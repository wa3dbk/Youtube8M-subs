to<00:00:53.480> build<00:00:54.260> an<00:00:54.440> electric<00:00:54.680> guitar<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.730> that's

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
to build an electric guitar and that's

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.479 
to build an electric guitar and that's
what<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:56.660> really<00:00:56.719> all<00:00:56.960> about<00:00:57.109> people<00:00:58.010> put<00:00:58.309> on

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
I'm not like somebody else I'm like me

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.460 
I'm not like somebody else I'm like me
it's<00:01:09.259> kind<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.619> like<00:01:09.710> a<00:01:09.800> new<00:01:10.520> attitude<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:11.539> it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
it's kind of like a new attitude and it

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.859 
it's kind of like a new attitude and it
plays<00:01:12.679> well<00:01:12.950> too<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:13.420> you<00:01:14.420> got<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.690> whole

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
plays well too so you got the whole

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.100 
plays well too so you got the whole
package<00:01:15.080> I<00:01:15.530> think<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:17.330> where<00:01:17.720> did<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:17.960> get

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
package I think and where did you get

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.029 
package I think and where did you get
the<00:01:18.289> idea<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:19.070> have<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.520> open<00:01:19.789> bodied<00:01:20.360> guitar

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
the idea to have this open bodied guitar

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.680 
the idea to have this open bodied guitar
well<00:01:22.039> as<00:01:22.250> originally<00:01:22.849> started<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.479> was

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
well as originally started I was

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.999 
well as originally started I was
thinking<00:01:24.229> about<00:01:24.500> isolating<00:01:25.459> the<00:01:26.060> neck<00:01:26.330> from

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
thinking about isolating the neck from

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.550 
thinking about isolating the neck from
from<00:01:28.009> my<00:01:28.160> body<00:01:28.369> because<00:01:28.910> sometimes<00:01:29.500> with<00:01:30.500> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
from my body because sometimes with the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.190 
from my body because sometimes with the
guitar<00:01:30.679> against<00:01:31.280> your<00:01:31.429> body<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:32.149> can<00:01:32.200> deaden

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
guitar against your body it can deaden

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.839 
guitar against your body it can deaden
the<00:01:33.229> sound<00:01:33.349> so<00:01:34.220> that<00:01:34.369> was<00:01:34.520> the<00:01:34.670> original

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
the sound so that was the original

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:37.479 
the sound so that was the original
concept<00:01:35.720> now<00:01:36.259> I'm<00:01:36.590> not<00:01:36.830> sure<00:01:37.039> that<00:01:37.069> it<00:01:37.310> really

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:37.489 
concept now I'm not sure that it really

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:42.490 
concept now I'm not sure that it really
does<00:01:37.789> it<00:01:38.410> like<00:01:39.410> that<00:01:39.709> though<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.209> real<00:01:41.500> tonal

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
does it like that though the real tonal

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.370 
does it like that though the real tonal
influences<00:01:43.399> by<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.610> neck<00:01:44.000> through<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:44.869> by

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
influences by the neck through and by

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.490 
influences by the neck through and by
the<00:01:45.440> quality<00:01:46.069> tonewoods<00:01:47.030> by<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.869> pickups

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
the quality tonewoods by the pickups

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.279 
the quality tonewoods by the pickups
lawler<00:01:48.860> pickups<00:01:49.989> single<00:01:50.989> coil<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:51.739> dual<00:01:52.429> coil

lawler pickups single coil and dual coil

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.690 
lawler pickups single coil and dual coil
configuration<00:01:54.289> all<00:01:54.739> those<00:01:55.099> things<00:01:55.429> really

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
configuration all those things really

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.660 
configuration all those things really
contribute<00:01:56.360> to<00:01:56.509> its<00:01:56.690> unique<00:01:57.170> tone<00:01:57.619> can<00:01:58.550> you

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
contribute to its unique tone can you

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.070 
contribute to its unique tone can you
tell<00:01:58.819> us<00:01:58.849> about<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.270> different<00:01:59.599> woods<00:01:59.810> that

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
tell us about the different woods that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.210 
tell us about the different woods that
you<00:02:00.200> work<00:02:00.349> with<00:02:00.670> ok<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.840> neck<00:02:03.110> obviously<00:02:04.039> it's

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
you work with ok the neck obviously it's

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.669 
you work with ok the neck obviously it's
a<00:02:04.340> neck<00:02:04.550> through<00:02:04.970> so<00:02:05.569> the<00:02:05.690> neck<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:05.929> all<00:02:06.110> maple

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
a neck through so the neck is all maple

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.650 
a neck through so the neck is all maple
one<00:02:07.160> piece<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.550> maple<00:02:07.700> all<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.179> way<00:02:08.300> through

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
one piece of maple all the way through

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.250 
one piece of maple all the way through
which<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.379> a<00:02:09.410> tremendous<00:02:10.039> tonal<00:02:10.459> advantage

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
which is a tremendous tonal advantage

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.600 
which is a tremendous tonal advantage
bass<00:02:12.260> players<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.950> known<00:02:13.129> this<00:02:13.310> for<00:02:13.550> years

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
bass players have known this for years

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.180

that with the neck through design you

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.460 
that with the neck through design you
get<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> maximum<00:02:16.879> sustained<00:02:17.569> and<00:02:17.900> resonance

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
get the maximum sustained and resonance

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.420 
get the maximum sustained and resonance
so<00:02:19.340> it's<00:02:19.610> maple<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.660> body<00:02:20.959> is<00:02:21.319> maple<00:02:21.800> which<00:02:22.250> is

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
so it's maple the body is maple which is

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.000 
so it's maple the body is maple which is
a<00:02:22.459> great<00:02:22.819> tone<00:02:23.180> wood<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.870> it's<00:02:24.440> trimmed<00:02:24.830> with
