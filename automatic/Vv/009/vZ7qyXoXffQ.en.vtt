remote-control cars that you charged up
via<00:00:38.040> batteries<00:00:38.699> and<00:00:39.350> you<00:00:40.350> could<00:00:40.620> let<00:00:41.280> them<00:00:41.430> go

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
via batteries and you could let them go

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.360 
via batteries and you could let them go
crazy<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:42.300> around<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.720> floor<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.350> about<00:00:43.650> 10

15<00:00:44.670> minutes<00:00:45.210> or<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.540> before<00:00:45.839> you<00:00:46.110> need<00:00:46.230> to

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
15 minutes or so before you need to

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.310

look inside this is an extremely old
packaging<00:01:45.330> so<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:46.110> not<00:01:46.260> aged<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.950> great<00:01:47.340> I

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
packaging so it's not aged that great I

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.140 
packaging so it's not aged that great I
can't<00:01:49.740> remember<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.100> used<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.370> go<00:01:50.580> there<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
can't remember what used to go there I

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.850 
can't remember what used to go there I
don't<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.900> if<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.290> think<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> used<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> be

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
don't know if it I think it used to be

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.530 
don't know if it I think it used to be
some<00:01:53.040> fold-out<00:01:53.430> instructions<00:01:54.150> but<00:01:54.330> they<00:01:54.450> were

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
some fold-out instructions but they were

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.390 
some fold-out instructions but they were
really<00:01:54.840> basic<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.470> literally<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:55.860> told<00:01:56.220> you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
really basic it literally just told you

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.649 
really basic it literally just told you
where<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> batteries<00:01:57.060> go<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.510> you're

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
where the batteries go and how you're

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.450 
where the batteries go and how you're
charged<00:01:58.880> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.150> remote<00:02:00.710> it's<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> basic

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
charged this is the remote it's a basic

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.990 
charged this is the remote it's a basic
remote<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.020> forwards<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.760> turn

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
remote to do forwards and that's to turn

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.550 
remote to do forwards and that's to turn
if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.330> never<00:02:06.540> reverse<00:02:06.930> give<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.380> these

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
if you never reverse give on these

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
if you never reverse give on these
things<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.280> okay<00:02:08.580> cuz<00:02:08.789> you'll<00:02:08.909> see<00:02:09.090> why

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
things but it's okay cuz you'll see why

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.210 
things but it's okay cuz you'll see why
this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.480> actual<00:02:12.900> charge<00:02:13.260> II<00:02:13.530> itself

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
this is the actual charge II itself

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.990 
this is the actual charge II itself
you<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:15.239> sonic<00:02:15.659> they're<00:02:15.870> driving<00:02:16.879> letting<00:02:17.879> us

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you got sonic they're driving letting us

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.720 
you got sonic they're driving letting us
know<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.209> he's<00:02:18.900> driving<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:19.980> I<00:02:20.489> don't<00:02:20.640> know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
know that he's driving and I don't know

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.339 
know that he's driving and I don't know
why<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.180> had<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.390> number<00:02:21.629> 2<00:02:21.900> on<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.260> I

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
why but it had the number 2 on it I

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.949 
why but it had the number 2 on it I
think<00:02:22.819> I'm<00:02:23.819> guessing<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.360> might<00:02:24.480> be<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> time

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
think I'm guessing it might be the time

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.260 
think I'm guessing it might be the time
with<00:02:25.140> Sonic<00:02:25.440> 2<00:02:25.709> maybe<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.610> don't<00:02:27.180> know<00:02:27.240> I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
with Sonic 2 maybe but I don't know I

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.970 
with Sonic 2 maybe but I don't know I

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
years now since I played it one of these

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:17.569 
years now since I played it one of these
so<00:04:05.850> I'm<00:04:05.940> really<00:04:06.150> out<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.390> practice<00:04:06.540> but<00:04:16.579> well

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
they're also amazingly durable I didn't

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:22.850 
they're also amazingly durable I didn't
own<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:21.720> one<00:04:21.900> when<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.049> was<00:04:22.140> growing<00:04:22.470> up<00:04:22.620> by<00:04:22.830> I

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
own this one when I was growing up by I

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.820 
own this one when I was growing up by I
owned<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.460> white<00:04:23.669> one<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.290> quite<00:04:25.290> often<00:04:25.500> when<00:04:25.770> I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
owned a white one and quite often when I

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.500 
owned a white one and quite often when I
was<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:26.010> kid<00:04:26.250> I'd<00:04:26.400> Drive<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:26.700> down<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.180> stairs

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
was a kid I'd Drive it down the stairs

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.490 
was a kid I'd Drive it down the stairs
and<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.020> aerial<00:04:29.000> never<00:04:30.000> once<00:04:30.300> broke<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.140> I

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
and the aerial never once broke and I

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
and the aerial never once broke and I
don't<00:04:31.560> know<00:04:31.800> why<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.160> they<00:04:32.250> would<00:04:32.370> always

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
don't know why but they would always

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.820 
don't know why but they would always
fall<00:04:33.000> like<00:04:33.450> this<00:04:33.720> like<00:04:34.140> bang<00:04:34.580> bang<00:04:35.720> bang<00:04:36.830> bang

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
fall like this like bang bang bang bang

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.080 
fall like this like bang bang bang bang
you<00:04:37.979> know<00:04:38.100> like<00:04:38.280> that<00:04:38.370> they<00:04:38.520> would<00:04:38.640> never<00:04:38.820> go

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
you know like that they would never go

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.900 
you know like that they would never go
that<00:04:39.900> way<00:04:40.110> for<00:04:40.350> some<00:04:40.530> reason<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.490> aerials

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
that way for some reason so the aerials

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.969 
that way for some reason so the aerials
will<00:04:42.090> never<00:04:42.270> would<00:04:43.050> never<00:04:43.260> damage<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.860> mean

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
will never would never damage I mean

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.550 
will never would never damage I mean
this<00:04:44.130> one's<00:04:44.450> it's<00:04:45.450> bent<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.050> the<00:04:46.140> reason<00:04:46.440> why

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
this one's it's bent but the reason why

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.230 
this one's it's bent but the reason why
it's<00:04:46.800> bent<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:47.160> because<00:04:47.430> of<00:04:47.520> how<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:47.700> store<00:04:48.090> it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
it's bent is because of how you store it
