00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.119
 Glitches players after bringing another 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.369

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.710
 players of everything I've brought that 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 today what the strikers teach 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.470
 that without further delay we will start 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.470
 sebastien haller plays in the utrecht in 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.969
 the league of the dutch league if it has 20 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.489
 I think it 's French 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.870
 there is French very similar to michael 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.120
 mann drone that is the man we have 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.520
 here that we will talk about him later 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.590
 you see very good speed very good 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.120
 acceleration a good jump good strength 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.469
 very good head accuracy is a 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.379
 very tall player as you have seen before 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.449
 it measures a meter 90 and they have good 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.910
 definition is a very forward 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.700
 recommended and that has a potential 89 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.530
 90 or so the next player is 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.909
 michael mann drone is the best that you 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.729
 I'm going to bring all the forwards is 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:17.290
 an authentic beast starts with 60 of 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:19.420
 average and its potential is 93 94 I what 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.179
 I have 93 in chelsea and still have 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.660
 28 years a beast 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:27.670
 seriously, it is very strong, it is very fast 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.470
 has a huge draft power 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 an incredible definition one meter 91 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.759
 top ming head has good jump 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:38.440
 good resistance is impressive is 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.470
 very complete is the most complete player 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.540
 that I have in the fifa and it is a beast 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.120
 the next player is samuel saiz 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.790
 he plays in the athletic one of madrid to the control 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.740
 that this has been to his books of 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.320
 sunderland if I have not done it john the 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.010

 very good agility very good balance 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.200
 is a technical striker has good 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.570
 dribble definition and power does not have 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.290
 a lot but over time he's fighting 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.140
 has a potential of 90 88 between 68 and 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.570
 90 is a beast 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.040
 the next player is playing Iago Aspas 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.160
 in Seville this has been for the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.990
 liverpool I think there is a player 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.709
 how good is 4 of watermarks he 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.860
 unique that I find noteworthy in this 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.940
 player is 26 years old and has a 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.950
 potential of 87 88 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.680
 the next player is nikita 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.020

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.580
 has a potential of 87 88 the next 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.200

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.070
 highest fifa measures one meter ninety 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.680
 and nine is from bosnia plays in elche is 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:03.310
 in a forward who is 24 years old 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.320
 only with about 26 27 will be a game 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.680
 already very good has very good strength 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:11.200

 has good good shooting power 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.710
 definition good head accuracy and 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.880
 is a striker who has a potential 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.100
 from 86-87 the next player carlos 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.480
 tevez to me if I 've done it and well 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.440
 I have 92 has a potential of 85 but 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.490
 when clichÃ© 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.960
 well it reaches 90 91 or even 92 is a 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.000
 authentic beast and how are you seeing 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.430

 juve is 30 years old 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.980
 it is already 85 on average but it does not usually go up 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.470
 nothing or no point but whatever 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.060

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.270

 the good shamrock rovers is a player 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.720
 terrific, very similar to one I'm going to 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.730

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.680
 very good accuracy of missing good shot 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.530
 the truth that very complete and has a 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.690
 potential of 90 the next player 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.440

 agility very good resistance 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.590
 force and then what is with him is his 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.520
 definition a lethal definition 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.240

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:35.060
 has a potential of 87 88 the next 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.750
 loved show with one plays in the toulouse 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.430
 is 22 years old and this is a player who 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.470
 does not stand out much in almost nothing, not like 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.570
 you are watching there is not at all fast 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.050
 it's not quite resistant they do not have 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.280
 a lot of force does not have much definition 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:55.760

 already a 85 86 and it usually goes up to 90 91 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.050
 even 92 the next rachida gave uy 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.050
