00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 you are great guys today we are with you 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.340
 We look deck master deshin basic 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.340
 alcohol used raider used everyone drove 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.890
 and so the guys in front of us are wonderful 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.850
 the deck is actually an analogue of the base collider 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.160
 normal running 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.190
 Well, a little with your chips let's 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.270
 let's see firstly the standard apiary 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.629
 replaced by 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.320
 rider back to master deshin well, but 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.140
 by the way rider back to written here 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.239
 place cards and slightly changed ace as well 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.780
 a bit altogether beyond recognition yes then 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.760
 it is unusual for us to see such here 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.860
 written the word master let's see 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.250
 what is written here for its plain 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:10.340
 what's a fairy tale 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:15.960
 Oh and oh some 45 2 212a and what is this here 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 mean on the other end is written in 500 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.390
 air flow finish meiling versions means it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 cover there and danvers and well here everything 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.550
 understandably 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 slightly different difference of basic of poker 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.190
 808 standard slogan and instead of transition 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.709
 written by jack of diamonds is if they 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:40.550
 mistaken jack tambourine and I'm not mistaken and 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:44.160
 so guys back shirt fell out 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.679
 made in the style of rider back well because 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.440
 what is written here rider back means not 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.240
 the essence on the seal is written for and from and the scene 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.420
 kaap company as always we opened 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.550
 here we get all sorts of badges and 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.830
 what can I say it in general 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.720
 actually the same basil deck 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.580
 raider bag with the exception of their chips and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 Now I will show you these chips 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:18.300
 then there are also 2 jokers ace 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.520
 here by the way and so firstly here are two 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.270
 absolutely identical joker no 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.459
 guarantees nothing is done to 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.440
 use a lot of tricks there 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.390
 for example in focus the joker and if you 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.310
 buy two identical decks 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:37.920
 that is not the point in general it is made for 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:40.830
 amenities and now ace ace peak is very 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.840
 performed beautifully similar to like two 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.300
 water drops 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.989
 Okay, not the essence but written for her 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.840
 and is playing from the computer no less son in 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.769
 general standard phrases we don't need us 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.530
 it's all the same 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.130
 so this is what the back shirt looks like 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:03.599
 Well, guys are used to this all that I can 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.120
 say about the deck itself the faces 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.880
 performed a little less than usual 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.150
 deck I noticed it but literally 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.250
 recently precisely Yandex and 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 the deck can somehow for children 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.250
 miniature well at first I did not understand what 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.510
 funny 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:25.640
 then there is a big problem with this deck 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.140
 she is very curved that is 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.609
 arch and and in the opposite direction it 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:37.590
 actually break their integrity cards 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:42.239
 Well, now I will do and see what 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.980
 it will be in principle the head was equal but 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.440
 I see you that there are uneven 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.350
 bulges all uneven like that now she 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:55.260
 somehow took the slips and if we return 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:04:01.889
 her in the same position here and so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.720
 poured that she perfectly there all slips 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.579
 and all that 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:09.359
 guys explain nothing more because 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.489
 but I have another blue one 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:13.440
 deck you need to do twice the same thing 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.260
 did you see the red assassin the rest 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.299
 also there will be a little blue in 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.150
 Generally not the essence of the guys forgot to say here 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.000
 still an illusionist 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.430
 such a standard tag as a tag 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.470
 say it but guys i think that's it 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.850
 thank you all sign up 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.570
 likes well, in general, as always you know 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.570
 until
