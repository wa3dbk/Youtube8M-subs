00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.879
 let's see three games that are 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.830
 weighing in the manager 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.349
 if you want to know them you already know what 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.559
 you have to make stay here in andro 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.559
 tube 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.580
 very good guys and welcome to this 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.020
 new video as discussed time 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.480
 let's see three games totally 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.730
 free of play store and hour to have the 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.930
 download link and good are three 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.210
 games that against the play store that 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.730
 they seem really good to me so 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.830
 let's start with the first one in first 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.960
 place we have to arm so much is possible 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.430
 that you know this game through the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.610
 others through the youtubers that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.559
 involved in this game that are vegeta 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.030
 willy stacks is worth as you see in a 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.800
 score four to five by five 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 stars and a million downloads and 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.540
 as I said is or is a game 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.190
 tempera species very similar to tempel 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.930
 run I think we can have the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.909
 possibility of playing with these youtubers 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 that I have commented good yes yes that for 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.080
 gais of the possibility of a character 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.299
 free and then if we want to play with 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.070
 the youtubers would have to pay us 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.380
 It seems that they are two euros or 1.89 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.770
 exactly then you are going to expect that 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.770
 load 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.490
 let's go here the three characters came out 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.220
 and we would have a total of cadres in the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.900
 it 's free if you 're here 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.250
 magician who base with this game it and 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.720
 well then if you go by then we have 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.330
 the different youtubers that I have 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.800
 commented everyone says a phrase now 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.800
 if he is made to know how to look 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.370
 and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.500
 As you can see there, each one says a phrase 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.240
 it seems that they have several us then if 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.800
 We give another pass because dir in others and 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.270
 let's give it to play with is told 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.310
 it would be really not having to go towards 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 the sides jump crouching 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.850
 coins there is going to have to come a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.850
 thematic of minecraft 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.940
 malasig to know that the environment is very 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.940
 Similary 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.019
 how are you looking here the easy to go 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.099
 dodging obstacles and jumping 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.099
 when they touch us 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.700
 like that and I would have punctured and we would have 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.500
 dead so good we go with the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.960
 next game the second game for 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.310
 save today is called his cars he does not have a 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.950
 very good score to the play store with 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.050
 this a 38 on 5 stars however 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.850
 it 's the game that I liked the most 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.160
 of this top it seems super 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.960
 addictive and I find it really good 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.070
 It is surely true that you will have the same 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.660
 you still do not have why people get mad 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.580
 because it can not overcome many 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650
 levels and reopen it worth more 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.600
 heard both hands good one just 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.400
 it depends on everyone but having to do 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.000
 two things at once and that's what 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.980
 complicates the game is worth here that not the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 operation of the game would be simple 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.070
 ok and here you have the red car nostri 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.110
 you can see well because we have all the 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.760
 game the red car can only move 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.250
 between this lane and this lane and the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.260
 blue car between this one and this one and we'll have 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.630
 dodge the squares and catch the 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.360
 circles seem simple but nothing that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.720
 you play then you will see that they start 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.310
 complicate the thing 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.900
 it's ability to collect all the 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.430
 circles because if we leave some 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.180
 circle bumped us to a square 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.819
 we would be out 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.890
 our 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.010
 as sahin opened the circle and there would be 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.859
 lost done 1.53 and my record would be 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 at 28 our very high score but 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.219
 well I invite you to us what 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.959
 download you try it 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.849
 games and below you put the comments 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.560
 what did you think about it and what score 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.719
 you have done to finalize this top 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.459
 we have monster dash surely sounds 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.260
 the jetpack game so good this 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.209
 game is developed by the same 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.680
 creators so let's do the 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.030
 classic and banal career that I have 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.859
 base then simple if you are of the 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.150
 that click is going to jump and here to 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.669
 shoot ok we have to go jumping 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.129
 the various obstacles and killing the 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:09.930
 bugs as you see the gun you only have 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:12.030
 scope is to say that we will have 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.260
 have to shoot the bug when we have to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.939
 that distance 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.010
 for example there would not give you will have to 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:20.640
 To be closer 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.640
 lifetime 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.730
 As you can see, I would have lost and when I got to 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.840
 50 coins that offer level up 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.060
 As you can see there would be a raised level 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.680
 and compact practitioner like many of 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.690
 the games do not end up winning me coins 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.420
 then the coins with rising level of 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:55.570
 get improvements improve the weapon more 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.010
 speed more life and so on so 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.480
 well I invite you to download these 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.180
 games and here under the comments no 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.680
 what do you think about this topic? 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.020
 you have come across each of the games and 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.280
 which has been your favorite as I have 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.290
 commented before the description below 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.630

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.680

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.970
 a few days ago a top of the top 10 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.460
 games that I think are going to be for 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.200
 2015 is worth very good games 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.030
 they are also from this theme they are so 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.000
 similar but leaving here is worth the 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.050
 10 best games for 2015 so 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.190
