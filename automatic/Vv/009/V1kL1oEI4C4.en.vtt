about<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.840> trumpet<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.649> handling<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:27.049> most

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
about a trumpet just by handling it most

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.740 
about a trumpet just by handling it most
importantly<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.740> trumpet<00:01:29.250> has<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> sound<00:01:30.450> good

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
importantly a trumpet has to sound good

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.170 
importantly a trumpet has to sound good
that<00:01:31.289> means<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:32.250> got<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.609> a<00:01:32.640> good<00:01:32.880> tone

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that means it's got to have a good tone

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.270 
that means it's got to have a good tone
it's<00:01:34.049> got<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.380> able<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> play<00:01:34.649> all<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.039> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
it's got to be able to play all of the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's got to be able to play all of the
notes<00:01:35.460> in<00:01:35.909> tune<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> nice<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> easily<00:01:38.420> that's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
notes in tune and nice and easily that's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
notes in tune and nice and easily that's
particularly<00:01:39.810> important<00:01:40.320> for<00:01:40.350> student

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
particularly important for student

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679 
particularly important for student
trumpet<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.880> Trump<00:01:42.149> it's<00:01:42.329> difficult

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
trumpet because Trump it's difficult

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.649 
trumpet because Trump it's difficult
enough<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.079> play<00:01:43.289> as<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.600> looking

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
enough to play as it is so we're looking

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.770 
enough to play as it is so we're looking
for<00:01:46.109> into<00:01:46.710> notes<00:01:47.100> not<00:01:48.000> only<00:01:48.299> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> easy

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
for into notes not only in the easy

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.779 
for into notes not only in the easy
middle<00:01:49.289> register<00:01:49.469> but<00:01:50.100> all<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> way<00:01:50.429> down<00:01:50.640> at

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
middle register but all the way down at

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:52.490 
middle register but all the way down at
the<00:01:50.820> bottom<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.020> way<00:01:52.109> up<00:01:52.229> at<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.409> top

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
the bottom and all the way up at the top

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.789 
the bottom and all the way up at the top
so<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.850> just<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.179> to<00:01:54.240> go<00:01:54.329> through<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.350> few

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
so I'm just going to go through a few

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.709 
so I'm just going to go through a few
pupil<00:01:56.280> calls<00:01:56.490> now<00:01:56.729> just<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.060> demonstrate<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
pupil calls now just to demonstrate that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:15.869 
pupil calls now just to demonstrate that
the<00:01:57.869> instrument<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.320> inching

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.670 

so<00:02:16.879> everything's<00:02:17.540> coming<00:02:17.900> out<00:02:18.019> going<00:02:18.440> all<00:02:18.620> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
so everything's coming out going all the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.380 
so everything's coming out going all the
way<00:02:18.769> down<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.099> bottom<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:19.879> going<00:02:20.120> all<00:02:20.239> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
way down the bottom it's going all the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.740 
way down the bottom it's going all the
way<00:02:20.480> at<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.629> top<00:02:20.870> nice<00:02:21.230> and<00:02:21.260> easily<00:02:22.690> it's<00:02:23.690> very

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
way at the top nice and easily it's very

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.589 
way at the top nice and easily it's very
difficult<00:02:24.110> to<00:02:24.410> play<00:02:24.769> an<00:02:25.069> instrument<00:02:25.599> gently

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
difficult to play an instrument gently

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.780 
difficult to play an instrument gently
it's<00:02:27.440> easier<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:27.860> play<00:02:28.010> an<00:02:28.069> instrument<00:02:28.459> hard

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
it's easier to play an instrument hard

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's easier to play an instrument hard
and<00:02:29.090> in<00:02:29.540> an<00:02:29.660> orchestral<00:02:30.260> setting<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.130> need

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
and in an orchestral setting you need

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.809 
and in an orchestral setting you need
the<00:02:31.400> instrument<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.970> behave<00:02:32.630> predictably<00:02:32.959> and

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
the instrument to behave predictably and

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.979 
the instrument to behave predictably and
sometimes<00:02:34.819> quite<00:02:35.030> gently<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:35.630> I'm<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.870> going

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
sometimes quite gently so I'm just going

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.809 
sometimes quite gently so I'm just going
