the<00:04:24.040> air<00:04:24.250> jordan<00:04:24.970> here<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:26.590> right<00:04:26.800> way<00:04:27.070> it

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
the air jordan here is the right way it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.010

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.530 
will be upside down on the 2015 version
so<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:33.280> is<00:04:33.520> one<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.300> differences

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
so that that is one of the differences

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.720 
so that that is one of the differences
another<00:04:35.410> one<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.710> difference<00:04:36.040> also<00:04:36.280> and

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
another one of the difference also and

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.120 
another one of the difference also and
i'm<00:04:37.030> pretty<00:04:37.210> sure<00:04:37.540> on<00:04:37.840> this<00:04:38.250> this<00:04:40.380> this<00:04:41.380> will

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
i'm pretty sure on this this this will

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.780 
i'm pretty sure on this this this will
probably<00:04:42.460> have<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:44.140> jordan<00:04:45.010> mm<00:04:45.340> on<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.610> lace

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
probably have the jordan mm on the lace

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.180 
probably have the jordan mm on the lace
lock<00:04:46.090> instead<00:04:46.480> of<00:04:46.600> saying<00:04:46.810> nike<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.980> is

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
lock instead of saying nike that is

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.240 
lock instead of saying nike that is
probably<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.900> only<00:04:50.350> differences<00:04:50.830> oh<00:04:51.010> and

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
probably the only differences oh and

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.430 
probably the only differences oh and
another<00:04:51.460> difference<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.060> this<00:04:52.660> bottom<00:04:53.260> it

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
another difference is this bottom it

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.520 
another difference is this bottom it
won't<00:04:53.680> be<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:53.950> gum<00:04:54.190> so<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.820> would<00:04:54.970> be<00:04:55.180> that<00:04:55.930> icy

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
won't be the gum so it would be that icy

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.830 
won't be the gum so it would be that icy
blue<00:04:56.860> soul<00:04:57.220> that<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.180> another<00:04:58.570> difference

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
blue soul that is another difference

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.200 
blue soul that is another difference
that<00:04:59.260> they<00:04:59.410> have<00:04:59.650> changed<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:00.820> you<00:05:00.910> have<00:05:01.120> the
