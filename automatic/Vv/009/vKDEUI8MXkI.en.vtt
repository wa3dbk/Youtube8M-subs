00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
the ball all the time which seems a bit

that five player multi-tap instead of
only<00:05:46.550> using<00:05:46.999> two<00:05:47.949> rotating<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.099> swapping<00:05:49.490> out

tired<00:05:49.909> player<00:05:50.210> seems<00:05:50.569> to<00:05:50.779> happen<00:05:50.960> a<00:05:51.199> bit<00:05:51.439> more

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889

than<00:05:52.159> it<00:05:52.279> needs<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.759> and<00:05:53.229> I<00:05:54.229> wish<00:05:54.559> you<00:05:54.740> could

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
than it needs to and I wish you could

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.950 
than it needs to and I wish you could
decrease<00:05:55.430> the<00:05:55.490> time<00:05:55.909> for<00:05:56.270> each<00:05:56.449> quarter

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
decrease the time for each quarter

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.389 
decrease the time for each quarter
because<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.349> 12<00:05:57.710> minutes<00:05:58.099> tends<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.879> drag

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:00.399 
because that 12 minutes tends to drag

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:03.579 
because that 12 minutes tends to drag
