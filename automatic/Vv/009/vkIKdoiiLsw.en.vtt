00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.510
 lights on our youtube channel aside 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.610
 of technician in this guide I show you 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 what could be one of the reasons for 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.570
 which our storage disk o 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.210
 the storage top does not come 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.119
 seen from windows a very reason 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.890
 frequent so it is not seen because 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.220
 if it can be some way it is the label 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.679
 of our hard disk or drive 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.779
 storage and therefore windows not the 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.140
 can see what the label is the label 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.320
 simply and what is assigned 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.090
 to each unit such as disk 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 local labels the discolo channel in 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.440
 this case is my system and c 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 as in most part resisted 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.910
 will be modified 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.110
 the disc of the games direction and of me 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.200
 I also had another partition with 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.170
 another label that however deliberately 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.860
 fight to show you the first service 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.729
 because a dos does not display it then 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.229
 what we have to do in this case is a lot 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.990
 useful to know this because of the times 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 maybe you immediately go to format the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.869
 partition or to delete the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.609
 prediction create another and then with 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 the consequence of data parties or 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.049
 at least the operation is useless 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.509
 really simple just take one 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.179
 management of a software for the management of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.369
 partitions and we use a party 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.280
 assist in the standard edition they are 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.170
 software is free and complete and how 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.829
 you can see news the archive lists 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.560
 films then the films archive is there 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.560
 there is a file archive partition 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.389
 working then what we need to do 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.060
 indeed it will give it shape just click 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:50.280
 with the power now to select it 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.369
 advanced and select change the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.689
 shade as you can see the unit at 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.209
 moment now no letter 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.209
 here they do not assign him an ego nor 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:04.139
 janas assign you the unit h that the cocan 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:06.200
 I click apply proceed safely you 

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:08.239
 with sea yes 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.690
 ok the game is done and as you can see 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.330
 windows has detected the drive for me 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.860
 storage that I didn't see until why 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.200
 films 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.260
 this procedure neither involves nor fails 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.140
 it involves no data loss but rather 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.849
 we will need it then everyone can do it 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.849
 It stood to see our unity 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.330
