00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
and so I can't took it upon myself after

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
to see if I could create a much bigger

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
experience out of director and instead

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.310 
experience out of director and instead
of<00:00:16.680> treating<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.279> as<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.539> plug-in<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.779> simply

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
of treating it as a plug-in that simply

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
futuristic metallic look I kind of

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.830 
futuristic metallic look I kind of
wanted<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:12.730> fun<00:02:13.830> more<00:02:14.830> than<00:02:14.920> anything

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
wanted it to be fun more than anything

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.960 
wanted it to be fun more than anything
so<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> wanted<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:18.040> with<00:02:18.459> noodle<00:02:18.819> box

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
so what I wanted to do with noodle box

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.740 
so what I wanted to do with noodle box
was<00:02:19.390> packaged<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.110> into<00:02:20.970> an<00:02:21.970> experience

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
was packaged it into an experience

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.100 
was packaged it into an experience
rather<00:02:23.170> than<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:24.040> plain<00:02:24.550> menu<00:02:25.209> based<00:02:25.420> website

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
rather than a plain menu based website

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.870 
rather than a plain menu based website
where<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.620> know<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:26.950> have<00:02:27.190> sections<00:02:27.670> and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
where you know you have sections and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.270 
where you know you have sections and
things<00:02:28.060> like<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.269> so<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:29.440> kind<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.040> took<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
things like that so I kind of took the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.670 
things like that so I kind of took the
metaphor<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:32.069> Lego<00:02:33.069> or<00:02:33.700> tweet

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
metaphor of the the Lego or tweet

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.170 
metaphor of the the Lego or tweet
building<00:02:35.680> blocks<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.310> I'm<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> first

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
building blocks and I'm so the first

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.150 
building blocks and I'm so the first
thing<00:02:37.269> that<00:02:37.390> I<00:02:37.690> thought<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.140> was<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.350> make<00:02:38.500> main

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
thing that I thought it was to make main

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.300 
thing that I thought it was to make main
menu<00:02:39.580> actually<00:02:40.450> made<00:02:40.660> out<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.110> these<00:02:41.980> blocks

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
menu actually made out of these blocks

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.040 
menu actually made out of these blocks
which<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.880> user<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.180> actually<00:02:43.600> move<00:02:43.750> around

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
which the user can actually move around

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.259 
which the user can actually move around
so<00:02:44.440> they<00:02:44.560> quite<00:02:44.830> literally<00:02:45.250> can<00:02:45.910> make<00:02:46.090> this

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
so they quite literally can make this

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.360 
so they quite literally can make this
space<00:02:46.569> their<00:02:46.900> own<00:02:47.049> living<00:02:47.560> room<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.100> arrange

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
space their own living room and arrange

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.940 
space their own living room and arrange
things<00:02:48.610> as<00:02:48.970> they<00:02:49.390> want<00:02:49.630> and<00:02:49.900> then<00:02:50.620> each<00:02:50.769> of

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
things as they want and then each of

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.140 
things as they want and then each of
these<00:02:51.040> blocks<00:02:51.370> has<00:02:51.819> a<00:02:51.850> small<00:02:52.750> subsection

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
these blocks has a small subsection

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.630 
these blocks has a small subsection
which<00:02:55.150> which<00:02:55.560> either<00:02:56.560> kind<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.370> shows

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
which which either kind of shows

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.930 
which which either kind of shows
something<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:59.760> was<00:03:00.760> was<00:03:00.970> kind<00:03:01.570> of<00:03:01.600> a<00:03:02.140> test<00:03:02.940> an

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
something that was was kind of a test an

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.729 
something that was was kind of a test an
experiment<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:04.690> show<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:05.170> something<00:03:05.590> was

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
experiment to show that something was

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.890 
experiment to show that something was
possible<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.640> some<00:03:07.180> of<00:03:07.329> them<00:03:07.450> have<00:03:07.630> very

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
possible so some of them have very

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.770 
possible so some of them have very
simple<00:03:08.350> 3d<00:03:08.650> experiences<00:03:09.489> in<00:03:09.670> them<00:03:09.850> other<00:03:10.299> ones

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
simple 3d experiences in them other ones

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.810 
simple 3d experiences in them other ones
are<00:03:11.140> actually<00:03:11.290> meant<00:03:11.739> as<00:03:11.950> games<00:03:12.220> some<00:03:12.609> of<00:03:12.700> them

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
are actually meant as games some of them

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.780 
are actually meant as games some of them
are<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.450> completely<00:03:13.750> pointless<00:03:14.609> bits<00:03:15.609> of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
are just completely pointless bits of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.190 
are just completely pointless bits of
fun<00:03:16.060> like<00:03:16.450> as<00:03:16.570> a<00:03:16.890> peasant<00:03:17.890> memory<00:03:18.760> game<00:03:19.200> in

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
fun like as a peasant memory game in

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.650 
fun like as a peasant memory game in
there<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.310> idea<00:03:21.609> was<00:03:21.640> is<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> wanted

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
there and the idea was is I wanted

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.349 
there and the idea was is I wanted
people<00:03:22.959> to<00:03:22.989> really<00:03:23.920> feel<00:03:24.310> at<00:03:24.459> home<00:03:24.489> in<00:03:25.060> the

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
people to really feel at home in the

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.470 
people to really feel at home in the
space<00:03:26.130> like<00:03:27.130> they're<00:03:27.370> immersed<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.180> like

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
space like they're immersed in it like

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.830 
space like they're immersed in it like
you<00:03:28.780> might<00:03:28.989> find<00:03:29.769> playing<00:03:30.220> zelda<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.420> honor

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
you might find playing zelda on honor

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.130 
you might find playing zelda on honor
and<00:03:32.079> intel<00:03:32.769> ok
