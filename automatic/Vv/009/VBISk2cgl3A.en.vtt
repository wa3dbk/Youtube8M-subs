00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.470 

okay<00:00:00.690> now<00:00:01.290> we<00:00:01.350> have<00:00:01.650> two<00:00:01.949> hands<00:00:02.220> that<00:00:02.429> we<00:00:03.300> can

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
okay now we have two hands that we can

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay now we have two hands that we can
see<00:00:03.750> that<00:00:03.990> one<00:00:04.799> it's<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.279> little<00:00:05.400> bit<00:00:05.640> thicker

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
see that one it's a little bit thicker

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.880 
see that one it's a little bit thicker
than<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> other<00:00:06.330> one<00:00:06.569> we<00:00:06.810> have<00:00:07.230> to<00:00:07.500> reshape

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
than the other one we have to reshape

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.940 
than the other one we have to reshape
this<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:09.059> know<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.929> part<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> hand<00:00:10.740> it's

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
this you know this part of the hand it's

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.610 
this you know this part of the hand it's
thicker<00:00:11.519> than<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.840> means<00:00:13.170> we<00:00:13.590> are

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
thicker than this one it means we are

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.230 
thicker than this one it means we are
going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:14.070> reshape<00:00:15.740> with<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.490> all<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
going to reshape with like that all the

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.230 
going to reshape with like that all the
fingers<00:00:19.369> and<00:00:20.570> these<00:00:21.570> are<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.050> little<00:00:22.260> bit<00:00:23.240> but

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
fingers and these are so little bit but

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.109 
fingers and these are so little bit but
not<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.630> much<00:00:25.160> and<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.430> are<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> do

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
not that much and we are going to do

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.850 
not that much and we are going to do
like<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:31.219> and<00:00:32.219> then<00:00:32.780> now<00:00:34.399> we<00:00:35.399> need<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.880> start

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
like this and then now we need to start

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.660 
like this and then now we need to start
reshaping

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.920 

in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.300> hands<00:00:45.540> form<00:00:45.870> sample<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.930> now

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
in the hands form sample this to be now

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.530 
in the hands form sample this to be now
you<00:00:48.989> have<00:00:49.290> to<00:00:49.470> round<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:50.610> edges<00:00:53.059> round<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
you have to round the edges round the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.820 
you have to round the edges round the
edges<00:00:57.620> round<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.920> edges<00:01:00.290> you<00:01:01.290> know<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.500> make

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
edges round the edges you know to make

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:10.999 
edges round the edges you know to make
it<00:01:01.890> like<00:01:02.720> look<00:01:03.720> like<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.199> half

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.969 

now<00:01:12.009> we<00:01:12.640> need<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.979> make<00:01:15.189> the<00:01:15.549> forms<00:01:16.479> of<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
now we need to make the forms of the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:31.830 
now we need to make the forms of the
bonds<00:01:18.539> we<00:01:19.539> have<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:20.590> there<00:01:21.000> given<00:01:22.000> extra<00:01:22.770> clay

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:44.230 

then<00:01:32.840> we<00:01:33.380> just<00:01:33.620> there

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.730 

as<00:01:44.750> when<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.140> started<00:01:45.530> to<00:01:46.310> theme<00:01:47.860> in<00:01:48.860> here<00:01:50.740> just

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
as when it started to theme in here just

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.620 
as when it started to theme in here just
try<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.220> share<00:01:52.990> which<00:01:53.990> shape<00:01:55.210> we<00:01:56.210> want<00:01:56.360> like

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
try to share which shape we want like

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:05.230 
try to share which shape we want like
feminine<00:01:57.259> hands<00:01:57.619> have<00:01:58.460> to<00:01:58.960> think<00:02:01.090> along<00:02:02.090> it

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.210 

the<00:02:05.780> fingers

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
the fingers

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.559 
the fingers
when<00:02:08.760> we<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.119> this

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.780 

we<00:02:14.079> can<00:02:14.370> shape

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:30.420 

with<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.450> spoon

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.550 

then<00:02:31.590> we<00:02:32.590> have<00:02:32.739> been<00:02:32.890> here<00:02:33.299> and<00:02:34.299> we<00:02:34.329> tried<00:02:35.170> to

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
then we have been here and we tried to

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.229 
then we have been here and we tried to
ban<00:02:35.769> and<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.870> some<00:02:38.170> kind<00:02:38.409> of<00:02:38.530> shape<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.670> that

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
ban and in some kind of shape that that

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:50.430 
ban and in some kind of shape that that
we<00:02:40.450> want

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.840 

then<00:02:51.010> this<00:02:51.250> Han<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.180> be<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:54.550> to

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
then this Han is going to be that's to

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.600 
then this Han is going to be that's to
the<00:02:55.000> other<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.360> then<00:02:55.840> let's<00:02:56.470> work<00:02:56.800> with<00:02:57.340> other

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
the other one then let's work with other

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.850 
the other one then let's work with other
one
