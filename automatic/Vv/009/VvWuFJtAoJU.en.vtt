00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello dear friends in this video 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.559
 the lessons I want to show by example 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:14.559
 100 percent similarity can be achieved 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.079
 Your works 

00:00:17.079 --> 00:00:18.269
 kings dynamo 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:20.399
 namely for drawing portrait 100 

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:21.740
 percent similarity 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.340
 when viewing my work here I am now 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.519
 near Cairo 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.989
 painting the side of the nuggets 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.970
 if we look 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.580
 on the original 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 what it is like of course but not all and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.680
 here we look 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.940
 some details are different 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.140
 at the same time that is 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 in these two papers 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.130
 and here in may oil 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.300
 What is missing is some kind of small 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 details 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.760
 and to be one hundred percent 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.610
 speed 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:07.970
 i am now 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 I'll show you how to do it on the computer 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.670
 basically 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 when we draw a portrait 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 the main task 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.770
 he was like 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.700
 but the person we are painting 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.280
 and to achieve 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.650
 this result 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 namely, 100 percent speed 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:30.240
 we can take advantage 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.149
 one very good tool exactly 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:34.810
 by computer 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.230
 but or laptop 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.410
 there is enough camera for that 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.480
 take your job from this graph 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.140
 at a certain stage let's say u now i 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.380
 set up a camera 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.330
 and so I photographed 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.400
 then transferred to electronic format wav 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.810
 photos in the movies on computers and edgebands 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 how difficult but with the influx 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.710
 so dear friends photos with 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.670
 camera 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.610
 on the laptop, we have successfully thrown off 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.460
 no matter where you dump on what 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.200
 worked whose either on landline 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.580
 computer on usually home ice 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.049
 laptops 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:11.599
 generally look at the received 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.219
 Images 

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.659
 so open allo 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.659
 clicking browse 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.689
 it turned out such an image 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.689
 compare with the original 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.980
 you see 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.670
 portraits are clearly different 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.830
 a little advice 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.930
 to analyze portraits you need both 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.209
 images to throw 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.040
 for 1 that is for one reason a folder to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.649
 there were difficult images 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:42.129
 original photo of someone we will we 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.369
 we will draw and our second job 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.579
 at this or that stage so let's get started 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.489
 in order to conduct an analysis 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.549
 we need to crop this photo 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.449
 in order to face area 

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:57.389
 matched 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.929
 if so here shake forward backward 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.250
 that location 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.869
 clearly different 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.279
 so start editing 

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:07.979
 open our images in 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.299
 program on the internet which 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.299
 you can download the Internet 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.789
 which is free of charge 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:20.739
 take the rectangular selection 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.550
 areas 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.720
 and let's start highlights 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.720
 all that is superfluous and we do not need him to take 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.429
 and all you need to leave in this frame 

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:32.239
 the image is highlighted now you need to click 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.880
 on the keys from kontrol a little cates 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.299
 that is, we know everything 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.199
 the fact that 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:38.949
 outside the box 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.799
 and we get this image 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.849
 now save it 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.849
 click close will continue 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:57.309
 now compare 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:59.479
 come back 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.799
 it has already become better 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:02.939
 that is if the area of ​​the face is almost 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:05.939
 match up 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.319
 so that both faces match exactly on 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.419
 one hundred percent 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.199
 you again when aiming for a company with 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.420
 experienced program 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.809
 as a result of a driver infection 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.649
 individuals must be on one and 

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.159
 same place 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.159
 it turned out like this 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:26.969
 then back forward 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.479
 approximately 95 percent coincided 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:31.820
 but that's okay 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.220
 and with this material 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.530
 in principle, you can work 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.720
 You can of course edit a little 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.930
 To save time, we will do this 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.969
 result 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.469
 and now compare 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:43.339
 and to see the errors 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.130
 portrait 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.870
 begin to quickly twist 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.900
 back forward back forward forward 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.330
 and we can see 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.699
 the fact that 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:54.009
 from this country 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:56.139
 cabbage kaunas bulges out 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.680
 a little more than you need 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.610
 By the way, yes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.729
 You can network for yourself a notebook with a pen 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:03.900
 on the shelves to paint everything you need 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.360
 fix there 1 2 3 4 5 6 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.680
 and so on how much would you have cost 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.879
 want to fix 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.870
 write as much 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.819
 how many errors and you 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:17.009
 until found 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:18.740
 and that will correct 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.860
 let's say the first 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.169
 reduced 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.069
 sliver 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:25.699
 the second 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:28.360
 in the nose 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.819
 need to add some white 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.429
 and move the nose a little 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:37.429
 to the right closer to the eye 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.999
 the third 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:45.109
 this eye is a little flat 

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.980
 turned out 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.980
 he needs to be judged and pulled out a little 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.289
 in the eyebrow area 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:56.469
 the fourth will need 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.139
 slightly reduce 

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.789
 eye shadow 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.789
 the transition is too abrupt 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.219
 sixth 

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.009
 need to work well with hair 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.110
 so they look looked at us 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.889
 straight and long 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.469
 once our work is not yet 

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:15.729
 seems short 

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:16.659
 seventh 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:18.960
 remove the redness of poland 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.770
 eighth add blue 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.749
 under lips 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:24.430
 in this region 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.880
 ninth add 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:27.699
 more white 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:28.610
 announcement 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.610
 and here in these areas 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.789
 and on the tenth 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.930
 also add white 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.479
 slightly higher level 

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.360
 make a smooth transition 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.319
 and here kolpakova bank 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.509
 all 10 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.409
 difference principle we found which will 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:47.360
 correct 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.199
 on a piece of paper all these items we wrote down 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:51.770
 now there is only a draw 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:53.449
 all our and folders 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:55.979
 and turn on the audio with the music that you 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:56.789
 like 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.960
 and listen to nice music 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.469
 leaf removed 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:03.419
 with points of error to approach 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:05.930
 your work and start fixing them 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.310
 and such a correction of errors you can 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.660
 hold periodically then 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.589
 when it sees fit 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:14.579
 until you reach that result 

00:07:14.579 --> 00:07:16.039
 who want to 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:17.689
 and later will show what happened 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.409
 opinion 

00:07:20.409 --> 00:07:21.440
 as a result 

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.930
 I got this job 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.830
 not five plus of course 

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:27.400
 many small mistakes 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.530
 but it’s still my first 

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:32.379
 portrait 

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:34.699
 very much to learn 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:35.639
 Well, let 

00:07:35.639 --> 00:07:37.779
 we will learn 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:39.259
 I hope information 

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.129
 how to achieve portrait pressing speed 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.830
 one hundred percent 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.050
 helpful to you 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.679
 not to miss in drawing class 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:49.490
 subscribe the channel itself 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.770
 see you next five lessons
