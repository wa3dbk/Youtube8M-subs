anything<00:01:12.740> on<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.100> other<00:01:13.130> side<00:01:13.550> or<00:01:13.729> something

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.560 

so<00:01:17.450> dive<00:01:17.660> missile<00:01:18.200> dive<00:01:18.860> missile<00:01:19.310> like<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.210> in

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
enemies this is really really good

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.670 
enemies this is really really good

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
don't know if anyone is weak against it

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.900 
don't know if anyone is weak against it
because<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.679> tend<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.010> not<00:02:10.130> use<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:10.369> too<00:02:10.670> much

have that one from the start
wire<00:02:19.100> is<00:02:19.370> too<00:02:19.610> good<00:02:19.790> it's<00:02:20.030> easily<00:02:20.360> is<00:02:20.450> capable

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
wire is too good it's easily is capable

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.740 
wire is too good it's easily is capable
which<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.310> fortunate<00:02:22.610> because<00:02:23.090> it<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.540> rather

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
which is fortunate because it is rather

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.880 
which is fortunate because it is rather
heated

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.890 

compared<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.160> other<00:02:30.459> special<00:02:31.300> gadget<00:02:31.690> in

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
compared to the other special gadget in

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.429 
compared to the other special gadget in
this<00:02:32.110> game<00:02:33.010> at

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.350 

so<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.890> moving<00:02:38.250> platform<00:02:38.730> segment<00:02:39.150> air

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
so the moving platform segment air

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.170 
so the moving platform segment air
repeats<00:02:39.720> itself<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.500> actually<00:02:41.459> like<00:02:41.909> those

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
repeats itself I actually like those

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.850 
repeats itself I actually like those
ones<00:02:42.420> because<00:02:42.900> there<00:02:43.140> are<00:02:43.290> fairly<00:02:43.530> simple

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
ones because there are fairly simple

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.910 
ones because there are fairly simple
platforming<00:02:44.959> experiences<00:02:45.959> something<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.769> bit

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
platforming experiences something a bit

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.429 
platforming experiences something a bit
out<00:02:47.069> of<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.280> ordinary<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.989> not<00:02:49.200> too

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
out of the ordinary and it's not too

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.199 
out of the ordinary and it's not too
hard<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.129> doesn't<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.489> frustrating

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
hard so it doesn't get frustrating

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.369 
hard so it doesn't get frustrating
because<00:02:51.329> of<00:02:51.629> spikes<00:02:51.930> everywhere<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
because of spikes everywhere and the

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.690 
because of spikes everywhere and the
that<00:02:55.620> early<00:02:55.860> stage<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.430> done

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.449 

so<00:03:02.700> boss<00:03:02.939> time<00:03:03.349> feral<00:03:04.349> man<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.709> not<00:03:04.920> too<00:03:05.159> hard

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
so boss time feral man is not too hard

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.089 
so boss time feral man is not too hard
of<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.670> boss<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.480> depends<00:03:06.930> entirely<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.590> if

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
of a boss that it depends entirely on if

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.699 
of a boss that it depends entirely on if
he<00:03:08.250> feels<00:03:08.519> like<00:03:08.840> what<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.959> always<00:03:10.110> will<00:03:10.470> do<00:03:10.590> at

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
he feels like what you always will do at

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.380 
he feels like what you always will do at
the<00:03:10.860> start<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.280> jump<00:03:11.579> with<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.790> firing<00:03:12.269> off

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the start is jump with you firing off

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.679 
the start is jump with you firing off
his<00:03:12.569> Farrow<00:03:12.810> shots<00:03:13.879> after<00:03:14.879> that<00:03:15.060> it's<00:03:15.329> more<00:03:15.599> or

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
his Farrow shots after that it's more or

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.140 
his Farrow shots after that it's more or
less<00:03:15.720> random<00:03:18.140> jumping<00:03:19.140> around<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:20.150> quick

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
less random jumping around like quick

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.080 
less random jumping around like quick
men<00:03:21.359> of<00:03:21.450> old<00:03:21.659> fame<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.709> one<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.159> his<00:03:23.340> favorite

no questions asked but I feel we've

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.350 
no questions asked but I feel we've
forgotten<00:04:28.130> something<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.820> I'm<00:04:28.970> going<00:04:29.240> to

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.240 
forgotten something so I'm going to
double<00:04:29.780> check<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.770> bit<00:04:32.920> enter<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.040> first

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
double check just a bit enter the first

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.980 
double check just a bit enter the first
check<00:04:34.490> section<00:04:34.820> again<00:04:35.210> because<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.660> is<00:04:35.780> quick

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
check section again because it is quick

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.920 
check section again because it is quick
it's<00:04:36.890> more<00:04:37.070> success<00:04:37.430> now<00:04:37.900> demonstrate<00:04:38.900> how
