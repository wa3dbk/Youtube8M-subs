the area that i would like to move and
normally<00:04:14.560> this<00:04:14.650> would<00:04:14.829> just<00:04:14.949> be<00:04:15.040> done<00:04:15.250> by<00:04:15.370> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
normally this would just be done by the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.610 
normally this would just be done by the
GM<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.819> this<00:04:16.209> case<00:04:16.479> players<00:04:16.959> are<00:04:17.259> currently

allowed to move themselves but that will

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:21.449 
allowed to move themselves but that will
most<00:04:19.959> likely<00:04:20.199> change<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.739> future<00:04:20.859> or<00:04:21.279> at
