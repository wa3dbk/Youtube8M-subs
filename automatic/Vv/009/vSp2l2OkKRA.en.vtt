00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
fun so I thought right once something

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 
fun so I thought right once something
that<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.409> take<00:01:55.560> off<00:01:55.740> roads<00:01:56.040> going<00:01:56.399> off<00:01:56.549> road

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
that can take off roads going off road

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.190 
that can take off roads going off road
day<00:01:57.090> something<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> doesn't<00:01:57.780> matter<00:01:57.899> forget

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
day something that doesn't matter forget

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
it batted around that sort of thing

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.999 
it batted around that sort of thing
actually<00:02:00.329> quite<00:02:00.689> good<00:02:00.810> value<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.409> understand
