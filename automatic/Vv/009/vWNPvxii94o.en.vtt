00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.820 

one<00:00:15.570> of<00:00:15.629> the<00:00:15.719> other<00:00:15.840> things<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.170> over<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
one of the other things that over the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.130 
one of the other things that over the
years<00:00:17.510> we've<00:00:18.510> discovered<00:00:20.390> we<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.689> an<00:00:22.020> event

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
years we've discovered we had an event

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.290 
years we've discovered we had an event
we<00:00:22.439> talked<00:00:22.680> about<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.669> talked<00:00:23.880> about<00:00:24.119> working

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
we talked about we talked about working

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.700 
we talked about we talked about working
in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> direct<00:00:24.900> field<00:00:25.169> and<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.590> good

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
in the direct field and it's a good

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.350 
in the direct field and it's a good
story<00:00:26.009> if<00:00:26.279> most<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.759> energy<00:00:27.090> comes<00:00:27.300> from

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
story if most of the energy comes from

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.970 
story if most of the energy comes from
the<00:00:27.480> direct<00:00:27.869> field<00:00:28.079> that<00:00:28.259> you<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.590> able<00:00:28.950> to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the direct field that you are able to

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.089 
the direct field that you are able to
minimize<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.610> effects<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.360> the<00:00:30.660> room<00:00:30.899> on<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
minimize the effects of the room on the

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
minimize the effects of the room on the
listening<00:00:32.430> position<00:00:32.880> well<00:00:33.270> that's<00:00:33.719> true

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
listening position well that's true

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
listening position well that's true
but<00:00:34.770> there<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.010> other<00:00:35.160> things<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.430> are

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
but there are other things that are

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
but there are other things that are
going<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.270> listening<00:00:36.570> position<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
going on in that listening position and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.560 
going on in that listening position and
even<00:00:38.160> though<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.309> minimize<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.210> effects<00:00:39.480> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
even though you minimize the effects of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150 
even though you minimize the effects of
the<00:00:39.660> room<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:39.989> aren't<00:00:40.230> eliminating<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the room you aren't eliminating the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.979 
the room you aren't eliminating the
effects<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.550> room<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.940> because<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.960> have

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
effects of the room so because we have

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
effects of the room so because we have
some<00:00:43.200> serious<00:00:43.500> DSP<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.640> dedicated<00:00:45.030> CPU<00:00:45.539> all

some serious DSP and a dedicated CPU all
right<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.379> able<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> take<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.010> microphones

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

put<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.180> microphone<00:00:48.480> where<00:00:48.780> an<00:00:48.870> engineer

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
put the microphone where an engineer

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.900 
put the microphone where an engineer
would<00:00:49.470> sit<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:51.230> analyze<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.430> place<00:00:53.430> where

the<00:02:39.880> milestone<00:02:40.480> where<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.720> knew<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.560> really<00:02:41.590> had

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
the milestone where I knew we really had

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.880 
the milestone where I knew we really had
something<00:02:42.760> because<00:02:43.210> in<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.870> past<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.620> way<00:02:44.770> it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
something because in the past the way it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.620 
something because in the past the way it
was<00:02:45.040> done<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.570> way<00:02:46.780> it<00:02:46.900> was<00:02:47.020> done

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
was done and this is the way it was done

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.210 
was done and this is the way it was done
Walter<00:02:49.630> would<00:02:49.780> make<00:02:50.050> a<00:02:50.080> great<00:02:50.290> transducer<00:02:51.070> and

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
Walter would make a great transducer and

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:52.320 
Walter would make a great transducer and
he<00:02:51.280> would<00:02:51.400> measure<00:02:51.610> it<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.210> be

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
he would measure it and it would be

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.290 
he would measure it and it would be
great<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:54.100> he'd<00:02:54.280> built<00:02:54.490> a<00:02:54.610> box<00:02:54.850> and

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
great and and then he'd built a box and

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.060 
great and and then he'd built a box and
and<00:02:55.480> there'd<00:02:55.780> be<00:02:55.870> an<00:02:55.960> amplifier<00:02:56.530> or<00:02:56.770> not<00:02:56.890> and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
and there'd be an amplifier or not and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.440 
and there'd be an amplifier or not and
he<00:02:57.130> put<00:02:57.310> together<00:02:57.370> crossover<00:02:58.090> and<00:02:58.270> then

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
he put together crossover and then

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.250 
he put together crossover and then
there's<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.080> huge<00:02:59.530> baffle<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:01.930> middle<00:03:02.170> of

this baffle is a huge cutout to the size
of<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.390> speaker<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.200> Walter<00:03:05.830> would<00:03:05.980> put<00:03:06.160> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
of a speaker and Walter would put the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.250 
of a speaker and Walter would put the
speaker<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.820> there<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.180> then<00:03:07.270> he'd<00:03:07.420> take<00:03:07.450> he'd

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
speaker in there and then he'd take he'd

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.590 
speaker in there and then he'd take he'd
take<00:03:08.470> a<00:03:08.500> single<00:03:09.220> microphone<00:03:09.640> for<00:03:09.910> the<00:03:09.970> 26<00:03:10.420> feet

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
take a single microphone for the 26 feet

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.150 
take a single microphone for the 26 feet
behind<00:03:10.900> in<00:03:11.350> front<00:03:11.590> of<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.709> microphone

behind in front of the microphone

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.610 
behind in front of the microphone
blasted<00:03:12.820> Shh<00:03:13.209> he'd<00:03:13.720> looked<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.020> response<00:03:14.410> and

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
blasted Shh he'd looked the response and

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.420 
blasted Shh he'd looked the response and
go<00:03:15.090> gee<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:16.120> think<00:03:16.510> I<00:03:16.570> got<00:03:16.720> to<00:03:16.810> change<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
go gee I think I got to change that the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.830 
go gee I think I got to change that the
thickness<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.850> that<00:03:18.970> woofer<00:03:19.300> he<00:03:19.450> called<00:03:19.720> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
thickness of that woofer he called the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.870 
thickness of that woofer he called the
sample<00:03:20.230> plays<00:03:20.410> I<00:03:20.530> need<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.709> new<00:03:20.890> sample<00:03:21.190> it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
sample plays I need a new sample it

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.560 
sample plays I need a new sample it
needs<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.180> be<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:23.070> little<00:03:24.070> thinner<00:03:24.570> material

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
needs to be a little thinner material

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.600 
needs to be a little thinner material
and<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.990> six<00:03:26.350> weeks<00:03:26.560> later<00:03:26.770> a<00:03:26.860> couple<00:03:27.310> weeks

Reese weep and go uh the surrounds wrong
he'd<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:36.370> through<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.670> process<00:03:37.180> and<00:03:37.390> after<00:03:38.019> a

he'd go through the process and after a
series<00:03:38.739> of<00:03:39.040> compromises<00:03:39.430> every<00:03:39.850> time<00:03:40.000> he'd

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
series of compromises every time he'd

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.790 
series of compromises every time he'd
fix<00:03:40.420> one<00:03:40.780> thing<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.200> was<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.380> problem

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
fix one thing that was a problem

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.800 
fix one thing that was a problem
something<00:03:42.040> else<00:03:42.370> would<00:03:42.610> pop<00:03:42.850> out<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.390> he

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
something else would pop out and he

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.780 
something else would pop out and he
fixed<00:03:44.200> that<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:44.890> then<00:03:45.010> he<00:03:45.130> deal<00:03:45.459> with<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
fixed that and then he deal with the

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.490 
fixed that and then he deal with the
crossover<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.900> he'd<00:03:47.019> deal<00:03:47.200> with<00:03:47.380> the

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
crossover and he'd deal with the

years after a series of compromises we

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.710 
years after a series of compromises we

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
would have a product that was sellable

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.590 
would have a product that was sellable
and<00:03:58.930> usable<00:03:59.500> well<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.730> thing<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.209> happened

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
and usable well this thing that happened

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.670 
and usable well this thing that happened
at<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.900> NASA<00:04:02.230> lab<00:04:02.650> was<00:04:03.610> amazing<00:04:04.300> because

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
at this NASA lab was amazing because

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.199 
at this NASA lab was amazing because
through<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:06.310> digital<00:04:06.550> it<00:04:06.850> when<00:04:07.030> did

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
through the the digital it when did

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.120 
through the the digital it when did
these<00:04:07.420> digitally<00:04:07.959> controlled<00:04:08.140> transducers

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
these digitally controlled transducers

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.520 
these digitally controlled transducers
and<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.519> CPU<00:04:10.030> inside<00:04:10.420> we<00:04:11.019> were<00:04:11.170> able<00:04:11.500> to

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
and the CPU inside we were able to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.820 
and the CPU inside we were able to
actually<00:04:12.160> correct<00:04:12.730> all<00:04:13.090> of<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
actually correct all of the all of the

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.670 
actually correct all of the all of the
weird<00:04:15.900> frequency<00:04:16.900> anomalies<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.410> might

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
weird frequency anomalies that might

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.310 
weird frequency anomalies that might
exist<00:04:17.859> without<00:04:18.580> having<00:04:19.450> to<00:04:19.600> take<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:19.900> thing

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
exist without having to take the thing

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.040 
exist without having to take the thing
apart<00:04:20.859> we<00:04:21.370> could<00:04:21.580> do<00:04:21.700> it<00:04:21.850> digitally<00:04:22.030> and<00:04:22.570> that

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
apart we could do it digitally and that

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.810 
apart we could do it digitally and that
was<00:04:23.200> a<00:04:23.229> milestone<00:04:23.560> in<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.790> development

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
was a milestone in the development

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.219 
was a milestone in the development
process<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.990> had<00:04:26.680> saved<00:04:26.979> us<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.550> year<00:04:28.450> at<00:04:29.169> least

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
process it had saved us a year at least

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.090 
process it had saved us a year at least
a<00:04:29.590> year<00:04:29.890> in<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.000> performance<00:04:32.100> the

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
a year in the performance the

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.010 
a year in the performance the
performance<00:04:33.130> is<00:04:33.789> far<00:04:34.180> better<00:04:34.450> than<00:04:34.630> anything

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
performance is far better than anything

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.750 
performance is far better than anything
we<00:04:35.260> would<00:04:35.410> have<00:04:35.500> gotten<00:04:35.710> before<00:04:35.950> because<00:04:36.520> in

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
we would have gotten before because in

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.340 
we would have gotten before because in
the

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.440 
the
asked<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:38.100> were<00:04:38.220> always<00:04:38.400> making<00:04:38.640> we<00:04:39.330> were

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
asked we were always making we were

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.300 
asked we were always making we were
always<00:04:39.630> making<00:04:39.930> compromises<00:04:40.410> in<00:04:40.950> order<00:04:41.070> to

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
always making compromises in order to

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.010 
always making compromises in order to
correct<00:04:41.640> those<00:04:41.880> frequency<00:04:42.450> anomalies<00:04:42.870> and

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
correct those frequency anomalies and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.700 
correct those frequency anomalies and
now<00:04:43.380> it's<00:04:44.160> we're<00:04:44.550> not<00:04:44.700> compromising<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.290> I

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
now it's we're not compromising so I

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.850 
now it's we're not compromising so I
believe<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.550> what<00:04:48.390> we<00:04:48.510> have<00:04:48.720> here<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:49.200> really

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
believe that what we have here is really

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.890 
believe that what we have here is really
the<00:04:50.130> next<00:04:50.310> generation<00:04:50.430> of<00:04:51.090> speakers<00:04:51.540> I'm

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the next generation of speakers I'm

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.710 
the next generation of speakers I'm
really<00:04:52.260> proud<00:04:52.440> of<00:04:52.500> this
