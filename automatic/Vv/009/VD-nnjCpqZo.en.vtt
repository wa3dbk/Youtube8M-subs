 this wonderful little gadget that 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.590
 love that is the mandolin we are going to 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.570
 Take out some slices of pear squares 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.689

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:21.759
 are ready we go to the stove to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.799
 Mix them with another ingredient to 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.110
 then process and do our 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.390
 vinaigrette then we are ready to 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.679
 prepare this pear vinaigrette for 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:36.870
 this previously hot frying pan we are going to 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:41.610
 put a little room of white onion 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:45.860
 this sound I love very hot and 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.860
 let's also put the pear here 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.880
 let's wait a few minutes so that 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.010
 soften transparent 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.880
 pear and onion 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:01.300
 we are going to add a little salt 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.300
 very few 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.100
 we wait a few minutes and book 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.130
 here we have our pears ready and 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.700
 the onion we will pass to the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 blender 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.639
 and we are going to add to start 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.379
 emulsify a little bit of vinegar 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:27.379
 cider or apple cider vinegar 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.340
 a little bit of salt 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.440
 to 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.400
 a trickle of honey 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.170
 a little bit of honey nothing more 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.579
 and we started to liquefy and then 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.579
 we thrilled with olive oil 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:08.110
 Well, we have our vinaigrette ready 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.730
 perfectly integrated pear is already 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.260
 tempered very well and now we're going to 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.810
 integrate all the ingredients in 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.390
 our salad here we have a base 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.550
 spinach for being spinach baby arugula 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.950
 even lettuce orejona the base good 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.780
 here I suggest spinach because the taste is 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.790
 very good but if you do not use 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.070
 some at home we are going to put some 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.340
 pieces of pear we cut 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:35.120
 a little while ago in very thin slices 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.310
 Apple 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.560
 apple pieces here I am 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.360
 using without the cascarita but as 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.159
 I have always commented on the shell 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.620
 carries a very important amount of 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.569
 fiber so if you at home the 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.970
 tolerate or the guys go ahead with 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.769
 shell would be much better other 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.989
 ingredient that I'm going to add that is going to 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.710
 give a nice color and especially a 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:02.880
 very harmonious presentation is the kiwi 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.870
 here we are with the kiwi the color 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.730
 incredible antioxidants the blueberries 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.459
 a good portion because to me 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.390
 they love the blueberries as well as they are 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:16.220
 acids 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.950
 here and nothing else we are going to mix a 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.730
 bit 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.490
 let's add a little bit of cheese 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:29.130
 go a few pieces that nothing else are going to 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.130
 go falling in the salad 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.540
 this will also give a touch 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.760
 gourmet and original very tasty if 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.870
 you want to show off at these parties 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:43.529
 at home with birds we can combine this 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:47.889
 salad 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:51.219
 We leave the goat cheese there 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.370
 and finally we are going to add our 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:56.819
 pear vinaigrette nothing else we are going to 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.819
 drop 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:03.009
 we already have it here and me how I 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.719
 love the luck of olive we go to 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:07.509
 also put you to give a little 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:10.779
 shine to our salad a little bit of 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.909
 olive oil very clever and fast 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.430
 that easy with ingredients from 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:18.460
 season very natural very fresh 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.050
 ideal for combining spinach 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.449
 fruits so I hope you guys 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.300
