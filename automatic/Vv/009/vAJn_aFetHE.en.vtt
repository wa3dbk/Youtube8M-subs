00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
for blondes but that just takes too much

sections<00:03:04.110> remember<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.680> bigger<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.040> section

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
sections remember the bigger the section

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.620 
sections remember the bigger the section
the<00:03:05.580> longer<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.030> will<00:03:06.120> take

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the longer it will take

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.050 
the longer it will take
so<00:03:07.020> try<00:03:07.320> sectioning<00:03:07.920> your<00:03:07.950> hair<00:03:08.100> off<00:03:08.520> into

three or four sections starting from the

three or four sections starting from the
crown<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.330> working<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.810> way<00:03:12.960> all<00:03:13.350> the

crown and then working your way all the
way<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.950> bottom<00:03:15.530> and<00:03:16.530> you're<00:03:17.520> definitely

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
way to the bottom and you're definitely

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.699 
way to the bottom and you're definitely
going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.150> want<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.630> get<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> concentrator

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
going to want to get a concentrator

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.040 
going to want to get a concentrator
nozzle<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.580> will<00:03:20.820> help<00:03:21.090> out<00:03:21.270> a<00:03:21.330> lot<00:03:21.780> for

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
nozzle this will help out a lot for

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.410 
nozzle this will help out a lot for
speed<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.770> also<00:03:22.980> smoothness<00:03:23.910> of<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.150> hair

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
speed and also smoothness of the hair

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.199 
speed and also smoothness of the hair
now<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.020> usually<00:03:25.709> use<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.100> horizontally<00:03:26.459> now

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
now I usually use it horizontally now

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.449 
now I usually use it horizontally now
that's<00:03:27.450> kind<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:28.680> wrong<00:03:28.890> way<00:03:29.130> to<00:03:29.190> do<00:03:29.430> it

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
that's kind of the wrong way to do it

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.400 
that's kind of the wrong way to do it
but<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> only<00:03:29.880> do<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.300> for<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.630> lower<00:03:30.900> section

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
but I only do this for the lower section

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.050 
but I only do this for the lower section
just<00:03:31.620> because<00:03:31.860> my<00:03:32.010> wrist<00:03:32.250> can't<00:03:32.520> really<00:03:32.760> twist

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
just because my wrist can't really twist

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.240 
just because my wrist can't really twist
in<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.270> certain<00:03:33.540> way<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:34.020> I'm<00:03:34.410> using<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.890> bio

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
in a certain way and I'm using the bio

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.699 
in a certain way and I'm using the bio
ionic<00:03:35.880> brush<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:37.020> nice<00:03:37.170> because<00:03:37.380> it

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
ionic brush it's really nice because it

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.590 
ionic brush it's really nice because it
actually<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.310> square<00:03:38.850> brush<00:03:39.030> instead<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.510> a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
actually is a square brush instead of a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.570 
actually is a square brush instead of a
round<00:03:39.900> brush<00:03:40.110> so<00:03:40.350> it<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.680> grabs<00:03:41.250> hold

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
round brush so it really grabs hold

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.699 
round brush so it really grabs hold
tight<00:03:41.940> of<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.239> hair<00:03:42.450> and<00:03:42.660> then<00:03:43.140> once<00:03:43.530> I'm<00:03:43.680> done

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
tight of the hair and then once I'm done

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.650 
tight of the hair and then once I'm done
with<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.130> lower<00:03:44.250> section<00:03:44.760> I'm<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.270> going<00:03:45.510> to

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
with the lower section I'm just going to

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.020 
with the lower section I'm just going to
move<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.110> nozzle<00:03:46.320> into<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:47.100> vertical

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
move the nozzle into a vertical

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.910 
move the nozzle into a vertical
direction<00:03:48.270> that<00:03:48.750> is<00:03:49.170> actually<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.650> correct

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
direction that is actually the correct

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.520 
direction that is actually the correct
way<00:03:50.130> to<00:03:50.160> use<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.880> concentrator<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> then<00:03:52.380> I'm

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
way to use the concentrator and then I'm

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.440 
way to use the concentrator and then I'm
just<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> blow-dry<00:03:53.250> my<00:03:53.459> hair<00:03:53.610> with<00:03:54.239> the

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
just going to blow-dry my hair with the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.150 
just going to blow-dry my hair with the
round<00:03:54.720> brush<00:03:57.709> in<00:03:58.709> if<00:03:58.950> you're<00:03:59.100> ever

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
round brush in if you're ever

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.800 
round brush in if you're ever
blow-drying<00:03:59.670> and<00:03:59.910> your<00:04:00.000> arm<00:04:00.150> starts<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.690> get

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
blow-drying and your arm starts to get

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.390 
blow-drying and your arm starts to get
tired<00:04:01.140> don't<00:04:01.530> worry<00:04:01.680> just<00:04:01.860> turn<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
tired don't worry just turn the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.580 
tired don't worry just turn the
blow-dryer<00:04:02.790> off<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.510> put<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.810> down<00:04:04.020> relax

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
blow-dryer off and put it down relax

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.530 
blow-dryer off and put it down relax
your<00:04:04.709> arms<00:04:05.040> for<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.310> little<00:04:05.520> bit<00:04:05.670> take<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.270> little

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
your arms for a little bit take a little

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.600 
your arms for a little bit take a little
break<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:06.989> then<00:04:07.110> continue<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.980> do<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.310> all<00:04:08.489> the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
break and then continue I do it all the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.790 
break and then continue I do it all the
time<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:09.150> then<00:04:09.780> you're<00:04:09.989> just<00:04:10.140> going<00:04:10.380> to<00:04:10.440> take

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
time and then you're just going to take

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.800 
time and then you're just going to take
down<00:04:10.980> each<00:04:11.250> section<00:04:11.790> and<00:04:12.030> just<00:04:12.090> continue<00:04:12.690> the

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
down each section and just continue the

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.960 
down each section and just continue the
process<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.380> pulling<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.860> tight<00:04:14.100> on<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.400> brush

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
process of pulling it tight on the brush

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.030 
process of pulling it tight on the brush
and<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.360> rotating<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.019> brush<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:16.709> really

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
and then rotating the brush it really

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.550 
and then rotating the brush it really
helps<00:04:17.370> to<00:04:17.489> rotate<00:04:18.480> the<00:04:18.600> brush<00:04:18.810> and<00:04:18.989> then<00:04:19.140> using

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
helps to rotate the brush and then using

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.800 
helps to rotate the brush and then using
a<00:04:19.739> cool<00:04:20.100> setting<00:04:20.489> which<00:04:20.640> is<00:04:20.669> the<00:04:20.910> cool<00:04:21.150> button

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
a cool setting which is the cool button

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.840 
a cool setting which is the cool button
shot<00:04:22.080> in<00:04:22.320> order<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.950> cool<00:04:23.310> down

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
shot in order to cool down

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.750 
shot in order to cool down
and<00:04:24.150> keep<00:04:24.420> it<00:04:24.570> nice<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.810> smooth<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
and keep it nice and smooth now with the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.130 
and keep it nice and smooth now with the
concentrator<00:04:27.390> you<00:04:27.570> just<00:04:27.780> want<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> make<00:04:28.110> sure

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
concentrator you just want to make sure

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.600 
concentrator you just want to make sure
that<00:04:28.440> you're<00:04:28.590> always<00:04:29.010> directing<00:04:29.460> and

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
that you're always directing and

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.940 
that you're always directing and
concentrated<00:04:30.300> down<00:04:30.540> on<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.080> hair<00:04:31.290> shaft<00:04:31.650> just

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
concentrated down on the hair shaft just

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.800 
concentrated down on the hair shaft just
because<00:04:32.310> if<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.940> don't<00:04:33.270> then<00:04:33.540> you're<00:04:33.690> just

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
because if you don't then you're just

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.510 
because if you don't then you're just
going<00:04:34.020> to<00:04:34.110> lift<00:04:34.410> off<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.740> cuticle<00:04:35.190> and<00:04:35.310> then

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
going to lift off the cuticle and then

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.400 
going to lift off the cuticle and then
lifting<00:04:35.880> up<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> cuticle<00:04:36.510> is<00:04:36.690> going<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.170> cause

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
lifting up the cuticle is going to cause

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.860 
lifting up the cuticle is going to cause
frizz<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.850> you<00:04:38.940> want<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.270> get<00:04:39.360> the<00:04:39.510> most

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
frizz and if you want to get the most

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.570 
frizz and if you want to get the most
volume<00:04:40.590> you<00:04:40.830> want<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.100> pull<00:04:41.250> your<00:04:41.370> hair

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
volume you want to pull your hair

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.370 
volume you want to pull your hair
forward<00:04:41.910> if<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.390> pull<00:04:42.600> your<00:04:42.630> hair<00:04:42.780> back<00:04:43.200> and

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
forward if you pull your hair back and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.200 
forward if you pull your hair back and
then<00:04:43.530> rotate<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:43.980> down<00:04:44.310> you're<00:04:44.580> not<00:04:44.760> going<00:04:45.090> to

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
then rotate it down you're not going to

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.520 
then rotate it down you're not going to
get<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.480> right<00:04:45.660> on<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:46.050> route<00:04:46.230> you're<00:04:46.380> gonna

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
get it right on the route you're gonna

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.890 
get it right on the route you're gonna
get<00:04:46.710> it<00:04:46.860> off<00:04:47.040> base<00:04:47.340> if<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:48.030> pull<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.270> forward

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
get it off base if you pull it forward
