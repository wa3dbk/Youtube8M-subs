00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 vegetarianism that was on the 1st of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.330
 October we show here in the program 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.050
 a special report on the style of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.240
 life 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.070
 if you missed the report that 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.940
 I watched again just access our 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.570
 tv site morena dot com.br and enter 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.390
 link of the news well and we stayed 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 show you a recipe here 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.900
 water in the mouth a vegetarian feijoada and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.769
 I'll take care of her after lunch. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.769
 That cinch does not 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.500
 so bacon meat or tenderloin 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.680
 ear or pork rib what turns 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 vegetarian feijoada and what will give the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.039
 little face in the feijoada the difference is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.390
 smoking tofu and sausage well the idea 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 at least curious 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.920
 but before you start the recipe you have to 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.730
 prepare some of the ingredients 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.350
 the eggplant in a short and put it on the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.350
 oven of a grill 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.590
 if I put it under ice without going through 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.450
 break it and I can do it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 feel this piece of her in the feijoada 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 understand and not that thing shows like this 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.650
 I like this place a forminha and leads to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.170
 oven 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.290
 then the result so after 20 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.990
 minutes in the oven shot and she's like this 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 this soy has already been hydrated and only with water 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.130
 Hot anything after I put right 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.840
 extreme right and put 6 tablespoons 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:40.049
 soy cookie left in paper 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.060
 August with eggplant and soy ready 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.820
 it is time to start effectively 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.850
 prepare the feijoada 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.159
 I usually get by the olive oil 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.399
 aloÃ­sio these are not to give a pinch 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.909
 people are just and putting others 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.570
 ingredients that make the time of the seasoning 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.409
 red chili tomato and green onion 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 and salt are after this is those shops 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.740
 you've hydrated and showed with sauce 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.770
 of soybeans 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.770
 ah 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.980
 the black beans already cooked with enough 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.469
 broth and now has an important step 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.909
 this recipe put the smoked tofu and 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.680
 soy sausage 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.359
 only it has to be integer even for 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.060
 do not risk undoing 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:31.709
 only then will you cut it ok 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.720
 cook and cook for about 20 minutes. 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 minutes to accentuate the taste of 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.099
 Ingredients 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.730
 after that put the rest still 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:44.819
 missing carrot zucchini leaves 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.750
 blond and finally to that eggplant that 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.639
 you found 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.200
 now you can take advantage of up to 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.840
 season the feijoada 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.269
 cover and leave again for another 20 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.540
 minutes only this time on low heat 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.439
 to thicken the broth resembles tofu and 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.419
 of sausage 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:05.480
 because it is after groups to the broth can 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.480
 catch the two and the time of slice the 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.849
 then ready with cortez neto rose 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.239

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.769
 It's a good finish and to finish it. 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.979
 Do you like to add some tomatoes? 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.489
 chopped to give a delicious texture and 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:29.639
 coentry 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.859
 this position then yields to six people and 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:34.459
 thence it is time to assemble the presentation of the 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:38.190
 Dish is like you with brown rice 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:42.390
