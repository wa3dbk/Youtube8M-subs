three and then cut on the outside for my
design<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:02.969> little

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
design is because I use these little

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
design is because I use these little
pieces<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.840> PVC<00:02:04.350> pipe<00:02:04.920> which<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.340> six<00:02:05.579> inch<00:02:05.759> PVC

this<00:02:09.810> one<00:02:10.050> here<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.979> just<00:02:11.220> basically<00:02:11.640> makes<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
this one here it just basically makes it

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.030 
this one here it just basically makes it
a<00:02:12.300> little<00:02:12.540> bit<00:02:12.750> sturdier<00:02:13.080> not<00:02:13.560> quite<00:02:13.830> so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
a little bit sturdier not quite so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.020 
a little bit sturdier not quite so
flexible<00:02:15.560> these<00:02:16.560> are<00:02:16.739> not<00:02:16.950> necessary<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.879> can

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
flexible these are not necessary you can

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.210 
flexible these are not necessary you can
certainly<00:02:18.390> do<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.870> without<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.379> it's<00:02:19.920> just

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
certainly do it without it it's just

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.490 
certainly do it without it it's just
something<00:02:20.580> I've<00:02:20.730> chosen<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.330> do<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.720> order<00:02:22.470> to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.839 
something I've chosen to do in order to
just<00:02:23.370> dirty<00:02:23.580> my<00:02:23.760> trap<00:02:24.030> up<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.330> little<00:02:24.569> bit<00:02:25.849> you

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
just dirty my trap up a little bit you

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.610 
just dirty my trap up a little bit you
can<00:02:27.030> basically<00:02:27.209> build<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.780> whatever<00:02:27.959> size<00:02:28.200> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
can basically build it whatever size you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.220 
can basically build it whatever size you
want<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:29.130> just<00:02:29.160> need<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> take<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.239> check

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
want you just need to take and check

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.750 
want you just need to take and check
with<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.500> game<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.860> fish<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.430> make<00:02:32.550> sure

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
with your game and fish to make sure

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.699 
with your game and fish to make sure
that<00:02:32.970> there's<00:02:33.180> no<00:02:33.360> size<00:02:33.720> limit<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.319> whatever

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
that there's no size limit or whatever

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.949 
that there's no size limit or whatever
and<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.430> stick<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> those<00:02:35.970> limits<00:02:36.239> otherwise

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
and just stick to those limits otherwise

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.339 
and just stick to those limits otherwise
you<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.349> build<00:02:37.560> whatever<00:02:37.980> you<00:02:38.190> want<00:02:39.290> at<00:02:40.290> that

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
you can build whatever you want at that

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.100 
you can build whatever you want at that
point<00:02:40.860> this<00:02:41.580> roll<00:02:41.940> this<00:02:42.330> came<00:02:42.599> off<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.930> roll

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
point this roll this came off the roll

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.680 
point this roll this came off the roll
just<00:02:43.380> like<00:02:43.590> this<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.030> don't<00:02:45.299> really<00:02:45.450> have

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
just like this so you don't really have

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.569 
just like this so you don't really have
to<00:02:45.810> do<00:02:45.930> too<00:02:46.140> much<00:02:46.349> for<00:02:46.620> me<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.069> is<00:02:47.190> basically

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
to do too much for me to it is basically

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.839 
to do too much for me to it is basically
in<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:47.970> in<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.390> cylinder<00:02:48.989> position<00:02:49.410> anyways<00:02:50.190> you

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
in a in a cylinder position anyways you

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.580 
in a in a cylinder position anyways you
just<00:02:51.060> want<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> open<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.930> so<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.319> it<00:02:52.500> will

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
just want to open it up so that it will

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.270 
just want to open it up so that it will
fit<00:02:52.829> together

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
fit together

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.819 
fit together
I<00:02:53.959> overlapped<00:02:55.290> three<00:02:56.930> of<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.349> end<00:02:58.530> pieces

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
I overlapped three of the end pieces

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.750 
I overlapped three of the end pieces
with<00:02:59.310> three<00:02:59.610> of<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.819> other<00:03:00.000> side<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:02.579> that

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
with three of the other side so that

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.970 
with three of the other side so that
gives<00:03:03.000> it<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.209> nice<00:03:03.420> sturdy<00:03:03.810> line<00:03:04.620> through

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
gives it a nice sturdy line through

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.289 
gives it a nice sturdy line through
there<00:03:08.840> take<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> zip<00:03:10.140> tie<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:11.180> through<00:03:12.180> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
there take a zip tie and through the

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:28.600 
there take a zip tie and through the
first<00:03:12.569> square

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.150 

and<00:03:28.700> just<00:03:29.420> tighten<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.870> down<00:03:32.590> now<00:03:33.590> basically

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
and just tighten that down now basically

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.340 
and just tighten that down now basically
I<00:03:34.190> use<00:03:34.490> these<00:03:34.700> zip<00:03:34.970> ties<00:03:35.000> just<00:03:35.540> to<00:03:35.870> hold<00:03:36.110> it

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
I use these zip ties just to hold it

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.780 
I use these zip ties just to hold it
till<00:03:37.340> I<00:03:38.020> put<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.140> wire<00:03:39.350> on<00:03:39.680> it<00:03:39.860> but<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.520> can<00:03:40.670> do

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
till I put the wire on it but you can do

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.550 
till I put the wire on it but you can do
it<00:03:40.910> however<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.420> like<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.960> zip<00:03:42.170> ties<00:03:42.380> will

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
it however you like the zip ties will

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.650 
it however you like the zip ties will
work<00:03:42.710> just<00:03:42.740> fine<00:03:43.040> there's<00:03:43.820> no<00:03:44.000> problems<00:03:44.480> with

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
work just fine there's no problems with

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.110 
work just fine there's no problems with
them<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:46.010> may<00:03:46.160> have<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.460> replace<00:03:46.670> them<00:03:46.940> from

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
them you may have to replace them from

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.670 
them you may have to replace them from
time<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:47.480> time<00:03:47.540> but<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.110> keep<00:03:48.320> an<00:03:48.470> eye<00:03:48.650> on

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
time to time but just keep an eye on

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.710 
time to time but just keep an eye on
them<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:49.160> you<00:03:49.640> should<00:03:49.700> be<00:03:49.970> just<00:03:50.180> fine<00:03:50.270> if<00:03:50.630> you

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
them and you should be just fine if you

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.030 
them and you should be just fine if you
want<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:50.960> just<00:03:51.080> use<00:03:51.260> zip<00:03:51.470> ties<00:03:51.680> you<00:03:51.860> don't

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
want to just use zip ties you don't

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.870 
want to just use zip ties you don't
necessarily<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.730> use<00:03:52.850> wire<00:03:57.520> now<00:03:58.520> you<00:03:58.580> may

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
necessarily have to use wire now you may

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.140 
necessarily have to use wire now you may
want<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> use<00:03:59.450> some<00:04:00.290> gloves<00:04:00.560> with<00:04:00.830> these<00:04:01.150> while

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
want to use some gloves with these while

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.820 
want to use some gloves with these while
you<00:04:02.180> doing<00:04:02.450> this<00:04:02.750> because<00:04:02.990> they<00:04:03.170> can<00:04:03.200> these

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
you doing this because they can these

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.650 
you doing this because they can these
edges<00:04:04.310> where<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.580> cut<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:04.970> off<00:04:05.209> can<00:04:05.480> be

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
edges where you cut this off can be

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.890 
edges where you cut this off can be
sharp<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.050> just<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.590> careful<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.690> at<00:04:08.690> that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
sharp so just be careful and at that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.680 
sharp so just be careful and at that
point<00:04:09.140> you<00:04:09.410> basically<00:04:09.590> got<00:04:10.160> your<00:04:10.430> cylinder<00:04:10.910> if

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
point you basically got your cylinder if

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.390 
point you basically got your cylinder if
you<00:04:11.840> want<00:04:12.050> to<00:04:12.140> use<00:04:12.230> just<00:04:12.260> zip<00:04:12.770> ties<00:04:12.980> you<00:04:13.250> can

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
you want to use just zip ties you can

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.160 
you want to use just zip ties you can
basically<00:04:13.580> just<00:04:14.000> zip<00:04:14.270> tie<00:04:14.480> this<00:04:14.540> all<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.020> way

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
basically just zip tie this all the way

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.050 
basically just zip tie this all the way
down<00:04:15.519> or<00:04:16.519> if<00:04:16.669> you<00:04:16.820> want<00:04:17.000> to<00:04:17.090> use<00:04:17.269> wire<00:04:19.060> just

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
down or if you want to use wire just

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.670 
down or if you want to use wire just
take<00:04:20.239> a<00:04:20.269> piece<00:04:20.540> of<00:04:20.720> wire

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.570 

place<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.580> through<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:29.190> just<00:04:30.190> loop<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> around

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
place it through and just loop it around

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.650 
place it through and just loop it around
a<00:04:30.820> couple<00:04:31.120> times<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:33.610> way<00:04:33.789> it<00:04:33.940> just<00:04:33.970> holds<00:04:34.539> it

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
a couple times that way it just holds it

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.779 
a couple times that way it just holds it
in<00:04:35.229> place<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.009> that<00:04:36.190> way<00:04:36.340> it<00:04:36.460> won't<00:04:36.550> go

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
in place and that way it won't go

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:41.340 
in place and that way it won't go
nowhere<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:39.509> just<00:04:40.509> find<00:04:40.720> I<00:04:40.840> can<00:04:41.050> get<00:04:41.199> these

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
nowhere I just find I can get these

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.590 
nowhere I just find I can get these
tighter<00:04:41.710> this<00:04:42.070> way<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:42.580> they're<00:04:43.150> not<00:04:43.360> so

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
tighter this way and they're not so

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.320 
tighter this way and they're not so
loose<00:04:43.840> if<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.310> do<00:04:45.310> it<00:04:45.490> you<00:04:45.639> might<00:04:45.759> want<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.180> use<00:04:46.300> a

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
loose if I do it you might want to use a

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.090 
loose if I do it you might want to use a
pair<00:04:46.600> of<00:04:46.630> pliers<00:04:46.840> just<00:04:47.050> to<00:04:47.380> tighten<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.800> up<00:04:47.860> a

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
pair of pliers just to tighten that up a

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.659 
pair of pliers just to tighten that up a
little<00:04:48.190> bit

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.659 

lay<00:04:54.669> that<00:04:54.699> down<00:04:55.090> flat<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.860> then<00:04:56.860> all<00:04:57.009> I<00:04:57.039> do<00:04:57.250> is

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
lay that down flat and then all I do is

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.219 
lay that down flat and then all I do is
go<00:04:57.910> like<00:04:58.479> every<00:04:58.870> other<00:04:58.990> one<00:05:00.690> along<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:01.900> edge

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
go like every other one along this edge

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.600 
go like every other one along this edge
of<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:03.490> top<00:05:03.729> piece<00:05:04.030> that<00:05:04.240> folds<00:05:04.630> over<00:05:04.780> and<00:05:05.610> I

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
of the top piece that folds over and I

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:14.360 
of the top piece that folds over and I
loop<00:05:06.849> it<00:05:07.060> through

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:28.210 

hold<00:05:15.370> it<00:05:15.490> down<00:05:15.789> tight<00:05:17.610> loop<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.789> through<00:05:18.819> again

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.100 

now<00:05:29.030> that's<00:05:29.240> good<00:05:29.510> and<00:05:29.660> tight<00:05:29.690> right<00:05:30.080> there<00:05:32.110> go

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
now that's good and tight right there go

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.160 
now that's good and tight right there go
two<00:05:33.170> more<00:05:33.620> up<00:05:34.150> or<00:05:35.150> three<00:05:35.510> whatever<00:05:36.020> you

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
two more up or three whatever you

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.730 
two more up or three whatever you
believe<00:05:36.290> whatever<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:36.920> feel<00:05:37.160> is<00:05:37.280> best<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:39.350> do

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
believe whatever you feel is best and do

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:59.379 
believe whatever you feel is best and do
it<00:05:39.890> again

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.300 

and<00:05:59.569> just<00:06:00.080> do<00:06:00.229> that<00:06:00.259> all<00:06:00.470> the<00:06:00.620> way<00:06:00.740> up<00:06:00.860> if<00:06:01.220> you

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
and just do that all the way up if you

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.089 
and just do that all the way up if you
choose<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.610> use<00:06:01.879> the<00:06:02.030> water<00:06:02.860> now<00:06:03.860> at<00:06:03.949> this

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
choose to use the water now at this

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.070 
choose to use the water now at this
point<00:06:04.370> in<00:06:04.699> my<00:06:05.479> design

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
point in my design

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:14.830 
point in my design
I'll<00:06:07.069> slide<00:06:07.490> this<00:06:07.759> PVC<00:06:08.659> color<00:06:09.169> in<00:06:09.439> here<00:06:13.840> and

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
I'll slide this PVC color in here and

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:24.410 
I'll slide this PVC color in here and
it's<00:06:15.169> tight-fitting

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.690 

okay<00:06:25.140> now<00:06:25.410> we<00:06:25.470> got<00:06:25.710> it<00:06:25.860> in<00:06:26.010> there<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.550> was<00:06:26.670> a

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
okay now we got it in there it was a

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.490 
okay now we got it in there it was a
tight<00:06:26.970> fit<00:06:27.000> but<00:06:27.420> we<00:06:27.480> finally<00:06:27.900> got<00:06:28.020> it<00:06:28.200> in<00:06:28.320> there

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:28.500 
tight fit but we finally got it in there

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.830 
tight fit but we finally got it in there
now<00:06:29.490> I<00:06:29.520> leave<00:06:29.850> it<00:06:30.030> back<00:06:30.920> one<00:06:31.920> Square<00:06:32.840> behind

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
now I leave it back one Square behind

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.220 
now I leave it back one Square behind
the<00:06:34.020> outside<00:06:34.470> edge<00:06:34.740> and<00:06:35.600> this<00:06:36.600> will<00:06:36.810> help<00:06:36.990> to

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:37.230 
the outside edge and this will help to

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.150 
the outside edge and this will help to
that<00:06:37.470> once<00:06:37.680> we<00:06:37.830> put<00:06:38.100> our<00:06:38.310> cones<00:06:38.640> in<00:06:40.160> it

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
that once we put our cones in it

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.610 
that once we put our cones in it
stiffens<00:06:41.760> out<00:06:41.940> to<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.540> outside<00:06:42.960> edge<00:06:43.230> but<00:06:43.530> it

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
stiffens out to the outside edge but it

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.740 
stiffens out to the outside edge but it
also<00:06:43.800> gives<00:06:44.280> you<00:06:44.460> room<00:06:44.730> in<00:06:44.880> order<00:06:45.090> to<00:06:45.240> tie<00:06:45.510> off

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
also gives you room in order to tie off

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:51.350 
also gives you room in order to tie off
your<00:06:46.220> outside<00:06:47.220> cone<00:06:49.490> at<00:06:50.490> this<00:06:50.700> point<00:06:51.030> you're

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 
your outside cone at this point you're

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.870 
your outside cone at this point you're
going<00:06:51.420> to<00:06:51.570> want<00:06:51.780> to<00:06:51.870> take<00:06:52.140> and<00:06:52.410> drill<00:06:53.130> a<00:06:53.340> few

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
going to want to take and drill a few

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.680 
going to want to take and drill a few
holes<00:06:54.830> around<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:56.010> outside<00:06:56.430> edge<00:06:56.730> and<00:06:57.030> zip

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
holes around the outside edge and zip

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.690 
holes around the outside edge and zip
tie<00:06:57.900> those<00:06:58.310> to<00:06:59.310> hold<00:06:59.520> these<00:06:59.730> collars<00:07:00.210> in<00:07:00.390> place
