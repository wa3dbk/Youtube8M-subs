up<00:01:56.140> working<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.229> google<00:02:04.119> should<00:02:05.119> be<00:02:05.180> good<00:02:05.270> to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
up working this google should be good to

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.060 
up working this google should be good to
build<00:02:05.510> a<00:02:05.720> backs<00:02:06.050> so<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:06.530> can<00:02:06.680> get<00:02:06.800> some<00:02:06.950> better

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
build a backs so we can get some better

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.480 
build a backs so we can get some better
would<00:02:07.780> better<00:02:08.780> would<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.080> mean<00:02:09.350> what<00:02:09.979> quicker

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
would better would I mean what quicker

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:18.660 
would better would I mean what quicker
uh<00:02:12.160> yeah<00:02:14.470> let<00:02:15.470> some<00:02:15.650> axes<00:02:16.450> also<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.510> is<00:02:17.660> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
uh yeah let some axes also this is a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.850 
uh yeah let some axes also this is a
that<00:02:19.670> was<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.880> pickaxe<00:02:20.540> she'll<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.560> using<00:02:22.040> later

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
that was a pickaxe she'll be using later

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.600 
that was a pickaxe she'll be using later
three<00:02:24.860> axes<00:02:25.190> should<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.430> enough<00:02:25.640> for<00:02:25.760> now<00:02:27.610> you

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
three axes should be enough for now you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.640 
three axes should be enough for now you
quickly<00:02:28.820> use<00:02:29.060> these<00:02:33.670> kind<00:02:34.670> of<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.880> sapling

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
quickly use these kind of the sapling

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:46.990 
quickly use these kind of the sapling
this<00:02:36.650> will<00:02:36.800> replant<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.280> tree<00:02:37.520> I<00:02:45.910> think<00:02:46.910> will

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
this will replant the tree I think will

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.160 
this will replant the tree I think will
be<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.360> thing<00:02:47.660> i<00:02:47.720> don't<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:47.870> about<00:02:47.959> these

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
be the thing i don't like about these

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.890 
be the thing i don't like about these
large<00:02:48.440> trees<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:49.070> if<00:02:49.220> they<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.570> can't

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
large trees is if they that you can't

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.940 
large trees is if they that you can't
get<00:02:50.989> all<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> wood<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.590> so<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.739> have<00:02:51.799> to

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
get all the wood and so you have to

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.810 
get all the wood and so you have to
