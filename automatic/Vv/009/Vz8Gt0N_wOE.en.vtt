review on what I think about it because

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.220 
review on what I think about it because
I<00:00:31.830> love<00:00:32.040> trying<00:00:32.340> new<00:00:32.460> foundations<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> I

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I love trying new foundations and I

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.740 
I love trying new foundations and I
found<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.280> would<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.360> 8<00:00:36.570> out<00:00:36.719> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
found that I would give this an 8 out of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
found that I would give this an 8 out of
10<00:00:37.399> probably<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:38.430> 9<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.149> more<00:00:39.329> i<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
10 probably a 9 the more i use it the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
10 probably a 9 the more i use it the
more<00:00:39.960> i<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.800> first<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:41.250> didn't<00:00:41.489> like<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
more i like it at first I didn't like it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.779 
more i like it at first I didn't like it
because<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:43.140> very<00:00:43.530> liquidy<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.670> was

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because it was very liquidy and it was

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209 
because it was very liquidy and it was
very<00:00:44.969> runny<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.559> took<00:00:46.890> me<00:00:47.070> off<00:00:47.190> guard

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
very runny and that took me off guard

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.479 
very runny and that took me off guard
because<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.780> used<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.200> using<00:00:49.590> Revlon<00:00:50.280> which

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
because I was used to using Revlon which

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.740 
because I was used to using Revlon which
is<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.059> thick<00:00:51.480> thicker<00:00:52.350> consistency

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
is more of a thick thicker consistency

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.279 
is more of a thick thicker consistency
so<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.110> um<00:00:56.120> yeah<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.449> oh<00:00:57.629> wow<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.109> can

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so then um yeah I'm like oh wow this can

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.250 
so then um yeah I'm like oh wow this can
get<00:00:58.469> really<00:00:58.739> messy<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.370> you're<00:00:59.609> clumsy<00:00:59.989> but<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
get really messy if you're clumsy but I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.189 
get really messy if you're clumsy but I
found<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> reason<00:01:02.760> why<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
found that the reason why the

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.050 
found that the reason why the
consistency<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.470> little<00:01:05.339> bit<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
consistency is a little bit more on the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.170 
consistency is a little bit more on the
liquid<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.040> what<00:01:09.030> it

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
liquid side is because it is what it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.230 
liquid side is because it is what it
says<00:01:09.479> it's<00:01:09.810> super<00:01:10.560> blendable<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.850> reason

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
says it's super blendable and the reason

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.310 
says it's super blendable and the reason
why<00:01:12.390> it's<00:01:13.760> liquidy<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.570> movable

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
why it's liquidy is because it's movable

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
why it's liquidy is because it's movable
so<00:01:18.229> let<00:01:19.229> me<00:01:19.320> get<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.590> again<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.520> put<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.820> up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so let me get it again I just put it up

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.710 
so let me get it again I just put it up
yeah<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.530> can<00:01:23.159> apply<00:01:23.670> layers<00:01:24.180> upon<00:01:24.509> layers

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
yeah so you can apply layers upon layers

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.760 
yeah so you can apply layers upon layers
in<00:01:25.500> different<00:01:26.220> areas<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> your<00:01:27.180> face<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
in different areas of your face and it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.819 
in different areas of your face and it
will<00:01:29.040> cover<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.729> as<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.420> um<00:01:30.780> like<00:01:31.350> full

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
will cover up as if it's um like full

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.840 
will cover up as if it's um like full
coverage<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:33.270> say<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.310> medium<00:01:35.310> well

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
coverage I would say this is medium well

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.380 
coverage I would say this is medium well
it<00:01:36.630> depends<00:01:37.560> because<00:01:37.710> this<00:01:38.130> builds<00:01:38.759> up<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
it depends because this builds up so it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
it depends because this builds up so it
can<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.659> anything<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.320> want<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> can<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.070> share

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
can be anything you want it can be share

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.170 
can be anything you want it can be share
and<00:01:41.540> then<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.659> could<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.990> um<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:44.189> would<00:01:44.729> say<00:01:44.939> up

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and then it could be um i would say up

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.069 
and then it could be um i would say up
to<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> strong<00:01:45.930> medium<00:01:46.579> um<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.840> keep

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
to a strong medium um if you keep

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.880 
to a strong medium um if you keep
building<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.649> only<00:01:49.920> build<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> medium<00:01:51.180> on

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
building I only build up to a medium on

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
building I only build up to a medium on
certain<00:01:52.890> areas<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.640> cheeks<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.840> found

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
certain areas of my cheeks and I found

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560 
certain areas of my cheeks and I found
that<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:55.710> even<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.490> use<00:01:56.570> concealer

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that I don't even have to use concealer

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.370 
that I don't even have to use concealer
under<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.850> is<00:01:59.880> super<00:02:00.390> removable

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
under this so this is super removable

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.910 
under this so this is super removable
super<00:02:01.710> blendable<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.549> dries<00:02:02.909> um<00:02:03.740> right<00:02:04.740> on

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
super blendable and it dries um right on

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.389 
super blendable and it dries um right on
time<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.479> has<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:07.170> beautiful<00:02:07.399> matte

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
time so it has this beautiful matte

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.650 
time so it has this beautiful matte
finish<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.810> leaves<00:02:10.170> your<00:02:10.379> face<00:02:10.739> um

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
finish so it leaves your face um

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.370 
finish so it leaves your face um
oil-free

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
oil-free

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.500 
oil-free
usually<00:02:13.740> have<00:02:13.950> combination<00:02:14.820> skin<00:02:14.850> but<00:02:15.480> I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
usually have combination skin but I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.320 
usually have combination skin but I
found<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:16.080> foundations<00:02:16.890> give<00:02:17.220> me<00:02:17.430> more<00:02:18.300> of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
found that foundations give me more of

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.830 
found that foundations give me more of
an<00:02:18.480> oily<00:02:18.990> finish<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:20.460> has<00:02:20.760> no<00:02:21.060> oil<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.660> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
an oily finish and this has no oil in it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.110 
an oily finish and this has no oil in it
I<00:02:22.080> know<00:02:22.290> most<00:02:22.680> foundations<00:02:23.400> say<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.880> but

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
I know most foundations say that but
