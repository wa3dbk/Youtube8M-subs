00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.289
 the trainer of arminia bielefeld 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.240
 in contrast, stefan schema thinks of days 

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:08.530
 like this 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.030
 silly christmas time then 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.309
 At some point wait for great drivers 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.590
 namely, until Christmas took 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.940
 still in six finals and then would be 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.800
 draw an interim balance and then 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.240
 Will we really see where it is with us? 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.160
 Of course, we prefer to go upstairs 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.200
 moment is arminia bielefeld in place 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.150
 five and that team apparently 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.130
 really ready for anything in the end 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.080
 also to be at the top 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.599
 She has her coach this week 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.609
 so was a bit surprised 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.379
 stefan chandler was the day before yesterday 

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.190
 training after an intensive session 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.989
 already finish 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.399
 but his players then asked him for it 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.140
 to be allowed to continue 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.460
 this working and willing attitude 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.809
 wants to chandler today from his 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.089
 Team in the game here in Wiesbaden 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.519
 see the arminia in black and white 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.629
 apropos training standard situations 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.789
 this week was the 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.280
 training focus the first corner after 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.489
 nine minutes and it is there it is 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.489
 already happened 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.299
 perfect start for bielefeld the early 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.190
 guide 

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.440
 there was work during the week 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.090
 but the chance exploitation was worth it 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.679
 last the biggest problem 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.619
 Today, it works right away with the first one 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.890
 possibility johannes rahn at the end of the 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.890
 recycling chain 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.380
 who has been playing for eleven without victory 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.150
 this season but also ten times 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.409
 played a draw is quite a 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.700
 uncomfortable opponent 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.770
 sven mold is that and janjic zlatko 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.840
 janjic grew up in Bielefeld 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.090
 At 15, he came to Arminia was there 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.680
 later profi and bundesliga player until 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.680
 he moved to vienna two years ago 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.150
 the arminia does everything else 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.220
 properly controlled soon result 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.320
 opponent the next establishment attack 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.150
 dennis riemer 27 minutes already over 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.400
 little coach peter vollmann active earlier 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.350
 in münster or fortuna köln his 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 current team constantly in the 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.380
 alarm state 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.810
 just before the break free kick for 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:08.040
 bielefeld and johannes rahn that again 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 but that was not enough anyway 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.210
 what you accuse the arminia until then 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:18.990
 can that at half-time only with 1 0 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:20.460
 kemmers Bielefeld not only leads today 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.650
 with one but with two 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.120
 Striker set up alone that shows 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.930
 that bielefeld necessarily win here 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.000
 want 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.730
 one of the two attackers that is 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.880
 fabian klos and the other is sebastian 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.710
 It's not exactly the headball game 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.330
 his favorite activity and 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.800
 Nevertheless , he does it as a learned 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.880
 Wing players today in the center 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.880
 to work properly 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.980
 the svp does not just treat some 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.240
 cheap games but they are today you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.730
 not worth the money yet 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.590
 substitute steffen wohlfarth 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.500
 brings a bit of improvement but on 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.140
 platinum comfort board not over 57 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.750
 minute arminias keeper plays a whole 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.400
 strong season maybe even 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.450
 beatles best in this game time 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.450
 patrick platinum 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.180
 but who can do it? 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.370
 to keep Arminia behind 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.530
 the corner comes from alf mintzel and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.860
 jannik the ball is flying direction 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.209
 East Westphalia but here in Vienna you are 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.209
 apparently already satisfied with little 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.080
 then already the final phase no 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.570
 lazy at welfare the opinion of 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.400
 Chile , the opportunity to counter 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.740
 fabian klos in the middle of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.230
 furnished test goes off but 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.520
 alone against yes you no eleven meters 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.240
 continue to play 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.870
 a wrong decision because that was a 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.210
 foul 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.670
 That's a punishment bielefeld 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.100
 disadvantaged but that has none 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.960
 consequences because that makes school 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.390
 arielia was created for bielefeld 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.490
 win convincingly gives way overtime 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.930
 in training sometimes simply upset 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.860
 football and I wanted on thursday 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.540
 stop because I am so scared 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.710
 had because of the load control and 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.150
 the guys were almost on flood 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.290
 gone because we just go to the 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.610
 play decision I've wanted 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.280
 she then too is left to luck 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.480
 then happens relatively quickly 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:20.330
 Bielefeld has fun at work and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.420
 again contact the table top and 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:27.010
 stay on top and right there 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.010
 would also be completely different tradition
