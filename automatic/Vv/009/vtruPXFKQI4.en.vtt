00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.190
 hey dear friends and welcome back 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:15.879
 wants two reasons drive 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.420
 we play the maps, apple returns yes 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:21.759
 nice start in image start holes like that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.109
 I want and I just hope that we 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.179
 I'll break some here again 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.160
 I'm in a good mood and confident 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.500
 that we will classify a lot here 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.490
 should play wonderful against that stone 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.449
 step and would have our set 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.300
 completely not true 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.620
 Thank you very much for the set 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:45.040
 and then a wooden sword I'll get you 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:49.660
 love you all as they should times 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.720
 is was a bug and I can not think if I 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.430
 have what the chamber is 5000 chamber 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.070
 actually that is of useless is mine 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.710
 what do you need chamber people good for 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 If you have less than 20 km you will be banned 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.530
 and war per day 10 you can go back 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.330
 that then someday again 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.740
 you can play at under 20 km h 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.729
 do not play because then stop 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.890
 wanted to make sure that you do not stop 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.810
 just random people kills in that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.830
 You stop at a certain chamber 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.870
 worth saying is banned or not 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.230
 can play more 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.970
 and yes it's just that way 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.860
 but really came a degree 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.000
 really totally useless then you know 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.420
 what people you fly you fly you 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.440
 fly down 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.440
 that has now seen less or 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.630
 what was a focus just what only one 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 the second point was the 23 points 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.069
 third of the third of the third must sit 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.439
 or the third must sit or why 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.060
 I can not get the third of it 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.130
 third nice 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229
 why did you kill him, why did you 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.500
 So you killed agrees that when 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.179
 trek on yes well that's sooner 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.509
 suboptimal I want to kill you now 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.490
 would have 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.079
 then look who up here like that 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.849
 alone running around 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.989
 that's why he's on the tree I have that 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:11.790
 has seen a tree near or right 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.950
 you can go to a school somewhere 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.260
 yes here below 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 somehow you can bake yourself in there 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.829
 and gebauer gebauer do you nothing me 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.099
 Do not you prefer to back up 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:30.840
 who attacked me attacked you 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:35.450
 are angry if or joke that is right 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.450
 evil of the type b 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.740
 People prefer to stay here 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.740
 security 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:03:01.110
 what should be what players welcomed no what 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.110
 now I'm here 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:10.960
 what was that 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.070
 therefore not at all that is looked 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.600
 probably nothing with the roll break 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.670
 I was again racing from a cargo 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.650
 kids killed i was detective he was 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.730

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.470
 end of the game so I sure as well 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.020
 can go that he is in Lausanne and 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.000
 No trader is and he was in need 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.890
 Just break me as a detective 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.600
 was beaten, however, with the 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.280
 round frozen cargo I hope then 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.720
 Just put it there 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.800
 I also liked you 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.480

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.630
