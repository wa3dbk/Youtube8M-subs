00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.680
 cancer often does not have 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.890
 debug but at least people 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.260
 they have the right to try to fight for 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.130
 their lives and in that sense we 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.500
 We believe that this does not constitute 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.790
 a social euthanasia is to say that the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 people who do not have money the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.070
 society is not a ministry is not a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.410
 minister is the society that condemns them 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.490
 to die without any possibility of power 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.349
 face a job a commitment a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 therapy that can extend your life 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.150
 improve the quality of life and many 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.850
 times survive and therefore what 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.000
 we want to ask is what 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.609
 we want to group all the different 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.680
 groupings that have been forming in 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:49.809
 around cancer to education cancer 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.510
 of breast here we have the groupings of 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.550
 lung and pancreatic cancer but 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.260
 we want all of them to be associated 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.269
 the people to all the patients that 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.239
 they have cancer to fight just for 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.789
 the right of all and we want to put 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.340
 emphasis also on prevention the 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:10.000
 cancer is a malady of modern society 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.000
 an evil of development has to do with 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.470
 the consumption of food has to do 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.590
 with the consumption of fat has to do 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.330
 with little physical activity 40 per 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.640
 cancer are related to 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.830
 diet and with lifestyles and by 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.869
 whether we want to face cancer 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.860
 we really have to prevent it we have 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.899
 to face the problems of 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.030
 heavy metal contamination of 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.819
 dioxin pesticides that surround us 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.440
 permanently it can not be that already with 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.110
 the diagnosis that is something very painful 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.850
 of receiving people also have to 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.979
 take charge of the anguish of the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.100
 economic situation and not feel that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.570
 has the right to gamble with 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.090
 everything I can give 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.150
 and the possibilities today to be able 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.280
 try to improve because not only 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.840
 we are talking here about the cure of 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.820
 cancer but also the quality of 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.330
 life through which one transits mind 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.830
 this disease has therefore 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.110
 we want to start this road of 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.910
 organization we believe that things in 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.479
 lonely never work and therefore 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.060
 the possibility of networks and 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.970
 communication is what will allow us 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.570
 to be able to shake society 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.010
 because all Chileans 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.620
 close to us we have had a 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.660
 someone who is passing through this disease 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.690
 or that has traveled at some time by 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.970
 she and we believe that everyone in this eagerness to 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.770
 equity in Chile- and to feel that all 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.420
 we have the same rights too 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.239
 we have the same rights of healing 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.010
 and healing or good quality of life 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.340
 in front of a disease that seems 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.220
 irreversible so in a country that does not 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.640
 has taken over honestly 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.290
 of this pathology in which 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.080
 find themselves involved in the boom 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 some of the some pathologies and not 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.510
 all as they said pillar and first the 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.620
 Senator Giuseppe 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.670
 is 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.850
 it's like who asks his father what 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.130
 take care 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.880
 here we ask the state that is our 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.610
 father to take care of the sick of 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.960
 cancer in chile 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.420
 there is technology 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.870
 there are resources 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.270
 there are drugs 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.750
 and let us allow some 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.630
 die with quality of life 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:39.040
 and others live because that opportunity 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.040
 it is always open
