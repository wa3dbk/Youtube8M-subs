00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
just a little section of it and then

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.290 
just a little section of it and then
start<00:01:57.830> French<00:01:58.100> braiding<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:58.940> you<00:01:59.030> don't<00:01:59.240> know

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.880 
start French braiding if you don't know
how<00:01:59.540> to<00:01:59.600> French<00:01:59.930> braid<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.230> just<00:02:00.500> are

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
how to French braid you just are

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.150 
how to French braid you just are
braiding<00:02:01.880> normally<00:02:02.510> but<00:02:02.900> then<00:02:03.050> each<00:02:03.350> time<00:02:03.740> you

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
braiding normally but then each time you

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.280 
braiding normally but then each time you
pick<00:02:04.400> up<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.670> new<00:02:04.850> piece<00:02:05.150> so<00:02:05.810> you're<00:02:05.960> adding

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
pick up a new piece so you're adding

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.139 
pick up a new piece so you're adding
more<00:02:06.440> pieces<00:02:06.680> into<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.220> braid<00:02:07.520> each<00:02:07.790> time

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
more pieces into the braid each time

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.840 
more pieces into the braid each time
it's<00:02:08.780> hard<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.140> explain<00:02:09.440> just<00:02:10.280> myself<00:02:10.520> because

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
it's hard to explain just myself because

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.670 
it's hard to explain just myself because
I'm<00:02:10.970> not<00:02:11.120> very<00:02:11.360> good<00:02:11.480> at<00:02:11.690> it<00:02:11.990> I<00:02:12.020> can't<00:02:12.440> really

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
I'm not very good at it I can't really

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.940 
I'm not very good at it I can't really
explain<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.640> perfectly<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.800> look

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
explain to it perfectly so you can look

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.190 
explain to it perfectly so you can look

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.590 
pull it over grab another piece and then
you<00:02:27.830> know<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.220> watch<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:28.850> easier<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.390> watch

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
you know just watch it's easier to watch

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.210 
you know just watch it's easier to watch
then<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.320> me<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.560> walk<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.830> through<00:02:31.130> it

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
then for me to walk you through it

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.410 
then for me to walk you through it
because<00:02:31.280> I<00:02:31.459> have<00:02:31.610> no<00:02:31.970> idea<00:02:32.270> what<00:02:32.480> I'm<00:02:32.600> saying

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.790 

so<00:02:38.420> once<00:02:38.630> you're<00:02:38.780> done<00:02:38.810> braiding<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.440> all<00:02:39.590> back

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
so once you're done braiding it all back

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.010 
so once you're done braiding it all back
I<00:02:40.040> didn't<00:02:40.280> take<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.400> tiny<00:02:40.820> little<00:02:41.210> rubber<00:02:41.690> band

I<00:04:01.349> actually<00:04:01.919> teased<00:04:02.459> it<00:04:02.699> so<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.359> can<00:04:03.599> use<00:04:03.629> a

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
I actually teased it so you can use a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.500 
I actually teased it so you can use a
lot<00:04:04.079> less<00:04:04.109> hair<00:04:04.530> than<00:04:04.560> this<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.969> just<00:04:06.000> took

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
very dirty because it needs something to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.810
