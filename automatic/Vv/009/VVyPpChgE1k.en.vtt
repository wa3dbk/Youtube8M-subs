00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:11.619
 with these heats that you have done here in 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.920
 I have been drinking a lot of water from 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.939
 coconut but what to do with the meat of 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.279
 coconut 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:21.070
 these are sweet coconuts from thailand 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.270
 so not to waste the meat 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.730
 Well, since you take it out with a spoon 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.790
 you can clean it and then you can 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.090
 make milk or you can make coconut cream 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:36.030
 as dessert as breakfast this is going to be 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 a custard or coconut cream and what 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.320
 we are going to need is well phase the coconut and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.340
 we are going to need a sweetener that are 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 the dates 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.330
 if you do not have dates because there are countries 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.300
 they write to me that they do not know them 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.850
 you can use other things that are 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.000
 sweeteners this nothing else is a fruit 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.540
 sweet and as always always make sure 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.199
 that you're not going to grind the bone I'm going to use 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:07.590
 about 4 dates but if you want more 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.960
 sweet then you put more truth 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.500

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.420

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.259
 meat of 4 coconuts 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:23.189
 you can use about 3 coconuts nothing else I'm going to 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.560
 use that and I will also use so much 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.560
 almond milk that you prepare 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.310
 and a splash of vanilla to give you more 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.750
