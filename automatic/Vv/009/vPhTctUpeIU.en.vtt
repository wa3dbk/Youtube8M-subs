rig here and I'm going to show you today

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.229 
rig here and I'm going to show you today
how<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:26.160> hook<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:26.579> a<00:00:26.669> GPS<00:00:27.090> unit<00:00:27.329> because<00:00:27.779> these

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
how you hook up a GPS unit because these

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.999 
how you hook up a GPS unit because these
these<00:00:30.239> units<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.720> not<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:31.290> GPS<00:00:31.710> so

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
these units do not come with the GPS so

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
these units do not come with the GPS so
I<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.340> added<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.000> we're<00:00:33.239> gonna<00:00:33.329> take<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
I have added one and we're gonna take a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.000 
I have added one and we're gonna take a
look<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.110> how<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> works<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> GPS<00:00:37.560> unit

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
look at how that works so the GPS unit

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.430 
look at how that works so the GPS unit
that<00:00:38.130> I'm<00:00:38.310> using<00:00:38.490> is<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.730> Garmin<00:00:39.180> 18x

rs-232 serial plug on the end of it and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.000 
rs-232 serial plug on the end of it and
you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.600> mount<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.079> outside<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.740> does<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you can mount this outside it does have

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.760 
you can mount this outside it does have
a<00:00:50.070> magnetic<00:00:50.550> base<00:00:50.760> but<00:00:51.270> I've<00:00:52.230> just<00:00:52.290> got<00:00:52.470> mine

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
a magnetic base but I've just got mine

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.340 
a magnetic base but I've just got mine
sitting<00:00:53.130> here<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> corner<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
sitting here in the corner of the the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
sitting here in the corner of the the
dashboard<00:00:56.130> here<00:00:56.930> not<00:00:57.930> much<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.380> it<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.680> this

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
dashboard here not much to it here this

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.190 
dashboard here not much to it here this
is<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.700> magnetic<00:01:00.150> base<00:01:00.329> but<00:01:00.750> I've<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.900> got<00:01:01.110> it

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
is a magnetic base but I've just got it

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.840 
is a magnetic base but I've just got it
sitting<00:01:01.530> here<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.070> seems<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.610> stay

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
sitting here in it it seems to stay

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.999 
sitting here in it it seems to stay
there<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.960> let's<00:01:04.229> take<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> look<00:01:04.649> at<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> other

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
there so let's take a look at the other

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.770 
there so let's take a look at the other
end<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.030> other<00:01:09.180> end<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:09.630> we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
end of it so on the other end here we

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.980 
end of it so on the other end here we
have<00:01:10.520> your<00:01:11.520> standard<00:01:11.970> cigarette<00:01:12.240> 12<00:01:12.750> volt

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
have your standard cigarette 12 volt

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.660 
have your standard cigarette 12 volt
adapter<00:01:14.090> plug<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.570> then<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.290> your

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
adapter plug and then you have your

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.500 
adapter plug and then you have your
female<00:01:17.670> 9<00:01:18.210> pin<00:01:18.620> rs-232<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> I've<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
female 9 pin rs-232 and I've got a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.340 
female 9 pin rs-232 and I've got a
little<00:01:22.350> bit<00:01:22.560> different<00:01:22.950> set<00:01:23.220> up<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.350> have

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
little bit different set up here I have

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.190 
little bit different set up here I have
an<00:01:25.530> actual<00:01:25.860> GPS<00:01:26.700> well<00:01:27.240> it's<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> serial<00:01:27.810> cable

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
an actual GPS well it's a serial cable

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.610 
an actual GPS well it's a serial cable
splitter<00:01:28.940> that<00:01:29.940> I<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.630> split<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.049> GPS

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
splitter that I can split this GPS

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.160 
splitter that I can split this GPS
signal<00:01:32.040> so<00:01:32.909> it'll<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> another<00:01:33.960> radio

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
signal so it'll go to another radio

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
signal so it'll go to another radio
which<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.799> my<00:01:34.950> case<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.580> Kenwood<00:01:35.940> d7a

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
which in my case is the Kenwood d7a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.280 
which in my case is the Kenwood d7a
which<00:01:38.190> does<00:01:38.430> APRs<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.659> don't<00:01:39.900> have<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.140> buy<00:01:40.260> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
which does APRs so I don't have to buy a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.250 
which does APRs so I don't have to buy a
separate<00:01:40.830> GPS<00:01:41.340> unit<00:01:41.670> which<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.020> pretty<00:01:43.020> neat

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
separate GPS unit which is pretty neat

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.039 
separate GPS unit which is pretty neat
here<00:01:43.549> but<00:01:44.549> anyway<00:01:45.060> I've<00:01:45.299> got<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.600> plugged<00:01:45.720> into

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
here but anyway I've got it plugged into

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.300 
here but anyway I've got it plugged into
a<00:01:46.790> null<00:01:47.790> modem<00:01:48.000> adapter<00:01:48.770> which<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.010> splits

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
a null modem adapter which then splits

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.359 
a null modem adapter which then splits
into<00:01:51.140> my<00:01:52.140> two<00:01:52.200> radios<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.650> works<00:01:55.830> really

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
into my two radios so that works really

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
into my two radios so that works really
well<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.400> radio<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.790> get<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.390> GPS<00:02:00.930> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
well so on the radio to get the GPS to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
well so on the radio to get the GPS to
work<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.470> least<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> icon<00:02:02.220> 880<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:03.299> need

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
work at least on the icon 880 you need

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.010 
work at least on the icon 880 you need
to<00:02:03.600> change<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:05.369> port<00:02:05.670> speed<00:02:05.930> defaults<00:02:06.930> to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
to change the the port speed defaults to

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
to change the the port speed defaults to
9600<00:02:07.619> baud<00:02:07.979> but<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.549> need<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> drop<00:02:08.939> it<00:02:09.000> down

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
9600 baud but you need to drop it down

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.649 
9600 baud but you need to drop it down
to<00:02:09.299> 48<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:09.989> this<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.140> something<00:02:10.500> that<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:12.540> all

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
to 48 and this is something that and all

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.450 
to 48 and this is something that and all
the<00:02:14.359> tutorials<00:02:15.359> I<00:02:15.480> found<00:02:15.749> online<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.560> wasn't

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
the tutorials I found online it wasn't

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.070 
the tutorials I found online it wasn't
very<00:02:17.640> clear<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.150> how<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.570> change<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.880> so<00:02:21.080> what

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
very clear on how to change this so what
