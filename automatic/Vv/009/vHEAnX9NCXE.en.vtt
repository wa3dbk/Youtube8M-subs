00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
I'm going to find the center of some

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.920 
I'm going to find the center of some
accuse<00:00:22.980> doesn't<00:00:23.640> calipers<00:00:24.090> your<00:00:24.810> the

accuse doesn't calipers your the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.410 
accuse doesn't calipers your the
calipers<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.609> get<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> center<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.330> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
calipers to get the center of what you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.720 
calipers to get the center of what you
want<00:00:29.789> another<00:00:30.029> place<00:00:32.059> then<00:00:34.700> you<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
want another place then you can

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.350 
want another place then you can
score<00:00:36.180> remark

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:48.280 

when<00:00:41.360> you<00:00:41.420> need<00:00:41.539> it<00:00:46.809> screw<00:00:47.809> it<00:00:47.960> up<00:00:47.989> from<00:00:48.199> the

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
when you need it screw it up from the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.160 
when you need it screw it up from the
bottom<00:00:48.440> where<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:49.550> want<00:00:49.730> your<00:00:50.170> starting

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
bottom where you want your starting

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.040 
bottom where you want your starting
point<00:00:54.250> I've<00:00:55.250> got<00:00:55.399> some<00:00:55.610> oil<00:00:56.540> here<00:00:56.899> as<00:00:57.019> a

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
point I've got some oil here as a

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.960 
point I've got some oil here as a
cutting<00:00:57.409> fluid<00:00:57.649> as<00:00:58.129> we<00:00:58.519> want<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.729> keep<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
cutting fluid as we want to keep the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:07.749 
cutting fluid as we want to keep the
drill<00:00:59.589> nice<00:01:00.589> and<00:01:00.769> cool<00:01:00.949> as<00:01:01.250> we<00:01:01.460> go<00:01:06.520> so<00:01:07.520> we<00:01:07.610> get

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
drill nice and cool as we go so we get

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:18.399 
drill nice and cool as we go so we get
in<00:01:07.880> an<00:01:07.970> air<00:01:08.119> spot

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:32.550 

and<00:01:18.950> slowly<00:01:19.310> go

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.420 

let's<00:01:33.560> take<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.770> break<00:01:34.000> all<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.150> time<00:01:35.360> to<00:01:35.570> let

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
let's take a break all the time to let

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.120 
let's take a break all the time to let
the<00:01:37.430> drill<00:01:37.670> bit<00:01:37.820> cool<00:01:38.000> down<00:01:39.010> when<00:01:40.010> you're

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
the drill bit cool down when you're

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.340 
the drill bit cool down when you're
drilling<00:01:40.280> you<00:01:40.520> want<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.790> see<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.300> little<00:01:42.080> bit<00:01:42.230> of

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
drilling you want to see a little bit of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.170 
drilling you want to see a little bit of
stainless<00:01:42.590> start<00:01:43.010> to<00:01:43.130> come<00:01:43.310> off<00:01:43.460> if<00:01:43.940> you're

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
stainless start to come off if you're

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.650 
stainless start to come off if you're
drilling<00:01:44.390> and<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.110> don't<00:01:45.290> see<00:01:45.500> any<00:01:46.660> shavings

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
drilling and you don't see any shavings

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.540 
drilling and you don't see any shavings
start<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.080> come<00:01:48.230> off<00:01:48.410> then<00:01:49.190> you're<00:01:49.400> drilling

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
start to come off then you're drilling

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.490 
start to come off then you're drilling
too<00:01:49.820> fast<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.420> all<00:01:50.840> you're<00:01:50.990> doing<00:01:51.290> is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
too fast and all you're doing is

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.770 
too fast and all you're doing is
hardening<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.760> steel<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> it's<00:01:53.570> going<00:01:53.720> to

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
hardening up the steel and it's going to

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.210 
hardening up the steel and it's going to
be<00:01:53.870> really<00:01:54.050> hard<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:54.380> drill<00:01:54.650> through<00:01:54.830> so<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
be really hard to drill through so you

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.890 
be really hard to drill through so you
want<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.520> go<00:01:55.580> slow<00:01:55.640> you<00:01:56.360> want<00:01:56.510> to<00:01:56.570> have<00:01:56.660> a<00:01:56.720> high

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
want to go slow you want to have a high

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.370 
want to go slow you want to have a high
torque<00:01:57.760> and<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:59.060> lot<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.270> pressure<00:01:59.570> in<00:01:59.810> there<00:02:00.050> to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
torque and a lot of pressure in there to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.770 
torque and a lot of pressure in there to
try<00:02:00.620> and<00:02:00.740> get<00:02:00.860> through<00:02:01.010> that<00:02:01.070> drill<00:02:01.570> to<00:02:02.570> try

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
try and get through that drill to try

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.860 
try and get through that drill to try
and<00:02:02.900> get<00:02:03.470> rid<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.680> stainless<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:05.090> it's<00:02:05.840> a

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
and get rid of stainless so it's a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.240 
and get rid of stainless so it's a
little<00:02:06.080> hole<00:02:07.630> little<00:02:08.630> tiny<00:02:08.899> hole<00:02:09.100> once<00:02:10.100> that

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
little hole little tiny hole once that

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.680 
little hole little tiny hole once that
little<00:02:10.369> holes<00:02:10.580> poked<00:02:10.850> through<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.450> step

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
little holes poked through the step

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:23.550 
little holes poked through the step
drill<00:02:11.870> will<00:02:12.110> quickly<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:14.120> through<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.420> rest

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.460 

so<00:02:24.560> there's<00:02:24.740> the<00:02:24.800> first<00:02:24.950> hole<00:02:26.140> now<00:02:27.140> normally

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
so there's the first hole now normally

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.520 
so there's the first hole now normally
what<00:02:27.590> I<00:02:27.650> do<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:29.420> very<00:02:29.630> step<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> step

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
what I do with very step of the step

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.490 
what I do with very step of the step
drill<00:02:30.770> I<00:02:30.980> stop<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.390> let<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.570> just<00:02:33.260> have<00:02:33.440> a

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
drill I stop and I let it just have a

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.310 
drill I stop and I let it just have a
little<00:02:33.620> rest<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.070> little<00:02:34.280> cooldown<00:02:34.580> so<00:02:35.320> this

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
little rest and little cooldown so this

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.280 
little rest and little cooldown so this
hole<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:37.430> going<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.270> be<00:02:38.390> for<00:02:38.660> my<00:02:39.190> psych<00:02:40.190> class

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
hole is going to be for my psych class

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.010 
hole is going to be for my psych class
which<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.590> be<00:02:42.680> sitting<00:02:42.830> in<00:02:42.950> there<00:02:44.020> so

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
which is going to be sitting in there so

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.390 
which is going to be sitting in there so
I've<00:02:45.260> got<00:02:45.470> all<00:02:47.739> that<00:02:48.739> put<00:02:48.950> some<00:02:49.100> pieces<00:02:49.280> and
