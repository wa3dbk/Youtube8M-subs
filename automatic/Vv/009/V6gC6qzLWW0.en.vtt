actually start like the boss has not

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
actually start like the boss has not
become<00:00:23.670> active<00:00:24.119> until<00:00:24.359> you<00:00:24.480> cross<00:00:24.689> past<00:00:25.260> this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
become active until you cross past this

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.099 
become active until you cross past this
door<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.640> best<00:00:26.849> thing<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.660> kill<00:00:27.960> off

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
door so the best thing to do is kill off

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.470 
door so the best thing to do is kill off
these<00:00:28.349> ads<00:00:28.650> before<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.609> cross<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.880> door<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
these ads before you cross the door and

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.089 
these ads before you cross the door and
if<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.230> do<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.650> making<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
if you can do that you're making it a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.069 
if you can do that you're making it a
lot<00:00:32.279> easier<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.940> second<00:00:33.270> way<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.420> start<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> as

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
lot easier the second way to start it as

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.810 
lot easier the second way to start it as
well<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:34.800> shoot<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> boss<00:00:35.370> from<00:00:35.610> here

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
well as if you shoot the boss from here

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.979 
well as if you shoot the boss from here
so<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.090> shoot<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> boss<00:00:36.510> from<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.870> he

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so if you shoot the boss from here he

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.750 
so if you shoot the boss from here he
will<00:00:37.079> become<00:00:37.380> active<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.309> can<00:00:38.430> see<00:00:38.579> while

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
will become active and you can see while

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.250 
will become active and you can see while

in mind that when we shoot one of these

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.140 
in mind that when we shoot one of these
bosses<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> face<00:01:19.380> area<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:20.549> does<00:01:20.820> stun

bosses in the face area it does stun

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.789 
bosses in the face area it does stun
them<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> takes<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:21.990> gives<00:01:22.229> them<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> ton<00:01:22.740> of

damage that it does and it stuns them so

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
damage that it does and it stuns them so
the<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.560> difference<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.369> mob<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
the only difference about this mob to

the only difference about this mob to
the<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:27.000> mobs<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.600> they've<00:01:27.750> shrunk

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the other mobs is that they've shrunk

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.130 
the other mobs is that they've shrunk
the<00:01:28.619> stun<00:01:29.340> area<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.689> if<00:01:31.020> you're

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the stun area so you can see if you're

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.330 
the stun area so you can see if you're
looking<00:01:31.350> at<00:01:31.380> his<00:01:31.530> face<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.159> see

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
looking at his face there you could see

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
looking at his face there you could see
the<00:01:32.460> glowing<00:01:32.759> orange<00:01:33.210> eyes<00:01:33.479> that's<00:01:34.140> actually

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the glowing orange eyes that's actually

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.870 
the glowing orange eyes that's actually
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> stun<00:01:35.250> area<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.790> you

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
going to be the stun area there so you

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
going to be the stun area there so you
have<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.180> hit<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.630> stun<00:01:36.840> him<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.079> then

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
have to hit that to stun him and then

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.719 
have to hit that to stun him and then
reset<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.799> it's<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.250> bit<00:01:38.369> tricky<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
reset and it's a little bit tricky to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.210 
reset and it's a little bit tricky to
reset<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.420> he<00:01:40.140> jumps<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:40.799> quite<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> bit

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
reset because he jumps back quite a bit

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.530 
reset because he jumps back quite a bit
when<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.000> doesn't<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.360> back<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
when you do and he doesn't go back to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.810 
when you do and he doesn't go back to
the<00:01:42.750> exact<00:01:43.079> same<00:01:43.290> spot<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.460> ran<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the exact same spot so because I ran it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.850 
the exact same spot so because I ran it
a<00:01:44.909> sniper<00:01:45.210> rounds<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:46.049> chamber<00:01:46.680> there

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
