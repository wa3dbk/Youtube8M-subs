00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
is the difference between hypertrophic

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.130 
is the difference between hypertrophic
scars<00:00:16.049> think<00:00:17.009> I'm<00:00:17.099> saying<00:00:17.279> that<00:00:17.400> right<00:00:17.520> and

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
scars think I'm saying that right and

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.400 
scars think I'm saying that right and
keloids<00:00:19.759> hypertrophic<00:00:20.759> scars<00:00:21.210> are<00:00:21.599> just

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
keloids hypertrophic scars are just

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.389 
keloids hypertrophic scars are just
trauma<00:00:22.980> scarring<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.599> can<00:00:24.809> go<00:00:24.930> away

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:25.399 
trauma scarring and they can go away

00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:27.889 
trauma scarring and they can go away
like<00:00:26.399> depending<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:26.969> a<00:00:27.029> couple<00:00:27.270> days<00:00:27.419> couple

but um biggest way to get rid of

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.340 
but um biggest way to get rid of
hypertrophic<00:01:28.830> scars<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.640> um<00:01:30.509> tea<00:01:30.930> tree<00:01:31.170> oil

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
hypertrophic scars is um tea tree oil

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.180 
hypertrophic scars is um tea tree oil
and<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:33.920> Walgreens<00:01:34.920> for

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
cartilage and stuff so that's a big

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.090 
cartilage and stuff so that's a big
problem<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.660> there's<00:02:24.660> really<00:02:24.930> no<00:02:25.260> cure<00:02:25.800> for

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
problem and there's really no cure for

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
problem and there's really no cure for
keloids<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:27.150> can't<00:02:27.420> really<00:02:27.570> get<00:02:27.750> rid<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:27.990> them

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
keloids you can't really get rid of them

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.370 
keloids you can't really get rid of them
so<00:02:29.040> when<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.150> your<00:02:30.270> piercer<00:02:30.750> make<00:02:31.110> sure

that the bump hurts you know if it
doesn't<00:02:36.420> hurt<00:02:36.570> then<00:02:36.870> you've<00:02:37.050> got<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> serious

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
doesn't hurt then you've got a serious

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.030
