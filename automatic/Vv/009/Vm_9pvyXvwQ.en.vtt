enough<00:01:40.920> doesn't<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.320> little

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
enough doesn't it so this is my little

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
enough doesn't it so this is my little
map<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.479> say<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:46.530> relatively<00:01:47.130> big<00:01:47.899> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
map I say little it's relatively big and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.109 
map I say little it's relatively big and
we're<00:01:49.020> not<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.229> walk<00:01:49.350> across<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.939> but<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.030> aim

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
we're not to walk across it but the aim

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.210 
we're not to walk across it but the aim
in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> game<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.619> say<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.950> pick<00:01:53.100> things

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
in the game like I say is to pick things

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.800 
in the game like I say is to pick things
up<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.640> place<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.600> they're<00:01:54.689> down

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
up in one place but they're down

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
up in one place but they're down
somewhere<00:01:55.320> else<00:01:55.500> each<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.369> these<00:01:56.460> little

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
somewhere else each of these little

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
somewhere else each of these little
names<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.180> towns<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.899> that's<00:01:58.200> dad<00:01:58.560> Church

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
names of towns so that's dad Church

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
names of towns so that's dad Church
that's<00:01:59.610> nan<00:02:00.060> Shaw<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:01.229> Barbara<00:02:02.869> strange

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that's nan Shaw that's Barbara strange

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.590 
that's nan Shaw that's Barbara strange
names<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:05.520> get<00:02:05.670> towns<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.090> could<00:02:06.329> pick<00:02:06.540> up

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
names you get towns we could pick up

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
names you get towns we could pick up
people<00:02:07.140> when<00:02:07.350> mail<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.009> stuff<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.060> get

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
people when mail and stuff and you get

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
people when mail and stuff and you get
these<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.619> industries<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
these little industries so this is a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.730 
these little industries so this is a
farm<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.670> example<00:02:12.060> dad<00:02:12.270> Church<00:02:12.629> farm<00:02:13.020> there

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
farm for example dad Church farm there

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.700 
farm for example dad Church farm there
lumbermill<00:02:15.110> what<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.170> go<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.350> do<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:16.590> these

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
lumbermill what you go to do with these

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.410 
lumbermill what you go to do with these
places<00:02:16.980> you've<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:17.970> pick<00:02:18.090> up<00:02:18.150> resources

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
places you've got to pick up resources

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.810 
places you've got to pick up resources
from<00:02:19.380> one<00:02:19.890> place<00:02:20.160> and<00:02:20.190> put<00:02:20.460> them<00:02:20.670> down

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
from one place and put them down

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.910 
from one place and put them down
somewhere<00:02:21.210> else<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.410> example<00:02:22.710> with<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
somewhere else so for example with the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.710 
somewhere else so for example with the
Solman<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.340> i<00:02:23.430> pick<00:02:23.550> up<00:02:23.700> wood<00:02:23.880> from<00:02:24.240> a<00:02:24.360> forest

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
Solman if i pick up wood from a forest

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.060 
Solman if i pick up wood from a forest
and<00:02:24.960> bring<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.320> to<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.530> sawmill<00:02:25.680> i'll<00:02:25.950> get

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
and bring it to the sawmill i'll get

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.770 
and bring it to the sawmill i'll get
some<00:02:26.220> money<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.730> that'll<00:02:27.270> create<00:02:27.420> goods

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
some money and that'll create goods

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.510 
some money and that'll create goods
which<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.110> can<00:02:28.260> say<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> other<00:02:28.830> places<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.370> make

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
which I can say to other places to make

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.510 
which I can say to other places to make
a<00:02:29.550> bit<00:02:29.730> more<00:02:29.910> money<00:02:30.060> right<00:02:31.010> best<00:02:32.010> way<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.220> sort

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
a bit more money right best way to sort

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.220 
a bit more money right best way to sort
of<00:02:32.550> explain<00:02:32.850> I<00:02:32.910> thing<00:02:33.210> is<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.450> get<00:02:33.540> stuck<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.050> I

of explain I thing is to get stuck in I

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.200 
of explain I thing is to get stuck in I

start with something simple let's go

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.890 
start with something simple let's go
over<00:02:36.300> here<00:02:36.450> shall<00:02:36.660> we

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
over here shall we

gonna change the name of this place just

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280 
gonna change the name of this place just
because<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.020> like<00:02:43.200> first<00:02:43.560> saying<00:02:43.800> things<00:02:44.580> like

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
because I like first saying things like

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.540 
because I like first saying things like
splob<00:02:46.290> there<00:02:47.160> we<00:02:47.250> go

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
splob there we go

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:55.430 
splob there we go
so<00:02:48.210> we<00:02:48.300> got<00:02:48.420> splob<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.710> we've<00:02:49.980> got<00:02:53.810> plot<00:02:54.810> there

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
so we got splob and we've got plot there

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
so we got splob and we've got plot there
we<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:56.270> Capitals<00:02:57.270> there<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:57.960> go

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
we go Capitals there we go

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.390 
we go Capitals there we go
just<00:02:59.460> cuz<00:02:59.610> pop<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:00.060> plop<00:03:00.300> sound<00:03:00.600> better<00:03:00.750> I

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
just cuz pop and plop sound better I

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.770 
just cuz pop and plop sound better I
think<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.970> here<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.540> go

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
think so here we go

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.530 
think so here we go
this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.020> splob<00:03:04.290> that's<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> population<00:03:05.540> 1012

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this is splob that's the population 1012

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.040 
this is splob that's the population 1012
this<00:03:06.990> is<00:03:07.170> plat<00:03:07.410> 417<00:03:08.280> people<00:03:08.870> first<00:03:09.870> thing

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
this is plat 417 people first thing

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.390 
this is plat 417 people first thing
we're<00:03:10.170> gonna<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.500> create<00:03:10.770> a<00:03:10.920> small<00:03:11.130> bus

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
we're gonna do is create a small bus

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.310 
we're gonna do is create a small bus
route<00:03:11.640> so<00:03:12.330> we're<00:03:12.450> gonna<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.720> few<00:03:12.900> bus<00:03:13.080> stops

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
route so we're gonna get a few bus stops

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.050 
route so we're gonna get a few bus stops
here<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.530> few<00:03:13.650> bus<00:03:13.890> stops<00:03:14.130> over<00:03:14.340> here<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:14.940> we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
here a few bus stops over here and we

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.700 
here a few bus stops over here and we
just<00:03:15.090> no<00:03:15.270> transport<00:03:15.840> passengers<00:03:16.050> over<00:03:16.440> cuz

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
just no transport passengers over cuz

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.920 
just no transport passengers over cuz
that's<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> whole<00:03:17.100> point<00:03:17.310> right<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.720> way<00:03:18.810> we

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
that's the whole point right the way we

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.920 
that's the whole point right the way we
do<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.170> is<00:03:20.030> firstly<00:03:21.030> we'll<00:03:21.270> probably<00:03:21.540> need<00:03:21.870> a

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
do that is firstly we'll probably need a

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.730 
do that is firstly we'll probably need a
road<00:03:22.260> connecting<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.950> two<00:03:23.070> places<00:03:23.540> which<00:03:24.540> is

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
road connecting the two places which is

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.760 
road connecting the two places which is
else<00:03:25.740> the<00:03:26.640> buses<00:03:26.970> are<00:03:27.120> going<00:03:27.360> to<00:03:27.540> struggle<00:03:28.410> put

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
else the buses are going to struggle put

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.860 
else the buses are going to struggle put
it<00:03:28.830> in<00:03:28.890> that<00:03:28.980> way<00:03:29.160> so<00:03:29.850> easily<00:03:30.270> enough<00:03:30.600> we<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
it in that way so easily enough we just

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.850 
it in that way so easily enough we just
connect<00:03:31.110> them<00:03:31.200> with<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.350> little<00:03:31.440> bit<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.680> Road

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
connect them with a little bit of Road
