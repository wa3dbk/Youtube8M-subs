00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.600
 unfortunately he has seen more and more summer 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 this wonderful header from Mario Gomez 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.479
 especially in Germany 

00:00:09.479 --> 00:00:11.519
 first time redeemed 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.169
 It is simply important in a winter term 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.150
 to go to sleep first, guide 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 and to win a race then much easier Mario Matthes 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 is the man who was so unhappy at the last European elections 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.789
 who looked 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.670
 Armstrongs at approx 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.040
 in the wake of the euro did not really come into action 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.040
 at Dr German national team 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.580
 and that goes on 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.270
 that is completely surprising and Helmes for Klose and now comes their money 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.270
 from Jan are 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.470
 she did not bring anything 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.130
 when has seen 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.860
 Australia he had twisted committed 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.630
 what makes a discount of 1 4 so presents itself during Sven Smeets 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.560
 ULZ 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.900
 the rectory 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.020
 a situation where you have to do much more 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 their seat in Seattle is of course special responsibility here 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 also the game to deny the German national team in his 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.580
 Older 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.580
 then you have to do it a lot even after that he annoys you anyway 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.300
 the situation in Japan is not 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.390
 rash 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.390
 from little Mesut Ozil 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.330
 the Australians 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.050
 you are 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.070
 certainly not particularly happy with the group again 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.360
 She was able to make plans because of her performance in the last World Cup 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.170
 offers a lot 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.970
 Doris Trachsel but now they have their doors 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.970
 in front of your nose in Germany are going to year by year 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.540
 that's all a bit scary though 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.500
 we have their struggle and willpower 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.680
 is much possible one on this game is still not over 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.830
 they're just playing around in their own half right now 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.259
 and now already 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.479
 the romance 1 percent they are in bright red 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:14.849
 we should now we have to move forward 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.849
 that Jan o the finding is my right 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.230
 Therefore, the finalists of the perpetrator but because the right lanes moves with 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.709
 19 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.709
 because there is 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.109
 Tauss he won in a row 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.799
 who leaked 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.799
 and then are 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.249
 What does this questionable actually could the German defense since long 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.509
 enough 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.309
 until 10 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.309
 comes the former striker before McDonald's 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:55.799
 Dr at the white ring 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.669
 A little bit Celtic confused the secret program 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.649
 that's good 

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:03.199
 he bites regulators 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.369
 previously set 

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:08.519
 and he made the weekly sheet serve the completely separate that seems 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:09.719
 no one else 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:11.709
 That may not be true 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.279
 Jade's Edition is in such a guesthouse from 4ing 

00:03:14.279 --> 00:03:17.019
 Who is the Achilles heel of the German game? 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.389
 and now it is 1 1 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:21.659
 6 and 6 minutes are played 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.399
 and nothing has come of it for Germany 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.189
 not only regarding 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.079
 because there is a draw so persist 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.199
 You can not be satisfied with a point against Australia 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.049
 Germany must now experience 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.229
 she wants here 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:37.799
 Place Dr 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.249
 Do not get Mesut ozil r macht has a weak game 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.959
 lead the way 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.009
 Read more to bring it into dealership 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.649
 there is even a goal for Germany Darfeld 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:51.659
 brings 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:54.719
 Unfortunately, RenÃ© Adler had his first goal 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.489
 at this World Cup 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.459
 Super barely opportunity to excel but once as a lecturer 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.189
 to deliver for it 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.689
 We saw two header goals like Goldman Sachs in the second half 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.539
 told 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.029
 somehow 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.859
 Offensively dangerous emerged 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:15.319
 Marcell Jansen my goodness 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.370
 he does not win the ball under control the very big art 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.280
 Michael Ballack could not have been seen yet, we even go 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.529
 He exchanged praise but not so good at all 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.180
 the pressure on the corporation 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.180
 in the game 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.309
 Germany 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:35.350
 what now 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.350
 the Wilkes to the front something to irritate 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.090
 but she 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.090
 are abandoned there on the outline 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.990
 the Australians are naturally satisfied with these one to one 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.499
 Walters 

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.499
 what is that please what is that would see 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.779
 It took a long time to think about when he plays the flank and the pass and then 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:58.669
 he has 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.129
 forgot that the game was going on at the goal line village then we do 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.129
 but it is finished 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:07.559
 only eleven minutes 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.360
 from s 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.430
 he would have to be me now but be relatively firm 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.779
 Single 1 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:16.889
 This is 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.999
 so far a bitter disappointment 

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.270
 Plenty of the videos or bags you get 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:25.550
 Argentina has lost so far 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.550
 Engern and decided Germany 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.430
 at the moment 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.430
 Draw 1 1 is nice 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.039
 and now over the outside 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.620
 is there somehow a bit Reuters reported that must go forward now 

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:43.059
 that's only six minutes left 

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.620
 and with that disappeared 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.819
 play one-on-one here as if they were relaxed 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:51.120
 3 0 lead or so 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.860
 that the Australian Erfurt express the trend color for dangerous 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.510
 Attacks by Blomus had and especially for the 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.779
 facing the defender too 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.020
 And even that's not a problem for the Australians at all 

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:04.849
 something made by Leicester 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.210
 Google is 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.210
 Some things need to change 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.379
 this does not look like it's going to happen 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.509
 and around 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.779
 he will do in the second half 

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:21.719
 is not really changed is the Australian about Emma children they come 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:22.360
 back 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.409
 NRZ at the Theater Basel 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:27.789
 what is that because you just have to reference him and my kindness 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.400
 most basic on the basis of this world 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.949
 as last year 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.229
 somehow in a merry afternoon the F-youth rose 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:36.939
 that can be normal 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.499
 and still such a loss of Mertesacker's canal works 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.080
 the area next to it is a long way off 

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:48.800
 is that again Bayern ends completely right I would say with one to one 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.949
 the Australians 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.169
 They have them giving them until Tuesday 10 

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:58.799
 that can not show that there is a future and that is not yet 

00:06:58.799 --> 00:06:59.639
 for sure 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.210
 nothing at all 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:05.710
 This victory is the situation is very disappointing because the whole one too 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.610
 one Bochum here 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.429
 they are disappointed Ostend
