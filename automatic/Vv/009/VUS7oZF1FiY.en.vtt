00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 to be well equipped follow the tests 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.299
 of your favorite gear with free yesterday at 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.919
 attitudes points like what he 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.919
 it's surf sports on the internet 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.299
 for the interests he tested for 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.509
 you the top twin crisis 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.960
 from burton in pvc will also be in 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.430
 complete what will not want the recalls 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.560
 so here's really reconciling with 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.869
 their leaves but because these two 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.759
 past years we tended where he 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.230
 snow a bit hard missed a bit of across 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:33.940
 of helaba that's true it's can 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.800
 to be excluded we have a band that is hyper 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.540
 catchy and we have the coup 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.500
 benefits of the paicv that blocks everything for 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.949
 play very good weather very nice 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.730
 the idea is a real toy what to orient 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.980
 presta there are people who want here 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.230
 pretty dynamic board but with some 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.879
 tolerance anyway how does she get 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 reveals jacques rossi burton a very good 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.129
 show 8 where he will guide him 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.410
 and iv and so suddenly this morning 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.539
 time as classic so 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.090
 actually calls them pop that amber 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.009
 that is to say that we have as classic a 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.810
 little fixed ones and a flat part in 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.009
 spatula gave a door with 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.520
 a lot of rebounds all of you and 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.179
 dynamic 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.800
 hop hop and for sure the version that 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.920
 Roman plastic bourdin anyway a 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.810
 little more exclusive less player very 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.360
 performing 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.710
 so the finish with the stick on the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.720
 card that marks really well and 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.030
 really concrete still packed here he is 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.590
 that he approached branch sport not steals 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.270
 a hair 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.250
 and what about the field that that 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.299
 unfortunately we have no more sun 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.159
 did not prevail 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.469
 we do not have the very beautiful light but 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.899
 she is very pretty but here we have a mac 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:49.560
 see the reflection may be worth but 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.340
 as often it's pretty mask guy that 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.340
 it's true that with a cartel
