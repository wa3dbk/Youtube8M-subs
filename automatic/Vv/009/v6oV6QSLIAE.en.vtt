rarity for being too country and we also

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.840 
rarity for being too country and we also
know<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.409> Twilight<00:01:32.799> is<00:01:33.130> not<00:01:33.340> strictly

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850

herself in front of others so with all
this<00:01:37.689> in<00:01:37.840> mind<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:38.200> don't<00:01:38.259> think<00:01:38.590> Twilight's

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
this in mind I don't think Twilight's

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.100 
this in mind I don't think Twilight's
off<00:01:39.220> friendship<00:01:39.579> is<00:01:39.820> necessarily<00:01:40.360> being<00:01:40.780> bad

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
off friendship is necessarily being bad

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.109 
off friendship is necessarily being bad
but<00:01:41.380> rather<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:41.860> think<00:01:42.220> she<00:01:42.340> saw<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.549> process

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
but rather I think she saw the process

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:44.670 
but rather I think she saw the process
of<00:01:43.240> making<00:01:43.630> friends<00:01:43.869> as<00:01:44.170> being<00:01:44.409> full<00:01:44.649> of

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
of making friends as being full of

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.649 
of making friends as being full of
superficial<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.060> decided<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> was

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
superficial and decided it was

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.230 
superficial and decided it was
a<00:01:46.689> big<00:01:46.990> unnecessary<00:01:47.799> pain<00:01:48.070> in<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.280> ass<00:01:48.460> as<00:01:48.909> for

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
a big unnecessary pain in the ass as for

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.060 
a big unnecessary pain in the ass as for
the<00:01:49.299> slumber<00:01:49.509> party<00:01:49.869> itself<00:01:50.290> though<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.770> think

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
the slumber party itself though I think

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.319 
the slumber party itself though I think
it<00:01:51.159> has<00:01:51.340> more<00:01:51.520> to<00:01:51.579> do<00:01:51.790> with<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> fact<00:01:52.210> that

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
it has more to do with the fact that

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:53.730 
it has more to do with the fact that
there<00:01:52.479> are<00:01:52.570> certain<00:01:52.719> things<00:01:52.869> our<00:01:53.290> society

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
there are certain things our society

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.380 
there are certain things our society
hypes<00:01:53.979> up<00:01:54.219> to<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.460> point<00:01:54.610> that<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.939> sounds

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
hypes up to the point that it sounds

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.149 
hypes up to the point that it sounds
really<00:01:55.570> enticing<00:01:56.290> regardless<00:01:56.829> of<00:01:56.979> whether

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
really enticing regardless of whether

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.410 
really enticing regardless of whether
it's<00:01:57.399> something<00:01:57.579> you<00:01:57.789> would<00:01:57.880> actually<00:01:58.270> enjoy

review<00:02:34.600> of<00:02:34.660> best<00:02:34.870> night<00:02:35.110> ever<00:02:35.140> six<00:02:35.680> out<00:02:35.800> of<00:02:35.920> ten

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
review of best night ever six out of ten

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.560 
review of best night ever six out of ten
I<00:02:36.160> don't<00:02:36.460> even<00:02:36.550> know<00:02:36.700> I'm<00:02:37.180> doing<00:02:37.390> here

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
I don't even know I'm doing here

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.210 
I don't even know I'm doing here
but<00:02:37.750> getting<00:02:37.900> back<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.260> actual<00:02:38.710> episode<00:02:39.160> I

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
but getting back to the actual episode I

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
but getting back to the actual episode I
think<00:02:39.400> that's<00:02:39.700> why<00:02:39.880> it's<00:02:40.000> even<00:02:40.210> funnier<00:02:40.630> and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
think that's why it's even funnier and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.630 
think that's why it's even funnier and
also<00:02:41.230> more<00:02:41.380> understandable<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.310> Twilight

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
also more understandable that Twilight

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.520 
also more understandable that Twilight
has<00:02:42.850> all<00:02:43.000> these<00:02:43.120> expectations<00:02:43.570> for<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.170> slumber

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
has all these expectations for a slumber

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.870 
has all these expectations for a slumber
party<00:02:44.560> based<00:02:45.070> on<00:02:45.220> what<00:02:45.340> she<00:02:45.370> read<00:02:45.670> in<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.850> book

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
party based on what she read in a book

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.940 
party based on what she read in a book
so<00:02:46.570> they<00:02:46.870> go<00:02:47.020> through<00:02:47.230> all<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.470> motions

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
so they go through all the motions

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.370 
so they go through all the motions
giving<00:02:48.370> makeovers<00:02:48.850> eating<00:02:49.450> s'mores<00:02:49.870> telling
