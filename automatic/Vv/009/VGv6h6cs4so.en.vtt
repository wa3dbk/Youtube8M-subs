creaming creaming is where we're going

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.189 
creaming creaming is where we're going
to<00:00:20.490> take<00:00:20.730> some<00:00:21.000> butter<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.330> sugar<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.930> we're

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to take some butter and sugar and we're

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.359 
to take some butter and sugar and we're
going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.380> put<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.590> into<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.800> KitchenAid<00:00:23.220> mixer

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
going to put it into a KitchenAid mixer

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.279 
going to put it into a KitchenAid mixer
with<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> paddle<00:00:24.119> attachment<00:00:24.300> we're<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
with a paddle attachment we're going to

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.230 
with a paddle attachment we're going to
put<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.949> medium<00:00:26.189> speed<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> that

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
put it on to a medium speed and that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.490 
put it on to a medium speed and that
medium<00:00:27.539> speed<00:00:27.779> is<00:00:27.869> going<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.080> aerate<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
medium speed is going to aerate the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.620 
medium speed is going to aerate the
butter<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.830> sugar<00:00:28.980> now<00:00:29.550> once<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.269> find<00:00:30.510> that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
butter and sugar now once we find that

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.179 
butter and sugar now once we find that
the<00:00:30.810> sugar<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> butter<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.890> coming

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
the sugar and the butter is coming

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.979 
the sugar and the butter is coming
together<00:00:32.279> nicely<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:33.360> we<00:00:33.480> can<00:00:33.630> increase<00:00:33.960> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
together nicely then we can increase the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.049 
together nicely then we can increase the
speed<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:35.100> we're<00:00:35.250> looking<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
speed and what we're looking is for the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.880 
speed and what we're looking is for the
sugar<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.750> butter<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.260> start<00:00:37.559> kind<00:00:37.800> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

as<00:00:40.079> our<00:00:40.200> cream<00:00:40.440> mixture<00:00:40.770> you'll<00:00:41.190> notice<00:00:41.460> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
as our cream mixture you'll notice that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
as our cream mixture you'll notice that
the<00:00:41.790> color<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.300> lot<00:00:42.540> lighter<00:00:42.750> than<00:00:42.930> normal

the color is a lot lighter than normal
regular<00:00:43.860> unsalted<00:00:44.489> butter<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.390> we've<00:00:45.539> got

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
regular unsalted butter so we've got

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.270 
regular unsalted butter so we've got
something<00:00:45.989> that's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.230> pale<00:00:46.469> yellow<00:00:46.500> almost<00:00:47.190> a

you're<00:01:17.159> making<00:01:17.340> sure<00:01:17.729> also<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.810> fully

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
you're making sure also that it fully

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.690 
you're making sure also that it fully
incorporates<00:01:19.619> in<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.250> left<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.580> any

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.289 
go ahead and add in the milk the reason
why<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> add<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> milk<00:01:29.880> now<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
why we want to add the milk now is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
why we want to add the milk now is
because<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.960> chance<00:01:31.259> for<00:01:31.500> keeping

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
because we have a chance for keeping

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710 
because we have a chance for keeping
everything<00:01:32.100> nice<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.579> modernized<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
everything nice and modernized and not

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.210 
everything nice and modernized and not
getting<00:01:34.020> any<00:01:34.170> lumps<00:01:34.619> when<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:34.920> comes<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
getting any lumps when it comes to

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.800 
getting any lumps when it comes to
adding<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.640> our<00:01:35.759> flour<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> add

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
adding in our flour we're going to add

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.770 
adding in our flour we're going to add
in<00:01:36.990> our<00:01:37.079> bread<00:01:37.320> flour<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:39.479> make<00:01:39.630> sure

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
in our bread flour and then make sure

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.810 
in our bread flour and then make sure
that<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> turn<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.560> KitchenAid<00:01:41.100> back<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.610> too

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that you turn the KitchenAid back on too

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.270 
that you turn the KitchenAid back on too
low<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:43.140> might<00:01:43.320> need<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> pulse<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.070> from

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
low you might need to pulse this from

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.620 
low you might need to pulse this from
time<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> time<00:01:44.579> which<00:01:44.909> basically<00:01:45.329> means

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
time to time which basically means

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
time to time which basically means
turning<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.140> on<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.320> then<00:01:46.590> turning<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:46.950> right

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
turning it on and then turning it right

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
turning it on and then turning it right
back<00:01:47.280> off<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> make<00:01:48.600> sure<00:01:48.810> that

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
back off and that's to make sure that

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
back off and that's to make sure that
the<00:01:49.140> flower<00:01:49.320> doesn't<00:01:49.740> spray<00:01:49.979> up<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.340> air

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the flower doesn't spray up in the air

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
the flower doesn't spray up in the air
and<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.759> your<00:01:50.970> face<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.049> we<00:01:52.170> did

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and into your face just like we did

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.280 
and into your face just like we did
before<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.770> need<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> scrape<00:01:53.189> down<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.430> sides

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
before we need to scrape down the sides

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.149 
before we need to scrape down the sides
the<00:01:55.290> next<00:01:55.530> thing<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.680> we're<00:01:55.920> going<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
the next thing that we're going to

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
the next thing that we're going to
incorporate<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.939> there<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.689> pumpkin

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
incorporate in there is our pumpkin

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
incorporate in there is our pumpkin
puree<00:01:58.380> all<00:01:58.890> right<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.189> this<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.430> our<00:01:59.549> canned

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
puree all right so this is our canned

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.149 
puree all right so this is our canned
pumpkin<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.079> add<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.590> in<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:02.009> at

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
pumpkin and we can add that in all at

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.670 
pumpkin and we can add that in all at
one<00:02:02.280> time<00:02:02.869> you'll<00:02:03.869> notice<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.380> starts

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
one time you'll notice that it starts

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.469 
one time you'll notice that it starts
looking<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.189> more<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> cake<00:02:06.240> batter

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
looking a lot more like a cake batter

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.760 
looking a lot more like a cake batter
we're<00:02:06.719> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> transfer<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> new

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
we're going to transfer it to a new

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.169 
we're going to transfer it to a new
mixing<00:02:08.280> bowl<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.610> reason<00:02:08.879> why<00:02:08.970> we're

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
mixing bowl and the reason why we're

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.300 
mixing bowl and the reason why we're
going<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.660> new<00:02:09.720> mixing<00:02:10.170> bowl<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:11.160> that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
going into a new mixing bowl is so that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.910 
going into a new mixing bowl is so that
we<00:02:11.430> have<00:02:11.459> enough<00:02:11.580> space<00:02:12.000> for<00:02:12.300> our

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
we have enough space for our

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.190 
we have enough space for our
White's<00:02:13.450> now<00:02:14.450> for<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.720> egg<00:02:14.840> whites<00:02:15.050> I've

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
White's now for the egg whites I've

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.900 
White's now for the egg whites I've
taken<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.530> liberty<00:02:15.560> of<00:02:15.890> already<00:02:16.220> mixing<00:02:16.760> that

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
taken the liberty of already mixing that

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.240 
taken the liberty of already mixing that
ahead<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.180> time<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.660> so<00:02:18.380> you<00:02:18.440> take<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.830> 10<00:02:19.040> egg

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
ahead of time and so you take the 10 egg

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.490 
ahead of time and so you take the 10 egg
whites<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:20.360> start<00:02:20.660> whisking<00:02:20.959> that<00:02:21.260> until

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
whites and you start whisking that until

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.380 
whites and you start whisking that until
it<00:02:21.590> gets<00:02:21.739> nice<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:21.950> frothy<00:02:22.370> after<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
it gets nice and frothy after that

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.520 
it gets nice and frothy after that
you're<00:02:23.540> going<00:02:23.660> to<00:02:23.720> take<00:02:23.959> half<00:02:24.230> of<00:02:24.380> your

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
you're going to take half of your

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.220 
you're going to take half of your
remaining<00:02:24.800> sugar<00:02:25.130> and<00:02:25.569> whisk<00:02:26.569> it<00:02:26.780> into<00:02:27.140> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
remaining sugar and whisk it into the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.080 
remaining sugar and whisk it into the
egg<00:02:27.349> whites<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.860> we're<00:02:28.459> going<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> fold<00:02:28.910> this

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
egg whites and we're going to fold this

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.059 
egg whites and we're going to fold this
into<00:02:29.360> our<00:02:29.600> pumpkin<00:02:30.110> mixture<00:02:30.410> we're<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.010> to

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
into our pumpkin mixture we're going to

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.699 
into our pumpkin mixture we're going to
fold<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.580> in<00:02:31.760> two<00:02:32.000> ways<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:33.110> first<00:02:33.290> way<00:02:33.470> is

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
fold it in in two ways the first way is

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.220 
fold it in in two ways the first way is
just<00:02:34.520> to<00:02:34.640> soften<00:02:34.970> up<00:02:35.239> the<00:02:35.300> mixture<00:02:35.750> so<00:02:36.140> we're

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
just to soften up the mixture so we're

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.540 
just to soften up the mixture so we're
going<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.440> take<00:02:36.560> half<00:02:36.770> of<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.010> egg<00:02:37.130> whites<00:02:37.370> and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
going to take half of the egg whites and

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.330 
going to take half of the egg whites and
we're<00:02:38.030> really<00:02:38.270> not<00:02:38.720> folding<00:02:39.260> but<00:02:39.709> whisking<00:02:40.160> in

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
we're really not folding but whisking in

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.270 
we're really not folding but whisking in
the<00:02:40.550> egg<00:02:40.670> whites<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.739> soften<00:02:43.099> it<00:02:43.190> up

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the egg whites this is to soften it up

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.820 
the egg whites this is to soften it up
to<00:02:43.459> make<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:43.730> easier<00:02:44.120> for<00:02:44.420> folding<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.709> egg

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
to make it easier for folding in the egg

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.080 
to make it easier for folding in the egg
whites<00:02:46.040> later<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.489> reason<00:02:46.730> why<00:02:46.819> i<00:02:46.880> say

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
whites later and the reason why i say

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.270 
whites later and the reason why i say
folding<00:02:47.569> in<00:02:47.720> is<00:02:47.870> because<00:02:48.560> we're<00:02:49.069> actually

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
folding in is because we're actually

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.160 
folding in is because we're actually
going<00:02:49.550> to<00:02:49.640> be<00:02:49.670> very<00:02:49.940> gentle<00:02:50.209> with<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:51.049> egg

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
going to be very gentle with the egg

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.360 
going to be very gentle with the egg
whites<00:02:51.380> later<00:02:51.620> on<00:02:51.799> because<00:02:51.950> those<00:02:52.130> egg<00:02:52.340> whites

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
whites later on because those egg whites

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.800 
whites later on because those egg whites
are<00:02:52.670> going<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.850> provide<00:02:53.090> us<00:02:53.299> with<00:02:53.360> a<00:02:53.510> lot<00:02:53.750> of

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810

we need to keep whisking more we want to

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.320 
we need to keep whisking more we want to
make<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> to<00:03:04.160> where<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.400> looks<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:04.730> modulus<00:03:05.150> is

make it to where it looks the modulus is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.539 
make it to where it looks the modulus is
that<00:03:06.049> nice<00:03:06.260> kind<00:03:06.530> of<00:03:06.680> orange<00:03:06.980> e<00:03:07.130> pumpkin

pour<00:03:11.299> in<00:03:11.510> the<00:03:11.750> egg<00:03:12.200> whites<00:03:12.850> we're<00:03:13.850> going<00:03:13.970> to

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
pour in the egg whites we're going to

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.330 
pour in the egg whites we're going to
fold<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:14.810> very<00:03:15.019> gently<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.040> come

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
fold that in very gently so you come

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.610 
fold that in very gently so you come
from<00:03:16.489> the<00:03:16.610> middle<00:03:16.850> and<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.269> lift<00:03:17.570> up<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.530> you

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
from the middle and you lift up and you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.800 
from the middle and you lift up and you
keep<00:03:18.799> doing<00:03:19.130> that<00:03:19.250> until<00:03:19.519> most<00:03:20.420> of<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.630> egg

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
keep doing that until most of the egg

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.810 
keep doing that until most of the egg
whites<00:03:21.079> are<00:03:21.290> incorporated<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.370> this<00:03:22.549> is<00:03:22.700> about

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
whites are incorporated so this is about

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.490 
whites are incorporated so this is about
done<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.600> don't<00:03:23.750> want<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.930> whisk<00:03:24.079> too<00:03:24.290> much

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
done you don't want to whisk too much

done you don't want to whisk too much
you<00:03:25.070> can<00:03:25.220> still<00:03:25.549> see<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> little<00:03:25.940> bit<00:03:26.120> of

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
you can still see a little bit of

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.630 
you can still see a little bit of
visible<00:03:26.660> meringue<00:03:27.380> but<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.340> don't<00:03:28.489> have

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
visible meringue but you don't have

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.430 
visible meringue but you don't have
something<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.209> has<00:03:29.390> large<00:03:29.780> streaks<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
we're going to take our prepared sheet

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.610 
we're going to take our prepared sheet
tray<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:35.660> already<00:03:35.959> lined<00:03:36.200> with<00:03:36.500> plastic

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
wrap to make my life easier I also put

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.740 
wrap to make my life easier I also put
onto<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.700> sheet<00:03:40.940> tray<00:03:41.120> ahead<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.450> time<00:03:41.600> a

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
onto the sheet tray ahead of time a

onto the sheet tray ahead of time a
little<00:03:42.019> bit<00:03:42.109> of<00:03:42.140> Pam<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.739> then<00:03:43.730> it's<00:03:43.880> ready

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
little bit of Pam and then it's ready

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.340 
little bit of Pam and then it's ready
for<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.299> batter<00:03:44.480> to<00:03:44.690> pour<00:03:44.900> onto<00:03:45.079> it<00:03:45.350> now<00:03:47.350> using

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
for the batter to pour onto it now using

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.530 
for the batter to pour onto it now using
your<00:03:48.500> spatula<00:03:48.739> just<00:03:49.130> spread<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.549> out<00:03:49.730> it's

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
your spatula just spread it out it's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.840 
your spatula just spread it out it's
going<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> rise<00:03:50.989> a<00:03:51.049> little<00:03:51.200> bit<00:03:51.530> so<00:03:51.799> it's<00:03:52.040> not

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
going to rise a little bit so it's not

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.819 
going to rise a little bit so it's not
important<00:03:53.329> if<00:03:53.450> it's<00:03:53.600> all<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.840> same<00:03:54.230> height

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
important if it's all the same height

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.170 
important if it's all the same height
but<00:03:55.070> you<00:03:55.370> want<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.579> get<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.819> to<00:03:55.910> where<00:03:56.060> it's

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
but you want to get it to where it's

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.270 
but you want to get it to where it's
fairly<00:03:56.600> consistent<00:03:57.319> so<00:03:57.890> now<00:03:58.010> we're<00:03:58.130> going<00:03:58.220> to

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
fairly consistent so now we're going to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.620 
fairly consistent so now we're going to
take<00:03:58.430> our<00:03:58.549> pudding<00:03:58.730> cake<00:03:58.970> and<00:03:59.150> put<00:03:59.269> it<00:03:59.359> into<00:03:59.510> a

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
take our pudding cake and put it into a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.960 
take our pudding cake and put it into a
350-degree<00:04:00.410> oven<00:04:00.620> for<00:04:00.920> 20<00:04:01.340> minutes<00:04:01.370> we're

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
350-degree oven for 20 minutes we're

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.520 
350-degree oven for 20 minutes we're
going<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.209> put<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.359> into<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.720> water<00:04:02.989> bath<00:04:03.200> so

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
going to put that into a water bath so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.509 
going to put that into a water bath so
let's<00:04:03.709> go<00:04:03.799> ahead<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:03.980> see<00:04:04.100> how<00:04:04.280> we're<00:04:04.430> going

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
let's go ahead and see how we're going

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.280 
let's go ahead and see how we're going
to<00:04:04.609> set<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.660> we<00:04:05.750> take<00:04:05.900> our<00:04:06.109> pudding

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
to set that up so we take our pudding

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.920 
to set that up so we take our pudding
cake<00:04:06.560> we<00:04:07.220> go<00:04:07.430> into<00:04:07.640> our<00:04:08.000> sheet<00:04:08.630> tray<00:04:08.810> that's

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
cake we go into our sheet tray that's

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.990 
cake we go into our sheet tray that's
already<00:04:09.319> in<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> oven<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:10.670> need<00:04:10.819> to<00:04:10.880> be

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
already in the oven you need to be

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.940 
already in the oven you need to be
careful<00:04:11.150> because<00:04:11.480> this<00:04:11.690> is<00:04:11.810> all<00:04:11.959> very<00:04:11.989> hot<00:04:12.440> but

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
careful because this is all very hot but

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.140 
careful because this is all very hot but
the<00:04:13.069> reason<00:04:13.220> why<00:04:13.459> we're<00:04:13.639> doing<00:04:13.730> this<00:04:13.940> is<00:04:14.120> so

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
the reason why we're doing this is so

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.789 
the reason why we're doing this is so
that<00:04:14.239> you<00:04:14.450> don't<00:04:14.600> burn<00:04:14.750> yourself<00:04:14.870> more<00:04:15.319> we're

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
that you don't burn yourself more we're

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:18.520 
that you don't burn yourself more we're
going<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.980> pour<00:04:16.280> into<00:04:16.579> that<00:04:16.970> sheet<00:04:17.630> tray<00:04:17.870> water

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
going to pour into that sheet tray water

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.920 
going to pour into that sheet tray water
until<00:04:18.889> it's<00:04:19.100> almost<00:04:19.459> up<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.000> edges<00:04:20.510> the

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
until it's almost up to the edges the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.640 
until it's almost up to the edges the
very<00:04:21.109> top<00:04:21.320> edges<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.950> our<00:04:22.940> pudding<00:04:23.419> cake

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
very top edges of our pudding cake

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.100 
very top edges of our pudding cake
and<00:04:25.820> that<00:04:26.820> water<00:04:27.090> bath<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.510> going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> help<00:04:27.930> it

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
and that water bath is going to help it

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.240 
and that water bath is going to help it
to<00:04:28.320> cook<00:04:28.710> very<00:04:28.980> evenly<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.700> very<00:04:30.600> gently<00:04:30.660> so

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
to cook very evenly and very gently so
