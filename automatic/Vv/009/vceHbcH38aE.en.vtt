00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.160
 Right now is the'd got off the new Tomei 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.370
 Well the dream of Shizuoka City is now Shimizu 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:17.850
 I'm alive, but now this one 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.640
 It runs the land called Route 52, but this car 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.189
 Pretty principle 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:30.680
 He will automatically make it work though the engine brake is effective once 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:33.030
 Listen to the brakes with a natural feeling rather than with the engine brakes that feel like that amount 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.910
 I will give you 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:40.120
 Well I think there is great hope 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.620
 Though it is a ride 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.500
 Well spoofed Atenza 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.770
 Compared to the accelerator etc. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.930
 It becomes soft setting 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.800
 that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.020
 Well Eva comfort even though I've been made to feel that was a little anxiety Speaking bad 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.690
 Komachi that got better 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:09.700
 The handle is still that kind of 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:17.100
 You say that it's a little sweet , I feel that the turn has been lightened, right? 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.100
 But we have that straight-line stability as pretty far-ass and get on the highway is very good 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.520
 There is no thing being caught in the wind 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.670
 If you notice that the cap goes smoothly and you notice 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.540
 Ummm 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.540
 I'm out of it for about 110 kg 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.980
 There was not such a thing in PUP News last time 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:48.870
 Well I think this is also a good place for gasoline cars 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:55.520
 I know and I said long stroke's design 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.520
 I think that it is probably that the big factor is that it has been shaken to a torque type fairly, though 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:03.640
 Thank you very much for that today's market would like to put on 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.640
