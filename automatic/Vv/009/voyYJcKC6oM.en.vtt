was<00:03:28.319> very<00:03:28.560> impressed<00:03:28.769> with<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:29.940> way<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.150> was

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
was very impressed with the way it was

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.610 
was very impressed with the way it was
approached<00:03:30.629> and<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.319> all<00:03:31.410> I'm<00:03:31.470> going<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
approached and that's all I'm going to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.740 
approached and that's all I'm going to
say<00:03:31.829> about<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.069> but<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.970> felt<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.180> real

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
say about that but it just felt so real

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
say about that but it just felt so real
and<00:03:34.079> that<00:03:34.769> was<00:03:34.919> something<00:03:35.190> that<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.340> really<00:03:35.849> I'm

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
and that was something that I really I'm

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.580 
and that was something that I really I'm
not<00:03:36.150> talking<00:03:36.389> about<00:03:36.419> graphic<00:03:37.109> it<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.440> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
not talking about graphic it just it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.580 
not talking about graphic it just it
felt<00:03:38.090> not<00:03:39.090> Hollywood<00:03:39.780> eyes<00:03:40.019> like<00:03:40.290> I've<00:03:40.410> been

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
felt not Hollywood eyes like I've been

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.439 
felt not Hollywood eyes like I've been
saying<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:41.069> felt<00:03:41.340> genuine<00:03:41.940> I<00:03:42.060> have<00:03:42.239> but<00:03:42.419> one

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
saying it felt genuine I have but one

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:43.909 
saying it felt genuine I have but one
flaw<00:03:42.810> with<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.109> movie<00:03:43.349> and<00:03:43.379> that<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:43.889> a

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
flaw with the movie and that is that a

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.220 
flaw with the movie and that is that a
certain<00:03:44.370> thing<00:03:44.760> happens<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.359> fairly

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
certain thing happens that's fairly

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.589 
certain thing happens that's fairly
surprising<00:03:46.739> that<00:03:47.129> was<00:03:47.669> very<00:03:47.910> effective<00:03:48.359> but

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
surprising that was very effective but

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.879 
surprising that was very effective but
then<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.900> just<00:03:49.049> sort<00:03:49.199> of<00:03:49.290> gets<00:03:49.440> glossed<00:03:49.650> over

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
then it just sort of gets glossed over

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:52.610 
then it just sort of gets glossed over
and<00:03:50.310> you<00:03:50.549> sort<00:03:50.730> of<00:03:50.819> lose<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.480> feel<00:03:52.169> of<00:03:52.349> time

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
and you sort of lose a feel of time

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.680 
and you sort of lose a feel of time
almost<00:03:53.280> as<00:03:53.519> the<00:03:53.760> next<00:03:53.940> few<00:03:54.090> scenes<00:03:54.269> progressed

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
almost as the next few scenes progressed

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.589 
almost as the next few scenes progressed
and<00:03:54.900> besides<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.859> the<00:03:56.459> spectacular<00:03:56.669> now<00:03:57.269> is

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
and besides that the spectacular now is

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.059
