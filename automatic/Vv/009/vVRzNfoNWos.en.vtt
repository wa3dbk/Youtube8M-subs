things that completely screw this game
up<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:02.010> example<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.789> bullets<00:01:03.359> are<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
up for example the bullets are on a

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.170 
up for example the bullets are on a
little<00:01:04.290> bit<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> delay<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.670> very

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
little bit of a delay this is very

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.240 
little bit of a delay this is very
notable<00:01:06.750> right<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.229> beginning<00:01:07.350> where<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
notable right in the beginning where you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
notable right in the beginning where you
practice<00:01:08.700> your<00:01:08.850> shooting<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:09.270> hitting<00:01:09.510> some

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
practice your shooting by hitting some

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.350 
practice your shooting by hitting some
bottles<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.680> shoot<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> bottle<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.210> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
bottles you shoot a bottle and then the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
bottles you shoot a bottle and then the
bullet<00:01:12.630> doesn't<00:01:13.170> hit<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.350> bottle<00:01:13.740> right<00:01:13.979> away

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
bullet doesn't hit the bottle right away

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.450 
bullet doesn't hit the bottle right away
there<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> slight<00:01:15.570> delay<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.560> obviously

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
there is a slight delay and obviously

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.880 
there is a slight delay and obviously
bullets<00:01:18.119> aren't<00:01:18.390> Lightspeed<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.500> bullets

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
bullets aren't Lightspeed but bullets

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.640 
bullets aren't Lightspeed but bullets
are<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.939> faster<00:01:21.780> than<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.439> are<00:01:22.470> in

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
are way faster than what they are in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
are way faster than what they are in
this<00:01:22.950> game<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.759> guy<00:01:23.909> you're<00:01:24.060> playing<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
of the bad guys until they actually draw

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
on you or on someone else this means you

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.069

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
millisecond before they shoot you and

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
millisecond before they shoot you and
this<00:01:36.060> wouldn't<00:01:36.390> be<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.509> problem<00:01:36.570> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.560> didn't
