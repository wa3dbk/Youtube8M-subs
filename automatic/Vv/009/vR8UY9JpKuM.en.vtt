Grappelli today we will be analyzing a

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.470 
Grappelli today we will be analyzing a
few<00:00:14.550> of<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> ideas<00:00:14.820> that<00:00:15.259> Django<00:00:16.259> uses<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.890> his

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480 
few of the ideas that Django uses in his

few of the ideas that Django uses in his
accompanying<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:19.050> Stephane<00:00:19.860> Grappelli<00:00:19.890> keep

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:20.489 
accompanying of Stephane Grappelli keep

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.790 
accompanying of Stephane Grappelli keep
in<00:00:20.610> mind<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.060> these<00:00:21.210> ideas<00:00:21.419> are<00:00:21.800> probably

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
in mind that these ideas are probably

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.100 
in mind that these ideas are probably
best<00:00:23.009> used<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.489> duet<00:00:23.880> situations<00:00:24.570> Django

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
best used in duet situations Django

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.830 
best used in duet situations Django
wouldn't<00:00:25.410> probably<00:00:26.450> accompany<00:00:27.450> in<00:00:27.540> this<00:00:27.660> way

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
wouldn't probably accompany in this way

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.370 
wouldn't probably accompany in this way
if<00:00:28.020> he<00:00:28.169> was<00:00:28.320> playing<00:00:28.619> with<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.520> band<00:00:30.380> also

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
if he was playing with the band also

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.200 
if he was playing with the band also
please<00:00:32.009> familiarize<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.790> tune<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.120> you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
please familiarize with the tune if you

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.540 
please familiarize with the tune if you
don't<00:00:33.390> already<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.980> attached<00:00:35.370> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
don't already know it I have attached a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.660 
don't already know it I have attached a
PDF<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.840> structure<00:00:37.590> or<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.920> chords<00:00:38.580> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
PDF of the structure or the chords of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.020 
PDF of the structure or the chords of
the<00:00:38.730> tune

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.150 

so<00:00:48.030> one<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> these<00:00:48.390> ideas<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.079> Django<00:00:49.469> uses

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
so one of these ideas that Django uses

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.740 
so one of these ideas that Django uses
quite<00:00:50.399> often<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.920> place<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.750> simple

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
quite often in this in place of a simple

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.860 
quite often in this in place of a simple
major<00:00:54.989> chord<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.879> really<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> chord<00:00:57.210> scale<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
major chord is really a chord scale and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:08.330 
major chord is really a chord scale and
and<00:00:58.110> here<00:00:58.589> it<00:00:58.680> is<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:07.740> Django<00:01:08.009> is<00:01:08.100> doing

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and here it is so what Django is doing

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.280 
and here it is so what Django is doing
here<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.610> he's<00:01:08.759> basically<00:01:09.000> tying<00:01:09.899> or

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
here is he's basically tying or

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.789 
here is he's basically tying or
approaching<00:01:10.920> from<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> G<00:01:11.670> major<00:01:12.649> facing<00:01:13.649> on

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
approaching from the G major facing on

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.530 
approaching from the G major facing on
to<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> second<00:01:14.460> chord<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> song<00:01:15.060> which<00:01:15.360> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to the second chord of the song which is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
to the second chord of the song which is
E<00:01:15.750> flat<00:01:16.170> seven<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:18.350> he<00:01:19.350> does<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.770> by<00:01:20.070> passing

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
E flat seven and he does that by passing

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.169 
E flat seven and he does that by passing
by<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.860> diminished<00:01:23.149> just<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.240> triad<00:01:25.759> then<00:01:26.759> its

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:27.179 
by a diminished just a triad then its

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.809 
by a diminished just a triad then its
first<00:01:27.750> inversion<00:01:29.000> C<00:01:30.000> diminished<00:01:31.640> then<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
first inversion C diminished then this

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.399 
first inversion C diminished then this
is<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.090> first<00:01:33.300> inversion<00:01:33.569> of<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> G<00:01:34.170> major

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
is the first inversion of the G major

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:45.700 
is the first inversion of the G major
which<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.800> G<00:01:35.789> over<00:01:35.819> B<00:01:38.060> diminished<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.800> down<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
which is G over B diminished and down to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.830 
which is G over B diminished and down to
seven<00:01:48.259> one<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.500> analyze<00:01:50.100> this<00:01:50.610> by<00:01:50.850> simply<00:01:51.479> and

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
seven one can analyze this by simply and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.260 
seven one can analyze this by simply and
basically<00:01:52.170> observing<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.829> many<00:01:53.729> times<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
basically observing that many times to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.600 
basically observing that many times to
break<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> monotony<00:01:54.899> of<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> one<00:01:56.280> chord

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
break the monotony of a of a one chord

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
break the monotony of a of a one chord
or<00:01:56.820> one<00:01:57.119> major<00:01:57.329> chord<00:01:58.189> you<00:01:59.189> can<00:02:00.530> alternate

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
or one major chord you can alternate

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.429 
or one major chord you can alternate
between<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:02.039> 1<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.789> 5<00:02:03.030> which<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> in

the<00:02:04.560> case<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.979> G<00:02:05.219> would<00:02:05.399> be<00:02:05.430> d7<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:07.160> substitution

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the case of G would be d7 a substitution

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
the case of G would be d7 a substitution
for<00:02:08.190> d7<00:02:08.850> would<00:02:09.450> be<00:02:10.670> flat<00:02:11.670> diminished<00:02:12.030> which<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
for d7 would be flat diminished which is

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.420 
for d7 would be flat diminished which is
actually<00:02:13.200> nothing<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:13.500> at<00:02:14.600> d7<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:16.019> a<00:02:16.049> flat<00:02:16.530> 9

this<00:03:18.690> time<00:03:18.990> we<00:03:19.170> use<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.320> chromatic<00:03:19.620> approach<00:03:19.980> of

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
this time we use a chromatic approach of

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.740 
this time we use a chromatic approach of
diminished<00:03:26.030> at<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.240> point

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
diminished at this point

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.470 
diminished at this point
he<00:03:28.020> already<00:03:28.170> implies<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.980> e<00:03:29.010> 7<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:30.150> would<00:03:30.330> be

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
he already implies the e 7 this would be

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:43.140 
he already implies the e 7 this would be
the<00:03:30.600> first<00:03:30.810> inversion

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.710 

so<00:03:43.750> again<00:03:44.049> he<00:03:44.170> approaches<00:03:44.590> chromatically

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
so again he approaches chromatically

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.050 
so again he approaches chromatically
this<00:03:46.830> B<00:03:48.480> flat<00:03:49.480> seven<00:03:50.470> which<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.650> again<00:03:51.099> nothing

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
this B flat seven which is again nothing

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:16.890 
this B flat seven which is again nothing
but<00:03:52.299> a<00:03:52.450> tritone<00:03:52.900> substitution<00:04:15.539> so<00:04:16.539> again<00:04:16.720> then

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
but a tritone substitution so again then

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.140 
but a tritone substitution so again then
to<00:04:17.019> summarize<00:04:17.229> basically<00:04:17.739> Django<00:04:18.459> is<00:04:18.699> looking

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
to summarize basically Django is looking

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.300 
to summarize basically Django is looking
to<00:04:19.329> fill<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.320> space<00:04:20.620> that<00:04:20.859> there<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.160> between

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
to fill the space that there is between

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.020 
to fill the space that there is between
these<00:04:22.060> chords<00:04:23.729> practically<00:04:24.729> with<00:04:24.850> some

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
these chords practically with some

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.050 
these chords practically with some
chords<00:04:25.419> scales<00:04:25.539> and<00:04:26.139> again<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.430> main<00:04:27.639> ideas

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
chords scales and again the main ideas

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.140 
chords scales and again the main ideas
are<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.570> use<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.960> diminished<00:04:29.380> chords<00:04:32.820> on<00:04:33.820> the

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
are the use of diminished chords on the

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:42.210 
are the use of diminished chords on the
fifth<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:35.699> G<00:04:36.699> which<00:04:37.510> is<00:04:37.539> d7<00:04:39.449> but<00:04:41.100> on<00:04:42.100> the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
fifth of the G which is d7 but on the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.469 
fifth of the G which is d7 but on the
sixth<00:04:42.520> string<00:04:44.160> then<00:04:45.160> he<00:04:45.280> uses<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:46.240> first

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
sixth string then he uses the first

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.040 
sixth string then he uses the first
inversion<00:04:46.810> of<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.229> major<00:04:47.410> chord<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.250> for<00:04:48.729> G<00:04:49.210> we

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
inversion of the major chord so for G we

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.890 
inversion of the major chord so for G we
have<00:04:50.080> B<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:53.740> then<00:04:53.919> in<00:04:54.099> the<00:04:54.690> second<00:04:55.690> passage

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
have B and then in the second passage

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.070 
have B and then in the second passage
Django<00:04:56.800> uses<00:04:57.250> a<00:04:57.760> lot<00:04:58.450> of<00:04:58.479> chromatic

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
Django uses a lot of chromatic

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.129 
Django uses a lot of chromatic
chromaticism<00:04:59.650> x'<00:04:59.979> as<00:05:00.330> well<00:05:01.330> as<00:05:01.510> the<00:05:01.750> famous

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
chromaticism x' as well as the famous

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.710 
chromaticism x' as well as the famous
tritone<00:05:02.770> substitution<00:05:03.520> which<00:05:03.849> basically

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
tritone substitution which basically

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.100 
tritone substitution which basically
again<00:05:05.080> states<00:05:05.440> that<00:05:05.710> for<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.099> seventh<00:05:06.520> chord<00:05:07.110> in

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
again states that for a seventh chord in

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.879 
again states that for a seventh chord in
the<00:05:08.229> case<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.830> this<00:05:09.130> case<00:05:09.370> we<00:05:09.580> have<00:05:09.729> an<00:05:09.849> e7<00:05:10.889> the

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
the case in this case we have an e7 the

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.450 
the case in this case we have an e7 the
Jaguar<00:05:12.370> substitutes<00:05:12.880> with<00:05:13.060> the<00:05:13.710> B<00:05:14.710> flat<00:05:15.039> seven

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
Jaguar substitutes with the B flat seven

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.800 
Jaguar substitutes with the B flat seven
you'll<00:05:15.910> you'll<00:05:16.660> hear<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:18.300> whole<00:05:19.300> lot<00:05:19.539> from

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
you'll you'll hear this a whole lot from

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.469 
you'll you'll hear this a whole lot from
Django<00:05:20.680> but<00:05:21.039> also<00:05:21.430> many<00:05:22.000> other<00:05:22.090> jazz

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
Django but also many other jazz

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.860 
Django but also many other jazz
musicians<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:24.250> basically<00:05:24.789> you<00:05:25.030> take<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.630> you

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
musicians so basically you take you you

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.040 
musicians so basically you take you you
look<00:05:26.050> at<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.460> seventh<00:05:27.460> chord<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:28.630> simply

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
look at the seventh chord you simply

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.469 
look at the seventh chord you simply
look<00:05:29.199> for<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.530> flatted<00:05:29.949> fifth<00:05:33.090> which<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.300> B

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
look for the flatted fifth which is B

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.170 
look for the flatted fifth which is B
flat<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:35.169> you<00:05:35.860> can<00:05:35.979> build<00:05:36.190> a<00:05:36.490> seventh<00:05:36.970> chord

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
flat and you can build a seventh chord

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.210 
flat and you can build a seventh chord
on<00:05:37.530> on<00:05:38.530> that<00:05:40.380> so<00:05:41.380> here's<00:05:41.620> the<00:05:41.740> progression

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
on on that so here's the progression

00:05:42.220 --> 00:06:11.650 
on on that so here's the progression
again<00:05:42.310> very<00:05:42.849> slowly

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.600 

so<00:06:12.660> I<00:06:12.690> hope<00:06:12.900> this<00:06:13.050> was<00:06:13.260> of<00:06:13.290> help<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:14.100> if

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
so I hope this was of help and if

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.710 
so I hope this was of help and if
