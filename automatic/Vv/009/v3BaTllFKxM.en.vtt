an<00:00:17.190> OCD<00:00:17.609> neat<00:00:17.970> freak<00:00:18.240> overnight<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:19.770> kind<00:00:20.039> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
an OCD neat freak overnight you kind of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.640 
an OCD neat freak overnight you kind of
have<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.609> baby<00:00:21.359> steps<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.020> get<00:00:22.109> organized

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
have to have baby steps to get organized

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
have to have baby steps to get organized
especially<00:00:22.859> if<00:00:23.310> you're<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.460> super<00:00:23.939> messy

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
especially if you're a super messy

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.939 
especially if you're a super messy
person<00:00:24.660> or<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.810> hoarder<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.470> can't<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
person or a hoarder you can't just

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.040 
person or a hoarder you can't just
change<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.029> day<00:00:27.210> that's<00:00:27.449> not<00:00:27.570> realistic

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
change in the day that's not realistic

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.890 
change in the day that's not realistic
so<00:00:28.680> my<00:00:29.519> methods<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.359> baby<00:00:30.570> step

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
so my methods are little baby step

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.330 
so my methods are little baby step
things<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.529> could<00:00:31.710> really<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> big

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
things that could really make a big

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.380 
things that could really make a big
difference

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.910 

I'm<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.660> kind<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.899> organizer<00:00:44.290> that<00:00:44.410> thinks

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
I'm the kind of organizer that thinks

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.180 
I'm the kind of organizer that thinks
really<00:00:45.250> fashion-forward<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.660> don't<00:00:47.649> like<00:00:47.949> when

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
really fashion-forward I don't like when

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.340 
really fashion-forward I don't like when
organizers<00:00:48.970> tell<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.570> to<00:00:49.809> go<00:00:49.930> out<00:00:50.019> and<00:00:50.050> buy<00:00:50.320> a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
organizers tell you to go out and buy a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.250 
organizers tell you to go out and buy a
bunch<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:50.739> plastic<00:00:51.730> bins<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.480> are<00:00:52.540> sterile

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
bunch of plastic bins that are sterile

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.619 
bunch of plastic bins that are sterile
and<00:00:53.530> look<00:00:53.710> like<00:00:53.860> a<00:00:53.920> hospital<00:00:54.519> supply<00:00:54.879> closet

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
and look like a hospital supply closet

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.869 
and look like a hospital supply closet
and<00:00:55.840> then<00:00:56.320> you<00:00:56.469> have<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.680> put<00:00:56.860> Sharpie<00:00:57.339> labels

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
and then you have to put Sharpie labels

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.990 
and then you have to put Sharpie labels
all<00:00:58.059> over<00:00:58.409> that's<00:00:59.409> definitely<00:01:00.159> not<00:01:00.370> glamorous

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
all over that's definitely not glamorous

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000 
all over that's definitely not glamorous
I<00:01:01.239> don't<00:01:01.480> see<00:01:01.690> any<00:01:01.930> celebrities<00:01:02.559> having<00:01:02.890> that

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.370 
from that type of organizing the way I
organize<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.880> really<00:01:13.240> fashion<00:01:13.690> forward<00:01:13.720> and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380
