well<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.809> that's<00:00:09.990> released<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:10.380> learned<00:00:10.559> I'm

a<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.110> short<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.559> went<00:00:35.280> through<00:00:35.610> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
a is a very short one went through in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
a is a very short one went through in
about<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.059> couple<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> seconds<00:00:36.870> B<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.620> much

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
about a couple of seconds B is much

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.040 
about a couple of seconds B is much
bigger<00:00:38.100> seven<00:00:38.640> megabytes<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.420> saying<00:00:39.870> quite

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
bigger seven megabytes and saying quite

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.440 
bigger seven megabytes and saying quite
a<00:00:40.110> bit<00:00:40.290> longer<00:00:40.489> so<00:00:41.489> definitely<00:00:42.210> make<00:00:42.420> sure

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
a bit longer so definitely make sure

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.779 
a bit longer so definitely make sure
batteries<00:00:43.079> fall<00:00:43.320> don't<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.340> thing<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.700> know

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
batteries fall don't the thing you know

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
batteries fall don't the thing you know
like<00:00:44.969> I'm<00:00:45.480> sure<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.809> gonna<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:45.989> fine<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
like I'm sure it's gonna be fine and

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.920 
like I'm sure it's gonna be fine and
then<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:47.360> die<00:00:48.360> on<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.840> middle

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
then it's gonna die on you in the middle

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.189 
then it's gonna die on you in the middle
of<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> update<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.710> that'd<00:00:50.070> be<00:00:50.460> quite

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
of the update and that'd be quite

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.529 
of the update and that'd be quite
devastating<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> that's<00:00:54.120> something<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
devastating so that's something to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.010 
devastating so that's something to
remember

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
remember

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.979 
remember
and<00:00:55.289> then<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.800> don't<00:00:56.760> know<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.180> update<00:00:57.480> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
and then just don't know the update it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
and then just don't know the update it's
just<00:00:58.170> south<00:00:58.710> extracting<00:00:59.190> zip<00:00:59.370> file<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
just south extracting zip file so just

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.510 
just south extracting zip file so just
double<00:01:00.629> click<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.289> extract<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
double click and it's gonna extract to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.440 
double click and it's gonna extract to
the<00:01:03.290> let's<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.589> called<00:01:04.830> D<00:01:05.250> 300<00:01:06.090> update

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the let's see it's called D 300 update

I mean folder and that there's your two
two<00:01:11.090> bins<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.020> B<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.799> day

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
two bins there so the a and B do day

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.440 
two bins there so the a and B do day
first<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.640> second<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:15.330> into

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
first and to be second you just go into

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.020 
first and to be second you just go into
your<00:01:15.509> firmware<00:01:15.840> options<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.890> you'll<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.220> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
your firmware options and you'll see an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.539 
your firmware options and you'll see an
option<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.420> perform<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.409> update<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.400> that

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
option to perform an update and that

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.190 
option to perform an update and that
that's<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:21.180> very<00:01:21.330> simple<00:01:24.049> should<00:01:25.049> be

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that's really it's very simple should be

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's really it's very simple should be
done<00:01:28.189> and<00:01:29.240> that's<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:31.020> few

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
done and that's what are you just few

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.060 
done and that's what are you just few
things<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.590> keep<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.890> eye<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.009> us<00:01:32.400> for<00:01:34.070> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
things to keep an eye on us for and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.109 
things to keep an eye on us for and
there<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.790> well<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:36.930> warning<00:01:38.119> this

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
there we go well then warning this

there we go well then warning this
should<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.329> have<00:01:39.450> changed<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.869> turn<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
should not have changed to turn the

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:40.700 
should not have changed to turn the
camera<00:01:40.500> off

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
camera off

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.940 
camera off
yeah<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:42.150> turned<00:01:42.630> off<00:01:42.829> that's<00:01:43.829> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

L<00:01:44.100> don't<00:01:45.740> know<00:01:46.740> it's<00:01:46.950> just<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.159> show<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> where

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
L don't know it's just to show you where

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.630 
L don't know it's just to show you where
the<00:01:47.610> option<00:01:47.939> is<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> go<00:01:48.329> into<00:01:48.450> your<00:01:48.540> menu<00:01:49.640> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
the option is you go into your menu the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
the option is you go into your menu the
shooting<00:01:50.970> man<00:01:51.119> comes<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.630> this<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.590> really

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
shooting man comes up this is really

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.300 
shooting man comes up this is really
awkward

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
awkward

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.200 
awkward
but<00:01:53.549> anyway<00:01:53.850> give<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> shot<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.090> go

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
but anyway give it a shot so you just go

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.870 
but anyway give it a shot so you just go
into<00:01:57.420> your<00:01:58.909> setup<00:01:59.909> menu<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.610> it's<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.729> very

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
into your setup menu and it's the very

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
into your setup and then you look for

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.170 
into your setup and then you look for
USB<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:51.989> crappy<00:02:52.519> anyway<00:02:53.519> USB

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
USB and this is really crappy anyway USB

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.320 
USB and this is really crappy anyway USB
and<00:02:54.930> then<00:02:55.019> you<00:02:55.140> select<00:02:55.290> ok<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.310> then<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.180> have

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
and then you select ok and then you have

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.420 
and then you select ok and then you have
two<00:02:57.540> options<00:02:57.750> one<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.380> mass<00:02:58.620> storage<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
two options one is mass storage and the

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.210 
two options one is mass storage and the
other<00:02:59.519> one<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.910> something<00:03:00.900> else<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.739> that's

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
other one is something else but that's

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.589 
other one is something else but that's
the<00:03:02.370> default<00:03:02.670> one<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.120> make<00:03:03.269> sure<00:03:03.299> you<00:03:03.480> select

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
the default one so make sure you select

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.080 
the default one so make sure you select
mass<00:03:04.260> storage<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:05.220> then<00:03:05.310> just<00:03:05.549> confirm<00:03:05.730> ok

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
mass storage and then just confirm ok

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970 
mass storage and then just confirm ok
and<00:03:06.959> that's<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.200> that<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.590> way<00:03:07.769> you'll<00:03:07.920> be

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
and that's it that that way you'll be

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.940 
and that's it that that way you'll be
able<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.280> copy<00:03:08.459> files<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.360> to<00:03:09.810> your<00:03:09.959> card
