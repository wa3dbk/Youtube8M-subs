00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.529
 Cuckoo kill today we 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.049
 found in a video actually 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.910
 particular so in fact I'm going to do 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.200
 a run round of my room and in fact I 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'm sorry it was general going to move 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.029
 because the tablet has not moved because 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.850
 that actually because I actually do not know 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 very well framed but hey you 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.130
 do not worry and then here I am 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 tried to tidy up as I had you 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 said I ordered as quickly as possible 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 So here I hope it is well 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.579
 throw for me that's pretty much 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 row so here and also before before 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.610
 to talk to you i will tell you sign 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:56.329
 that I'm going to talk to you about one thing 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:01:00.059
 before returning to the turn that with the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 so a youtube buzz that stopped his 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.070
 chain we made a chain that 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.689
 is called lea and maeva biotic so 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.840
 if you want to see we have 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.549
 than a video but that explains how 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.470
 what is the channel going to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.170
 unfold and so here I would like that 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.220
 you will see the quality is not 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.890
 very good because I am now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 a camera but you will see the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.720
 next videos will not be like that 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.790
 so that's all that's all I think this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.150
 that I wanted to tell you ah yes and that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.400

 do not know if I said the other day 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.200
 Saturday 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.290

 I love sweet names here I do not 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:42.070
 it limits to that takes four to fine 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.630
 mouth not so much the jo it's 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.060
 indecent this cut 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.060
 I go back down there and you turn 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.419
 you have bet floors and the udc have 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.419
 detached 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.970
 you go my door and mortal and all 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:06.400
 the five years 808 act two shelves 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:09.940
 three shelves and 4 times 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.070
 that's in any case a puzzle you have a 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.500
 carpet that I'm going to change because I have 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.660
 everything rotten and there we come back to the point of 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.370
 departure normally you see the yam and 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.650
 shelves binds to greece and the pau 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.300
 mans where I am but see the decor 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.430
 behind 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.710
 so here we went around my 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.220
 bedroom 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.570
 until before and so the wii a white wall 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.919
 and the white wall after there is a 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:40.690
 opening s to 1 bathroom 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:44.470
 so here's something like that where I 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.610
 store all my stuff stuff 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:56.740
 like that I have in my room and picked up 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:06:01.080
 then made a new shower all 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.780
 but I really tell you all my polishes 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.870
 that's when we're late parent is all 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:12.530
 there an ice cream 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:17.360
 here is an ice cream you are my products 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:22.580
 and all and all that is my opinion and 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:25.389
 turtles my brothel it was he 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:31.639
 never finished product 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:39.110
 so here and that is a machine where I 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:39.940
 store all my mess we have everyone 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.090
 real 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:46.930
 it's very very great here we are 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.190
 then we will return to the starting point 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:07:01.819
 but these tours by her for that 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:07:03.830
 flaw or there agree so I wished 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.000
 mannix so we see if I did this 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.979
 video is not at all to boast 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.020
 of all I have one is because we 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:14.389
 asked me 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:16.759
 and here I think it was all me 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:21.080
 I think that was all and you 

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:29.740
