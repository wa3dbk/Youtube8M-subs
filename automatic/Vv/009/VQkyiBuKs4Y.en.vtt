00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.000
 no 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.230
 no 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.740
 or our father who is in heaven 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.630
 pick up my smiles make them become 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.580
 read more sincere as I leave the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.489
 objections when I remain alone in 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.950
 company of constellations the void 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.710
 but partner in the cold streets reached 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.090
 the silhouette is strong for what it needs 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.610
 shining eyes ready to burst 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.949
 in the influx there is no sincere peace for 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.460
 every bag they knock is criticized 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.269
 from the demons the radioactive heart more than 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.730
 to chernobyl 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.559
 I love the rain it involves another flash 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.770
 so that that glass with the heart 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.280
 I poison myself I hope to dream 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.530
 we must find it 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.690
 arci and we remained in the face and me 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.060
 I divide from the looks that never given that 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.280
 much 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 now I can do it 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.490
 for me 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.110
 mistaken 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.530
 I notice when I dream 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.830
 if you want soccer 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.280
 I don't know what to believe sarde directed like 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.220
 take god christmas i don't know 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.790
 the more I propose myself that I live in dreams but 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.130
 not yolks no I don't know how to do reverse 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.399
 bastards please don't wake me up 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.280
 Please bastard I just watch them for 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.190
 see you inside I just think about it and here 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.409
 serious games and I have the honor of not being there 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.620
 sometimes for me but despite everything 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.170
 I would always choose land even though 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.610
 I'm scared and alive breathless too 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.580
 on the broken heart 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.740
 I am always the same not saying that you 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.200
 I promised to sell the soul to the devil 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.900
 rather than changing myself 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.900
 rather than changing myself 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.380
 anything 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.440
 they want 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.990
 I realize it when I dream about you
