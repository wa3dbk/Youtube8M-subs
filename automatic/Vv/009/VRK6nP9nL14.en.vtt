might think well maybe I should change
what<00:02:13.040> about<00:02:13.130> me<00:02:13.400> or<00:02:13.520> maybe<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.819> should<00:02:14.150> dye<00:02:14.720> my

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
what about me or maybe I should dye my

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.430 
what about me or maybe I should dye my
hair<00:02:14.870> darker<00:02:15.500> or<00:02:16.180> whatever<00:02:17.180> but<00:02:17.720> they<00:02:17.930> do<00:02:18.410> a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
hair darker or whatever but they do a

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.410 
hair darker or whatever but they do a
really<00:02:18.800> good<00:02:18.950> job<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.459> letting<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.270> know<00:02:20.300> that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
really good job of letting you know that

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.199 
really good job of letting you know that
they<00:02:20.750> want<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.860> be<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.430> best<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.000> but

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
they want you to be the best you but

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.449 
they want you to be the best you but
they<00:02:23.330> want<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.170> stay<00:02:24.470> yield<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.310> that's

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
they want you to stay yield and that's

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.550 
they want you to stay yield and that's
nice<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.150> know<00:02:26.239> they<00:02:26.390> want<00:02:26.660> they<00:02:27.110> want<00:02:27.380> those

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
nice you know they want they want those

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.680 
nice you know they want they want those
qualities<00:02:27.770> that<00:02:28.160> make<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:29.239> come<00:02:29.450> out

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
qualities that make you you to come out

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.170 
qualities that make you you to come out
and<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.170> think<00:02:30.410> once<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.769> fans<00:02:31.040> get<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:32.000> know

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
and I think once the fans get to know

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.530 
and I think once the fans get to know
you<00:02:32.239> then<00:02:33.080> they<00:02:33.650> start<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.519> love<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:35.420> know

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
you then they start to love you you know

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.420 
you then they start to love you you know
for<00:02:35.930> who<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.530> are<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:36.890> that's<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.250> great

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
for who you are and that's the great

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.640 
for who you are and that's the great
thing<00:02:37.610> about
