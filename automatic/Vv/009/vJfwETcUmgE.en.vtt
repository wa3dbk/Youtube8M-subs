00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 Hi guys today and show you both 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.670
 sigma brushes I bought and two 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.160
 They sent me these two here. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.040
 I really wanted to test and I enjoyed it. 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 that black friday says that the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.609
 freight was free and then I got these 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.939
 two brushes are already curious 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.260
 because a lot of people talking about them 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 and this one is here with a diagonal cut 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.969
 and this is the mouse were not those two 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 that I bought 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:39.000
 after a week the sigma is to send 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.260
 the email asking if I wanted to test 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 two brushes of his release always 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.039
 of course not 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.219
 they sent me these two that one is 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 exactly what I bought and this bigger 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.300
 genius who is equal to this little one or the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.420
 little gon greater 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.629
 these gum green line brushes are the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 veganism is a philosophy of life in 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.700
 where people refuse to eat 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.760
 or the bear any kind of animal thing is 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.350
 This they want to take care of, they want them. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.610
 do not want animals to be 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.570
 explored so they refuse to eat 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:25.530
 annum , which has containing eggs 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 beef milk and so on 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.939
 here in germany there are enough people 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 which follows this philosophy of life 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:38.939
 This is the p88. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.920
 the bristles are light synthetic and it has 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.939
 the diagonal cut 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.130
 This brush is good for some things. 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.799
 and the interesting thing about him is that he has 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 this point here that goes into any 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.159
 pouting 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.280
 I can already say that I loved this one. 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.340
 brush because it fits right 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.360
 in this little corner of the eye that is 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.659
 It's difficult for you and I do not 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.170
 Spread the word and I'll go 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:12.810
 setting the concealer all the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.209
 face flecks and tapped 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.099
 and emphasizes this potential is 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.010
 Great because it does not need you anymore. 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.890
 scrub both to melt the product and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.890
 the product half disappears 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.160
 he already does this role so I thought it was cool 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.830
 and a lot of people do not like messing with 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.120
 Fingers because psi will come out which is a 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.370
 faster thing 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.319
 the brush is good for this because you do not 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.519
 so dirty your finger because the finger too 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.890
 Can you apply a concealer on a good 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.220
 but the brush in one more shape is more 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:52.080
 but it stays cleaner, right. 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.799
 Now that's 88 of which is a brush 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.130
 two in one is just that because he 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:03.330
 does several functions 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.319
 the acronym has released this from here that is the whole 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.680
 world knows wef 80 wonderful is one 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.400
 brush that you spread very well your 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.790
 base is your baby with m 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:22.620
 your beach is wonderful only that 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:26.280
 from here he already does his job and another 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:29.190
 function because it has a diagonal cut 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.269
 he has this right tip that will 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.450
 fit everything that is pouting to 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:41.190
 pass your base 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:43.709
 it will apply its base very well as 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:47.220
 well how much of this one is going to give 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.630
 perfect finish because he has this 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.799
 diagonal cut 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:55.340
 You'll be able to get a blush to do. 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.340
 an outline 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.850
 so really he's a two in 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.500
 one is that hi try more fb 34 than 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:09.930
 Remember that is the one that people apply 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.220
 blanche makes the outline and if that is more 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.639
 equal to that 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.959
 so the question is the following I go 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.940
 buy two brushes if in this one I 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.410
 I already have the function of these two 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:29.030
 no you do not need because really 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:31.460
 This is a cool place. 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.180
 principle I 'm already using this brush 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.840
 there is a time and what I could notice in it 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:44.540
 only thing different from himself is that he 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:47.360
 do not the movement is circular as well 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.000
 How much the one that I have more 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.970
 ease in doing so these 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.600
 moves down and pulling to give 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:01.190
 but it is not as comfortable as it is 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:04.790
 This one from here and it inserts was very legal and 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.100
 gives a wonderful finish but this one 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.410
 here also gives a wonderful finish 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.720
 and if you want to make moves 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.360
 circular with it also gives only 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.350
 just so a little too much difference 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.330
 very little 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:21.590
 if I had to buy one of the two I 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.470
 buy this again because it ft 31/8 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.970
 has millions of functions and I do not 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.910
 would need to spend money on this 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.480
 although I have the most brush and I have 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.330
 two of him and brush also sometimes never 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.340
 It's too much because I always tell you wando. 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.610
 Or are you laziness aside now? 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.980
 to clean something I noticed is 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:46.400
 especially when we applied base 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:49.880
 corrective they do not loose certain in their 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.890
 face as some brushes drop more 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.010
 also in the first few 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.060
 normal because when they make the cut 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:01.910
 some certain fall inside and are 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.960
 And then you think you're falling. 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.660
 bristles 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:08.930
 What can not happen is being you. 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.990
 wash type 56 times and keep falling 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.100
 I already think it's a 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.070
 problem 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.260
 the sigma company super reliable i will never 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:22.280
 I had problem with them they always me 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:25.580
 responds means and so the service is 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:28.040
 note ten but usually I'm taxed 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.080
 every time I buy on top because 

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.600
 here in germany is a little 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.990
 different they take more do not want them 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.320
 pay more attention 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:40.170
 one and ends up happening when the sigma 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:43.020
 did not discriminate the exact value that 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.300
 you bought a value below and 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:47.910
 send as if it were present 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:51.000
 I was not taxed but now I do not know the 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.400
 What happened to sigma? 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.350
 company and put the value is 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.250
 exactly what you told then 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:02.730
 risk is much higher and there is nothing 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.630
 People can do is risk their luck. 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.250
 same 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:08.190
 I'll leave the sigma link here. 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:12.030
 underneath and give them a pass there 

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:14.430
 they released but the sanitary shade as well 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.930
 It's also interesting, I 'm crazy about 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.460
 to experiment 

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.130
 I hope this video has helped 

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:22.200
 some people who were in doubt and 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:26.210
 I gave a kiss to everyone and to the 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.210
 next video salt
