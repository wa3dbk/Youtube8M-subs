00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
hi welcome to Josh trees my name is

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.120 
hi welcome to Josh trees my name is
Bruce<00:00:07.080> we're<00:00:07.440> going<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:07.799> do<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> little

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Bruce we're going to do a little

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.339 
Bruce we're going to do a little
demonstration<00:00:08.400> today<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.510> how<00:00:09.780> to<00:00:09.840> plant<00:00:10.200> a

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
demonstration today on how to plant a

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.620 
demonstration today on how to plant a
400<00:00:10.830> liter<00:00:11.070> tree<00:00:11.309> first<00:00:11.790> step<00:00:12.090> would<00:00:12.330> be<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
400 liter tree first step would be to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.360 
400 liter tree first step would be to
ensure<00:00:12.780> that<00:00:12.960> your<00:00:13.290> tree<00:00:13.530> complies<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
ensure that your tree complies for the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.210 
ensure that your tree complies for the
landscape<00:00:14.820> architect's<00:00:15.360> specifications<00:00:16.320> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
landscape architect's specifications you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.279 
landscape architect's specifications you
can<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.699> we've<00:00:18.000> got<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.210> yardstick<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.020> bag

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
can see we've got a yardstick in the bag

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.550 
can see we've got a yardstick in the bag
yeah<00:00:19.910> we<00:00:20.910> hold<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> up<00:00:21.779> against<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.230> tree

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
yeah we hold it up against the tree

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.390 
yeah we hold it up against the tree
every<00:00:22.980> mark<00:00:23.490> denotes<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.449> half<00:00:24.600> meter<00:00:25.369> so<00:00:26.369> you

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
every mark denotes a half meter so you

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.939 
every mark denotes a half meter so you
can<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> tree<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.990> over<00:00:28.560> four

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
can see that this tree is over four

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.820 
can see that this tree is over four
meters<00:00:29.310> tall<00:00:29.580> probably<00:00:30.140> up<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> five<00:00:31.619> meters

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
meters tall probably up to five meters

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.180 
meters tall probably up to five meters
and<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.579> caliper<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.239> tree<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.890> at<00:00:34.890> least

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
and the caliper the tree is at least

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
and the caliper the tree is at least
fourteen<00:00:35.700> centimeters<00:00:36.260> thirty<00:00:37.260> centimeters

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
fourteen centimeters thirty centimeters

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.240 
fourteen centimeters thirty centimeters
from<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.850> base<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.540> tree<00:00:39.829> right<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.100> what

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
from the base of the tree right so what

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
from the base of the tree right so what
we<00:00:41.399> gonna<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.180> gonna<00:00:42.360> measure<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.899> height

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
we gonna do we gonna measure the height

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.220 
we gonna do we gonna measure the height
of<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> bag<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:45.059> level<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> soil<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
of the bag and the level of the soil and

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.709 
of the bag and the level of the soil and
compare<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.610> what<00:00:48.030> we've<00:00:48.329> got<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.629> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
compare it to what we've got in the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.110 
compare it to what we've got in the
ground<00:00:48.989> alright<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.489> see<00:00:50.700> we're

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
ground alright as you can see we're

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
ground alright as you can see we're
gonna<00:00:51.210> need<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> add<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> little<00:00:52.260> bit<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.469> soil

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
gonna need to add a little bit of soil

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
gonna need to add a little bit of soil
because<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.399> very<00:00:53.640> important<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
because it's very important that the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
because it's very important that the
height<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.110> root<00:00:55.289> ball<00:00:55.530> should<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.190> at<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
height of the root ball should be at the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.779 
height of the root ball should be at the
same<00:00:57.120> level<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> side<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.070> hole<00:00:59.250> due

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
same level with the side of the hole due

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.670 
same level with the side of the hole due
to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> nature<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.690> soil<00:01:00.960> here<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.530> is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
to the nature of the soil here which is

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.609 
to the nature of the soil here which is
really<00:01:02.039> poor<00:01:02.309> we've<00:01:03.300> excavated<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:04.049> big<00:01:04.229> square

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
really poor we've excavated a big square

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.010 
really poor we've excavated a big square
hole<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.129> we're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.330> add<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> potting

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
hole and we're going to add a potting

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.470 
hole and we're going to add a potting
soil<00:01:07.260> into<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> hole

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.420 

okay<00:01:17.480> so<00:01:17.540> now<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.320> soil<00:01:18.590> level<00:01:19.010> inside<00:01:19.370> the

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
okay so now the soil level inside the

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.930 
okay so now the soil level inside the
hole<00:01:21.010> corresponds<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.340> mark<00:01:22.580> that<00:01:22.790> we've

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
hole corresponds to the mark that we've

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.390 
hole corresponds to the mark that we've
made<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.450> stick<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:24.830> ensure<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.250> the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
made on the stick to ensure that the

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.040 
made on the stick to ensure that the
tree<00:01:25.640> is<00:01:25.880> planted<00:01:26.090> at<00:01:26.510> the<00:01:26.540> correct<00:01:26.930> height

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
tree is planted at the correct height

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.050 
tree is planted at the correct height
right<00:01:27.980> so<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.280> next<00:01:28.490> step<00:01:28.700> will<00:01:28.880> be<00:01:28.940> cutting

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
right so the next step will be cutting

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.900 
right so the next step will be cutting
of<00:01:29.480> the<00:01:29.600> bag<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:30.920> we'll<00:01:31.250> cut<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:31.670> roots

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
of the bag and then we'll cut the roots

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.540 
of the bag and then we'll cut the roots
and<00:01:32.210> move<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.020> tree<00:01:33.230> into<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.650> hole<00:01:33.830> all

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
and move the tree into the hole all

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.700 
and move the tree into the hole all
right<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:34.970> now<00:01:35.090> we've<00:01:35.270> removed<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.720> bag<00:01:35.990> it's

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
right so now we've removed the bag it's

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.760 
right so now we've removed the bag it's
important<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.340> note<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.710> tree<00:01:39.710> is

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
important to note that the tree is

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.400 
important to note that the tree is
completely<00:01:40.100> root<00:01:40.700> siddhart

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
completely root siddhart

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.630 
completely root siddhart
there's<00:01:42.410> a<00:01:42.530> nice<00:01:42.740> root<00:01:43.040> ball<00:01:43.250> that's<00:01:43.430> been

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
there's a nice root ball that's been

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.000 
there's a nice root ball that's been
formed<00:01:43.940> one<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> most<00:01:45.200> important<00:01:45.740> steps

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
formed one of the most important steps

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.070 
formed one of the most important steps
of<00:01:46.250> container-grown<00:01:46.790> trees<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.690> cut<00:01:47.900> that

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:48.080 
of container-grown trees is to cut that

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.590 
of container-grown trees is to cut that
root<00:01:48.350> ball<00:01:48.560> so<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.369> roots<00:01:49.580> don't<00:01:49.910> continue<00:01:50.450> to

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
root ball so the roots don't continue to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.200 
root ball so the roots don't continue to
circle<00:01:50.869> and<00:01:51.260> they<00:01:51.650> spread<00:01:51.920> out<00:01:52.030> inside<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
circle and they spread out inside the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.109 
circle and they spread out inside the
hole<00:01:53.390> so<00:01:54.080> we<00:01:54.590> normally<00:01:54.800> make<00:01:55.220> about<00:01:55.550> four

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
hole so we normally make about four

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:10.510 
hole so we normally make about four
slits<00:01:56.390> down<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.869> root<00:01:57.050> ball<00:02:09.399> excellent<00:02:10.399> so

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
slits down the root ball excellent so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.220 
slits down the root ball excellent so
now<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.729> tree<00:02:11.240> is<00:02:11.300> ready<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.720> go<00:02:11.870> into<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
now the tree is ready to go into the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.440 
now the tree is ready to go into the
hole<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.650> common<00:02:13.100> misconception<00:02:13.880> is<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.090> with

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
hole a common misconception is that with

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.080 
hole a common misconception is that with
a<00:02:14.480> 400<00:02:14.959> liter<00:02:15.110> tree<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:16.250> need<00:02:16.400> equipment<00:02:16.700> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
a 400 liter tree you need equipment to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.060 
a 400 liter tree you need equipment to
get<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.269> tree<00:02:17.600> into<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.959> hole<00:02:18.230> I'll<00:02:18.769> show<00:02:19.010> you

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
get the tree into the hole I'll show you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.790 
get the tree into the hole I'll show you
how<00:02:19.730> easy<00:02:20.000> it<00:02:20.209> is<00:02:20.300> to<00:02:20.510> plant<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:20.959> tree<00:02:21.140> with

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
how easy it is to plant this tree with

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:32.940 
how easy it is to plant this tree with
just<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.130> few<00:02:22.310> guys

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.410

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
this way all right now the big thing

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.900 
this way all right now the big thing
blessing<00:03:01.650> you've<00:03:01.890> got<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.100> center<00:03:02.520> in<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
blessing you've got a center in the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.699 
blessing you've got a center in the
whole<00:03:03.090> turn<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.720> tree<00:03:03.959> so<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.320> fork<00:03:04.560> is

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
whole turn this tree so the fork is

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.770 
whole turn this tree so the fork is
facing<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.280> way<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.970> need<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.360> turn<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
facing that way so you need to turn it a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:14.360 
facing that way so you need to turn it a
little<00:03:06.959> more

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.120 

little<00:03:15.270> more<00:03:15.480> yeah

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.940 

okay<00:03:23.120> that's<00:03:23.480> cool<00:03:23.810> all<00:03:24.320> right<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:24.770> we've

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
okay that's cool all right so now we've

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.170 
okay that's cool all right so now we've
got<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.250> tree<00:03:25.460> in<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.670> hole

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
got the tree in the hole

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.750 
got the tree in the hole
got<00:03:27.020> the<00:03:27.140> orientation<00:03:27.890> right<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.370> we've<00:03:28.730> got

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
got the orientation right and we've got

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.360 
got the orientation right and we've got
it<00:03:29.230> leveled<00:03:30.230> out<00:03:30.380> like<00:03:30.620> we<00:03:30.770> want<00:03:30.920> it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
it leveled out like we want it

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.840 
it leveled out like we want it
check<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> planting<00:03:32.660> depth<00:03:32.870> again<00:03:33.850> planting

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850 
check the planting depth again planting

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.610 
check the planting depth again planting
depth<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.270> container<00:03:35.750> grown<00:03:36.020> trees<00:03:36.350> is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
depth in container grown trees is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.080 
depth in container grown trees is
probably<00:03:37.010> one<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.430> most<00:03:37.580> critical

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
probably one of the most critical

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.240 
probably one of the most critical
aspects<00:03:38.600> it's<00:03:39.260> really<00:03:39.680> important<00:03:40.160> that

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
aspects it's really important that

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.520 
aspects it's really important that
you're<00:03:40.550> able<00:03:40.580> to<00:03:40.940> see<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.510> root<00:03:41.720> arts<00:03:42.170> or<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
you're able to see the root arts or the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.060 
you're able to see the root arts or the
root<00:03:42.710> flare<00:03:42.950> and<00:03:43.340> that<00:03:44.090> when<00:03:44.560> you<00:03:45.560> finished

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
root flare and that when you finished

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.940 
root flare and that when you finished
your<00:03:46.370> final<00:03:46.970> finished<00:03:47.360> level<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:48.050> the<00:03:48.560> current

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
your final finished level is the current

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.040 
your final finished level is the current
level<00:03:49.310> at<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.700> tree<00:03:49.880> is<00:03:50.030> in<00:03:50.300> at<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> nursery

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
level at the tree is in at the nursery

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.070 
level at the tree is in at the nursery
that<00:03:51.290> is<00:03:51.980> a<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.370> important<00:03:52.790> point<00:03:53.080> right

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
that is a really important point right

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.840 
that is a really important point right
so<00:03:54.320> now<00:03:54.470> we've<00:03:54.860> got<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.280> tree<00:03:55.490> straight

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
so now we've got the tree straight

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.000 
so now we've got the tree straight
aligned<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:56.990> at<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> correct<00:03:57.770> orientation

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
aligned and at the correct orientation

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.000 
aligned and at the correct orientation
it's<00:03:59.000> time<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.480> add<00:03:59.630> the<00:03:59.660> back<00:03:59.990> fall<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:00.500> the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
it's time to add the back fall and the

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.070 
it's time to add the back fall and the
controlled<00:04:01.430> release<00:04:01.520> fertilizer<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.660> to

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
controlled release fertilizer and to

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.100 
controlled release fertilizer and to
compact<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.650> soil<00:04:03.980> as<00:04:04.100> we<00:04:04.220> go<00:04:04.810> right<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.020> you

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
compact the soil as we go right so you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.870 
compact the soil as we go right so you
can<00:04:06.260> see<00:04:06.500> they<00:04:06.800> add<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> little<00:04:07.310> bit<00:04:07.520> of<00:04:07.580> soil

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
can see they add a little bit of soil

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.180 
can see they add a little bit of soil
and<00:04:08.150> then<00:04:08.390> compact<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> soil<00:04:09.350> then<00:04:09.830> they<00:04:10.010> add

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
and then compact the soil then they add

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.370 
and then compact the soil then they add
a<00:04:10.220> little<00:04:10.490> bit<00:04:10.730> more<00:04:10.760> soil<00:04:11.330> compacted<00:04:12.050> as<00:04:12.200> they

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
a little bit more soil compacted as they

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.789 
a little bit more soil compacted as they
go<00:04:16.540> all<00:04:17.540> right<00:04:17.690> so<00:04:17.750> now<00:04:18.049> we've<00:04:18.260> filled<00:04:18.530> up<00:04:18.650> the

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
go all right so now we've filled up the

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.620 
go all right so now we've filled up the
hole<00:04:18.980> and<00:04:19.250> it's<00:04:19.400> important<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.940> note<00:04:20.150> that<00:04:20.180> you

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
hole and it's important to note that you

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.870 
hole and it's important to note that you
can<00:04:20.780> still<00:04:21.080> see<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.920> root<00:04:22.100> flare<00:04:22.370> over<00:04:22.670> here

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
can still see the root flare over here

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.330 
can still see the root flare over here
and<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.570> current<00:04:23.780> soil<00:04:24.170> level<00:04:24.530> that<00:04:24.980> the<00:04:25.160> tree

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
and the current soil level that the tree

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.520 
and the current soil level that the tree
was<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:25.850> when<00:04:26.150> it<00:04:26.270> was<00:04:26.420> in<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.600> nursery<00:04:27.050> which

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
was in when it was in the nursery which

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.040 
was in when it was in the nursery which
is<00:04:27.710> level<00:04:27.920> to<00:04:28.280> the<00:04:28.370> surrounding<00:04:28.940> ground<00:04:29.240> we're

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
is level to the surrounding ground we're

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.200 
is level to the surrounding ground we're
now<00:04:30.200> going<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.560> create<00:04:31.190> a<00:04:31.250> nice<00:04:31.460> dam<00:04:31.820> around

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
now going to create a nice dam around

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.210 
now going to create a nice dam around
the<00:04:32.330> tree<00:04:32.540> so<00:04:32.750> we<00:04:33.290> can<00:04:33.440> fill<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:33.710> up<00:04:33.830> with<00:04:34.040> water

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
the tree so we can fill it up with water

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.420 
the tree so we can fill it up with water
and<00:04:34.720> ensure<00:04:35.720> really<00:04:36.170> good<00:04:36.440> penetration<00:04:37.190> of

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
and ensure really good penetration of

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.240 
and ensure really good penetration of
that<00:04:37.640> water<00:04:38.020> we're<00:04:39.020> gonna<00:04:39.110> add<00:04:39.380> a<00:04:39.410> Molson<00:04:40.100> to

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
that water we're gonna add a Molson to

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.100 
that water we're gonna add a Molson to
the<00:04:40.340> top<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.730> just<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.480> help<00:04:41.660> with<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.930> weed

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
the top of that just to help with a weed

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.320 
the top of that just to help with a weed
