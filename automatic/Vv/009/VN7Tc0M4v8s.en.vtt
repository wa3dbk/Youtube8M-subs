00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
women when I design because I don't

really believe in seeing one person in

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.229 
really believe in seeing one person in
your<00:04:09.590> mind<00:04:09.859> when<00:04:10.190> you're<00:04:10.310> designing<00:04:10.549> because

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
your mind when you're designing because

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.050 
your mind when you're designing because
the<00:04:11.419> ideal<00:04:11.750> is<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.169> have<00:04:12.799> different<00:04:13.370> women<00:04:13.639> you

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
the ideal is to have different women you

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
the ideal is to have different women you
know<00:04:14.090> every<00:04:14.780> girl<00:04:15.019> can<00:04:15.049> find<00:04:15.530> that<00:04:15.680> she<00:04:15.829> wants

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.979 
know every girl can find that she wants
and<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.489> think<00:04:16.729> it's<00:04:16.909> the<00:04:17.359> collection<00:04:17.599> is<00:04:17.870> so
