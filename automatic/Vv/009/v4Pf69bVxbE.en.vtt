00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 70 years after the second world war 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:15.330
 in Europe , the smell of burning again and the most 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.900
 terrible about what could not think 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.439
 win or as well as the millions killed 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.710
 tortured fascist torture chambers 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:30.269
 concentration camps that we their heirs will 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:34.820
 shoot each other brother go to brother 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:38.489
 and will destroy it but it happened 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:44.010
 happened on earth plentifully watered 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:48.510
 blood winners spooky gift fallen 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.620
 and living terrible pain for the living 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.890
 veterans millennial history forever 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 rallied 3 kindred people of Belarusians 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.420
 Russian Ukrainians tragic events 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.680
 our brothers is our pain 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.619
 Belarus has already done a lot for this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 so that peace reigns in the Ukrainian land 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.010
 and we are ready to do even more for it 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.810
 all you need to stop this 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.890
 the war 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 if we are Slavs if we have reason 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.729
 do not agree do not decide what we 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.100
 no one else can help us 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:32.479
 generally humanly speaking dear 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.320
 veterans and not only veterans 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.920
 I want to say frankly all the parades and 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.189
 festive events good 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:48.619
 veterans appreciate it but if by and large 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:53.040
 we turned out to be bad heirs 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.490
 those who won that war we did not save 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.969
 didn't keep that country 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:04.040
 which they defended and moreover we 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:07.770
 unleashed on this land Slavic land 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.039
 unforgivable war for us and what 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.170
 before we realize it and we will do everything 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.280
 necessary to stop her and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:20.640
 repent while alive not only 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.260
 veterans but war veterans are better 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.260
 will be for our generation
