point<00:03:37.380> now<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.880> upper<00:03:39.180> is<00:03:39.390> a<00:03:39.450> lot<00:03:39.720> more

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
point now the upper is a lot more

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.310 
point now the upper is a lot more
breathable<00:03:40.350> than<00:03:40.410> than<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.430> back<00:03:41.580> ela<00:03:41.880> and

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
breathable than than the back ela and

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.380 
breathable than than the back ela and
Evo<00:03:43.320> in<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.560> bikina<00:03:44.010> so<00:03:44.550> more<00:03:44.910> breathable

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
Evo in the bikina so more breathable

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.650 
Evo in the bikina so more breathable
means<00:03:45.720> they<00:03:45.870> smell<00:03:46.470> slightly<00:03:46.980> less<00:03:47.190> and<00:03:47.660> over
