00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
impede fullest is pretty similar to that

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.250 
impede fullest is pretty similar to that
it's<00:00:57.970> just<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.270> ballista<00:00:58.930> changed<00:01:01.260> dsr

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260

it's just the ballista changed dsr
hardwired<00:01:02.710> is<00:01:02.890> usually<00:01:03.280> this<00:01:03.430> class<00:01:03.700> but<00:01:03.880> i

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
hardwired is usually this class but i

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.700 
hardwired is usually this class but i
changed<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:04.570> ACOG<00:01:04.930> ballistics<00:01:05.440> trying

those raid spawns try and get some stuff
yeah<00:01:20.110> a<00:01:20.380> support<00:01:21.370> class<00:01:21.490> now<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.850> think

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
yeah a support class now I think

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.430 
yeah a support class now I think
everyone<00:01:22.240> should<00:01:22.570> have<00:01:22.810> an<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:23.020> support<00:01:23.350> class

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
everyone should have an a support class

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.350 
everyone should have an a support class
on<00:01:23.710> every<00:01:24.130> game<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.340> should<00:01:24.550> be<00:01:24.880> able<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.150> take
