00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
shoe the first froma layout is they've

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.800 
shoe the first froma layout is they've
increased<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.939> flexibility<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
increased the flexibility of the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.109 
increased the flexibility of the
forefoot<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:50.040> made<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.430> shoe<00:01:50.670> quite<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
forefoot and they made the shoe quite a

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
forefoot and they made the shoe quite a
bit<00:01:51.329> lighter<00:01:51.540> than<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.439> first<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
bit lighter than the first one and it

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.120 
bit lighter than the first one and it
has<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.720> do<00:01:54.960> with<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.530> technology<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
has a lot to do with the technology that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.730 
has a lot to do with the technology that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.060 
they use down here to make it nice and
strong<00:01:59.009> but<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.490> light<00:01:59.969> weight<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.649> have

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
getting proper depth but I will

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.500 
getting proper depth but I will
attribute<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.920> lot<00:02:33.950> of<00:02:34.130> my<00:02:34.580> success<00:02:34.970> in<00:02:35.390> that

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510

area<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:36.740> these<00:02:36.950> shoes

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
area to these shoes

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.670 
area to these shoes
specifically<00:02:38.270> when<00:02:38.810> comparing<00:02:39.260> to<00:02:39.410> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
specifically when comparing to the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.010 
specifically when comparing to the
Fivefinger<00:02:40.100> shoes<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.700> wore<00:02:40.940> is<00:02:41.210> how

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
Fivefinger shoes that I wore is how

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.080 
Fivefinger shoes that I wore is how
stable<00:02:42.350> your<00:02:42.620> foot<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:42.980> my<00:02:43.310> foot<00:02:43.610> would<00:02:43.760> slide

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
stable your foot is my foot would slide

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.170 
stable your foot is my foot would slide
around<00:02:44.270> a<00:02:44.570> lot<00:02:44.720> in<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.140> Fivefinger<00:02:45.500> shoes

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
around a lot in the Fivefinger shoes

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.060 
around a lot in the Fivefinger shoes
because<00:02:47.180> as<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.600> squat<00:02:47.960> I<00:02:48.170> push<00:02:48.440> my<00:02:48.620> knees<00:02:48.860> out

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
because as I squat I push my knees out

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.670 
because as I squat I push my knees out
so<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.120> pressure<00:02:50.390> would<00:02:50.720> or<00:02:51.230> that<00:02:51.260> force

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
so that pressure would or that force

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.470 
so that pressure would or that force
would<00:02:51.920> transfer<00:02:52.280> to<00:02:52.430> my<00:02:52.550> feet<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
would transfer to my feet and I have to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.440 
would transfer to my feet and I have to
reset<00:02:53.930> my<00:02:54.230> foot<00:02:54.710> position<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.180> middle<00:02:56.300> of

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
reset my foot position in the middle of

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.660 
reset my foot position in the middle of
my<00:02:56.570> set<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.140> if<00:02:57.740> anybody's<00:02:58.280> had<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.520> go

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
my set and if anybody's had to go

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.130 
my set and if anybody's had to go
through<00:02:58.970> that<00:02:59.090> it's<00:02:59.390> not<00:02:59.600> really<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.110> best

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
through that it's not really the best

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.560 
through that it's not really the best
when<00:03:01.100> you're<00:03:01.190> squatting<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.820> with<00:03:02.330> these

whatever width you like it stays there

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.600 
whatever width you like it stays there
you<00:03:10.040> won't<00:03:10.160> have<00:03:10.220> to<00:03:10.400> worry<00:03:10.550> about

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
you won't have to worry about

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.000 
you won't have to worry about
repositioning<00:03:11.120> your<00:03:11.510> foot<00:03:11.870> you<00:03:12.560> feel<00:03:12.740> really

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
repositioning your foot you feel really

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.800 
repositioning your foot you feel really
stable<00:03:13.430> your<00:03:13.700> foot<00:03:14.000> does<00:03:14.210> it<00:03:14.360> feel<00:03:14.510> like<00:03:14.540> it's

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810

rolling<00:03:14.930> over<00:03:15.350> at<00:03:15.440> all<00:03:15.590> because<00:03:16.520> the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
rolling over at all because the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.280 
rolling over at all because the
containment<00:03:17.180> is<00:03:17.240> really<00:03:17.480> well<00:03:17.660> there's<00:03:18.110> two

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
containment is really well there's two

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.400 
containment is really well there's two
straps<00:03:19.240> this<00:03:20.240> strap<00:03:20.600> I<00:03:20.900> don't<00:03:21.200> really<00:03:21.320> think

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
straps this strap I don't really think

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.260 
straps this strap I don't really think
it<00:03:21.650> really<00:03:21.830> does<00:03:22.040> anything<00:03:22.520> unless<00:03:22.820> maybe<00:03:23.150> you

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
it really does anything unless maybe you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.670 
it really does anything unless maybe you
have<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> super<00:03:23.750> narrow<00:03:23.870> foot<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.350> leave<00:03:24.530> this

the other foot the upper is all

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.940 
the other foot the upper is all
synthetic<00:03:41.170> but<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.290> seems<00:03:42.500> like<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.709> really

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
synthetic but it seems like a really

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.010 
synthetic but it seems like a really
durable<00:03:43.490> synthetic<00:03:43.910> material<00:03:44.570> like<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.870> said

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
barely any marks at all so a lot of

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.440 
barely any marks at all so a lot of
people<00:03:54.490> complain<00:03:55.490> about<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.970> price<00:03:56.180> and

lot of places the price I think it's

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:03.880 
lot of places the price I think it's
worth<00:04:02.390> it<00:04:02.630> only<00:04:02.900> because<00:04:03.020> they'll<00:04:03.410> last<00:04:03.680> so

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
worth it only because they'll last so

worth it only because they'll last so
long<00:04:04.130> maybe<00:04:05.030> not<00:04:05.330> if<00:04:05.450> you're<00:04:05.600> doing<00:04:05.690> Olympic

cushion but surprisingly they're still
very<00:04:25.630> comfortable<00:04:26.220> especially<00:04:27.220> compared<00:04:27.610> to

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
very comfortable especially compared to

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.240 
very comfortable especially compared to
some<00:04:27.790> shoes<00:04:28.330> that<00:04:28.510> I<00:04:28.540> have<00:04:28.840> that<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.470> let's<00:04:30.130> say

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
some shoes that I have that I let's say

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.240 
some shoes that I have that I let's say
vulcanize<00:04:30.760> soles<00:04:31.410> my<00:04:32.410> feet<00:04:32.680> actually<00:04:32.860> feel

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
vulcanize soles my feet actually feel

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.060 
vulcanize soles my feet actually feel
better<00:04:33.430> in<00:04:33.730> these<00:04:33.910> there's<00:04:34.180> less<00:04:34.360> pressure<00:04:35.070> on

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
better in these there's less pressure on

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.610 
better in these there's less pressure on
the<00:04:36.520> ball<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:36.970> my<00:04:37.240> foot<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.750> these<00:04:38.020> then<00:04:38.410> in

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
the ball of my foot and these then in

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.470 
the ball of my foot and these then in
just<00:04:38.800> a<00:04:38.890> regular<00:04:39.040> flat<00:04:39.580> shoes<00:04:39.970> so<00:04:40.180> they<00:04:40.270> found

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
just a regular flat shoes so they found

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.710 
just a regular flat shoes so they found
the<00:04:40.660> way<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:41.530> keep<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:42.130> really<00:04:42.490> stable<00:04:42.760> but<00:04:43.480> yet

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
the way to keep it really stable but yet

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.450 
the way to keep it really stable but yet
or<00:04:43.990> still<00:04:44.200> have<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.620> level<00:04:45.010> of<00:04:45.100> cushioning

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
or still have a level of cushioning

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.340 
or still have a level of cushioning
which<00:04:45.640> I<00:04:45.760> really<00:04:46.180> don't<00:04:46.300> even<00:04:46.330> understand<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
which I really don't even understand the

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.000 
which I really don't even understand the
inside<00:04:47.800> is<00:04:47.980> really<00:04:48.250> padded<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:49.090> well<00:04:49.330> and

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
inside is really padded very well and

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.320 
inside is really padded very well and
your<00:04:51.010> foot<00:04:51.280> I<00:04:51.460> mean<00:04:51.850> you<00:04:51.940> could<00:04:52.090> wear<00:04:52.240> these

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
your foot I mean you could wear these

your foot I mean you could wear these
all<00:04:52.570> day<00:04:52.600> really<00:04:52.990> except<00:04:53.440> for<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.680> fact<00:04:53.980> that

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
all day really except for the fact that

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.180 
all day really except for the fact that
the<00:04:55.510> heel<00:04:55.720> is<00:04:55.750> raised<00:04:56.080> just<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.590> few<00:04:56.740> details

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
the heel is raised just a few details

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.350 
the heel is raised just a few details
I'll<00:04:57.880> show<00:04:59.160> the<00:05:00.160> bottom<00:05:00.700> of<00:05:00.820> them<00:05:01.000> they<00:05:01.120> say

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
I'll show the bottom of them they say

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.490 
I'll show the bottom of them they say
Nike<00:05:02.080> power<00:05:02.320> bridge<00:05:02.710> that's<00:05:03.670> what<00:05:03.820> they<00:05:03.940> call

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
Nike power bridge that's what they call

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.680 
Nike power bridge that's what they call
the<00:05:05.500> tech<00:05:06.250> for<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:06.940> heel<00:05:07.150> you<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:08.590> see<00:05:08.920> there

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
the tech for the heel you can see there

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.840 
the tech for the heel you can see there
and<00:05:10.690> then<00:05:11.020> also<00:05:11.290> something<00:05:12.130> I<00:05:12.310> just<00:05:12.640> found

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
and then also something I just found

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.050 
and then also something I just found
which<00:05:13.150> i<00:05:13.240> think<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.540> pretty<00:05:13.720> cool<00:05:14.790> it's<00:05:15.790> on<00:05:15.940> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
which i think is pretty cool it's on the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.460 
which i think is pretty cool it's on the
inside<00:05:17.610> it<00:05:18.610> might<00:05:18.760> be<00:05:18.880> hard<00:05:19.060> to<00:05:19.120> see<00:05:19.390> but<00:05:20.350> it

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
inside it might be hard to see but it

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.850 
inside it might be hard to see but it
says<00:05:20.620> go<00:05:20.860> forth<00:05:21.450> and<00:05:22.450> and<00:05:23.050> then<00:05:23.260> this<00:05:23.440> one<00:05:23.620> says

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
says go forth and and then this one says

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.140 
says go forth and and then this one says
dominate<00:05:25.830> on<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:27.100> inside<00:05:27.460> there<00:05:27.700> so<00:05:27.970> that's

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
dominate on the inside there so that's

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.380 
dominate on the inside there so that's
pretty<00:05:28.360> cool<00:05:29.040> I<00:05:30.040> would<00:05:30.640> say<00:05:30.850> if<00:05:31.060> you<00:05:31.150> have<00:05:31.240> to

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
pretty cool I would say if you have to

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.260 
pretty cool I would say if you have to
pick<00:05:31.570> between<00:05:31.720> these<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.470> Adi<00:05:32.740> power<00:05:33.270> lifting

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
pick between these and Adi power lifting

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.240 
pick between these and Adi power lifting
shoes<00:05:34.330> I<00:05:34.870> would<00:05:35.050> go<00:05:35.170> with<00:05:35.320> these<00:05:35.530> people<00:05:36.130> say

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
shoes I would go with these people say

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.190 
shoes I would go with these people say
they're<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.490> little<00:05:36.670> heavier<00:05:37.030> but<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.900> me<00:05:38.020> that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
they're a little heavier but to me that

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.390 
they're a little heavier but to me that
just<00:05:38.530> means<00:05:38.740> they're<00:05:38.950> a<00:05:38.980> little<00:05:39.100> more

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 
just means they're a little more

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.080 
just means they're a little more
well-built<00:05:40.060> and<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:42.460> me<00:05:42.580> they<00:05:42.730> just<00:05:42.760> look

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
well-built and to me they just look

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.440 
well-built and to me they just look
cooler<00:05:43.390> I<00:05:43.570> think<00:05:43.810> they're<00:05:43.930> cooler<00:05:44.140> shoes<00:05:44.470> and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450
