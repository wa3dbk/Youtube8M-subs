shot showing the first layer which is
the<00:01:24.030> silicone<00:01:24.479> i<00:01:24.930> believe<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.729> like<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the silicone i believe or like the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
the silicone i believe or like the
screen<00:01:27.210> protector<00:01:27.979> second<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> i<00:01:29.840> think<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
screen protector second a i think it's a

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.219

hardcore<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.520> plastic<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> then<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> third

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
hardcore like plastic and then the third

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.649 
hardcore like plastic and then the third

I think the microphone goes there or

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.880 
I think the microphone goes there or
maybe<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:31.290> know<00:02:31.410> it's

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
maybe that's it but I don't know it's

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.760

okay so here are pretty much the three

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.760 
okay so here are pretty much the three
layers<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.540> ipod<00:02:51.540> touch<00:02:51.770> otterbox

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
layers of the ipod touch otterbox

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.660 
layers of the ipod touch otterbox
defender<00:02:52.980> series<00:02:53.430> case<00:02:54.170> here's<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.350> back

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
defender series case here's the back

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.660 
defender series case here's the back
which<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.880> part<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.390> front<00:02:57.660> as<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.860> solid

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
which is part of the front as the solid

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.300 
which is part of the front as the solid
layer<00:02:59.910> of<00:03:00.090> plastic<00:03:00.710> it<00:03:01.710> already<00:03:02.040> has<00:03:02.130> the

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
layer of plastic it already has the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.490 
layer of plastic it already has the
silicon<00:03:02.850> already<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.750> screen<00:03:04.170> which<00:03:04.470> is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
silicon already on the screen which is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.650 
silicon already on the screen which is
good<00:03:04.860> so<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.790> way<00:03:05.910> you<00:03:05.970> can<00:03:06.150> protect<00:03:06.360> your

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
good so that way you can protect your

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380 
good so that way you can protect your
iPod<00:03:06.990> Touches<00:03:07.350> screen<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.090> the<00:03:09.090> rubberized

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
iPod Touches screen and the rubberized

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.740 
iPod Touches screen and the rubberized
layer<00:03:10.080> which<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.740> slides<00:03:11.370> on<00:03:11.580> over<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
layer which just slides on over it so

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.370 
layer which just slides on over it so
anyway<00:03:13.110> here's<00:03:13.920> my<00:03:14.100> ipod<00:03:14.459> touch<00:03:14.490> with<00:03:15.000> the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
anyway here's my ipod touch with the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.630 
anyway here's my ipod touch with the
case<00:03:16.380> from<00:03:16.800> phillips<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.700> very<00:03:18.690> good<00:03:18.990> one<00:03:19.200> but

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
case from phillips a very good one but

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.890 
case from phillips a very good one but
definitely<00:03:20.640> held<00:03:20.910> through<00:03:21.180> for<00:03:21.390> a<00:03:21.420> while<00:03:21.630> now

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
definitely held through for a while now

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.920 
definitely held through for a while now
it's<00:03:22.890> time<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.190> upgrade<00:03:23.340> so<00:03:24.209> just<00:03:24.600> hold<00:03:24.720> on<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it's time to upgrade so just hold on a

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.500 
it's time to upgrade so just hold on a
second<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.440> i'll<00:03:26.070> probably<00:03:26.340> speed<00:03:27.120> through

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
second and i'll probably speed through

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.190 
second and i'll probably speed through
the<00:03:28.130> upgrade<00:03:29.130> process<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> case<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.810> just

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
the upgrade process of the case so just

00:03:31.200 --> 00:04:01.620 
the upgrade process of the case so just
hold<00:03:31.350> on

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.890 

okay<00:04:02.630> so<00:04:02.690> pretty<00:04:03.050> much<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.680> had<00:04:04.340> a<00:04:04.700> pretty<00:04:05.540> easy

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
okay so pretty much I had a pretty easy

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.040 
okay so pretty much I had a pretty easy
time<00:04:06.350> getting<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:07.310> case<00:04:07.550> on<00:04:07.820> but<00:04:08.450> it<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:09.020> a

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
time getting the case on but it is a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.230 
time getting the case on but it is a
little<00:04:09.260> bit<00:04:09.440> tricky<00:04:09.740> on<00:04:09.890> to<00:04:10.490> get<00:04:10.670> on<00:04:10.820> at<00:04:11.000> first

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:11.240 
little bit tricky on to get on at first

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.270 
little bit tricky on to get on at first
but<00:04:11.540> once<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.930> get<00:04:12.050> it<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.320> there<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.860> know

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
but once you get it on there you know

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.990 
but once you get it on there you know
instantly<00:04:14.180> your<00:04:15.020> ipod<00:04:15.410> touch<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:16.000> extremely

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
protected there's a layer of silicon

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.900 
protected there's a layer of silicon
here<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.230> plastic<00:04:21.800> holding<00:04:22.160> it<00:04:22.280> in<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.790> of

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910

here the plastic holding it in and of
course<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.330> rubberized<00:04:23.600> layer<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:25.040> dropping

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000
