that's<00:00:35.910> quite<00:00:36.120> simple<00:00:36.360> enough<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.750> cool<00:00:37.710> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that's quite simple enough right cool so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.770 
that's quite simple enough right cool so
this<00:00:38.070> Lobby<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.550> pretty<00:00:39.030> much<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.300> same<00:00:39.510> as

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
this Lobby is pretty much the same as

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.959 
this Lobby is pretty much the same as
sky<00:00:40.200> wars<00:00:40.469> except<00:00:40.860> I've<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.370> added<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.790> few

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
sky wars except I've just added a few

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
sky wars except I've just added a few
blocks<00:00:42.210> changed<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.410> way<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.590> looks<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
blocks changed it the way it looks and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.420 
blocks changed it the way it looks and
made<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> more<00:00:45.120> symmetrical<00:00:45.750> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.860> cool

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
made it more symmetrical kind of so cool

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.000 
made it more symmetrical kind of so cool
so<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.420> stiff<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.170> has<00:00:49.440> four

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so this stiff this one has four

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.040 
so this stiff this one has four
different<00:00:50.460> arenas<00:00:51.090> all<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.570> which<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
different arenas all of which are the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.160 
different arenas all of which are the
exact<00:00:52.590> same<00:00:52.710> arena<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.570> copied<00:00:54.870> four

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
exact same arena I just copied four

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.500 
exact same arena I just copied four
different<00:00:55.559> times<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.340> can<00:00:56.640> replay<00:00:57.180> this

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
different times I so you can replay this

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.869 
different times I so you can replay this
four<00:00:58.199> times<00:00:58.469> without<00:00:58.980> having<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.399> restart<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
four times without having to restart the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
four times without having to restart the
map<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.300> specific<00:01:00.989> arena<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.829> let's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
map for that specific arena also let's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.039 
map for that specific arena also let's
take<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> very<00:01:02.640> quick<00:01:02.879> look<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.300> park<00:01:03.539> or<00:01:03.809> if

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
take a very quick look at the park or if

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.170 
take a very quick look at the park or if
we<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.379> through<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
we go through here you can see that this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.130 
we go through here you can see that this
parkour<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.110> cloud<00:01:07.979> featured<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.030> half<00:01:09.689> mowie

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
parkour is cloud featured so half mowie

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.500 
parkour is cloud featured so half mowie
I<00:01:10.439> believe<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.340> going<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> try<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:11.939> tackle<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
I believe is going to try and tackle it

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
I believe is going to try and tackle it
this<00:01:12.810> parkour<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.470> relatively<00:01:14.070> easy<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
this parkour is relatively easy now the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.760 
this parkour is relatively easy now the
last<00:01:15.600> couple<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.960> ones<00:01:16.140> were<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> bit<00:01:16.530> too

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
last couple of ones were a bit too

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.410 
last couple of ones were a bit too
difficult<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:18.060> were<00:01:18.119> too

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
difficult and they were too

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
difficult and they were too
time-consuming<00:01:18.860> I've<00:01:19.860> made<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.610> be

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
time-consuming I've made this to be

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.719 
time-consuming I've made this to be
quite<00:01:21.210> simple<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.070> tricky<00:01:23.580> as

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
quite simple and but kind of tricky as

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.330 
quite simple and but kind of tricky as
well<00:01:23.970> there's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> few<00:01:24.869> ones<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.439> look<00:01:25.770> simple

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
well there's a few ones that look simple

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.039 
well there's a few ones that look simple
but<00:01:26.369> you've<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.180> you've<00:01:27.659> gotta<00:01:27.840> put<00:01:28.020> a

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
but you've got I like you've gotta put a

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
but you've got I like you've gotta put a
lot<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.290> time<00:01:28.530> into<00:01:28.799> thinking<00:01:29.280> if<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.759> can

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
lot of time into thinking if you can

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
lot of time into thinking if you can
make<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> jump<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.630> how<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.930> jump<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.710> like

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
make a jump and how you jump it like

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.210 
make a jump and how you jump it like
where<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> jump<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.030> from<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.840> he

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
where you jump it from so you can see he

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.490 
where you jump it from so you can see he
he<00:01:35.220> misunderstood<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.240> one<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
he misunderstood that one there so if I

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
he misunderstood that one there so if I
very<00:01:37.710> quickly<00:01:37.890> go<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.090> show<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
very quickly go down here to show you

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.620 
very quickly go down here to show you
what<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.869> lobbies<00:01:40.590> look<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.390> see

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
what the lobbies look like you can see

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.020 
what the lobbies look like you can see

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
server so that is a non-issue but you

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.600 
server so that is a non-issue but you
know<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:53.710> have<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.010> deal<00:02:54.130> with<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.460> like<00:02:54.580> a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.910 
know you have to deal with it for like a
30<00:02:55.360> seconds<00:02:55.930> or<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.080> and<00:02:56.380> then<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.620> will

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
30 seconds or so and then it will

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.880 
30 seconds or so and then it will
eventually<00:02:57.660> disappear<00:02:58.660> so<00:02:59.260> one<00:02:59.380> last<00:02:59.530> thing<00:02:59.680> I

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
eventually disappear so one last thing I

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.950 
eventually disappear so one last thing I
