00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
the different blues different greens on

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.500 
the different blues different greens on
the<00:00:19.740> brown<00:00:19.949> background<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.789> i'm<00:00:21.150> not<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> huge

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the brown background and i'm not a huge

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.840 
the brown background and i'm not a huge
brown<00:00:21.840> Finn<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.550> think<00:00:23.760> it's

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
brown Finn and this is just I think it's

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.580 
brown Finn and this is just I think it's
a<00:00:23.939> beautiful<00:00:24.330> print<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.350> first

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a beautiful print so the first

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.550 
a beautiful print so the first
combination<00:00:26.189> would<00:00:26.939> be<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.480> guess<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
combination would be I guess this is a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
combination would be I guess this is a
pretty<00:00:28.800> obvious<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.640> brown<00:00:29.849> with<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
pretty obvious one to brown with the

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.229 
pretty obvious one to brown with the
blue<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> brown<00:00:31.380> Robin<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.460> Robin<00:00:32.940> doesn't

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
blue the brown Robin the Robin doesn't

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
blue the brown Robin the Robin doesn't
match<00:00:33.570> any<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> colors<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.860> but

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
match any of the colors on this but

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.220 
match any of the colors on this but
nonetheless<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.820> coordinates<00:00:36.450> because<00:00:36.690> of

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
nonetheless it coordinates because of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.830 
nonetheless it coordinates because of
the<00:00:37.500> brown<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.610> actual<00:00:38.940> drip<00:00:39.270> drops<00:00:39.510> print

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the brown in the actual drip drops print

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.500 
the brown in the actual drip drops print
the<00:00:40.530> next<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.010> would<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.879> black<00:00:42.210> earth

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the next one would be the black earth

the next one would be the black earth

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
the solid Navy another one would be the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:17.990 
the solid Navy another one would be the
brown<00:01:16.799> champagne<00:01:17.310> even<00:01:17.610> though<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.700> has<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
brown champagne even though it has the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
brown champagne even though it has the
champagne<00:01:18.390> lining<00:01:18.750> its<00:01:18.869> though<00:01:19.110> Brownsville

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
champagne lining its though Brownsville

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.969 
champagne lining its though Brownsville
coordinates<00:01:20.100> very<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> brown<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.799> Earth

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
coordinates very well the brown of Earth

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.070 
coordinates very well the brown of Earth
Mother<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.400> think<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> looks<00:01:24.240> phenomenal<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
Mother I think this looks phenomenal and

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.960 
Mother I think this looks phenomenal and
I<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.350> honestly<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.850> with

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
I actually honestly really like it with

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
I actually honestly really like it with
the<00:01:27.090> black<00:01:27.390> um<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.500> even<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.130> more

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
the black um I think even a little more

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.249 
the black um I think even a little more
than<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.700> with<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.150> brown<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.780> course

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
than I do with the brown but of course

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.780 
than I do with the brown but of course
this<00:01:31.439> matches<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.250> looks<00:01:32.460> great

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
this matches and this looks great

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.469 
this matches and this looks great
together<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:35.369> last<00:01:35.610> one<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
together and the last one this is the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.719 
together and the last one this is the
same<00:01:36.960> print<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.650> different<00:01:38.159> in<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
same print in a different in the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.850 
same print in a different in the
different<00:01:38.759> colors<00:01:39.509> though<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.710> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
different colors though so I think this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.310 
different colors though so I think this
would<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.070> great<00:01:41.460> if<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.759> twins<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.780> if

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
would be great if you have twins or if

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.190 
would be great if you have twins or if
you<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> boy<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> girl<00:01:44.250> um<00:01:44.930> either<00:01:45.930> way

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you have a boy and a girl um either way

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.960 
you have a boy and a girl um either way
