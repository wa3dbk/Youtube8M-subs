00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.140
 hi my name is Rafaela crepaldi the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.269
 makeup artist and creator of born brazil 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.240
 today we will do a look with the 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.740
 clear the fol collection look the look 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.359
 will enter now in the second semester 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.159
 now at the end of the year 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.079
 so there are some products that 

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:35.840
 people are launching the collection and one of them 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.550
 it is prudent to try to show more than this 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.100
 super fine base 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.750
 so I'll make the skin with her 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.210
 intention is to actually make a correction 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.010
 only in the area you need 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.609
 as well as other base of the other 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:53.260
 The idea is to apply with the 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:59.239
 spread the base in my hand and I came 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.519
 spreading slowly with this new super 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.879
 moisturizer she will maintain a super skin 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.650
 and the idea is to keep this 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.579
 lightness of the skin so I will not 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.579
 work with no dust 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.870
 I always like to still run a little 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.940
 dirty of applying base money as well 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:22.090
 on the eyelid can serve because it serves 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.470
 as a base for shade after I go 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.800
 let some apply a concealer 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.410
 here a game on the rest of base by 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.810
 from the base where he had left it in 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.760
 The tones combine with each other. 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.470
 that the right tone of the collective 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.770
 now I'll make the correction where I think 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.840
 necessary that it is the eye region here 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.280
 around the nose and a little bit in the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:48.940
 region make you the eye when in the shadows 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.390
 silver here 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.530
 elielton silver half on the side of everything 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.140
 this process 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.320
 to actually cast shadow so that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.619
 she's cool and firm and stronger. 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.040
 with the entire surface of the fault, right? 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:13.480
 now I've been thinking a little bit cuter 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:15.790
 work it back in the fifth concave 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.690
 Gradient zinho let die so 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.690
 very coarse 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 I'll apply the black pencil could only 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.140
 earn just to make a light with toninho 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.660
 Warm help waiting a little bit 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 lower lashes people are also 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.370
 It's important to see that I 'm not joking. 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.250
 lakes 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.370
 inside the water line applying hot 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.340
 aid but on the outside of a 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.440
 more fluffy 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.530
 I came here with the cuddly brush still 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.930
 with just a little shadow of his 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.700
 shade silver and I will reapply for 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.650
 up pencil here not to let it 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.370
 get very strong I'll pass a pencil 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.110

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.670

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.570

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.430

 now I'm going to wear a pink blush more 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.210
