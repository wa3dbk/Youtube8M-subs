entrence<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.210> 100<00:00:06.629> sample<00:00:06.990> is<00:00:07.109> called<00:00:07.379> but<00:00:07.620> for

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
entrence a 100 sample is called but for

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.799 
entrence a 100 sample is called but for
now<00:00:08.130> I'm<00:00:08.340> assuming<00:00:08.460> it's<00:00:08.880> black<00:00:09.090> ops<00:00:09.300> 2<00:00:09.540> and

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
now I'm assuming it's black ops 2 and

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.180 
now I'm assuming it's black ops 2 and
today<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.139> want<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.469> talk<00:00:10.650> about<00:00:10.800> some<00:00:11.070> of<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
perks that potentially going to be in

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.839 
perks that potentially going to be in
the<00:00:13.049> game<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.500> firstly<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.190> want<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.549> start<00:00:14.790> off

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the game so firstly I want to start off

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.340 
the game so firstly I want to start off
by<00:00:14.910> talking<00:00:15.120> about<00:00:15.420> stopping<00:00:15.839> power<00:00:15.960> because

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
by talking about stopping power because

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680 
by talking about stopping power because
this<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.980> more<00:00:17.369> or<00:00:17.430> less<00:00:17.550> official<00:00:18.060> no<00:00:18.330> david

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690

vonderhaar<00:00:18.840> has<00:00:19.260> been<00:00:19.439> tweeting<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:19.830> it

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
vonderhaar has been tweeting about it

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.250 
vonderhaar has been tweeting about it
basically<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> think<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.570> started<00:00:21.869> out<00:00:21.960> isn't

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
basically I think that started out isn't

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.840 
basically I think that started out isn't
going<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.619> making<00:00:22.769> a<00:00:22.949> return<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.400> yet<00:00:23.640> again

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
going to be making a return it yet again

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.550 
going to be making a return it yet again
you<00:00:24.390> know<00:00:24.510> i'm<00:00:24.720> just<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.109> explain<00:00:25.500> what

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
you know i'm just going to explain what

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.259 
you know i'm just going to explain what
stopping<00:00:25.949> power<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.400> know<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.849> very

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
stopping power is you know it is very

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.400 
stopping power is you know it is very
possible<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.750> some<00:00:28.019> people<00:00:28.230> might<00:00:28.349> have

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
possible that some people might have

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.810 
possible that some people might have
picked<00:00:28.619> up<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> series<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.220> black<00:00:29.400> ops<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
picked up the series in black ops and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.820 
picked up the series in black ops and
they<00:00:30.359> don't<00:00:30.539> all<00:00:30.630> start<00:00:30.840> lowry<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.380> stopping

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
they don't all start lowry so stopping

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.709 
they don't all start lowry so stopping
power<00:00:32.009> basically<00:00:32.640> increased<00:00:33.120> your<00:00:33.360> bullet

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
power basically increased your bullet

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
power basically increased your bullet
damage<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> need<00:00:34.469> one<00:00:34.890> less<00:00:35.309> bullet<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
damage that you need one less bullet to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.060 
damage that you need one less bullet to
kill<00:00:36.000> an<00:00:36.210> enemy<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.110> i<00:00:37.290> believe<00:00:37.680> only

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
kill an enemy and it was i believe only

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
kill an enemy and it was i believe only

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
2 and the recent tweets from david

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.700 
2 and the recent tweets from david
vonderhaar<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> explained<00:00:43.469> why<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
vonderhaar kind of explained why it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
vonderhaar kind of explained why it
hasn't<00:00:44.040> been<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.640> series<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> recent

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
hasn't been in this series in the recent

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.720 
hasn't been in this series in the recent
years<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.710> basically<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.280> all<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.700> with

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
years so basically it's all to do with

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
years so basically it's all to do with
weapon<00:00:48.450> balance<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
weapon balance and I do think in the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.529 
weapon balance and I do think in the
last<00:00:50.250> couple<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.610> years<00:00:50.670> definitely<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.329> black

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
last couple of years definitely in black

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.209 
last couple of years definitely in black
ops<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> modern<00:00:52.890> warfare<00:00:53.039> 3

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
ops are you think in modern warfare 3

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.490 
ops are you think in modern warfare 3
there<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.449> good<00:00:54.780> kind<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.170> weapon

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
there is a really good kind of weapon

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.959 
there is a really good kind of weapon
balance<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.010> terms<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.489> damage<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.940> know

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
balance in terms of the damage you know

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
balance in terms of the damage you know
time<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.449> kill<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.660> stuff<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.170> all

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
time to kill and stuff like that all

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.069 
time to kill and stuff like that all
quite<00:00:59.070> similar<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.489> they<00:01:00.180> say<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.570> stopping

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
quite similar and they say that stopping

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.110 
quite similar and they say that stopping
power<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:01.680> distorts<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
power really distorts this because just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.910 
power really distorts this because just
think<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.750> black<00:01:04.049> ops<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.680> most

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
think in that black ops the most

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.500 
think in that black ops the most
powerful<00:01:05.189> gun<00:01:05.460> in<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> game<00:01:05.790> was<00:01:06.000> probably

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
powerful gun in the game was probably

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.510 
powerful gun in the game was probably
the<00:01:06.659> famas<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> assault<00:01:07.439> rifle<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.310> had

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the famas the assault rifle if you had

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
the famas the assault rifle if you had
stopped<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.360> gun<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.780> wouldn't<00:01:10.409> be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
stopped now on that gun it wouldn't be

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
stopped now on that gun it wouldn't be
fair<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> think<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.820> main

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
fair so I think that that's the main

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.550 
fair so I think that that's the main
reason<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.450> storm<00:01:12.750> now<00:01:12.900> isn't<00:01:13.260> coming<00:01:13.439> back

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
reason that storm now isn't coming back

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
reason that storm now isn't coming back
anymore<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.430> fact<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.850> can<00:01:14.970> make

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
anymore just the fact that you can make

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.789 
anymore just the fact that you can make
the<00:01:15.240> best<00:01:15.390> gun<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.869> much<00:01:16.049> better<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> be

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the best gun that much better and be

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
the best gun that much better and be
against<00:01:17.100> people<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.430> maybe<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.299> have<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
against people that maybe don't have the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.020 
against people that maybe don't have the
best<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.770> using<00:01:20.130> stopping<00:01:20.460> power<00:01:20.610> so

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
best on and on using stopping power so

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.280 
best on and on using stopping power so
yeah<00:01:21.150> we're<00:01:21.360> definitely<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> be

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
yeah we're definitely not going to be

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.100 
yeah we're definitely not going to be
seen<00:01:22.530> stopping<00:01:22.950> power<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.610> black<00:01:24.060> ops<00:01:24.240> 2<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
seen stopping power in black ops 2 and

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.510 
seen stopping power in black ops 2 and
also<00:01:25.350> won<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> other<00:01:25.770> reasons<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.250> stopping

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
also won the other reasons the stopping

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.830 
also won the other reasons the stopping
power<00:01:26.640> hasn't<00:01:26.939> been<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> game<00:01:27.450> it's

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
power hasn't been in the game it's

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
power hasn't been in the game it's
because<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.170> many<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.350> were<00:01:28.560> kind<00:01:28.799> of

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because too many people were kind of

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
because too many people were kind of
saying<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.790> almost<00:01:29.970> needed<00:01:30.420> stop

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
saying that you almost needed stop

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
saying that you almost needed stop
empowering<00:01:31.290> modern<00:01:31.560> warfare<00:01:31.710> 2<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.549> of

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
empowering modern warfare 2 to kind of

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.980 
empowering modern warfare 2 to kind of
compete<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.420> pretty<00:01:33.840> much

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
compete and it was pretty much

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
compete and it was pretty much
everyone's<00:01:34.500> second-tier<00:01:35.220> perkin<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.790> believe

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
everyone's second-tier perkin I believe

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
everyone's second-tier perkin I believe
that<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.540> kind<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.840> true<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.650> of

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that it's kind of true and this kind of

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.830 
that it's kind of true and this kind of
leads<00:01:37.920> me<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.310> another<00:01:39.060> point<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.630> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
leads me on to another point and that is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840 
leads me on to another point and that is
the<00:01:40.530> whole<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> stealth<00:01:41.340> perk<00:01:41.579> whether

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the whole kind of stealth perk whether

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.460 
the whole kind of stealth perk whether
it<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> ghosts<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.600> assessing<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.259> ghost

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it be ghosts or assessing it was ghost

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.560 
it be ghosts or assessing it was ghost
in<00:01:43.619> black<00:01:43.829> ops<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> his<00:01:44.610> assassin<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.299> modern

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
in black ops and his assassin in modern

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
in black ops and his assassin in modern
warfare<00:01:45.720> 3<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> think<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.220> perk<00:01:47.610> has

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
warfare 3 and I think that this perk has

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
warfare 3 and I think that this perk has
turned<00:01:48.479> into<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.869> power<00:01:49.049> park<00:01:49.380> in<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.740> game

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
turned into the power park in the game

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.819 
turned into the power park in the game
and<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.610> saw<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:50.939> kind<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.210> rise<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.049> black<00:01:52.649> ops

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and we saw it kind of rise in black ops

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
and we saw it kind of rise in black ops
as<00:01:53.100> soon<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.399> it<00:01:53.490> wasn't<00:01:53.700> stopping<00:01:54.030> power

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
as soon as it wasn't stopping power

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.510 
as soon as it wasn't stopping power
ghost<00:01:54.600> started<00:01:54.869> becoming<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.439> huge<00:01:56.130> huge

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
ghost started becoming a huge huge

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
ghost started becoming a huge huge
problem<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.689> think<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.409> big

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
problem and I think that one of the big

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.929 
problem and I think that one of the big
problems<00:01:58.710> was<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> was<00:01:59.579> so<00:01:59.729> dominant

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
problems was because it was so dominant

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.580 
problems was because it was so dominant
compared<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.540> other<00:02:00.689> perks<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.200> its<00:02:01.350> tier

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
compared to the other perks in its tier

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
compared to the other perks in its tier
it<00:02:01.799> was<00:02:01.890> in<00:02:02.040> Tier<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.390> Corran<00:02:03.390> where<00:02:03.570> exactly

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it was in Tier one Corran where exactly

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
it was in Tier one Corran where exactly
was<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.680> with<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.009> light<00:02:05.280> weight<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
was with it with like light weight and a

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.760 
was with it with like light weight and a
few<00:02:06.270> others<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.570> I<00:02:06.899> think<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> main<00:02:07.469> way<00:02:07.619> they

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
few others but I think the main way they

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.589 
few others but I think the main way they
could<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.039> helped<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.670> black<00:02:08.910> ops<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
could have helped that in black ops with

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.089 
could have helped that in black ops with
Britain<00:02:09.929> ghost<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> same<00:02:10.830> tier<00:02:11.069> as

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
Britain ghost in the same tier as

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.360 
Britain ghost in the same tier as
sleight<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.550> hand<00:02:11.819> because<00:02:11.940> sly

sleight of hand because sly

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.339 
sleight of hand because sly
hand<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.700> such<00:02:13.269> powerful<00:02:13.569> bug<00:02:13.810> especially<00:02:14.260> in

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
hand is such powerful bug especially in

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.350 
hand is such powerful bug especially in
black<00:02:14.500> ops<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:14.860> had<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.190> faster<00:02:15.670> aim<00:02:16.090> down

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
black ops we had the faster aim down

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.180 
black ops we had the faster aim down

sight and the quick reload they have

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.789 
sight and the quick reload they have
split<00:02:18.459> it<00:02:18.549> up<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.879> a<00:02:18.970> modern<00:02:19.239> warfare<00:02:19.390> 3<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.590> in

does seem to be a very powerful pergi
seems<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.690> be<00:02:34.780> getting<00:02:34.959> stronger<00:02:35.379> every<00:02:35.650> year

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
seems to be getting stronger every year

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.380 
seems to be getting stronger every year
especially<00:02:36.370> this<00:02:36.760> year<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> fact<00:02:37.299> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
especially this year the fact that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.630 
especially this year the fact that
assassin<00:02:37.959> pro<00:02:38.200> groans<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.340> many

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
assassin pro groans you so many

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.130 
assassin pro groans you so many
abilities<00:02:39.970> I<00:02:40.360> think<00:02:40.540> it's<00:02:40.750> something<00:02:41.049> like

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
abilities I think it's something like

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.710 
abilities I think it's something like
you<00:02:41.440> on<00:02:42.159> top<00:02:42.190> of<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.700> normal<00:02:43.150> assassin<00:02:43.599> you

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
you on top of the normal assassin you

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.539 
you on top of the normal assassin you
you<00:02:43.959> get<00:02:44.110> like<00:02:44.230> nine<00:02:44.500> extra<00:02:44.920> benefits<00:02:45.370> that

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
you get like nine extra benefits that

felt the need to run it in modern
warfare<00:02:58.030> 3<00:02:58.299> though<00:02:58.690> everyone<00:02:59.379> looks<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.799> a

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
warfare 3 though everyone looks that a

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:01.140 
warfare 3 though everyone looks that a
mini-map<00:03:00.159> they're<00:03:00.370> looking<00:03:00.609> for<00:03:00.760> red<00:03:00.909> dots

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
mini-map they're looking for red dots

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.280 
mini-map they're looking for red dots
and<00:03:01.390> as<00:03:01.510> soon<00:03:01.659> as<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:01.840> appear<00:03:02.079> on<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
and as soon as you appear on the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.930 
and as soon as you appear on the
mini-map<00:03:02.500> you're<00:03:03.159> as<00:03:03.220> good<00:03:03.340> as<00:03:03.459> dead<00:03:03.489> because

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
mini-map you're as good as dead because

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.330 
mini-map you're as good as dead because
it<00:03:04.060> only<00:03:04.180> takes<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.170> fraction<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.890> second<00:03:06.250> to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
it only takes a fraction of a second to

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
it only takes a fraction of a second to
kill<00:03:06.519> people<00:03:06.640> in<00:03:06.909> modern<00:03:07.120> warfare<00:03:07.269> 3<00:03:07.450> so<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
kill people in modern warfare 3 so I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.690 
kill people in modern warfare 3 so I
definitely<00:03:08.650> say<00:03:09.040> that<00:03:09.069> something<00:03:09.430> needs<00:03:09.640> to

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
definitely say that something needs to

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.910 
definitely say that something needs to
be<00:03:09.730> done<00:03:09.819> about<00:03:10.000> it<00:03:10.150> whether<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.230> be<00:03:11.260> bringing

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
be done about it whether it be bringing

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.289 
be done about it whether it be bringing
something<00:03:12.099> to<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.370> our<00:03:12.459> back<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:13.120> cut<00:03:13.269> a

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
something to have our back to cut a

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:14.819 
something to have our back to cut a
combat<00:03:13.659> it<00:03:13.780> looks<00:03:14.170> like<00:03:14.290> that's<00:03:14.409> not<00:03:14.620> going<00:03:14.680> to

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
combat it looks like that's not going to

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.379 
combat it looks like that's not going to
happen<00:03:14.950> well<00:03:15.549> maybe<00:03:15.730> they<00:03:15.879> could<00:03:16.060> just<00:03:16.090> split

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
happen well maybe they could just split

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:18.059 
happen well maybe they could just split
up<00:03:16.480> anymore<00:03:16.810> they<00:03:17.019> did<00:03:17.200> try<00:03:17.410> modern<00:03:17.739> warfare<00:03:17.889> 3

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
up anymore they did try modern warfare 3

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.400 
up anymore they did try modern warfare 3
they<00:03:18.730> tries<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.419> split<00:03:19.599> up<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.989> you<00:03:20.079> know<00:03:20.200> had

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
they tries to split up that you know had

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.650 
they tries to split up that you know had
blind<00:03:20.680> eye<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.040> assassin<00:03:21.579> and<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> point<00:03:22.540> i

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
blind eye and assassin and to a point i

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.569 
blind eye and assassin and to a point i
think<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.930> works<00:03:23.200> but<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.980> think<00:03:24.220> that

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
think that works but just think that

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.190 
think that works but just think that
assassin<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.299> his<00:03:25.419> own<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.780> gave<00:03:25.900> too<00:03:26.109> many

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
assassin on his own just gave too many

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.229 
assassin on his own just gave too many
benefits<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:26.829> i<00:03:27.040> was<00:03:27.549> wondering<00:03:27.579> what<00:03:28.090> you

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
benefits so i was wondering what you

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.030 
benefits so i was wondering what you
guys<00:03:28.269> think<00:03:28.660> they<00:03:28.780> could<00:03:29.019> do<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.410> make<00:03:29.919> this

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
guys think they could do to make this

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.460 
guys think they could do to make this
stealth<00:03:30.280> bug<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.730> lot<00:03:31.030> less<00:03:31.329> powerful<00:03:31.690> i<00:03:31.989> think

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
stealth bug a lot less powerful i think

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.080 
stealth bug a lot less powerful i think
the<00:03:32.650> one<00:03:32.859> thing<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.370> black<00:03:33.579> ops<00:03:33.730> had<00:03:33.910> going

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
the one thing the black ops had going

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.849 
the one thing the black ops had going
for<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.450> even<00:03:34.750> though<00:03:34.959> ghost<00:03:35.230> was<00:03:35.440> so<00:03:35.620> powerful

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
for it even though ghost was so powerful

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.339 
for it even though ghost was so powerful
was<00:03:36.609> the<00:03:36.790> Blackbird<00:03:37.180> because<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.900> park<00:03:38.109> ghost

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
was the Blackbird because the park ghost

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.530 
was the Blackbird because the park ghost
did<00:03:38.769> encounter<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.310> Blackbird<00:03:39.669> risen<00:03:40.329> modern

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
did encounter the Blackbird risen modern

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.809 
did encounter the Blackbird risen modern
warfare<00:03:40.690> 3<00:03:41.069> assassin<00:03:42.069> count<00:03:42.250> as<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.400> advanced

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
warfare 3 assassin count as the advanced

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.939 
warfare 3 assassin count as the advanced
UAV<00:03:43.000> so<00:03:43.480> that's<00:03:44.049> problem<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.560> only<00:03:44.769> thing

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
UAV so that's problem the only thing

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.199 
UAV so that's problem the only thing
that<00:03:45.099> where<00:03:45.220> he<00:03:45.250> counted<00:03:45.609> ballot<00:03:45.849> /<00:03:46.000> was<00:03:46.180> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
that where he counted ballot / was the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.449 
that where he counted ballot / was the
counter<00:03:46.540> UAV<00:03:46.660> not<00:03:47.650> a<00:03:47.680> lot<00:03:47.799> of<00:03:47.829> people<00:03:47.980> run<00:03:48.280> that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
counter UAV not a lot of people run that

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.520 
counter UAV not a lot of people run that
which<00:03:48.609> I<00:03:48.730> was<00:03:48.879> very<00:03:49.060> pleased<00:03:49.540> about<00:03:49.690> but<00:03:49.989> yeah

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
which I was very pleased about but yeah

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.229 
which I was very pleased about but yeah
I<00:03:50.560> think<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.949> Blackbird<00:03:51.340> really<00:03:51.699> saved<00:03:51.970> black

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
I think the Blackbird really saved black

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.210 
I think the Blackbird really saved black
ops<00:03:52.449> just<00:03:53.109> meant<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.349> everyone<00:03:53.739> was<00:03:53.889> visible

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
ops just meant that everyone was visible

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.009 
ops just meant that everyone was visible
and<00:03:54.430> I'd<00:03:54.489> really<00:03:54.730> kind<00:03:55.000> of<00:03:55.120> sped<00:03:55.690> up<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.810> game

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
and I'd really kind of sped up the game

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:57.930 
and I'd really kind of sped up the game
made<00:03:56.199> it<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.349> lot<00:03:56.500> less<00:03:56.709> stealthy<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.730> what<00:03:57.879> do

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
made it a lot less stealthy so what do

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.339 
made it a lot less stealthy so what do
you<00:03:58.000> think<00:03:58.180> they<00:03:58.299> could<00:03:58.449> do<00:03:58.569> in<00:03:58.780> black<00:03:58.989> ops<00:03:59.230> 2

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
you think they could do in black ops 2

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:01.619 
you think they could do in black ops 2
to<00:04:00.220> stop<00:04:00.430> post<00:04:00.699> you<00:04:00.879> know<00:04:01.000> would<00:04:01.239> it<00:04:01.269> be<00:04:01.449> to

to stop post you know would it be to

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.210 
to stop post you know would it be to
bring<00:04:01.810> back<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.079> Blackbird<00:04:02.500> would<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.160> be

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
bring back the Blackbird would it be

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.589 
bring back the Blackbird would it be
something<00:04:03.400> else<00:04:03.519> do<00:04:03.760> they<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.180> nerf<00:04:04.389> the

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
something else do they have to nerf the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.240 
something else do they have to nerf the
whole<00:04:04.750> ghost<00:04:04.930> kind<00:04:05.199> of<00:04:05.290> perk<00:04:05.440> do<00:04:05.980> they<00:04:06.099> have<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250
