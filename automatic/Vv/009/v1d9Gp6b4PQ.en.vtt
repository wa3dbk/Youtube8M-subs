run<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.559> newer<00:00:37.710> Corvettes<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.610> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
run one of the newer Corvettes like I do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.139 
run one of the newer Corvettes like I do
stay<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.210> c5<00:00:39.739> generation<00:00:40.739> c6<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:41.969> on
