00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.210 
measured azle now it's making me look
really<00:02:10.229> stupid<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.890> all<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.160> these

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
really stupid here that all of these

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.040 
really stupid here that all of these
players<00:02:11.489> have<00:02:11.670> got<00:02:11.849> big<00:02:12.000> increases<00:02:12.450> whereas

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
players have got big increases whereas

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.790 
players have got big increases whereas
all<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.200> previous

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
all the previous

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.860 
all the previous
so<00:02:13.890> they<00:02:14.100> did<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.550> anyway<00:02:14.790> Motors<00:02:15.480> oh<00:02:15.660> here

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
so they did but anyway Motors oh here

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.320 
so they did but anyway Motors oh here
does<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.350> an<00:02:16.560> increase<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.130> 11<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:17.940> don't

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
does have an increase of 11 but I don't

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.910 
does have an increase of 11 but I don't
think<00:02:18.510> his<00:02:18.690> stats<00:02:18.930> have<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.440> had<00:02:19.710> that

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
think his stats have actually had that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740 
think his stats have actually had that
much<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> change<00:02:20.430> now<00:02:20.700> his<00:02:21.150> pace<00:02:21.390> has<00:02:21.600> gone

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
much of a change now his pace has gone

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.480 
much of a change now his pace has gone
down<00:02:21.930> for<00:02:22.230> his<00:02:22.710> dribbling<00:02:23.100> has<00:02:23.250> stayed<00:02:23.460> the

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
down for his dribbling has stayed the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.280 
down for his dribbling has stayed the
same<00:02:23.610> his<00:02:24.270> shooting<00:02:24.600> has<00:02:24.750> gone<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.020> one

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
same his shooting has gone up one

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.830 
same his shooting has gone up one
defending<00:02:26.190> has<00:02:26.310> gone<00:02:26.490> down<00:02:26.670> eight<00:02:26.910> passing<00:02:27.660> up

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
defending has gone down eight passing up

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.560 
defending has gone down eight passing up
six<00:02:28.200> and<00:02:28.440> heading<00:02:28.830> down<00:02:28.860> free<00:02:29.430> so<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
six and heading down free so really the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.540 
six and heading down free so really the
only<00:02:30.780> thing<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.320> go<00:02:31.500> up<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.830> his<00:02:31.980> passing<00:02:32.460> and

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
only thing to go up is his passing and

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.970 
only thing to go up is his passing and
everything<00:02:33.210> has<00:02:33.420> gone<00:02:33.570> up<00:02:33.750> gone<00:02:34.320> down<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.770> more

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
everything has gone up gone down at more

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.680 
everything has gone up gone down at more
than<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.430> would<00:02:35.550> take<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.850> be<00:02:36.240> a<00:02:36.270> six

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
than what it would take to be a six

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.560 
than what it would take to be a six
difference<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.350> really<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.970> anything<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
difference so really if anything that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.320 
difference so really if anything that
card<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.080> at<00:02:40.260> 76<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.070> basically<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.910> same<00:02:41.940> as

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
card is at 76 is basically the same as

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.050 
card is at 76 is basically the same as
that<00:02:42.750> 87<00:02:43.380> card<00:02:43.590> which<00:02:43.770> is<00:02:43.920> absolutely<00:02:44.370> madness

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that 87 card which is absolutely madness

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.510 
that 87 card which is absolutely madness
that<00:02:45.390> plague<00:02:45.660> can<00:02:45.840> gain<00:02:46.020> 11<00:02:46.530> ratings<00:02:46.680> and<00:02:47.130> his

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
that plague can gain 11 ratings and his

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.460 
that plague can gain 11 ratings and his
card<00:02:47.820> barely<00:02:48.300> changed<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.720> mean<00:02:48.900> last<00:02:49.110> season's

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
card barely changed I mean last season's

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.890 
card barely changed I mean last season's
card<00:02:49.710> for<00:02:49.860> him<00:02:49.980> was<00:02:50.460> better<00:02:50.820> every<00:02:51.330> rating<00:02:51.720> was

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
card for him was better every rating was

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.720 
card for him was better every rating was
better<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.500> he<00:02:52.890> still<00:02:53.160> saved<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.520> same

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
better and he still saved the same

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.520 
better and he still saved the same
rating<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.240> very<00:02:54.480> odd<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.290> just<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
rating as very odd but that's just the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.710 
rating as very odd but that's just the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
now this guy is an absolute tank and I

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.100 
now this guy is an absolute tank and I
didn't<00:03:01.920> realize<00:03:02.310> he<00:03:03.000> was<00:03:03.120> that<00:03:03.210> severe<00:03:03.630> for<00:03:03.900> so

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
didn't realize he was that severe for so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.870 
didn't realize he was that severe for so
long<00:03:04.290> before<00:03:04.500> he<00:03:04.830> joined<00:03:05.100> Barcelona<00:03:05.610> he<00:03:05.790> was

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
long before he joined Barcelona he was

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.610 
long before he joined Barcelona he was
that<00:03:06.000> severe<00:03:06.270> for<00:03:06.510> six<00:03:06.720> years<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.140> he's<00:03:07.470> now

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
that severe for six years and he's now

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.080 
that severe for six years and he's now
been<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.860> pastor<00:03:08.310> for<00:03:08.340> six<00:03:08.670> years<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.060> that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
been a pastor for six years so that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.970 
been a pastor for six years so that
seems<00:03:09.630> strange<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:10.020> me<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.470> seems<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.860> he's

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
seems strange to me it seems like he's

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.830 
seems strange to me it seems like he's
always<00:03:11.130> being<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.550> barter<00:03:11.880> guy<00:03:12.060> but<00:03:12.360> that's

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
always being a barter guy but that's

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.570 
always being a barter guy but that's
just<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.110> way<00:03:13.200> it<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.380> now<00:03:13.590> he<00:03:14.040> has<00:03:14.220> actually

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
just the way it is now he has actually

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.220 
just the way it is now he has actually
gone<00:03:14.700> down<00:03:14.760> for<00:03:15.330> ratings<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:15.840> he<00:03:15.930> stayed

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
gone down for ratings but he stayed

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.080 
gone down for ratings but he stayed
around<00:03:16.410> that<00:03:16.740> sort<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.010> 84<00:03:17.610> level<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.030> a

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
around that sort of 84 level that a

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.610 
around that sort of 84 level that a
has-been<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:18.690> they're<00:03:18.900> like<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.350> where<00:03:19.500> he

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
has-been that they're like it where he

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.640 
has-been that they're like it where he
went<00:03:19.739> 88<00:03:20.220> there<00:03:20.370> when<00:03:20.489> 84-86<00:03:21.360> 84<00:03:21.750> 84<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.500> it's

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
went 88 there when 84-86 84 84 so it's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.860 
went 88 there when 84-86 84 84 so it's
kind<00:03:22.890> of<00:03:22.950> fair<00:03:23.190> but<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.420> quick<00:03:24.660> look<00:03:24.690> see

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
kind of fair but have a quick look see

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.180 
kind of fair but have a quick look see
how<00:03:25.020> much<00:03:25.200> his<00:03:25.380> stats<00:03:25.590> have<00:03:25.739> changed<00:03:26.070> she's

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
how much his stats have changed she's

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.060 
how much his stats have changed she's
gone<00:03:26.340> 89<00:03:26.880> 290<00:03:27.420> so<00:03:27.600> plus<00:03:27.840> one<00:03:28.020> pace<00:03:28.290> dribblings

though<00:03:32.790> shooting<00:03:33.090> has<00:03:33.300> gone<00:03:33.480> down<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:34.080> his

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
though shooting has gone down for his

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.440 
though shooting has gone down for his
defending<00:03:35.100> has<00:03:35.220> gone<00:03:35.400> down<00:03:35.580> five<00:03:35.910> his<00:03:36.180> past

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
defending has gone down five his past

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.390

has<00:03:36.630> gone<00:03:36.840> down<00:03:37.050> for<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.709> his<00:03:37.860> head<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.190> has

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
has gone down for and his head in has

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.580 
has gone down for and his head in has
gone<00:03:38.640> up<00:03:38.880> one<00:03:39.120> so<00:03:39.300> in<00:03:39.420> general<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.930> does<00:03:40.380> seem

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
gone up one so in general it does seem

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.500 
gone up one so in general it does seem
like<00:03:40.650> he<00:03:40.800> has<00:03:41.010> made<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.250> down<00:03:41.550> downgrade<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
like he has made a down downgrade of

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.330 
like he has made a down downgrade of
about<00:03:42.900> force<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.380> does<00:03:43.620> make<00:03:43.800> sense<00:03:43.860> for<00:03:44.190> his

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
about force that does make sense for his

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.979 
about force that does make sense for his
overall<00:03:44.580> rating<00:03:44.970> as<00:03:45.090> well<00:03:45.510> but<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
overall rating as well but that is the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.750 
overall rating as well but that is the
