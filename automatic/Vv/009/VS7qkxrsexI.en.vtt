00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.580
 welcome to all reviews today 

00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.150
 I will present a brand new map found 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.150
 a few days ago 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:14.240
 the app should download it for those who have 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.769
 very little ram and therefore it is convenient 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.130
 for low-end mobile phones 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.490
 the app is called grimsey 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.770
 in a nutshell this application 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.230
 the applications hibernate the processes that 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.120
 are used in the processes in 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.180
 background therefore that spoil copper e 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:39.860
 implement the system now we will go to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:43.520
 let you see it then unlock 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.810
 perfect then this widget and this is it 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.829
 the application is called 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.700
 application 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.649
 let's take a more practical example 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:55.840
 to the youtube skin for the company also 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:01.280
 if there is no connection then 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:03.559
 expect that opens so oh well does not 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.860
 nothing the same for whatsapp then 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.799
 it will be opened even if not though 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.049
 intonation a good dinner we go to 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.390
 see where to know without skinny fi 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.400
 here are the two applications he had lost 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.130
 the first is not bernate 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.140
 what they are now on the waiting list 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.640
 means that this application 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.080
 horasan background and waste and ram thing 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.689
 make up options 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.530
 I simply use widgets that dig 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:37.369
 hibernate now that it will come and that it will come 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:42.590
 installed as soon as the application would have it 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.390
 unloaded we press here of course 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.430
 through root permissions for this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.780
 application and will be written whatsapp e 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.470
 youtube have been banned 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.060
 now if we enter we see these are all 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.430
 these applications are hibernated 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.290
 therefore they cannot go to occupy ram 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:03.170
 when they want then they are kissed now 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.280
 and the battery lasts longer is the mobile phone 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.739
 becomes a lot for active obviously a 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.360
 advice to this application used by 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.610
 only when the mobile is not the state 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.860
 using or when 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.060
 but only to go on calls and 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.820
 messages and do the very few ones 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.010
 things you normally do to go 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.140
 browse through everything else 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.090
 go crush applications and not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.460
 always hibernated when he used them 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.690
 so hibernate only at the end when 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.770
 you have finished making your ropes 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:42.400
 all good at the next review 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.400
