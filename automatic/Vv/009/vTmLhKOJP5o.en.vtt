Cosmo<00:05:46.870> pays<00:05:47.050> a<00:05:47.080> little<00:05:47.380> bit<00:05:47.560> faster<00:05:48.040> I<00:05:48.070> think

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
Cosmo pays a little bit faster I think

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.950 
Cosmo pays a little bit faster I think
maybe<00:05:48.790> because<00:05:48.940> it's<00:05:49.270> that<00:05:49.510> fast<00:05:49.720> you're<00:05:49.900> like

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
maybe because it's that fast you're like

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.320 
maybe because it's that fast you're like
it's<00:05:50.320> more<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:50.830> or<00:05:50.890> Grissom<00:05:51.430> attack<00:05:51.730> type<00:05:52.000> I

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
it's more of it or Grissom attack type I

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.150 
it's more of it or Grissom attack type I
think<00:05:52.990> there's<00:05:53.140> the<00:05:53.260> plastics<00:05:53.650> a<00:05:53.710> little<00:05:54.070> bit

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
think there's the plastics a little bit

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:01.200 
think there's the plastics a little bit
more<00:05:54.370> I<00:05:58.980> think<00:05:59.980> those<00:06:00.280> may<00:06:00.490> be<00:06:00.520> possible<00:06:01.030> and

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
more I think those may be possible and

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.880 
more I think those may be possible and
more<00:06:01.300> cheaper<00:06:01.750> but<00:06:02.110> I'm<00:06:02.380> just<00:06:02.500> gonna<00:06:02.620> stop

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
more cheaper but I'm just gonna stop

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.860 
more cheaper but I'm just gonna stop
hustling<00:06:03.190> right<00:06:03.310> now<00:06:03.610> what<00:06:04.420> is<00:06:04.570> this<00:06:04.660> one

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870
