00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.900
 the people of the here today to show a tip on the control of the use 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.919
 grand tour game duo 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:14.909
 a lot of people do not know that you have how you put on that and black ford bridge 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:15.789
 gt 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.169
 those settings for you access during the race 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.389
 but in the control itself it is like you only have here 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.899
 in settings 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.899
 options 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.860
 well-fed 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.860
 controller here at the cassolÃ£o 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.710
 the beautiful here 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.080
 you can choose 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.910
 the ideal condition 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.510
 when you use this function there you can enter the house 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.250
 to change eg config greeted traction control 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.450
 here in the case of roxana configured 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.690
 I'll do a demonstration of control 2 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 to better demonstrate 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.020
 in case here the configuration would be original 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.200
 so come on 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.460
 the calculation that I did in my what at least I thought was the best 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.980
 it's time to show here but it can be done in any other way 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.160
 but let's go 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.010
 first as if putting a world gate entered Sunday 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.570
 in the case of the lake 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:29.960
 what did he do 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.280
 you enter here 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.760
 in ideal proportion 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.240
 you have made this option for this in case the rice originally this function is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.560
 nothing abusive 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.010
 a game of being really has no intention at all 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.560
 so come on and here we go 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620
 to the place 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.960
 the menongue control 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.990
 come on 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.090
 and I know he has no function of the case 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.700
 I know it triggers the contact but this you can put on another button 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.770
 in my case it was an excellent test 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.730
 the car counts 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.839
 ef 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.839
 the one that we will put to the menu navigation 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.869
 period this number 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.629
 the discussion 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.629
 to choose - 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.769
 but most used analog then let's go 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.429
 here you put the justice of the country 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:36.349
 one more adjustment 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
 the adjustment - in the case 

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:42.489
 adjust more 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.159
 ready with these settings you can access the menu 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.589
 We can not work in a race. 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:00.589
 like that I did like that it actually works 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.879
 so come on 

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:20.099
 to give any clue just case 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.179
 give a demonstration 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:23.419
 in case here 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.759
 I'll leave it for example against extraction off 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 srf 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:32.179
 be on level five 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:35.999
 the goal diminished eric kisses and off to demonstrate how it works 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:38.999
 see you tomorrow 

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:17.249
 for example in the bragantino 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:19.819
 the boy appears 

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.159
 so it does not influence anything 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.069
 the player still can not 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:27.069
 annually in September 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.009
 after the provision 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.999
 and by increasing attraction 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:36.110
 now for example 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.229
 abs brake 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.559
 had not fired 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:40.849
 a half hour 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.479
 the amount paid 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.590
 frei did not lock 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.590
 to prove that it really 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.719
 average full letter 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.990
 you can adjust to all 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.479
 stability 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.479
 if you can do anything 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.360
 the barber 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.360
 the traction control in the case of guard duties 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.129
 is the stability control you can 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.509
 with abs 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:19.509
 up to level 10 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.990
 there you can control a level of foot precision 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.779
 the brakes for example 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.159
 can bring 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.379
 I usually stopped giving 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.379
 stronger than that of bringing at least one 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:36.620
 and the exits 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.530
 so I already messed up
