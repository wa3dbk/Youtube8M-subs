that thing it could be the second try
for<00:02:45.780> Riesling<00:02:47.150> it<00:02:48.150> looked<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.570> them<00:02:48.810> was<00:02:48.990> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
for Riesling it looked like them was a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530 
for Riesling it looked like them was a
possible<00:02:50.060> obstruction<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.450> think

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
possible obstruction well I think

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.330 
possible obstruction well I think
there's<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:51.840> clear<00:02:51.960> restriction<00:02:52.650> there<00:02:52.860> he's

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
there's a clear restriction there he's

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
there's a clear restriction there he's
got<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.490> head<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> ball<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.810> he's

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
got a head of the ball and he's

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.600 
got a head of the ball and he's
shepherding<00:02:55.350> him<00:02:55.470> off<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.740> ball<00:02:55.950> stopped<00:02:56.490> him

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
shepherding him off the ball stopped him

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.520 
shepherding him off the ball stopped him
getting<00:02:56.880> anywhere<00:02:57.210> near<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.780> don't<00:02:58.380> think

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
getting anywhere near I don't think

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.390 
getting anywhere near I don't think
there's<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.710> any<00:02:59.040> doubt<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.550> this<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.920> chain<00:03:05.220> is
