okay so here we are for part two of the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.620 
okay so here we are for part two of the
circular<00:02:32.010> tubular<00:02:33.140> Kapton<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:35.450> we've<00:02:36.450> got

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
circular tubular Kapton and we've got

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.270 
circular tubular Kapton and we've got
all<00:02:36.810> our<00:02:36.840> stitches<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.890> be<00:02:38.239> test<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
all our stitches to be test it on and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.430 
all our stitches to be test it on and
I've<00:02:41.280> stretched<00:02:41.700> them<00:02:42.030> around<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.019> reach

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
I've stretched them around so they reach

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.170 
I've stretched them around so they reach
all<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> way<00:02:43.920> around<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> needle<00:02:44.489> and<00:02:44.730> you

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
all the way around the needle and you

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.040 
all the way around the needle and you
can<00:02:45.330> see<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.610> little<00:02:47.880> they<00:02:48.750> look

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
can see that all of the little they look

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.960 
can see that all of the little they look
almost<00:02:49.380> excellent<00:02:50.010> knots<00:02:50.220> or<00:02:50.519> little<00:02:50.730> purl

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
almost excellent knots or little purl

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.110 
almost excellent knots or little purl
bumps<00:02:51.330> are<00:02:51.959> all<00:02:52.170> facing<00:02:52.470> in<00:02:52.950> pies<00:02:53.310> by<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> way

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
bumps are all facing in pies by the way

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.080 
bumps are all facing in pies by the way
around<00:02:54.390> so<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:55.290> it<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.920> that<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.489> cast<00:02:56.880> on

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
around so that's it for that the cast on

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.720 
around so that's it for that the cast on
isn't<00:02:57.540> twisted<00:02:57.720> which<00:02:58.230> which<00:02:58.739> because<00:02:59.459> if<00:02:59.610> it

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
isn't twisted which which because if it

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.280 
isn't twisted which which because if it
were<00:02:59.819> twisted<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:00.420> find<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:00.780> then<00:03:00.989> it

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
were twisted when you find it then it

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.220 
were twisted when you find it then it
would<00:03:01.440> make<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.769> Mobius<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.370> not<00:03:03.209> a<00:03:03.390> tube<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
would make a Mobius and not a tube and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.430 
would make a Mobius and not a tube and
we<00:03:04.769> wanted<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.900> want<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.140> make<00:03:07.230> sure
