the<00:02:34.490> little<00:02:34.730> latch<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:36.140> just<00:02:36.920> at<00:02:37.370> the<00:02:37.580> point

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
the little latch just just at the point

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.240 
the little latch just just at the point
where<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.540> first<00:02:38.810> put<00:02:39.050> the<00:02:39.140> hook<00:02:39.290> in<00:02:39.320> what<00:02:40.160> I'm

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
where I first put the hook in what I'm

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.520 
where I first put the hook in what I'm
going<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.490> do<00:02:40.670> is<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.210> bend<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.080> braid<00:02:42.320> back

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
going to do is just bend the braid back

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.950 
going to do is just bend the braid back
90<00:02:43.220> degrees<00:02:43.550> and<00:02:43.790> slide<00:02:44.360> it<00:02:44.510> down<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.690> needle

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
90 degrees and slide it down the needle

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.590 
90 degrees and slide it down the needle
and<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:45.590> can<00:02:45.740> see<00:02:45.950> now<00:02:46.190> that's<00:02:46.790> freed<00:02:47.210> up<00:02:47.420> that

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
and you can see now that's freed up that

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.710 
and you can see now that's freed up that
latch<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.380> I<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.650> now<00:02:48.860> put<00:02:49.190> in<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:50.090> material

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
latch and I can now put in this material

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.170 
latch and I can now put in this material
and<00:02:50.870> pull<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.410> back<00:02:51.560> through<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.850> I<00:02:52.880> use<00:02:53.150> for

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
and pull it back through what I use for

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.750 
and pull it back through what I use for
that<00:02:53.480> I've<00:02:54.230> got<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.440> cup<00:02:54.740> hook<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.340> I've<00:02:55.490> bent

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
that I've got a cup hook that I've bent

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.490 
that I've got a cup hook that I've bent
out<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.000> shape<00:02:56.210> so<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.810> sticks<00:02:57.080> out<00:02:57.290> from<00:02:57.410> the

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
out of shape so it sticks out from the

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.700 
out of shape so it sticks out from the
bench<00:02:57.850> and<00:02:58.850> what<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.000> do<00:02:59.120> is<00:03:00.080> I<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.260> put<00:03:00.530> my

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
bench and what I do is I just put my

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.930 
bench and what I do is I just put my
braid<00:03:01.520> round<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:02.390> pull<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.370> needle<00:03:04.730> back

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
braid round that I pull the needle back

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.300 
braid round that I pull the needle back
until<00:03:05.240> I<00:03:05.330> can<00:03:05.480> put<00:03:05.630> the<00:03:05.720> hook<00:03:05.900> round<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.410> close

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
until I can put the hook round it close

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.730 
until I can put the hook round it close
the<00:03:07.610> latch<00:03:07.790> over<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.390> what<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.200> fingers<00:03:09.560> over

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
the latch over it what the fingers over

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.340 
the latch over it what the fingers over
it<00:03:09.890> and<00:03:10.130> just<00:03:10.550> pull<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.480> needle<00:03:11.900> back<00:03:12.320> through

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
it and just pull the needle back through

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.130 
it and just pull the needle back through
the<00:03:12.830> braid<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.910> can<00:03:14.090> see<00:03:14.300> now<00:03:14.570> I've<00:03:14.840> got<00:03:15.110> a

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
the braid and you can see now I've got a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.410 
the braid and you can see now I've got a
nice<00:03:15.940> loop<00:03:16.959> attached<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.370> cup<00:03:19.550> hook<00:03:19.730> so

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
nice loop attached to the cup hook so

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.000 
nice loop attached to the cup hook so
what<00:03:20.540> I'm<00:03:20.630> going<00:03:20.780> to<00:03:20.840> do<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.410> just<00:03:21.620> trim<00:03:21.860> off

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
what I'm going to do is just trim off

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.710 
what I'm going to do is just trim off
the<00:03:22.220> excess<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.290> I've<00:03:24.680> now<00:03:24.890> made<00:03:25.360> the<00:03:26.360> front

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
the excess and I've now made the front

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.470 
the excess and I've now made the front
part<00:03:26.989> of<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.230> mount<00:03:27.610> which<00:03:28.610> is<00:03:28.640> the<00:03:28.910> part<00:03:29.150> as

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
part of the mount which is the part as

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.460 
part of the mount which is the part as
you<00:03:29.630> can<00:03:29.750> see<00:03:29.930> here<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.860> entire<00:03:31.160> line<00:03:31.459> too<00:03:32.470> so

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
you can see here the entire line too so

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.699 
you can see here the entire line too so
now<00:03:33.910> using<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.180> little<00:03:35.330> bauble<00:03:36.200> again<00:03:36.410> on<00:03:36.530> my

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
now using the little bauble again on my

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:43.270 
now using the little bauble again on my
gate<00:03:37.340> latch<00:03:37.550> needle<00:03:39.160> put<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.220> hook<00:03:40.370> in<00:03:42.280> this

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
gate latch needle put the hook in this

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.430 
gate latch needle put the hook in this
bit<00:03:43.670> can<00:03:43.880> be<00:03:44.030> tricky<00:03:44.950> okay

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.589 

push<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.650> up<00:03:52.800> inside<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.610> braid<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:54.150> as<00:03:54.300> I<00:03:54.390> say

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
push it up inside the braid and as I say

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.600 
push it up inside the braid and as I say
it<00:03:54.750> can<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.170> tricky<00:03:55.500> trickiest<00:03:56.040> one<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.489> do

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
it can be the tricky trickiest one to do

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.220 
it can be the tricky trickiest one to do
because<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.940> haven't<00:03:57.090> twisted<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.599> 290

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
because you haven't twisted it 290

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.809 
because you haven't twisted it 290
degrees

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
degrees

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:04.490 
degrees
push<00:03:59.819> it<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.180> inside<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:02.280> braid<00:04:02.519> again<00:04:03.500> once

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
push it up inside the braid again once

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.059 
push it up inside the braid again once
again<00:04:04.830> just<00:04:05.580> got<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.849> where<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> latch<00:04:06.300> shows

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
again just got to where the latch shows

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:15.770 
again just got to where the latch shows
pull<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.160> back<00:04:09.709> get<00:04:10.709> my<00:04:10.830> size<00:04:11.069> 10<00:04:11.910> trouble<00:04:14.780> but

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
pull it back get my size 10 trouble but

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.289 
pull it back get my size 10 trouble but
over<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.139> braid<00:04:16.380> going<00:04:17.370> back<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.790> my<00:04:17.910> hook<00:04:18.150> up

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
over the braid going back to my hook up

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.850 
over the braid going back to my hook up
with<00:04:18.419> one<00:04:18.660> hook<00:04:19.530> of<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.739> trouble<00:04:20.570> over<00:04:21.570> my<00:04:21.860> cup

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
with one hook of the trouble over my cup

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.400 
with one hook of the trouble over my cup
hook<00:04:23.060> pull<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.240> back<00:04:24.510> until<00:04:24.720> as<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.110> can<00:04:25.260> see

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
hook pull this back until as you can see

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.940 
hook pull this back until as you can see
the<00:04:25.560> latch<00:04:25.740> as<00:04:26.450> hooked<00:04:27.450> on<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.750> the<00:04:27.870> braid<00:04:28.110> put

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
the latch as hooked on to the braid put

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.950 
the latch as hooked on to the braid put
on<00:04:29.040> the<00:04:29.130> fingers<00:04:29.430> over<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.729> again<00:04:29.850> I'm<00:04:30.840> just

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
on the fingers over it again I'm just

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.650 
on the fingers over it again I'm just
putting<00:04:31.290> it<00:04:31.380> back<00:04:31.560> and<00:04:32.520> now<00:04:32.700> I've<00:04:33.300> got<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
putting it back and now I've got the

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.740 
putting it back and now I've got the
hook<00:04:33.870> trapped<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.040> there<00:04:35.280> with<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:36.210> bit<00:04:36.660> of

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
hook trapped on there with a bit of

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.210 
hook trapped on there with a bit of
excess<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.440> trim<00:04:37.650> off<00:04:37.770> so<00:04:37.979> I'll<00:04:38.040> just

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
excess just to trim off so I'll just

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.740 
excess just to trim off so I'll just
trim<00:04:38.370> that<00:04:38.430> off<00:04:41.120> so<00:04:42.120> there<00:04:42.270> we<00:04:42.389> go

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
trim that off so there we go

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.810 
trim that off so there we go
there's<00:04:43.080> the<00:04:43.229> one<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.650> made<00:04:44.250> earlier<00:04:44.280> and

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
there's the one I made earlier and

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.590 
there's the one I made earlier and
hopefully<00:04:46.160> you<00:04:47.160> can<00:04:47.220> see<00:04:47.370> they're<00:04:48.330> not<00:04:48.419> too

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
hopefully you can see they're not too

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.400 
hopefully you can see they're not too
far<00:04:48.870> out<00:04:48.900> in<00:04:49.680> size<00:04:51.440> now<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.500> can<00:04:53.040> put<00:04:54.410> super

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
far out in size now you can put super

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:01.070 
far out in size now you can put super

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
only problem I have with this is a lot

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.360 
only problem I have with this is a lot
of<00:05:03.810> super<00:05:04.169> boobs<00:05:04.350> aren't<00:05:04.530> waterproof<00:05:05.100> so<00:05:05.310> if

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
of super boobs aren't waterproof so if

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.690 
of super boobs aren't waterproof so if
you<00:05:05.460> use<00:05:05.669> your<00:05:05.850> flies<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.389> lot<00:05:07.370> if<00:05:08.370> you<00:05:08.430> fish

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
you use your flies a lot if you fish

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.460 
you use your flies a lot if you fish
hard<00:05:08.970> with<00:05:09.180> them<00:05:09.389> there's<00:05:09.810> every<00:05:10.020> chance<00:05:10.050> that

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
hard with them there's every chance that

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.810 
hard with them there's every chance that
that<00:05:10.590> will<00:05:10.770> break<00:05:10.950> down<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.190> eventually<00:05:11.520> the

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
that will break down and eventually the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.480 
that will break down and eventually the
braid<00:05:12.090> will<00:05:12.270> slip<00:05:12.650> you<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:13.979> if<00:05:14.160> you<00:05:14.310> want

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
braid will slip you can if you want

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.900 
braid will slip you can if you want
treat<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.479> with<00:05:15.600> something<00:05:15.870> like<00:05:16.910> nail

treat it with something like nail
varnish<00:05:18.539> I<00:05:18.780> believe<00:05:19.139> this<00:05:19.320> is<00:05:19.380> something<00:05:19.740> like

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
varnish I believe this is something like

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.520

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.890 
tied things commercially I like to use
some<00:05:29.100> cure<00:05:29.310> material<00:05:29.820> because<00:05:30.419> it's<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:30.690> same

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
some cure material because it's the same

stuff that repairs a wader so you think

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.629 
stuff that repairs a wader so you think
how<00:05:32.940> strong<00:05:33.210> your<00:05:33.360> way<00:05:33.479> to<00:05:33.539> repair<00:05:33.960> has<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.320> be

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
how strong your way to repair has to be

how strong your way to repair has to be
okay<00:05:35.639> no<00:05:36.419> I<00:05:36.450> do<00:05:36.660> it<00:05:37.020> has<00:05:37.200> put<00:05:37.380> a<00:05:37.410> little<00:05:37.889> dab<00:05:38.520> of

this over the braid okay and bearing in

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.060 
this over the braid okay and bearing in
mind<00:05:43.680> it's<00:05:44.039> UV<00:05:44.370> cured<00:05:45.530> so<00:05:46.530> if<00:05:46.740> this<00:05:46.860> was

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.070 
mind it's UV cured so if this was

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.330 
mind it's UV cured so if this was
ordinary<00:05:47.660> ordinary<00:05:48.660> way<00:05:48.840> to<00:05:48.900> repair<00:05:49.349> such<00:05:50.070> as
