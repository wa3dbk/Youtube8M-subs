00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.790
 Y 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.530
 what is happening 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.630
 good 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.630
 the man said 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.369
 good 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.200
 Goodnight 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.190
 a year ago 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.440
 the first thing that one imagines as the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.440
 male bachelor videos 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.530
 and priorities 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:06.830
 these priorities friends music alcohol 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.190
 endless of debauchery and nap and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.510
 madness 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:18.050
 and the product becomes the list 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.690
 study to work study more 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.940
 cook sleep they called to see if it's 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.640
 all good mom who calls you in blood 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.340
 to see if everything is fine 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.710
 and of course it is logical one comes from the field 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.729
 to the city and the first thing you imagine 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.360
 they are streets that never sleep lights for 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.360
 everywhere 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.830
 bowling from Wednesday to Sunday I 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.820
 I want to turn into going to encourage talent 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.900
 to defined 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:56.350
 the craziest thing that is once at home that 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.350
 do not finish 5 10 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 and last week that confuse a 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.950
 synagogue 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.420
 5 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:39.810
 but it would not be fine just recognize each other 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:42.510
 these bandits how to get you from the bowling 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.989
 to the mummy's house the lord and he would know with 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.989
 beer 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.290
 the bed made of the typical ama 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:05.920
 but good one 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.920
 I also had strange things 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:15.180
 bigger 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.180
 24 hours determined final and this color 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:25.100
 with the end 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:38.940
 running from the kitchen 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:41.030
 by checking the name of may someone 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:48.560
 explain to me then they bought heras 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.560
 because they are super intrusive 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.080
 as the world the truth 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:15.600
 and if it can or can not be repeated 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.600
 more images there are as disqualification 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.050
 you have the media with your spokesperson that yes 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:27.790
 you touch those beers are poor you 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.790
 they discriminate that they have hidden 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.340
 the laburo that consumes 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.310
 then have on the possibility that 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:49.729
 serves the decoration that came with color 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.729
 no cough and pains hermitages rocks 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.650
 that save or a decoration candle 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.470
 there is nothing sadder than once in the 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.010
 lifetime 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.010
 and not 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:19.020
 you're surrounded by stinkers in nothing of 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.020
 the most things 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:28.340

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.340
 taxation the 10-minute candle 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.810
 in the 2nd to learn 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:40.980
 discover a little dignity 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.980
 more or less people 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:49.830
 and meanwhile you take pictures I can not 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.450
 living alone 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.050
 At some point we are presented with the 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.050
 need 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:59.270
 As good as we do we look for the most 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:02.870
 like mom 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.410
 if the belief 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:10.960
 we have a belief there is no mom there is no 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:13.960
 for the line does not cook milanesas 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.960
 good 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:32.020
 and also not be leaving where 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:35.580
 things are the moves as a 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.580
 gray spot a carpet 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:48.640
 Take your time too 

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:48.640
 and then beat a coffee in balls 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.630
 from experience by experience 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.630
 they call the curtains
