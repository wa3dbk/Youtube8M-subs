 warehouses are ahead because he is the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.560

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:14.169
 coupling gas 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:20.650
 that's all there to answer with 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:23.739
 plastic then I see mine too 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.530
 expert look betrays me hand-painted yes 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.290
 the thank you that makes it for you 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.409
 makes a young man who is 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.650
 still practicing in training and how 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:35.939
 to say the fight is very good 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.170
 you really made it hans 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.790
 this is not some kind of foil on it 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.459
 bends and then after something with the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.620
 hand painted the hoppers now smell 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.769
 next time improves or that one 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.750
 may not make more of it now again 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.290
 to the seat I think that's totally fine 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.930
 made 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.030
 comfortable is not but that's the point 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.310
 Anyway, what is it? 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.780
 possible you have he also sits on me 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.400
 can already do 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.950
 are there any limits or what 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.019
 what types of leather can you use there 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.819
 the limit is actually just that 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.090
 the one who wants to spend orders 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:15.450
 on the front so up is as always 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.970
 quite indefinitely they are for 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.560
 10,000 euros will be rather difficult 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.150
 Hardly anyone have yourself open 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.970
 sees his so-called custom bikes 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:28.650
 not but it is pretty much possible 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.720
 for hall there are several providers 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.360
 the about catalogs available 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.460
 put is what is mounted here 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.639
 now everything from a supplier or 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.949
 Are you looking for that or the customer while 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.840
 that usually adjusts that 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.349
 There is a longer conversation mostly 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.030
 even several until the last decision 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.380
 it is the one you take then 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.440
 it is difficult, thank god very much 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.979
 many suppliers for this guest around 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.050
 parts 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.659
 it is not always available what 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.659
 It takes so from a manufacturer and 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:02.849
 the decision ultimately lies 

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:07.560
 somehow with me in agreement with the 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.180
 Customers what exactly to take but then 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.080
 So far, it has never been that case 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.990
 anyone has complained that he 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.909
 you do not like it in the case were 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.710
 many customers have no hair 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:22.260
 sit or write down all of them 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:24.750
 excited by the year is rather simple 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:30.000
 very much gray hair that does not like 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.190
 is black and that's it then 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.300
 a man like the owner of the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.670
 Good 50s is exactly what it would be 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.160
 then people breathe normal price 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.380
 limit and say what's up 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.600
 or come out there and say some 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.470
 There is no limit but it is not 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.930
 look like this 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.580
 The price is always discussed before 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.860
 and then you have to look how far you are now 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.830
 can go and gives in places 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.680
 spokesman the big one this more or 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.810
 less depending on what but certainly 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.870
 is that until now still during 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.820
 of the structure come again and again 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.410
 Customers and opportunities and then there is 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.850
 talk again and that will be the case 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.169
 a 1 1 percent there is only 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.810
 change we would build that up 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.910
 kostheimer race pace were now exhaust 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.020
 was just walking out back there would 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.740
 actually a very nice outbreak 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:22.160
 on it to the ruster outbreak of the show 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.419
 some money has been lost through the heat 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:26.310
 and of course a new exhaust 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:28.140
 on it new footrests and that takes 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.440
 would be weeks longer and more 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.970
 work to date on it is on is 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.290
 every case outstanding succeeded here 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.300
 makes me crazy too 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.229
 a bit away from these dull black ones 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.900
 stories 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.610
 I'm back on green cent and 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.380
 that is the typical statement of the 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:49.020
 my car driver is the black one 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:51.150
