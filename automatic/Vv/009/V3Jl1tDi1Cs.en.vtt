here and you can't remove it so
something<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.280> didn't<00:03:19.610> like<00:03:19.670> about<00:03:19.820> this<00:03:20.270> was

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
something I didn't like about this was

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.780 
something I didn't like about this was
the<00:03:20.690> antenna<00:03:22.030> because<00:03:24.010> it's<00:03:25.010> a<00:03:25.160> wiring

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
the antenna because it's a wiring

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.450 
the antenna because it's a wiring
so<00:03:26.120> instead<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.450> just<00:03:26.690> being<00:03:26.930> built<00:03:27.680> in<00:03:27.860> like

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
so instead of just being built in like

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.240 
so instead of just being built in like
that<00:03:28.700> sometimes<00:03:29.690> they<00:03:29.900> can<00:03:29.930> get<00:03:30.350> obstructed

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
that sometimes they can get obstructed

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.370 
that sometimes they can get obstructed
as<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.850> see<00:03:32.000> right<00:03:32.030> now<00:03:32.300> it's<00:03:32.450> off<00:03:32.570> already

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
as you see right now it's off already

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.910 
as you see right now it's off already
tangled<00:03:34.040> so<00:03:34.790> that's<00:03:35.150> that's<00:03:35.630> that's<00:03:36.290> that's<00:03:36.830> a

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
tangled so that's that's that's that's a

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.450 
tangled so that's that's that's that's a
bit<00:03:37.070> of<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.220> negative<00:03:38.440> anyway<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.250> I<00:03:40.280> think

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
bit of a negative anyway so that I think

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.430 
bit of a negative anyway so that I think
the<00:03:40.760> quality<00:03:41.330> of<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:41.630> is<00:03:41.900> great<00:03:42.200> I

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
the quality of this is great I

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.940 
the quality of this is great I
definitely<00:03:43.220> recommend<00:03:43.520> it<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.970> anybody<00:03:44.240> and

night<00:04:40.870> on<00:04:41.870> your<00:04:41.990> ferraro<00:04:42.349> far<00:04:42.710> away<00:04:42.889> because

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
night on your ferraro far away because

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.800 
night on your ferraro far away because
it's<00:04:43.550> almost<00:04:43.849> becomes<00:04:44.330> like<00:04:44.539> light<00:04:45.530> blue<00:04:45.860> odd

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
it's almost becomes like light blue odd

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.589 
it's almost becomes like light blue odd
blue<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.280> that's<00:04:49.280> not<00:04:49.490> good<00:04:49.699> for<00:04:49.729> contrast<00:04:50.270> so

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:50.599 
blue and that's not good for contrast so

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.670 
blue and that's not good for contrast so
I<00:04:50.630> wish<00:04:50.870> dub<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.270> actual<00:04:54.169> back<00:04:54.410> was<00:04:54.650> a

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
I wish dub that the actual back was a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.249 
I wish dub that the actual back was a
bit<00:04:54.949> darker<00:04:55.400> but<00:04:56.210> other<00:04:56.569> than<00:04:56.840> that<00:04:56.930> I<00:04:57.050> think

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
bit darker but other than that I think

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.129 
bit darker but other than that I think
it's<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:57.919> think<00:04:58.009> it's<00:04:58.310> a<00:04:58.520> great<00:04:59.090> great<00:04:59.750> lark

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
it's I think it's a great great lark

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.819 
it's I think it's a great great lark
Lakhan<00:05:00.650> I'd<00:05:00.860> recommend<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.520> anybody
