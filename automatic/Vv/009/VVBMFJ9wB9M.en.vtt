where on the town online got a whole

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.690 
where on the town online got a whole
whole<00:00:38.399> bunch<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.730> resources<00:00:39.829> that<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
whole bunch of resources that I

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
whole bunch of resources that I
literally<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> rated<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.280> base

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
literally have it rated on this base

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.580 
literally have it rated on this base
more<00:00:44.940> than<00:00:45.149> twice<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.960> week<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
more than twice in this week because of

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.889 
more than twice in this week because of
how<00:00:46.739> much<00:00:46.890> I've<00:00:47.039> been<00:00:47.070> working<00:00:47.539> all<00:00:48.539> my

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
how much I've been working all my

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.299 
how much I've been working all my
resources<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.469> from<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.829> minds<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
resources are from my minds and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.209 
resources are from my minds and
collectors<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> most<00:00:52.860> part

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
collectors that I have for the most part

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.160 
collectors that I have for the most part
so<00:00:54.079> yeah<00:00:55.079> that's<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.770> pretty<00:00:56.160> ridiculous

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
so yeah that's that's pretty ridiculous

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.200 
so yeah that's that's pretty ridiculous
but<00:00:58.170> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.219> how<00:00:59.609> much<00:00:59.760> elixir

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
but as you can see from how much elixir

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.619 
but as you can see from how much elixir
we<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.840> go<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.170> here<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.469> we<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.629> max

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
we have we can go in here and we can max

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.399 
we have we can go in here and we can max
out<00:01:03.750> our<00:01:05.060> balloons<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:07.049> gonna<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
out our balloons so that's gonna be the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.929 
out our balloons so that's gonna be the
first<00:01:07.530> thing<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> we<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.400> max<00:01:08.610> Mr

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
first thing that we do for max Mr

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
first thing that we do for max Mr
balloons<00:01:09.240> can't<00:01:09.900> go<00:01:10.020> any<00:01:10.170> higher<00:01:10.200> than<00:01:10.530> this

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
balloons can't go any higher than this

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
balloons can't go any higher than this
so<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.909> means<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.510> hopefully<00:01:12.840> after<00:01:12.930> 10

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
so what this means is hopefully after 10

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.570 
so what this means is hopefully after 10
days<00:01:13.260> I<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.740> start<00:01:13.890> doing<00:01:14.010> some<00:01:14.250> balloon

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
days I can start doing some balloon

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.749 
days I can start doing some balloon
