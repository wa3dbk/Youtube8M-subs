CDI in addition to the CI this bike has
a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.639> of<00:01:50.670> other<00:01:50.999> features<00:01:51.299> such<00:01:51.749> as<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.649> oil

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
a lot of other features such as the oil

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
a lot of other features such as the oil
compression<00:01:53.520> release<00:01:53.670> too<00:01:54.240> let's<00:01:54.990> take<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
compression release too let's take a

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.529 
compression release too let's take a
look<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.909> takes<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.240> oil

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
look is that it takes out the oil

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:58.760 
look is that it takes out the oil
pressure<00:01:57.659> want<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.139> and<00:01:58.229> put<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.409> around<00:01:58.529> a

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
pressure want to go and put it around a

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.440 
pressure want to go and put it around a
compression<00:01:59.219> so<00:01:59.369> we<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.060> end<00:02:00.179> out<00:02:00.329> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
compression so we the end out to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
compression so we the end out to
evaporation<00:02:01.310> that's<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.429> new<00:02:02.579> feature<00:02:02.759> which

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
evaporation that's a new feature which

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.269 
evaporation that's a new feature which
in<00:02:03.389> addition<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.929> upgrade<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> camshaft

00:02:05.269 --> 00:02:05.279 
in addition to upgrade the camshaft

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.690 
in addition to upgrade the camshaft
variator<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.959> gears<00:02:07.409> as<00:02:07.740> well<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.549> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
variator the gears as well as the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
variator the gears as well as the
electrical<00:02:09.209> system<00:02:09.599> we've<00:02:09.989> upgrade<00:02:10.439> this

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
electrical system we've upgrade this

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.550 
electrical system we've upgrade this
bike<00:02:10.890> made<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> brand<00:02:12.030> new<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.689> factory

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
bike made it brand new from the factory

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.979 
bike made it brand new from the factory
together<00:02:13.890> we've<00:02:14.250> also<00:02:14.400> added<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:15.239> complete

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
together we've also added a complete

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:18.770 
together we've also added a complete
carburation<00:02:16.650> system<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.270> ready

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
carburation system so it's really ready

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.650 
carburation system so it's really ready
for<00:02:18.870> street<00:02:19.349> racing<00:02:20.000> should<00:02:21.000> always<00:02:21.239> use<00:02:21.270> this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
for street racing should always use this

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.449 
for street racing should always use this
in<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.989> closed<00:02:22.230> circuit<00:02:22.620> track<00:02:22.860> we're<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.400> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
in a closed circuit track we're going to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:24.949 
in a closed circuit track we're going to
take<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.790> in<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:23.940> street<00:02:24.239> a<00:02:24.270> few<00:02:24.360> seconds

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
take it out in the street a few seconds

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.320 
take it out in the street a few seconds
but<00:02:25.950> keep<00:02:26.220> in<00:02:26.340> mind<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:27.150> going

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330
