00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.540
 hello how are you sure it's fun and the day 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:10.680
 today I will show you in this video 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:13.059
 how to cover a granite and make a look 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.980
 using only eyeliners in both 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.650
 the eyes as the view I hope you 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:20.109
 Like, apply my first one in this 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.289
 case used park queens beats by them 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:26.769
 I'm going to apply two makeups I'm going to use 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:30.999
 for launching of álava or cabestany de 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:35.970
 ching and rise abode of life ball in the 

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:35.970
 color 754 and they are expressing 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.430
 how did they realize apply first 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.830
 to makeup and then I'm going to apply the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.790
 corrector to cover it many people believe 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.340
 what you should cover 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.850
 before the granite put makeup 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.510
 I do not believe because since you apply the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.910
 makeup 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.680
 sometimes that granite is already covered and 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.170
 you do not have to apply more product 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.250
 to cover the granite is very important 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.430
 that we use a concealer that is very 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.040
 heavy so you can mix very 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.380
 well and do not need a lot of product should 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.240
 to be dry the concealer is very different 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.710
 of the outline of the eyes to which 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.080
 we apply on the face 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.630
 there are two corrector palettes that 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.340
 I like the sea ​​color that is hip 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.390
 and this is very good but it is not so easy 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 of getting and another that is the 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.850
 camps the genitals of miquel ferrer 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.610
 Now you can realize that here 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.180
 we have a kind of a green concealer 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.040
 Lonjita and already the yellows another myth is 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.800
 that we must apply the green 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.710
 directly the green what it does is that 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.660
 tinges a little the reddish color but not 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.940
 we are going to apply the green actively 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.550
 what we are going to do is mix a color 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.310
 green with a color that looks a lot like 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.399
 to the tone of your skin then right now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.289
 to mix these two tones I will use my 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:12.409
 coral glam brush 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.730
 it's called mini finish and I'm going to grab 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.730
 just a little bit of the green 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.670
 and I'm going to mix it with this this is going to 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.250
 make my concealer have a tone 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.790
 green and help me cover I'm going to go 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.790
 direct 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.939
 to the part that we want to cover here 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.730
 you may realize that there is a little 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:37.030
 more clear 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.569
 What next 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.980
 I'm going to try to blur it with the same 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.980
 makeup brush 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.460
 we immediately started covering that 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.760
 there they have it and cover the granite without 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.430
 put a lot of product and without having put 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.380
 concealer or makeup and the need for 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.140
 re -add corrector only apply 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.050
 very little product and I think that's what 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.430
 enough 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.380
 to disguise that granite and cover it 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.810
 through auschwitz corrector in addition 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.810
 in prime in light boost 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.380
 now good would be my makeup I'm going to 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.960
 use of sea ​​in a gray color and I'm going to 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.080
 go first 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.530
 where was my granite and then to 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:40.040
 rest of the face 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.769
 for suddenly mom never leave topic 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.640
 it's quite dark I'm just going to apply 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.640
 a little 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.190
 fill my eyelashes 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.650
 and will delineate with pixie the price that 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.650
 there is see in the color black coconut 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.600
 inside my eyes 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.850
 having delineated all my eyes by 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.920
 inside makes them a little bit smaller for 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.769
 counter that I will use from 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.500
 pixie in the same in a month they deal 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.210
 but now the color oyster group its 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.700
 truth is that I'm going to line up outside 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.050
 all my eyes with a very clear color 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 and that will help me see what a 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.410
 little more 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.480
 if they want to do something like that it's super 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.790
 important that they mark very well the 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.520
 outline of your eyes or your eyelashes to 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.090
 that they do not lose the good eye is not that 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.090
 lose but 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.930
 but it does not look good 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.939
 you can see how this spear eye 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.590
 instantly flashed in the 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:12.729
 part of the eyes I will use 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.800
 it's really imperfect 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.070
 and I'm going to apply a fair bit of light 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.900
 under the eyebrow 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.689
 now I'm going to enter my eyebrows and my 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.360
 tabs 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:26.919
 for the eyebrow I will use the mercè 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.919
 in the soft color 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.960
 even though the mouth is so strong 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.050
 it really does not make us need so much 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.440
 blogs but I'm going to use a browser 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.620
 pixie sap déison touch has a bit of 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.620
 brightness 

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:29.090
 Here is a tip on how to cover the 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:31.039
 granite in the shocks in addition to how 

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.660
 make a look using only 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:36.350
 eyeliners I hope you liked it 

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.530
 I am part of the channel and remember that 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:41.530
 we want 

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.530
 Thank you
