00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the closed system of Apple the fact that

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
the closed system of Apple the fact that
it<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.640> puts<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.060> user<00:01:18.240> experience

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
first I mean it's it's been an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.700 
first I mean it's it's been an
inspiration<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.600> way<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.750> try<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> work<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
inspiration in the way I try to work and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.870 
inspiration in the way I try to work and

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
certainly none of the stuff we've done

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.359 
certainly none of the stuff we've done
has<00:01:24.060> reached<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:25.170> success<00:01:25.590> levels<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.189> any

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
means of sort of you know these amazing

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.870 
means of sort of you know these amazing
products<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> Apple<00:01:29.040> has<00:01:29.130> made<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
products that Apple has made but

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.010 
products that Apple has made but

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
certainly I think some of that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.510 
certainly I think some of that
inspiration<00:01:31.350> has<00:01:31.740> managed<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.159> see<00:01:32.310> through
