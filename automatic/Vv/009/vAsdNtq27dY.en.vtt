4<00:00:34.980> logo<00:00:35.430> which<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> back<00:00:36.360> of

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
4 logo which is actually on the back of

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.700 
4 logo which is actually on the back of
the<00:00:36.600> case<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> if<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:38.969> take<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> case<00:00:39.420> apart

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
the case so if we we take the case apart

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.160 
the case so if we we take the case apart
the<00:00:40.710> idea<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> if<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.579> if<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> pop<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the idea is if you if you pop the the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.990 
the idea is if you if you pop the the
phone<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:44.129> make<00:00:44.309> sure<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.550> put<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.850> wrong

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
phone in to make sure you put the wrong

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.180 
phone in to make sure you put the wrong
way<00:00:45.180> around<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.920> front

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
way around and then the the front

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
way around and then the the front
actually<00:00:47.430> clips<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.690> thing<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.140> know

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
actually clips on one thing to know

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
actually clips on one thing to know
where<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.950> as<00:00:50.610> soon<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.210> out

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
where this is as soon as you get it out

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
where this is as soon as you get it out
if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> pop<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:51.899> straight<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.410> phone

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
if you pop it straight on the phone

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.900 
if you pop it straight on the phone
you're<00:00:52.860> going<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.039> avoid<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.489> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
you're going to avoid the the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.889 
you're going to avoid the the
fingerprints<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.570> you're<00:00:54.690> actually

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
fingerprints that you're actually

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.840 
fingerprints that you're actually
getting<00:00:54.989> side<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.430> want<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.670> work

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
getting side it and you want to work

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.090 
getting side it and you want to work
your<00:00:57.090> way<00:00:57.210> around<00:00:57.360> making<00:00:58.320> sure<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.829> clipped

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
your way around making sure it's clipped

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.900 
your way around making sure it's clipped
it<00:00:59.309> nicely<00:01:00.530> there<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.649> go<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.219> rich<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
it nicely there you go get rich or in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.770 
it nicely there you go get rich or in
click<00:01:03.600> when<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.019> gone<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:05.630> so<00:01:06.630> what

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
click when it's actually gone in so what

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.149 
click when it's actually gone in so what
you're<00:01:06.900> getting<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:07.740> getting<00:01:07.920> almost

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you're getting is you're getting almost

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.789 
you're getting is you're getting almost
like<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> complete<00:01:09.119> front<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> back<00:01:09.750> case<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
like a complete front and back case it's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.570 
like a complete front and back case it's
it's<00:01:11.280> softer<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.939> front<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> well<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it's softer on the front and so well so

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
it's softer on the front and so well so
you<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.880> quite<00:01:15.479> easily<00:01:15.619> flick<00:01:16.619> through<00:01:16.830> there

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you can quite easily flick through there

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.899 
you can quite easily flick through there
the<00:01:18.110> screen<00:01:19.110> feels<00:01:19.770> ok<00:01:20.189> obviously<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.759> not

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
the screen feels ok obviously it's not

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.780 
the screen feels ok obviously it's not
quite<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.630> measure<00:01:21.900> as<00:01:22.409> using<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
quite the same measure as using the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.370 
quite the same measure as using the
glass<00:01:24.090> screen<00:01:24.450> itself<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.229> plastic

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
glass screen itself because it's plastic

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
glass screen itself because it's plastic
you<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.280> bit<00:01:26.490> more<00:01:26.670> resistance

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you do get a little bit more resistance

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
you do get a little bit more resistance
but<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> feels<00:01:27.659> absolutely<00:01:27.869> fine<00:01:28.439> you've<00:01:29.220> got

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
but it feels absolutely fine you've got

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.859 
but it feels absolutely fine you've got
the<00:01:29.400> hole<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> top<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> access<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> power

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the hole in the top to access the power

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.069 
the hole in the top to access the power
burn<00:01:32.420> assignment<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> solids<00:01:33.840> you've<00:01:33.960> got

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
burn assignment the solids you've got

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.469 
burn assignment the solids you've got
this<00:01:34.170> cutaway<00:01:34.500> here<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.450> can

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this cutaway here so you can you can

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.810 
this cutaway here so you can you can
access<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> volume<00:01:37.380> controls<00:01:37.829> obviously<00:01:38.490> the

access the volume controls obviously the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
access the volume controls obviously the
back<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> case<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.200> main<00:01:40.470> benefit<00:01:40.950> of

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
back of the case the the main benefit of

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.590 
back of the case the the main benefit of
this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.369> you're<00:01:41.670> getting<00:01:41.790> completely<00:01:42.390> clear

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this is you're getting completely clear

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.830 
this is you're getting completely clear
black<00:01:42.840> so<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> shaft<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.630> design<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
black so you can shaft the design of the

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.200 
black so you can shaft the design of the
iPhone<00:01:45.990> 5<00:01:46.530> which<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.280> looks<00:01:47.549> really<00:01:48.000> good
