ago<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.340> city<00:03:17.579> were<00:03:17.699> putting<00:03:17.910> bids<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.269> for

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419 
ago and city were putting bids in for

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:20.900 
ago and city were putting bids in for
Berbatov<00:03:18.720> we're<00:03:19.049> never<00:03:19.169> going<00:03:19.919> to<00:03:19.980> get<00:03:20.160> him<00:03:20.370> we

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
Berbatov we're never going to get him we

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:21.979 
Berbatov we're never going to get him we
just<00:03:21.060> bump<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.359> price<00:03:21.599> up<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> think

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
just bump in the price up and I think

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.720
