00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
have to do this perfectly you can just

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.799 
have to do this perfectly you can just
do<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.860> real<00:00:53.039> real<00:00:53.699> loosely<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.360> around<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
do them real real loosely and around the

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.939 
do them real real loosely and around the
edge<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.230> still<00:00:55.440> get<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> same<00:00:55.680> effect

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
edge and you still get the same effect

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.040 
edge and you still get the same effect
but<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> think<00:00:57.270> I'm<00:00:57.390> missing<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:58.760> centerpiece

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
but I think I'm missing a centerpiece

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.929 
but I think I'm missing a centerpiece
here<00:01:02.059> I'll<00:01:03.059> find<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> let's<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.439> so<00:01:04.939> probably

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
here I'll find it let's see so probably

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.090 
here I'll find it let's see so probably
on<00:01:06.060> my<00:01:06.150> sleep<00:01:06.450> somewhere<00:01:06.689> but<00:01:07.500> basically<00:01:07.680> what

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on my sleep somewhere but basically what

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.600 
on my sleep somewhere but basically what
I<00:01:08.159> start<00:01:08.610> doing<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:12.409> it<00:01:13.409> take<00:01:13.650> some<00:01:14.189> pigment

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I start doing is it take some pigment

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.200 
I start doing is it take some pigment
ink<00:01:14.960> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.140> from<00:01:16.560> color<00:01:16.860> box<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> I'm<00:01:18.090> going

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
ink this is from color box and I'm going

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.399 
ink this is from color box and I'm going
to<00:01:18.240> use<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> orange<00:01:18.720> because<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> yellow

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
to use the orange because the yellow

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.320 
to use the orange because the yellow
doesn't<00:01:19.710> show<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:19.890> very<00:01:20.130> well

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.140 

what<00:01:23.780> happened<00:01:24.080> mom<00:01:24.170> cuddles<00:01:24.560> here<00:01:24.740> okay<00:01:25.160> so

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
what happened mom cuddles here okay so

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.810 
what happened mom cuddles here okay so
then<00:01:26.540> we<00:01:27.500> move<00:01:27.680> this<00:01:27.830> out<00:01:28.010> of<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.250> way<00:01:28.310> you

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
then we move this out of the way you

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.200 
then we move this out of the way you
can't<00:01:29.030> see<00:01:29.180> it<00:01:29.300> but<00:01:29.510> then<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.170> just<00:01:30.320> think<00:01:31.210> the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
can't see it but then I just think the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.350 
can't see it but then I just think the
edges<00:01:32.630> like<00:01:33.230> this<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:36.760> it's<00:01:37.760> pain<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.210> butt

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
edges like this and it's pain the butt

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.500 
edges like this and it's pain the butt
but<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:38.930> gives<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.410> really<00:01:39.790> cool<00:01:40.790> effect<00:01:41.000> and

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
but it gives it a really cool effect and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.840 
but it gives it a really cool effect and
I<00:01:41.570> wouldn't<00:01:42.230> do<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.380> without<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.890> I<00:01:43.400> don't

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
I wouldn't do it without it I don't

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.520 
I wouldn't do it without it I don't
think<00:01:44.150> my<00:01:44.390> green<00:01:44.840> ones<00:01:45.080> because<00:01:45.320> they<00:01:45.380> don't

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
think my green ones because they don't

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.200 
think my green ones because they don't
have<00:01:45.560> any<00:01:45.770> ink<00:01:45.950> darker<00:01:46.370> not<00:01:46.550> dark<00:01:46.790> enough<00:01:46.880> I

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
have any ink darker not dark enough I

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.540 
have any ink darker not dark enough I
might<00:01:47.330> use<00:01:47.570> some<00:01:47.720> black<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.320> my<00:01:49.280> black

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
might use some black but my black

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.350 
might use some black but my black
pinnock<00:01:50.060> is<00:01:50.180> about<00:01:50.860> dried<00:01:51.860> up<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:52.400> I'll<00:01:53.210> have

to<00:02:09.950> turn<00:02:10.760> off<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.940> camera<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.390> look<00:02:11.480> for<00:02:11.750> once

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
to turn off the camera and look for once

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.680 
to turn off the camera and look for once
I<00:02:12.680> get<00:02:12.860> to<00:02:12.890> it<00:02:13.190> which<00:02:13.670> I'm<00:02:13.790> almost<00:02:14.060> done<00:02:14.270> inking

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
I get to it which I'm almost done inking

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.890 
I get to it which I'm almost done inking
okay<00:02:17.800> finally<00:02:18.800> this<00:02:19.300> will<00:02:20.300> if<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> do<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
okay finally this will if you do the

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.390 
okay finally this will if you do the
inking<00:02:21.230> like<00:02:21.410> this<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.800> will<00:02:21.920> get<00:02:22.130> on<00:02:22.250> your

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
inking like this it will get on your

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.680 
inking like this it will get on your
fingers<00:02:22.700> just<00:02:22.790> letting<00:02:23.240> you<00:02:23.330> know<00:02:23.360> because

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
fingers just letting you know because

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.940 
fingers just letting you know because
they're<00:02:24.320> so<00:02:24.500> small<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:26.440> make<00:02:27.440> these<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:27.800> that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
they're so small I make these so that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.590 
they're so small I make these so that
when<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.250> print<00:02:28.489> out<00:02:28.610> they'll<00:02:28.820> fit<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.239> six

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
when they print out they'll fit on a six

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.330 
when they print out they'll fit on a six
by<00:02:29.750> six<00:02:29.810> sheet<00:02:30.500> of<00:02:30.760> cardstock<00:02:31.760> like<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.340> wait

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
by six sheet of cardstock like that wait

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.699 
by six sheet of cardstock like that wait
to<00:02:34.489> run<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.670> camera<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.180> look<00:02:35.300> for<00:02:35.450> my<00:02:35.540> other

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
to run the camera and look for my other

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.640 
to run the camera and look for my other
pedal<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:37.010> that<00:02:37.280> I'm<00:02:37.370> missing<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:38.650> then

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
pedal here that I'm missing and then

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.400 
pedal here that I'm missing and then
it's<00:02:39.800> showing<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.190> how<00:02:40.370> to<00:02:40.400> make<00:02:40.790> them<00:02:41.410> how

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
it's showing you how to make them how

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.830 
it's showing you how to make them how
can<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:42.920> found<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:44.630> on<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
can a and I found it that is on the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.550 
can a and I found it that is on the
floor<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.910> take<00:02:47.150> my<00:02:47.300> ink<00:02:47.480> again<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:50.290> ink<00:02:51.290> the

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
floor and take my ink again and ink the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.220 
floor and take my ink again and ink the
textured<00:02:52.489> side<00:02:52.730> of<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.930> really<00:02:54.019> cool

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
textured side of this it's really cool

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.750 
textured side of this it's really cool
to<00:02:54.290> use<00:02:54.470> text<00:02:54.800> your<00:02:54.890> paper<00:02:55.100> where<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.489> buy<00:02:55.700> it

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
to use text your paper where you buy it

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.610 
to use text your paper where you buy it
like<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.090> or<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.330> run<00:02:56.450> it<00:02:56.600> through<00:02:56.810> a<00:02:57.019> cuddle

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
like that or you run it through a cuddle

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.210 
like that or you run it through a cuddle
bug<00:02:57.769> or<00:02:57.920> sizzix<00:02:59.350> whichever<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.620> use<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.100> makes

bug or sizzix whichever you use it makes
a<00:03:01.340> really<00:03:01.370> cool<00:03:01.790> theft<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:02.450> is<00:03:02.570> just

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
a really cool theft but this is just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.870 
a really cool theft but this is just
already<00:03:03.019> textured<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:04.640> what<00:03:04.850> I

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
already textured and I think what I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.729 
already textured and I think what I
might<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.360> is<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.690> found<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.170> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.380> floor<00:03:06.440> as

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
might do is I found this on the floor as

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.630 
might do is I found this on the floor as
well<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:07.220> keep<00:03:07.910> him<00:03:08.030> very<00:03:08.209> messy<00:03:08.540> room<00:03:08.720> and<00:03:09.650> I

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
well I keep him very messy room and I

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.850 
well I keep him very messy room and I
might<00:03:11.030> layer<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.080> i<00:03:12.110> get<00:03:12.380> one<00:03:12.590> blue

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
might layer this so that i get one blue

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.680 
might layer this so that i get one blue
I<00:03:13.070> don't<00:03:13.250> know<00:03:13.370> when<00:03:13.580> you<00:03:13.670> take<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.300> look<00:03:14.540> you

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
I don't know when you take a look you

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.790 
I don't know when you take a look you
and<00:03:14.810> see<00:03:14.959> how<00:03:15.080> this<00:03:15.230> looks<00:03:17.290> maybe<00:03:18.290> I

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
and see how this looks maybe I

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.670 
and see how this looks maybe I
I<00:03:20.270> don't<00:03:21.270> know<00:03:21.360> I<00:03:21.630> can't<00:03:22.140> really<00:03:22.230> it's<00:03:22.470> hard<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
I don't know I can't really it's hard to

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.040 
I don't know I can't really it's hard to
tell<00:03:22.860> when<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> don't<00:03:23.480> we<00:03:24.480> haven't<00:03:24.840> puffed

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
tell when you don't we haven't puffed

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.510 
tell when you don't we haven't puffed
them<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.710> the<00:03:25.860> part<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.100> makes<00:03:26.340> them

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
them up this is the part that makes them

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.490 
them up this is the part that makes them
dimensional<00:03:27.120> basically<00:03:27.840> I'm<00:03:27.960> just<00:03:27.990> taking

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
dimensional basically I'm just taking

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.040 
dimensional basically I'm just taking
these<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:29.040> then<00:03:29.550> just<00:03:29.880> bending<00:03:30.360> and<00:03:30.570> bending

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
these and then just bending and bending

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.320 
these and then just bending and bending
the<00:03:31.140> petals<00:03:31.470> like<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.730> it's<00:03:33.120> really

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
the petals like that so it's really

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.230 
the petals like that so it's really
simple<00:03:33.660> it's<00:03:33.990> not<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.580> can't<00:03:35.820> mess<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.060> up

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
simple it's not it you can't mess it up

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.930 
simple it's not it you can't mess it up
all<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.600> only<00:03:36.780> do<00:03:36.960> is<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.460> bend<00:03:38.460> the<00:03:38.610> pedals

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
all you only do is just bend the pedals

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.260 
all you only do is just bend the pedals
and<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.950> could<00:03:41.130> set<00:03:41.340> them<00:03:41.520> makes<00:03:41.820> them<00:03:41.910> curl

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
and that could set them makes them curl

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.720 
and that could set them makes them curl
up<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.930> my<00:03:43.380> dad<00:03:43.560> thought<00:03:43.800> I<00:03:43.860> would<00:03:44.100> have<00:03:44.580> taken

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
up so my dad thought I would have taken

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.370 
up so my dad thought I would have taken
a<00:03:44.940> heating<00:03:45.270> vent<00:03:45.300> to<00:03:45.600> them<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.870> make<00:03:46.020> them<00:03:46.140> curl

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
a heating vent to them to make them curl

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.010 
a heating vent to them to make them curl
one<00:03:46.620> nope<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:48.030> fingers<00:03:48.330> here<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:51.020> almost

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
one nope just my fingers here and almost

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.260 
one nope just my fingers here and almost
on<00:03:52.350> this<00:03:52.680> one<00:03:52.890> and<00:03:53.100> with<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.760> smaller<00:03:54.030> petals

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
on this one and with the smaller petals

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.970 
on this one and with the smaller petals
it's<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.690> little<00:03:54.870> bit<00:03:54.960> different<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.830> have

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
it's a little bit different you have

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.370 
it's a little bit different you have
this<00:03:56.220> little<00:03:56.370> point<00:03:56.760> on<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.390> end<00:03:57.570> and<00:03:58.320> that

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
this little point on the end and that

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.420 
this little point on the end and that
you<00:03:58.800> just<00:03:59.010> push<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.640> up<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:01.430> that

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
you just push it up like that so that

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.680 
you just push it up like that so that
way<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:02.640> gives<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.880> some<00:04:03.060> room<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.270> put<00:04:03.540> some

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
way it gives you some room to put some

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:12.820 
way it gives you some room to put some
glue<00:04:03.900> on<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:08.040> then<00:04:08.570> last<00:04:09.570> one<00:04:10.340> now<00:04:11.340> let<00:04:11.460> me

another project and then i just take

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.349 
another project and then i just take
some<00:04:47.459> glue<00:04:48.019> this<00:04:49.019> is<00:04:49.229> a<00:04:49.759> leanings<00:04:50.759> fast<00:04:51.059> grab

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:51.359 
some glue this is a leanings fast grab

some glue this is a leanings fast grab
tacky<00:04:51.389> glue<00:04:51.959> it<00:04:52.769> works<00:04:53.009> well<00:04:53.279> for<00:04:53.609> projects

tacky glue it works well for projects
like<00:04:54.179> this<00:04:54.449> so<00:04:54.749> that<00:04:54.899> keeps<00:04:55.109> them<00:04:57.289> it<00:04:58.289> grabs<00:04:58.559> it

00:04:58.789 --> 00:04:58.799 
like this so that keeps them it grabs it

00:04:58.799 --> 00:04:59.959 
like this so that keeps them it grabs it
real<00:04:58.949> quick<00:04:59.159> and<00:04:59.309> keeps<00:04:59.489> it<00:04:59.639> so<00:04:59.789> that<00:04:59.909> it

00:04:59.959 --> 00:04:59.969 
real quick and keeps it so that it

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:01.849 
real quick and keeps it so that it
doesn't<00:05:00.149> slide<00:05:01.049> around<00:05:01.109> and<00:05:01.529> not<00:05:01.619> to<00:05:01.709> wait

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:01.859 
doesn't slide around and not to wait

00:05:01.859 --> 00:05:02.719 
doesn't slide around and not to wait
forever<00:05:02.009> because<00:05:02.369> when<00:05:02.459> you're<00:05:02.549> handling

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:09.779 
you can use pop dots or dimensionals for

00:05:09.779 --> 00:05:11.569 
you can use pop dots or dimensionals for
these<00:05:09.899> two<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.349> gives<00:05:10.499> it<00:05:10.589> a<00:05:10.709> cool<00:05:11.159> effect<00:05:11.279> I

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:11.579

just<00:05:11.759> wanted<00:05:11.969> to<00:05:12.059> be<00:05:12.119> really<00:05:12.449> sturdy<00:05:13.379> and<00:05:13.709> so

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
just wanted to be really sturdy and so

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:20.119 
just wanted to be really sturdy and so
I'm<00:05:14.789> using<00:05:15.919> liquid<00:05:16.919> wet<00:05:17.339> glue<00:05:18.859> you<00:05:19.859> can<00:05:19.919> use

I'm using liquid wet glue you can use

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:21.889 
I'm using liquid wet glue you can use
any<00:05:20.339> adhesive<00:05:20.609> for<00:05:20.969> this<00:05:21.119> actually<00:05:21.719> I

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:21.899 
any adhesive for this actually I

00:05:21.899 --> 00:05:23.779 
any adhesive for this actually I
wouldn't<00:05:22.679> recommend<00:05:22.889> using<00:05:23.189> a<00:05:23.369> glue<00:05:23.609> runner

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
wouldn't recommend using a glue runner

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.399 
wouldn't recommend using a glue runner
unless<00:05:24.059> it's<00:05:24.269> really<00:05:24.659> permanent<00:05:25.049> adhesive

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
unless it's really permanent adhesive

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:28.699 
unless it's really permanent adhesive
and<00:05:25.799> I<00:05:26.789> have<00:05:27.779> some<00:05:27.899> permanent<00:05:28.289> he's<00:05:28.409> a<00:05:28.439> runner

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:28.709 
and I have some permanent he's a runner

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:30.229 
and I have some permanent he's a runner
and<00:05:28.919> this<00:05:29.039> they<00:05:29.339> wouldn't<00:05:29.549> keep<00:05:29.699> it<00:05:29.879> wouldn't

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:30.239 
and this they wouldn't keep it wouldn't

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:34.399 
and this they wouldn't keep it wouldn't
keep<00:05:30.299> together<00:05:30.539> it<00:05:31.099> it<00:05:32.099> wouldn't<00:05:32.669> work<00:05:32.789> so<00:05:33.409> you

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:34.409 
keep together it it wouldn't work so you

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:35.689 
keep together it it wouldn't work so you
gotta<00:05:34.529> be<00:05:34.589> careful<00:05:34.739> get<00:05:35.039> this<00:05:35.249> glue<00:05:35.519> on<00:05:35.669> your
