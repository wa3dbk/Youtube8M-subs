the only good thing about this game that
I<00:06:13.509> can<00:06:13.779> say<00:06:13.990> is<00:06:14.259> they<00:06:14.440> have<00:06:14.560> somewhat<00:06:15.099> improved

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580

the driving mechanics and I have no

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.260 
the driving mechanics and I have no
doubt<00:06:17.560> that's<00:06:18.099> because<00:06:18.430> of<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.699> new<00:06:18.969> need<00:06:19.240> for

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
doubt that's because of the new need for

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.110 
doubt that's because of the new need for
speed<00:06:19.479> reboot<00:06:20.050> that<00:06:20.259> came<00:06:20.379> out<00:06:20.529> recently<00:06:21.120> it's

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
speed reboot that came out recently it's

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.269 
speed reboot that came out recently it's
the<00:06:22.240> only<00:06:22.479> thing<00:06:22.659> I<00:06:22.960> mean<00:06:23.110> the<00:06:23.259> cards<00:06:23.919> kind<00:06:24.099> of

00:06:24.269 --> 00:06:24.279 
the only thing I mean the cards kind of

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.450 
the only thing I mean the cards kind of
handle<00:06:24.699> good<00:06:25.479> but<00:06:26.469> even<00:06:26.710> then<00:06:26.860> you<00:06:27.039> can't<00:06:27.279> get

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.460 
handle good but even then you can't get

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:29.600 
handle good but even then you can't get
into<00:06:27.699> all<00:06:27.849> of<00:06:27.879> them<00:06:28.240> which<00:06:28.449> is<00:06:28.479> really<00:06:28.930> stupid

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
into all of them which is really stupid

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.649 
into all of them which is really stupid
like<00:06:30.610> you<00:06:30.789> can't<00:06:30.969> just<00:06:31.120> walk<00:06:31.330> up<00:06:31.360> to<00:06:31.629> a

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:31.659 
like you can't just walk up to a

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:34.230 
like you can't just walk up to a
civilian<00:06:32.080> car<00:06:32.469> and<00:06:32.680> get<00:06:32.830> into<00:06:33.039> it<00:06:33.340> and<00:06:34.089> before

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 
civilian car and get into it and before

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.779 
civilian car and get into it and before
you<00:06:34.419> say<00:06:34.599> oh<00:06:35.020> well<00:06:35.710> those<00:06:35.979> cards<00:06:36.430> are<00:06:36.550> locked

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:36.789 
you say oh well those cards are locked

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:37.890 
you say oh well those cards are locked
and<00:06:37.000> don't<00:06:37.180> have<00:06:37.300> keys<00:06:37.570> in

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:37.900 
and don't have keys in

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.050 
and don't have keys in
so<00:06:38.110> that<00:06:38.259> makes<00:06:38.500> sense<00:06:38.620> well<00:06:38.979> I<00:06:39.009> i<00:06:39.280> highly

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
so that makes sense well I i highly

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.080 
so that makes sense well I i highly
doubt<00:06:40.300> that<00:06:40.720> the<00:06:41.410> skilled<00:06:41.830> driver<00:06:42.280> of<00:06:42.729> a

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
doubt that the skilled driver of a

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.170 
doubt that the skilled driver of a
police<00:06:43.479> car<00:06:43.780> would<00:06:44.440> leave<00:06:44.680> his<00:06:44.919> keys<00:06:45.280> in<00:06:45.610> his

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
police car would leave his keys in his

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.330 
police car would leave his keys in his
car<00:06:46.419> when<00:06:46.690> he<00:06:46.900> left<00:06:47.259> or<00:06:47.500> someone<00:06:47.889> else's<00:06:48.190> get

car when he left or someone else's get

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.090 
car when he left or someone else's get
into<00:06:48.580> it<00:06:48.699> so<00:06:49.300> that<00:06:49.509> doesn't<00:06:49.810> make<00:06:49.870> any<00:06:50.080> sense<00:06:50.380> I
