down the next couple of weeks she has

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.680 
down the next couple of weeks she has
some<00:00:58.379> swelling<00:00:58.649> certainly<00:00:59.219> around<00:00:59.789> her<00:01:00.480> neck

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690

area<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.770> below<00:01:01.949> here<00:01:02.100> region<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.969> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
area and just below here region but it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.539 
area and just below here region but it's
not<00:01:03.570> too<00:01:03.780> unusual<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.680> get<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.250> fact

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
probably got less swelling than but some

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.649 
probably got less swelling than but some
