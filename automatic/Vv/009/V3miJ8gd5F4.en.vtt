00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:45.949
 diego tough game and this is very serious 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.329
 because we were wrong too prince 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.890
 I think he had made an active race excuse 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.150
 feel the condition of Naples as seen 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.239
 function of the penalty match 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.489
 at the dinner benaglia in the stands but I believe 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.720
 we did the game on Wednesday 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.610
 a training victim with this 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.229
 recession team that put in 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:07.820
 difficulty but how much minutes I do not have 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.039
 seen a Naples unprepared e 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.350
 centrally from the point of view we say 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.460
 tactical and athletic of the agreement no no 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.310
 I do not agree 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.869
 only that credit must be given to that 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.679
 also corresponds to the Cesena because he has 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.679
 made a great race 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:34.630
 first you say but because we were wrong 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.630
 I had done too soon 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:14.060
 the abbey miccoli will do no 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:21.830
 training with this family like 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:23.660
 all naples a workout with 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 this team the exception that has me 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:36.410
 put his Naples in difficulty 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.100
 unprepared and certainly the bike of 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.100
 view let's say 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.490
 I only remember that he has it yesterday 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.020
 Forgot that you become the means 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.380
 I would also like to respond to the system 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.380
 perfect 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.470
 who put in difficulty
