 all the gas and I no longer have why 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.650
 be suffering terrific doré is 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.900

 that's a different classic months teddy bear 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.870
 white arrocito the classic arrocito like 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.870
 a carrot

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.270
 graphics and this canvas without sticking 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.270
 nothing in the sheet this is not a 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.250
 wonder of truth that if now the 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.110
 thomson spreads a wonder that is not 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.660
 there is better word to describe those that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.000
 wonder are your fabulous pans that 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.630
 they are made with one with a very material 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.250
 new 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.750
 which is called the non-stick sapphire 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.750
 there is blue material we are 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.980
 watching on screen they also look cute 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.630
 of bonito is really a wonder 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.340
 latent challenge because that's why because 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.220
 nothing is hitting him now yes that doing 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.810
 allusion to the word non-stick anything 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.940
 it sticks the anti-adhesion is total 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.740
 We can cook any kind of 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.080
 Saucer without the need to use 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.640
 oil then this is great because 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.010
 we are taking care of health a very 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.410
 important when not cooking with fats and 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.150
 with good with butter etc etc from that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.980
 the final channel of the script which exposes 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.770
 is exactly then it is a way 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.570
 very healthy cooking also come or 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.860
 They are manufactured with this super layer 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.350
 conductive that makes them warm 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.880
 much faster and they last hot by 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.070
 much more time what allows us 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.960
 obviously save my light or in desire 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.660
 depending on the type of grill well 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.760
 we have and in time because as 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.230
 we cook faster we have time to 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.370
 do other things in all the 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:53.060
 preparations that we are going to do how 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.680

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.060
 absorb the whole but it is already done 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.590
 done then right now they can tell us 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.750
 and do other things and let the rice 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.270
 is finished absorbing in 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.890
 and it is already really is very easy and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.320
