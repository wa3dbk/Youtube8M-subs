00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.220 
not much to getting the engine out I've
got<00:00:17.250> two<00:00:17.699> bolts<00:00:18.000> up<00:00:18.180> here<00:00:18.449> won<00:00:18.690> both<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:18.930> back

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230

got two bolts up here won both the back
of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> transmission<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.600> disconnect

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
of the transmission I have to disconnect

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.380 
of the transmission I have to disconnect
the<00:00:21.689> throttle<00:00:22.230> gas<00:00:22.500> line<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.279> battery<00:00:23.730> I'll

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the throttle gas line the battery I'll

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.759 
the throttle gas line the battery I'll
take<00:00:24.600> these<00:00:24.750> headers<00:00:24.990> off<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.529> get<00:00:25.650> them

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.650 
take these headers off just to get them
out<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> way<00:00:26.160> boom<00:00:27.150> should<00:00:27.420> be<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
out of the way boom should be out of

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.349 
out of the way boom should be out of
there<00:00:27.900> I<00:00:28.609> don't<00:00:29.609> know<00:00:29.670> why<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.880> seems<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.240> take

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
there I don't know why it seems to take

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.490 
there I don't know why it seems to take
so<00:00:30.510> long<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.779> take<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> radiator<00:00:31.410> out

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
so long to take the radiator out

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.870 
so long to take the radiator out
probably<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> have<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.460> take<00:00:32.640> these

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
probably because I have to take these

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.100 
probably because I have to take these
rods<00:00:33.660> loose<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:35.360> you<00:00:36.360> know<00:00:36.480> take<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.870> bolts

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
rods loose and you know take the bolts

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.360 
rods loose and you know take the bolts
loose<00:00:37.290> down<00:00:37.469> there<00:00:37.649> lift<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> all<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
loose down there lift it all up and

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.770 
loose down there lift it all up and
every<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:38.700> I<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.850> seems<00:00:39.180> like<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> spill<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
every time I do seems like I spill a

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.360 
every time I do seems like I spill a
boatload<00:00:40.050> any<00:00:40.530> fries<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:41.040> I'm<00:00:41.190> always

trying not to do but always seems like I
managed<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.160> spill<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.489> little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.820> anyway

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and there shouldn't be playing that and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.090 
and there shouldn't be playing that and
when<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.790> push<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.780> doesn't<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> it's

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
when I push it it doesn't go for it it's

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
when I push it it doesn't go for it it's
almost<00:01:23.400> like<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> clutch<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:26.420> cylinder<00:01:27.420> has

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
almost like a clutch a cylinder has

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.319 
almost like a clutch a cylinder has
gotten<00:01:28.020> stuck<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.829> clutch<00:01:29.220> plate<00:01:29.610> fork<00:01:30.030> or

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
gotten stuck in a clutch plate fork or

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.789 
gotten stuck in a clutch plate fork or
something<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.140> that's<00:01:31.530> something

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
something like that so that's something

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
something like that so that's something
I've<00:01:31.950> got<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.130> figure<00:01:32.369> out<00:01:32.610> see<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.570> there's

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I've got to figure out see if there's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.710 
I've got to figure out see if there's
been<00:01:33.840> damage<00:01:34.170> done<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.220> anyway<00:01:35.939> if<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
been damage done to that so anyway if I

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
been damage done to that so anyway if I
could<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> baby<00:01:37.590> out<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
could just get this baby out get the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.789 
could just get this baby out get the
transmission<00:01:38.460> pulled<00:01:38.939> off<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.650> that<00:01:40.650> will

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
transmission pulled off of it that will

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
out kind of inspected the transmission

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.160 
out kind of inspected the transmission
the<00:01:57.060> ears<00:01:57.409> broke<00:01:58.409> but<00:01:59.479> doesn't<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> crack

the ears broke but doesn't like a crack
got<00:02:01.439> into<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.329> transmission<00:02:03.329> case<00:02:03.829> anywhere

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
got into the transmission case anywhere

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.020 
got into the transmission case anywhere
and<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.460> believe

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
and I believe

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.380 
and I believe
I<00:02:07.140> believe<00:02:08.140> I<00:02:08.289> cannot<00:02:08.590> weld<00:02:09.429> these<00:02:09.670> back<00:02:09.940> on<00:02:09.970> or

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
I believe I cannot weld these back on or

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.880 
I believe I cannot weld these back on or

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
they'll be it'll be good enough I don't

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.100 
they'll be it'll be good enough I don't
think<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.209> don't<00:02:16.390> see<00:02:16.540> anything<00:02:16.720> remarkable

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
think I don't see anything remarkable

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.260 
think I don't see anything remarkable
about<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.830> klutz<00:02:18.130> i<00:02:18.370> took<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.760> throw<00:02:19.150> out

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
about the klutz i took the throw out

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.230 
about the klutz i took the throw out
bearing<00:02:19.300> out<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.050> spected<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.620> all<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
bearing out and spected it all and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.729 
bearing out and spected it all and
everything<00:02:22.240> looked<00:02:22.510> good<00:02:22.660> there<00:02:22.959> so<00:02:23.470> i<00:02:23.500> think

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
everything looked good there so i think

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.400 
everything looked good there so i think
it's<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.160> matter<00:02:24.310> of<00:02:24.489> getting<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:26.260> ears

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
it's just a matter of getting the ears

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's just a matter of getting the ears
welded<00:02:26.830> back<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.220> cleaning<00:02:28.209> it<00:02:28.300> up<00:02:28.420> putting<00:02:28.720> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
welded back on cleaning it up putting it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.610 
welded back on cleaning it up putting it
back<00:02:28.900> together<00:02:30.930> reweld<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:32.200> go<00:02:32.350> ahead<00:02:32.500> and

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
back together reweld and go ahead and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.500 
back together reweld and go ahead and
welding<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.010> now<00:02:33.160> my<00:02:33.550> cross<00:02:33.850> member<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.330> up

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
welding up now my cross member this up

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.760 
welding up now my cross member this up
under<00:02:34.780> there<00:02:34.959> and<00:02:35.310> that<00:02:36.310> would<00:02:36.400> be<00:02:36.430> good<00:02:36.640> i

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
under there and that would be good i

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.570 
under there and that would be good i
will<00:02:38.770> say<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.190> i<00:02:39.580> was<00:02:39.760> very<00:02:40.090> happy<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:41.709> how

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
will say this i was very happy with how

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.900 
will say this i was very happy with how
easy<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:43.060> was<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.239> get<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.690> motor<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:44.019> i<00:02:44.910> think

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
easy it was to get the motor out i think

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.449 
easy it was to get the motor out i think
i<00:02:46.060> did<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.540> about<00:02:46.840> 45<00:02:47.739> minutes<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.160> an<00:02:48.250> hour

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
i did it in about 45 minutes to an hour

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.120 
i did it in about 45 minutes to an hour
although<00:02:48.790> i<00:02:48.970> didn't<00:02:49.239> time<00:02:49.570> myself<00:02:49.600> but<00:02:50.530> seems

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
although i didn't time myself but seems

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.650 
although i didn't time myself but seems
like<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.400> popped<00:02:51.670> out<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:51.910> there<00:02:52.120> really<00:02:52.390> quick

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
like it popped out of there really quick

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.930 
like it popped out of there really quick
so<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.709> made<00:02:53.890> me<00:02:54.010> feel<00:02:54.190> good<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.880> know

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
so that made me feel good and you know

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.520 
so that made me feel good and you know
this<00:02:55.090> is<00:02:55.239> a<00:02:55.300> good<00:02:55.480> time<00:02:55.660> while<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.900> got<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.230> apart

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
this is a good time while I got it apart

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.550 
this is a good time while I got it apart
I<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:57.150> sort<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.239> fashioned<00:02:58.660> up<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.870> battery<00:02:59.140> box

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
I I sort of fashioned up a battery box

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.300 
I I sort of fashioned up a battery box
holder<00:03:00.550> down<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.510> hundred<00:03:01.780> floor<00:03:02.290> there<00:03:02.590> and

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
holder down a hundred floor there and

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.650 
holder down a hundred floor there and
while<00:03:03.519> I<00:03:03.550> got<00:03:03.790> that'd<00:03:04.150> be<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.300> good<00:03:04.420> time<00:03:04.600> to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
while I got that'd be a good time to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.270 
while I got that'd be a good time to
clean<00:03:04.959> all<00:03:05.110> that<00:03:05.140> up<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.530> make<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.830> pretty<00:03:06.069> and

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
clean all that up and make it pretty and

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.800 
clean all that up and make it pretty and
maybe<00:03:06.430> brace<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.940> up<00:03:07.030> will<00:03:07.209> get<00:03:07.450> infected

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
maybe brace it up will get infected

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.160 
maybe brace it up will get infected
probably<00:03:08.410> not<00:03:08.800> for<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.069> same<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.959> brace<00:03:10.959> that

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
probably not for the same to brace that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.990 
probably not for the same to brace that
battery<00:03:11.590> box<00:03:11.829> to<00:03:12.070> that<00:03:12.190> crossmember<00:03:12.489> out

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
battery box to that crossmember out

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.690 
battery box to that crossmember out
there<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.630> look<00:03:13.900> at

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
there you look at

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.060 
there you look at
real<00:03:15.700> good<00:03:16.050> so<00:03:17.050> I'm<00:03:17.350> pretty<00:03:17.560> happy<00:03:17.680> with<00:03:18.010> that

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
real good so I'm pretty happy with that

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.470 
real good so I'm pretty happy with that
I<00:03:18.370> guess<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.670> next<00:03:18.940> stage<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.570> will<00:03:20.200> be<00:03:20.380> to

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
I guess the next stage here will be to

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.820 
I guess the next stage here will be to
get<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.690> transmission<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.440> back<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.740> the

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
get that transmission in the back of the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.560 
get that transmission in the back of the
truck<00:03:24.040> and<00:03:24.190> run<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.790> up<00:03:24.880> somebody<00:03:25.300> who<00:03:25.360> can

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
truck and run it up somebody who can

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.940 
truck and run it up somebody who can
weld<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.900> woman<00:03:26.170> I'm<00:03:26.260> giving<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.620> welders

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
weld a woman I'm giving the welders

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.560 
weld a woman I'm giving the welders
wheels<00:03:27.190> back<00:03:27.430> on<00:03:27.610> there<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:28.000> might<00:03:28.300> try<00:03:28.540> that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
wheels back on there I might try that
