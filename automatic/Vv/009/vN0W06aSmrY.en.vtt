00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:08.620
 hello friends how are you today is the turn 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:10.860
 of law yes the spy plane of finn 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.860
 mcmissile 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.170
 and that helps to save lightning mcqueen and 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.170
 amate 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.880
 in the back of the pack it looks like 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.090
 the things that can be done to open 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.570
 the rear hatch towing a car 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.750
 inside the plane even shoot 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.750
 missiles 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 next to the instructions come the two 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.020
 only pieces that need to be assembled 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.390
 and it is explained perfectly 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.050
 how to put the missiles inside the plane 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.010
 and how to fit the pieces of the rooms 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.010
 that come loose 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.820
 you can lower the rear hatch 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.820
 take out the trailer hook a car 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.800
 these are the two missiles that come 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 and now we are fitting the two pieces 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:37.109
 that come loose apart from the missiles 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.109
 they are the tail of the plane 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.610
 this is a missile that we introduce below 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.610
 of the wing 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.970
 and pressing a button here 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.300
 because they shoot with enough power 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.710
 pulling here we lower the floodgate 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.710
 back while I was 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.450
 and with your finger we take out what is the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.450
 hook for towing 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.780
 on the back of the engine 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.780
 left of the plane 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.480
 is a thread that serves to 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.970
 go pulling the rope 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.020
 and hooks 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.020
 the trailer 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.960
 If there is also a trapdoor 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.320
 top that opens and lets us see your 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.320
 inside 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:21.260
 and how are they going 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.260
 the cars inside 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.910
