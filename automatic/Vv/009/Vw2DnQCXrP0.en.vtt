00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.350
 for the comments I think the 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.800
 first matches 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.560
 especially important 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.430
 and postponed which puts us in a 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.290
 good spiral 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.650
 then his power the work he 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.810
 remains a huge league in the mastery in 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.700
 first half 15-9 and role too fast 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.250
 because of the balloon and we were in the 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.890
 same cavalry I finally found the 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.700
 players a bit crazy I found them 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.710
 players a bit like a young cook 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.840
 who pockets his first to his first 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.850
 girl there was the first at the mine 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.520
 austere cfa knew we would be expected 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.620
 we are happy to have prayed capois we are 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.230
 includes other statements that mutated on 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.929
 will savor this michael and from 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 Monday what I 'm told you're pestering against 

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.989
 the realism of the attackers and mathieu 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.789
 nicolas it's on the one of the center in san 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.850
 luis and yeah yeah I think their 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.289
 help even in my opinion more logically due 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 to be marked expected on the accounts in 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.719
 late in the game when more complete 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.249
 the moorings of firmness but I am 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:04.720
 happy for pira because he scored 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:05.710
 his first goal was important even 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.570
 if physically he is not yet 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 completely ready it makes us feel good 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.290
 i'm disappointed for david who got 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.070
 high because it slaughters a 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.620
 huge job 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.240
 I am especially disappointed that the beauty that has 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.720
 makes a good comeback it's easy and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.920
 mans laval but here I am relieved 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.940
 to have taken the four points this is the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.100
 first when 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.500
 six rounds I have more complicated and at the same 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.920
 time is also that there is a lot of 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.870
 job 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.670
 which is interesting in the match 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.730
 official is that once you have 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.060
 we distracted 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.670
 it's an official match so it's good 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.510
 we believe in 4 points in May two and we 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.970
 does not take it into account 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.010
 everything is positive and above all low 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 we feel jarlot scored a goal 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.990
 on a beautiful balloon of ben so everything 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.610
 is better than we can see for 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.280
 the team too if you've managed the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.580
 pole to the rather selective physical challenge of 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.880
 rome yeah bah because we know that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.920
 it's face it's physical so that's it 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.870
 played on it and and then I think 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.490
 we had a good answer there was a 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.050
 moment to take a quarter of an hour we 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.810
 must enter in eight years it was a little 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.220
 hard good we spent the first except that 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.160
 then after that it was long so it's good 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.030
 if for the continuation the joy of being first 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.230
 goal and it's always fun 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.730
 for the striker to score for his 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.490
 first goal in addition to meinau yeah 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.810
 there I discovered the meinau tonight 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.700
 very impressed but I had a 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.310
 small ball in the belly early good 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.620
 after that went well so we see 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.840
 it's true that after this first goal we 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.760
 gets loose a little bit so I hope 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.930
 it's the first of a long series 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.880
 it's true that the first at home and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.040
 was not so easy that it's good 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.650
 true that we are always expected to be true 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.780
 that we go up one level and we are 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.390
 always as expected and we saw that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.880
 it's very difficult in this first 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.370
 half time we knew how to do it 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.370
 round back and the arrival on our few 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.160
 situations and Russia is effective 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.130
 so it's essential for us in 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.320
 time even if we did not play very well 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 knew how to do what is needed 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.959
 it is the most important 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.360
 you felt the difference between the 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.370
 cfa 2 and let him do it for sure 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.750
 it is true that there is always a small 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.280
 adaptation time also there have been the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.220
 preparation matches but that's right 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.600
 that this is the competition so yes 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.860
 it is true that we felt what after 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.320
 in the physical impact 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.970
 good is something else that we had 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.970
 maybe at home so a little bit 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.440
 timorous also for the first so 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.410
 addressed we recorded little to take 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.190
 goal and the finish we win 2 0 so that's 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.190
 a good thing
