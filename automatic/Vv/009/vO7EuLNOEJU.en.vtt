00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:11.430
 You may have heard that 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.410
 created a water powered car is only 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.120
 put water in the tank and run out 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.300
 really good right 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.400
 the water powered car is a revolution only 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.890
 is not manufactured because of the industry 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.589
 of the oil that kills who can 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.579
 make a country are bad are capitalists 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.720
 of evil 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:33.030
 AvarÃ© you believe this is true is 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 that one believes in this small talk 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.060
 you think if it was feasible to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.440
 point to be made in back yard 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.750
 already on the market 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.510
 do not believe in any theory of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.960
 conspiracy where there are evil 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.390
 nice being nice, the guy 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.460
 You're trying to convince me, and you're mean. 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.520
 they they 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.140
 that's how the crazy conspirators get 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.759
 refer to what does not exist they are the 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 government they are the evil industry they are 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:12.180
 the illuminatis they are reptilian at last 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 you must have already understood 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.140
 besides the motorcycle or car that runs only with 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.290
 Water 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.080
 there is also the bike that walks with water and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.720
 gasoline at the same time and if I do not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.060
 I can say a lot maybe 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.180
 gasoline is enough to really 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 generate the hydrogen promoter 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 but the bike moved only with water only with 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 water is nothing more than an electric motorcycle 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710
 The only difference is that a 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.860
 unnecessary work with hydrogen 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.020
 to reuse the gasoline engine when 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.150
 instead of using an electric motor that is 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.540
 much more efficient 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.659
 faith is crazy the non electric bike is 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.360
 powered by hydrogen out of water 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:04.100
 seriously, how is this hydrogen done? 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.049
 It is not free cost electricity is 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.989
 impossible to make the very 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.660
 the car carries the battery with itself 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.790
 movement since to walk 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.840
 it is dispersing this energy if 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.110
 you do not have to 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.080
 100% yew back if anyway 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.629
 You still doubt what I said. 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.750
 In registering for this video you will find 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.390
 links to expert explanation 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.640
 in the subject even creator of the system 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.519
 said that it is impossible 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.360
 the bike does not need to be recharged in the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.959
 power plug 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.870
 The best they can try is to 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.209
 Time you can not start a motorcycle. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.739
 To put water on her, you only have to turn one hour. 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.530
 will have to put it in the socket 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.400
 one if they say that this makes the economy of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.220
 gasoline 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.519
 others say it's just a waste of time and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.799
 Money and what do you think is yours? 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.340
 contribute to the discussion of the 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:05.459
 subject and if you have any questions I 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.950
 I'll try to respond within the possible
