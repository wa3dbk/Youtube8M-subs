today<00:00:09.150> we<00:00:09.690> are<00:00:09.750> going<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.170> look<00:00:10.440> at<00:00:10.679> stitch

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
today we are going to look at stitch

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.560 
today we are going to look at stitch
resist<00:00:12.349> using<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.830> simple<00:00:14.400> needle<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.030> thread

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
resist using a simple needle and thread

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.099 
resist using a simple needle and thread
to<00:00:15.839> stitch<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.740> gather<00:00:17.010> fabric<00:00:17.960> pushing<00:00:18.960> it

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
to stitch and gather fabric pushing it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.099 
to stitch and gather fabric pushing it
into<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.800> textured<00:00:20.609> bundle<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.720> be<00:00:21.840> dyed

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
into a textured bundle that can be dyed

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.580 
into a textured bundle that can be dyed
on<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.680> surface<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:24.390> beautiful<00:00:24.990> pattern<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
on the surface this beautiful pattern is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.519 
on the surface this beautiful pattern is
from<00:00:25.830> China<00:00:26.180> it's<00:00:27.180> done<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.660> heavier<00:00:28.199> weight

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
from China it's done on a heavier weight

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.220 
from China it's done on a heavier weight
cotton<00:00:28.859> than<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.670> kimono<00:00:30.090> cloth<00:00:30.420> from<00:00:30.689> Japan

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
cotton than the kimono cloth from Japan

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.130 
cotton than the kimono cloth from Japan
and<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.790> called<00:00:33.030> horse's<00:00:33.570> mouth<00:00:33.809> or

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and it is called horse's mouth or

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.590 
and it is called horse's mouth or
horse's<00:00:34.710> teeth<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.340> think<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.910> can<00:00:36.120> see<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
horse's teeth I think you can see the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.750 
horse's teeth I think you can see the
resemblance

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
resemblance

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.410 
resemblance
so<00:00:38.760> let's<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.629> how<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.350> done<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:41.420> this

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so let's look how this is done in this

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.250 
so let's look how this is done in this
case<00:00:42.860> we<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.040> two<00:00:44.309> lines<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.930> will<00:00:46.110> have

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
case we have two lines and I will have

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.580 
case we have two lines and I will have
two<00:00:46.559> folds<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.340> we'll<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.510> stitching<00:00:48.870> through

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
two folds and we'll be stitching through

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.220 
two folds and we'll be stitching through
four<00:00:50.129> layers<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.820> fabric<00:00:51.300> along<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> peak

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
four layers of fabric along the peak

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.029 
four layers of fabric along the peak
fold<00:00:52.530> instead<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.820> through<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.469> single<00:00:55.469> peak

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
fold instead of through a single peak

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
fold instead of through a single peak
fold<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.699> two<00:00:57.149> layers<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> fabric<00:01:00.600> suddenly

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
fold in two layers the fabric suddenly

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.450 
fold in two layers the fabric suddenly
becomes<00:01:01.530> bulkier<00:01:03.769> therefore<00:01:04.769> my<00:01:04.949> stitches

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
becomes bulkier therefore my stitches

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
becomes bulkier therefore my stitches
become<00:01:08.460> larger<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.470> way<00:01:11.180> easier<00:01:12.180> this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
become larger and in a way easier this

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
become larger and in a way easier this
is<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> great<00:01:13.890> technique<00:01:14.430> for<00:01:14.909> someone<00:01:15.299> who

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
is a great technique for someone who

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.100 
is a great technique for someone who
does<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:15.869> want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.860> too<00:01:17.250> fussy<00:01:18.110> this

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
does not want to be too fussy this

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.570 
does not want to be too fussy this
sample<00:01:20.420> was<00:01:21.420> stitched<00:01:21.780> through<00:01:22.380> knife<00:01:23.070> pleats

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
sample was stitched through knife pleats

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.859 
sample was stitched through knife pleats
so<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.600> knife<00:01:24.780> pleats<00:01:25.170> were<00:01:25.409> ironed<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
so the knife pleats were ironed in and

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.249 
so the knife pleats were ironed in and
actually<00:01:28.130> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.210> do<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> quick

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
actually if you like you can do a quick

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.980 
actually if you like you can do a quick
basting<00:01:32.009> stitch<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.610> hold<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.329> folds<00:01:33.720> down

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
basting stitch to hold the folds down

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.940 
basting stitch to hold the folds down
and<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.610> case<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.570> mokume<00:01:37.200> stitches<00:01:37.770> are

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
and in this case the mokume stitches are

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.030 
and in this case the mokume stitches are
not<00:01:38.280> running<00:01:38.579> across<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.990> fabric<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
not running across the fabric with the

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.830 
not running across the fabric with the
grain<00:01:41.310> but<00:01:42.140> diagonally<00:01:44.090> when<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.509> pulled

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
grain but diagonally when this is pulled

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.210 
grain but diagonally when this is pulled
up<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.320> died<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:48.500> think<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.770> something

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
up and died I think you get something

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.140 
up and died I think you get something
quite<00:01:50.490> beautiful<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.409> subtle

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
quite beautiful it's subtle

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.660 
quite beautiful it's subtle
I<00:01:54.800> have<00:01:55.800> done<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.070> series<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:57.080> studies<00:01:58.670> not

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I have done a series of studies not

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
I have done a series of studies not
exactly<00:02:00.270> based<00:02:00.660> on<00:02:00.930> an<00:02:01.110> origami<00:02:01.560> fold<00:02:02.040> in<00:02:02.690> this

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
exactly based on an origami fold in this

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.000 
exactly based on an origami fold in this
case<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:05.180> have<00:02:06.180> marked<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.720> circle<00:02:07.260> on<00:02:07.470> the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
case I have marked a circle on the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:12.260 
case I have marked a circle on the
fabric<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:10.740> can<00:02:11.070> keep<00:02:11.280> track<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
fabric so that I can keep track of a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.670 
fabric so that I can keep track of a
certain<00:02:12.600> symmetry<00:02:14.750> then<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.960> fabric<00:02:16.230> is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
certain symmetry then the fabric is

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.140 
certain symmetry then the fabric is
folded<00:02:17.960> across<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:21.180> circle<00:02:22.400> then<00:02:23.400> one<00:02:23.760> third

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
folded across the circle then one third

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.720 
folded across the circle then one third
of<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> fabric<00:02:25.080> is<00:02:25.260> folded<00:02:25.590> towards<00:02:26.340> me<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
of the fabric is folded towards me and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:34.210 
of the fabric is folded towards me and
one<00:02:27.630> third<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> back<00:02:31.400> then<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.700> sew<00:02:33.270> down

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
one third to the back then I sew down

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.350 
one third to the back then I sew down
this<00:02:35.600> circle<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.140> folds<00:02:37.710> with<00:02:38.610> parallel

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
this circle and the folds with parallel

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.300 
this circle and the folds with parallel
rows<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:40.140> machine<00:02:40.710> stitching<00:02:41.250> I<00:02:43.310> experimented

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
rows of machine stitching I experimented

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.440 
rows of machine stitching I experimented
with<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.930> kinds<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.650> variations<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.970> this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
with all kinds of variations of this

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.970 
with all kinds of variations of this
concept<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.720> different<00:02:51.720> dyes<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.380> different

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
concept and different dyes and different

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.300 
concept and different dyes and different
colors<00:02:53.960> so<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.770> could<00:02:57.380> come<00:02:58.380> up<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:59.040> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
colors so that one could come up with a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.530 
colors so that one could come up with a
variety<00:02:59.670> of<00:03:00.239> ways<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.470> stitch<00:03:02.160> down<00:03:02.540> these

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
variety of ways to stitch down these

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.479 
variety of ways to stitch down these
pique<00:03:04.050> folds<00:03:07.670> in<00:03:09.110> some<00:03:10.110> cases<00:03:10.380> I<00:03:10.800> have<00:03:11.100> six

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
pique folds in some cases I have six

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.720 
pique folds in some cases I have six
layers<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:13.050> other<00:03:13.320> cases<00:03:13.650> I<00:03:14.040> go<00:03:14.400> up<00:03:14.580> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
layers and in other cases I go up to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.220 
layers and in other cases I go up to
eight<00:03:15.000> layers<00:03:16.550> so<00:03:17.550> I'm<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.090> rerun<00:03:18.900> this

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
really even stripe and when I run it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.390 
really even stripe and when I run it
through<00:03:33.209> again<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.900> stripes<00:03:37.320> do<00:03:37.769> not<00:03:38.010> line<00:03:38.370> up

in<00:03:39.019> fact<00:03:40.019> I'm<00:03:40.950> going<00:03:41.400> to<00:03:42.590> exaggerate<00:03:45.560> by

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
in fact I'm going to exaggerate by

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.580 
in fact I'm going to exaggerate by
putting<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.040> little<00:03:47.310> tension<00:03:47.610> on<00:03:48.090> one<00:03:48.120> side<00:03:48.780> I'm

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
putting a little tension on one side I'm

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.199 
putting a little tension on one side I'm
going<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.780> keep<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.050> stripes<00:03:52.790> even<00:03:53.790> more

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
going to keep the stripes even more

going to keep the stripes even more
uneven<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:56.220> can<00:03:56.430> see<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.180> this<00:03:57.390> fabric

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
uneven and you can see that this fabric

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.910 
uneven and you can see that this fabric
as<00:03:58.200> its<00:03:59.010> run<00:03:59.489> through<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:01.609> is<00:04:02.609> repleted

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
as its run through and is repleted

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
here is a fan shape of a very similar

here is a fan shape of a very similar
fabric<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:16.950> is<00:04:17.160> actually<00:04:17.880> an<00:04:18.570> organza<00:04:19.489> satin
