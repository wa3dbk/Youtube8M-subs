great big screen at the front which

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.320 
great big screen at the front which
comes<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.960> high<00:01:13.170> up<00:01:13.610> will<00:01:14.610> say<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
comes very high up will say that the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.230 
comes very high up will say that the
side<00:01:15.630> mirrors<00:01:16.200> are<00:01:16.470> way<00:01:16.890> too<00:01:16.950> low<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.939> way<00:01:18.180> too

far back I don't quite understand the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
far back I don't quite understand the
logic<00:01:21.060> behind<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.780> need<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> go

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
logic behind that they need to go

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080 
logic behind that they need to go
forward<00:01:22.470> by<00:01:22.680> about<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> foot<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.670> by<00:01:23.880> about

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
forward by about a foot and up by about

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.260 
forward by about a foot and up by about
four<00:01:24.390> inches<00:01:24.780> but<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.130> enormous<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
four inches but they are enormous and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
four inches but they are enormous and
they<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.720> offer<00:01:28.080> quite<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> lot<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:28.710> vision<00:01:29.009> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
they do offer quite a lot of vision but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.620 
they do offer quite a lot of vision but
the<00:01:29.490> thing<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.729> you've<00:01:30.030> got<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> turn<00:01:30.420> your

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the thing is you've got to turn your

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.999 
the thing is you've got to turn your
head<00:01:30.780> about<00:01:31.020> three<00:01:31.320> inches<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.710> be<00:01:31.829> able<00:01:31.950> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
head about three inches to be able to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.850 
head about three inches to be able to
see<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.970> flood

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
see them so that's a flood

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
see them so that's a flood
this<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> automatic<00:01:35.850> gearbox<00:01:36.330> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
this is the automatic gearbox and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.960 
this is the automatic gearbox and
considering<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.320> such<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.530> small<00:01:37.830> engine<00:01:40.970> and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
considering it's such a small engine and

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.480 
considering it's such a small engine and
just<00:01:42.180> pull<00:01:42.390> away<00:01:42.510> quite<00:01:42.900> nicely<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:44.280> could

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
just pull away quite nicely you could

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.160 
just pull away quite nicely you could

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
car to be thrown around I don't think

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
car to be thrown around I don't think
it's<00:02:32.130> a<00:02:32.250> very<00:02:32.280> safe<00:02:32.730> vehicle<00:02:32.970> and<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.570> certainly

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's a very safe vehicle and I certainly

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.710 
it's a very safe vehicle and I certainly
don't<00:02:34.050> feel<00:02:34.200> safe<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:34.920> it<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.120> will<00:02:36.480> say

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
don't feel safe in it but I will say

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.090 
don't feel safe in it but I will say
it's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.930> stylish<00:02:37.170> little<00:02:37.620> vehicle

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
it's a stylish little vehicle

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.120 
it's a stylish little vehicle
it's<00:02:39.000> very<00:02:39.209> Kemp

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.510 

but<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.490> drives<00:02:42.700> along<00:02:43.030> quite<00:02:43.300> nicely<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:44.520> think

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
but it drives along quite nicely I think

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.730 
but it drives along quite nicely I think
probably<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.540> manual<00:02:47.020> would<00:02:47.140> be<00:02:47.320> a<00:02:47.350> bit<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.650> a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
probably the manual would be a bit of a

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.560 
probably the manual would be a bit of a
better<00:02:47.920> option<00:02:48.160> with<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.520> car<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.180> cos

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
better option with a car like this cos

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.050
