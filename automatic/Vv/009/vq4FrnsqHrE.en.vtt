00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
you have to like stuff it in the corners

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.200 
you have to like stuff it in the corners
there<00:03:09.950> like<00:03:10.280> that's<00:03:10.520> all<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.700> room<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:10.970> got

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
there like that's all the room you got

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.840 
there like that's all the room you got
but<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.230> was<00:03:12.320> on<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.590> first<00:03:12.830> kind<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.250> major

Chuck<00:03:20.150> I'm<00:03:20.300> gonna<00:03:20.480> guess<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:20.900> can't<00:03:21.140> go<00:03:21.290> for

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
Chuck I'm gonna guess this can't go for

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.830 
Chuck I'm gonna guess this can't go for
like<00:03:21.560> six<00:03:21.800> thousand<00:03:22.390> probably<00:03:23.390> buy<00:03:23.630> it<00:03:23.690> just

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
like six thousand probably buy it just

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.949 
like six thousand probably buy it just
for<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.200> motor<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:25.660> tune<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.870> and

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
for the motor and tune it and

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.530 
for the motor and tune it and
transmission<00:03:27.760> probably<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.880> pedal<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.300> want

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
transmission probably the pedal I want

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.050 
transmission probably the pedal I want
that<00:03:29.660> freaking<00:03:30.020> pedal<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.500> what<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.770> want

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.460 
try drive I think you would rip on
anything<00:04:43.940> but<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.120> pretty<00:04:45.389> much<00:04:45.600> crash<00:04:46.169> so

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
anything but it's pretty much crash so

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.129 
anything but it's pretty much crash so
it<00:04:46.650> doesn't<00:04:46.919> look<00:04:47.010> bad<00:04:47.220> but<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.669> is<00:04:47.910> it's<00:04:48.240> clean

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
it doesn't look bad but it is it's clean

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:58.129 
it doesn't look bad but it is it's clean
but<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.500> not<00:04:49.620> clean<00:04:53.660> so<00:04:54.660> yeah<00:04:56.419> pretty<00:04:57.419> nice

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
but it's not clean so yeah pretty nice

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.550 
but it's not clean so yeah pretty nice
I<00:04:58.169> wouldn't<00:04:58.530> mind<00:04:58.680> this<00:04:59.660> has<00:05:00.660> hydraulic<00:05:01.080> tanks

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
I wouldn't mind this has hydraulic tanks

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.230 
I wouldn't mind this has hydraulic tanks
it's<00:05:01.770> four<00:05:01.979> dots<00:05:02.250> for<00:05:02.430> the<00:05:02.520> winch<00:05:02.729> actually

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
it's four dots for the winch actually

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.420 
it's four dots for the winch actually
winch<00:05:03.600> in<00:05:03.810> which<00:05:03.990> Oh<00:05:04.340> speed<00:05:05.340> low<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:07.260> dog<00:05:07.530> the

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
winch in which Oh speed low the dog the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.020 
winch in which Oh speed low the dog the
dogs<00:05:08.700> you<00:05:09.090> know<00:05:09.240> for<00:05:09.630> the<00:05:09.780> deck<00:05:10.700> it's<00:05:11.700> apart

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
dogs you know for the deck it's apart

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.659 
dogs you know for the deck it's apart
like<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.780> decks<00:05:13.020> like<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.919> roller<00:05:14.100> I<00:05:14.370> say

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:14.669 
like the decks like the roller I say

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.310 
like the decks like the roller I say
that<00:05:14.880> there's<00:05:15.060> a<00:05:15.120> role<00:05:15.270> here<00:05:15.510> they'll<00:05:16.050> come<00:05:16.260> up

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
that there's a role here they'll come up

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.550 
that there's a role here they'll come up
and<00:05:16.620> they'll<00:05:17.570> stop<00:05:18.570> things<00:05:18.900> from<00:05:18.960> sliding<00:05:19.199> I

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
and they'll stop things from sliding I

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.090 
and they'll stop things from sliding I
believe<00:05:20.479> that's<00:05:21.479> pretty<00:05:21.660> cool<00:05:24.530> let's<00:05:25.530> go<00:05:25.770> walk

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
believe that's pretty cool let's go walk

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.129 
believe that's pretty cool let's go walk
around<00:05:26.250> it<00:05:27.710> walk<00:05:28.710> pretty<00:05:29.070> nice<00:05:29.930> sudden<00:05:30.930> here's

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
around it walk pretty nice sudden here's

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.250 
around it walk pretty nice sudden here's
a<00:05:31.260> gravel<00:05:31.680> kind<00:05:31.919> of<00:05:32.010> it<00:05:32.660> try<00:05:33.660> drive<00:05:33.930> like<00:05:34.110> it

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
a gravel kind of it try drive like it

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.080 
a gravel kind of it try drive like it
said<00:05:35.450> looks<00:05:36.450> like<00:05:36.599> at<00:05:36.750> all<00:05:36.900> so<00:05:37.169> inch<00:05:37.910> yeah<00:05:38.910> it's

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
said looks like at all so inch yeah it's

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:44.000 
said looks like at all so inch yeah it's
a<00:05:39.210> toss<00:05:39.419> away<00:05:40.370> um<00:05:42.200> winch<00:05:43.200> chapter<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.770> got

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.010 
a toss away um winch chapter I got

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.450 
a toss away um winch chapter I got
obviously<00:05:44.639> I<00:05:45.110> think<00:05:46.110> the<00:05:46.200> dogs<00:05:46.530> art<00:05:47.039> should<00:05:47.400> be

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
obviously I think the dogs art should be

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.070 
obviously I think the dogs art should be
on<00:05:47.639> the<00:05:47.729> trailer<00:05:48.000> I<00:05:48.330> think<00:05:48.810> it's<00:05:48.930> talking

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
on the trailer I think it's talking

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.010 
on the trailer I think it's talking
about<00:05:49.520> it's<00:05:50.520> not<00:05:50.729> hydraulic<00:05:51.270> spread<00:05:51.690> because

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
about it's not hydraulic spread because

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.909 
about it's not hydraulic spread because
it's<00:05:52.200> so<00:05:52.349> much<00:05:52.500> weight<00:05:52.800> on<00:05:52.830> there<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:53.849> take

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
it's so much weight on there it can take

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:00.080 
it's so much weight on there it can take
