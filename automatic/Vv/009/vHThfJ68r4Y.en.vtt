00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello welcome one more day to the garden in 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.130
 your hands 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.050
 Today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.970
 winter treatments that we call 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.490
 Winter treatments are not usually 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.520
 to call 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 the phytosanitary treatments that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 They made against pests on everything 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.400
 they usually do in deciduous trees 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.730
 whether they are fruit trees, whether they are roses or 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.309
 any shade tree that is a tree 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.340
 Deciduous this type of treatments 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 he is usually given to kill especially 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.970
 wintering forms of fungus insects 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.699
 of mites that may have been left 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.640
 last year on the tree pass the 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.309
 winter shaped egg or shaped 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.089
 larva what these products do is 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.250
 act physically on the plague or the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.330
 disease 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.540
 the product is an oil that acts 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.770
 leaves a layer on the branches and on the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.260
 trunk and that layer suffocates the eggs to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.380
 the larvae to the fungal spores 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 that we may have stayed over the years 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.580
 above therefore to treat 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.590
 these trees do not need two 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:28.650
 products an insecticide that is usually 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.470
 use mineral oils oils 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 they are viscous liquids that have action 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.660
 about insects on mites 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.479
 then primarily used one 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.450
 fungicide that is usually the cycle 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.880
 hard copper or copper that are products 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.580
 they have a bluish hue and good 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.100
 They also use a lot to avoid 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.990
 fungus problems the house inhabits 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.880
 Earth offers us different products 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.479
 for doing these treatments is one of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.479
 they are an insecticide based on 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.710
 chlorpyrifos that can be used to 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.930
 do insecticide action 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.720
 and on the other hand we have a 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.440
 fungicide with copper that also 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 it serves to kill then that they are fungi 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.690
 and very important spores 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.890
 fruit that are unemployed are 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.050
 unemployed means that they have not 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.510
 started to sprout that's because these 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.950
 products can leave some residue that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.720
 generate cytotoxicity that's what 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.760
 mainly what causes the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.620
 cytotoxicity is that the lens of the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.860
 sprouting process and can burn 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.950
 some plant tissues by 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.140
 example well here we see this plum tree that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.120
 already has sprouting very advanced then 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.430
 in this case it would not be convenient 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.140
 throw it out or it should have been applied 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.540
 because with 10 days notice our 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.420
 variety of plums of still not 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.430
 they are voted because they are slower 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.170
 Well, in this case, you can 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.480
 apply without any problem we are going to 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.280
 proceed to treatment here we have a 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.170
 good spray backpack is very 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.390
 important when making the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.360
 mixtures of this type of products then 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.490
 extreme precautions here we see that 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 we have about 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.129
 with gloves 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:25.459
 that come in the product itself 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:27.970
 we use we use these gloves but 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.970
 good 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.650
 if there were no gloves we would have to 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.600
 get us some because always 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.140
 these products come well because they are 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 chemicals that always keep 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.870
 some toxicity you have to adjust to what 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.090
 what the manufacturer says to you here in this 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.310
 case with the says two milliliters per 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.460
 every liter of water good us here 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.800
 in the in the backpack we have five liters 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.390
 preparations are not attached the product 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.400
 as a dosing syringe 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.400
 deschamps we have the water 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.360
 and now we have the fungicide 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:13.600
 He also comes with gloves 2 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:14.780
 grams per liter of water this spoonful 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.510
 make 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.400
 a gram and a half is very important 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.709
 also when we perform the treatment 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.419
 as always calculate more or less what 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.520
 let's spend good is not good to be 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.460
 we left the remaining product in the 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.790
 backpack and much less is good then 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.639
 throw it to drains or out there is better 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.820
 spend it on other plants although 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.590
 do not need at that moment good 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.160
 It is also very important to be able to take 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.120
 precautions with from a mask 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.160
 usually the masks there are 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.620
 different types of these one mask 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.409
 so appropriate so you do not get the train 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:54.119
 well 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:54.119
 and powdered liquids 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.389
 or not 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.389
 ah 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.400
 Well, you have seen how I have 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.680
 applied whenever we apply this 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.930
 product then it is necessary to get to 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.629
 all branches to all parts of the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.639
 trunk because in the cracks especially 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:25.469
 in the cracks that have the plant in 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:27.389
 the trunk or branches is where 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:31.349
 are these wintering forms going to be 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.629
 of eggs in the trunk that also swims 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:37.560
 it is important then the time to do it 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:39.270
 it's now in the February frame because it's 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.650
 when this kind of 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.629
 treatment 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.629
 I hope you learned one more thing
