00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
Rift like this is space crime time

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.539 
Rift like this is space crime time
continuum<00:01:29.259> Rift<00:01:29.469> Valley<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:30.280> there's<00:01:30.429> like

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
continuum Rift Valley and there's like

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.160 
continuum Rift Valley and there's like
you<00:01:30.909> know<00:01:30.939> get<00:01:31.299> a<00:01:31.329> ton<00:01:31.539> of<00:01:31.570> points<00:01:31.810> for<00:01:32.079> that

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
you know get a ton of points for that

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.020 
you know get a ton of points for that
and<00:01:32.439> it<00:01:32.530> looks<00:01:32.649> cool<00:01:32.920> and<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.219> just<00:01:33.399> decimate

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
and it looks cool and you just decimate

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.539 
and it looks cool and you just decimate
their<00:01:34.210> team<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> that's<00:01:35.710> rift<00:01:36.009> and<00:01:36.219> it's<00:01:36.429> a

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
their team and so that's rift and it's a

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.520 
their team and so that's rift and it's a
blast<00:01:36.820> and<00:01:37.240> in<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.719> other<00:01:37.780> mode<00:01:38.020> we<00:01:38.140> have<00:01:38.350> is

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
blast and in the other mode we have is

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.620 
blast and in the other mode we have is
as<00:01:38.679> mayhem<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.880> is<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.179> answer<00:01:40.329> to<00:01:40.479> the

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
as mayhem this is the answer to the

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.510 
as mayhem this is the answer to the
question<00:01:40.749> what<00:01:41.619> would<00:01:41.740> happen<00:01:42.100> if<00:01:42.219> you<00:01:42.429> know

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
question what would happen if you know

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.310 
question what would happen if you know
your<00:01:42.670> supers<00:01:43.030> recharge<00:01:43.479> like<00:01:43.749> three<00:01:43.960> times<00:01:44.170> as

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
your supers recharge like three times as

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.810 
your supers recharge like three times as
