00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
it's pretty much a slot machine so yeah

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.910 
it's pretty much a slot machine so yeah
the<00:00:16.780> thing<00:00:16.810> that<00:00:17.050> inspired<00:00:17.410> me<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.619> do<00:00:17.740> this

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
the thing that inspired me to do this

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.000 
the thing that inspired me to do this
was<00:00:18.280> Fe<00:00:18.850> discos<00:00:19.330> Pig<00:00:20.110> powered<00:00:20.410> slot<00:00:20.680> machine

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
was Fe discos Pig powered slot machine

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.730 
was Fe discos Pig powered slot machine
this<00:00:21.940> is<00:00:22.089> this<00:00:22.330> is<00:00:22.509> a<00:00:22.539> cow<00:00:23.080> powered<00:00:23.529> slot

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
this is this is a cow powered slot

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.859 
this is this is a cow powered slot
machine<00:00:24.009> but<00:00:24.189> you<00:00:24.220> don't<00:00:24.400> see<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.759> cows<00:00:24.970> so

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
machine but you don't see the cows so

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.079 
machine but you don't see the cows so
the<00:00:26.320> way<00:00:26.439> this<00:00:26.560> works<00:00:26.800> if<00:00:27.099> we<00:00:27.130> walk<00:00:27.550> over<00:00:27.730> here

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
the way this works if we walk over here

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.810 
the way this works if we walk over here
and<00:00:28.150> chuck<00:00:28.480> a<00:00:28.509> diamond<00:00:28.960> in<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:30.189> will<00:00:30.339> then<00:00:30.490> see

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
and chuck a diamond in we will then see

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.450 
and chuck a diamond in we will then see
that<00:00:31.300> the<00:00:31.749> numbers<00:00:32.110> will<00:00:32.230> start<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.740> roll<00:00:33.100> and

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
that the numbers will start to roll and

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.120 
that the numbers will start to roll and
start<00:00:34.180> to<00:00:34.420> you<00:00:34.780> know<00:00:34.810> basically<00:00:35.440> show<00:00:35.620> random

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
start to you know basically show random

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.720 
start to you know basically show random
stuff<00:00:36.400> and<00:00:37.379> when<00:00:38.379> we<00:00:38.500> give<00:00:38.649> it<00:00:38.770> some<00:00:38.949> time<00:00:39.190> it

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
stuff and when we give it some time it

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.260 
stuff and when we give it some time it
will<00:00:39.910> give<00:00:40.270> a<00:00:40.949> random<00:00:41.949> number<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:45.120> we've<00:00:46.120> got

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
will give a random number so we've got

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.229 
will give a random number so we've got
one<00:00:46.510> one<00:00:46.840> if<00:00:46.989> we<00:00:47.079> get<00:00:47.170> one<00:00:47.520> yep<00:00:48.520> we've<00:00:48.730> won<00:00:48.910> yeah

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
one one if we get one yep we've won yeah

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.750 
one one if we get one yep we've won yeah
first<00:00:49.750> attempt<00:00:50.320> right<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.190> now<00:00:51.309> we've<00:00:51.460> got<00:00:51.609> our

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
first attempt right so now we've got our

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
first attempt right so now we've got our
reward<00:00:52.359> which<00:00:52.629> is<00:00:52.780> some<00:00:52.989> diamonds<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:54.309> got

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
reward which is some diamonds we got

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.259 
reward which is some diamonds we got
five<00:00:55.780> diamonds<00:00:56.079> which<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.559> not<00:00:56.710> bad<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.269> it's

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
five diamonds which is not bad and it's

00:00:58.269 --> 00:00:59.819 
five diamonds which is not bad and it's
always<00:00:58.449> a<00:00:58.480> rip<00:00:58.690> off<00:00:58.840> these<00:00:59.050> things<00:00:59.230> but<00:00:59.559> yeah

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
always a rip off these things but yeah

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.680 
always a rip off these things but yeah
we<00:01:00.640> took<00:01:00.760> another<00:01:00.879> diamond<00:01:01.269> dimmer<00:01:01.480> can<00:01:01.600> ever

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
we took another diamond dimmer can ever

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.710 
we took another diamond dimmer can ever
really<00:01:01.899> go<00:01:02.050> I<00:01:02.760> know<00:01:03.760> I'm<00:01:04.150> not<00:01:04.239> very<00:01:04.300> good<00:01:04.600> at

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
really go I know I'm not very good at

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
really go I know I'm not very good at
making<00:01:04.839> things<00:01:05.080> look<00:01:05.590> nice<00:01:05.830> but<00:01:06.310> hey<00:01:07.270> oh<00:01:07.300> oh

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
making things look nice but hey oh oh

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.940 
making things look nice but hey oh oh
well<00:01:09.430> so<00:01:10.030> we've<00:01:10.270> got<00:01:10.420> three<00:01:10.960> three<00:01:11.170> two<00:01:11.410> so<00:01:11.830> we

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
well so we've got three three two so we

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.190 
well so we've got three three two so we
didn't<00:01:12.250> win<00:01:12.370> anything<00:01:12.580> that<00:01:12.820> time<00:01:13.060> see<00:01:13.840> we<00:01:14.020> got

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
didn't win anything that time see we got

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.760 
didn't win anything that time see we got
no<00:01:14.500> reward<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.870> so<00:01:16.870> this<00:01:17.020> thing<00:01:17.230> is<00:01:17.410> actually

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
no reward and so this thing is actually

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.030 
no reward and so this thing is actually
really<00:01:18.070> small<00:01:18.520> oh<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.180> I<00:01:19.330> built<00:01:19.630> this<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.140> I

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
really small oh and I built this and I

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.440 
really small oh and I built this and I
think<00:01:21.190> there's<00:01:21.340> about<00:01:21.400> seven<00:01:21.850> hours<00:01:22.120> if<00:01:22.360> you

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
think there's about seven hours if you

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.120 
think there's about seven hours if you
follow<00:01:22.630> me<00:01:22.750> on<00:01:22.810> Twitter<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.320> will<00:01:23.350> see<00:01:23.650> that<00:01:23.950> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
follow me on Twitter you will see that I

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.250 
follow me on Twitter you will see that I
kinda<00:01:24.670> did<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.850> little<00:01:25.030> note<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.660> myself<00:01:25.840> on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
kinda did a little note for myself on

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.050 
kinda did a little note for myself on
there<00:01:26.470> saying<00:01:26.770> started<00:01:27.400> and<00:01:27.550> finished

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
there saying started and finished

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.310 
there saying started and finished
um<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:29.560> yeah<00:01:29.770> we<00:01:30.760> got<00:01:30.940> two<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.420> two<00:01:31.660> we<00:01:32.200> will

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
um but yeah we got two to two we will

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.200 
um but yeah we got two to two we will
again<00:01:33.180> nice<00:01:34.180> one<00:01:34.480> so<00:01:35.290> yeah<00:01:36.130> anyway<00:01:36.430> if<00:01:36.880> we<00:01:36.940> just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
again nice one so yeah anyway if we just

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.730 
again nice one so yeah anyway if we just
head<00:01:37.330> around<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.600> back<00:01:38.970> we<00:01:39.970> will<00:01:40.120> see<00:01:40.740> that

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
head around the back we will see that

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.120 
head around the back we will see that
it's<00:01:42.090> relatively<00:01:43.090> small<00:01:43.360> and<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.920> very

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
it's relatively small and it's very

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.380 
it's relatively small and it's very
nicely<00:01:45.310> color-coordinated<00:01:46.300> as<00:01:46.390> well<00:01:46.570> so<00:01:47.410> I'm

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
nicely color-coordinated as well so I'm

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.880 
nicely color-coordinated as well so I'm
going<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.450> go<00:01:49.660> into<00:01:49.840> too<00:01:50.050> much<00:01:50.080> detail<00:01:50.380> how

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
going to go into too much detail how

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.180 
going to go into too much detail how
this<00:01:51.100> works<00:01:51.370> like<00:01:51.760> each<00:01:51.970> circuit<00:01:52.660> and<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
this works like each circuit and but the

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.090 
this works like each circuit and but the
randomization<00:01:55.000> part<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.480> is<00:01:55.630> based<00:01:55.960> on<00:01:56.290> this

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
randomization part that is based on this

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.970 
randomization part that is based on this
spawner<00:01:57.580> healed<00:01:58.030> for<00:01:58.300> three<00:01:58.540> spawner<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.170> so

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
spawner healed for three spawner and so

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.080 
spawner healed for three spawner and so
if<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.130> just<00:02:00.340> trigger<00:02:00.760> it<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.180> will<00:02:01.720> show<00:02:01.960> you

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
if I just trigger it I will show you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.820 
if I just trigger it I will show you
that<00:02:04.090> missed<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.570> missed<00:02:04.810> so<00:02:05.590> if<00:02:05.650> we<00:02:05.740> go<00:02:05.800> down

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that missed that missed so if we go down

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.330 
that missed that missed so if we go down
here<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.780> can<00:02:07.900> see<00:02:07.930> under<00:02:08.080> here<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.979> Ali's

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
here you can see under here the Ali's

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.449 
here you can see under here the Ali's
retract<00:02:09.819> and<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.170> cows<00:02:11.440> will<00:02:11.800> randomly<00:02:12.160> spawn

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
retract and the cows will randomly spawn

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.890 
retract and the cows will randomly spawn
on<00:02:12.610> one<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.849> those<00:02:13.000> three<00:02:13.300> pressure<00:02:13.569> plates

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
on one of those three pressure plates

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.289 
on one of those three pressure plates
and<00:02:14.200> that<00:02:14.829> is<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.129> randomization<00:02:15.790> part<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.150> it

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
and that is the randomization part of it

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.830 
and that is the randomization part of it
so<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:18.209> should<00:02:19.209> activate

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
so I should activate

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.050 
so I should activate
time<00:02:20.050> soon<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:24.010> M<00:02:24.280> this<00:02:24.310> buona<00:02:24.790> is

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
time soon and so this M this buona is

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.170 
time soon and so this M this buona is
set<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.540> spawn<00:02:26.140> with<00:02:27.099> nothing<00:02:27.550> like<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> minimum

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
set to spawn with nothing like a minimum

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.160 
set to spawn with nothing like a minimum
delay<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.780> about<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.700> hundred<00:02:31.120> gem<00:02:31.599> game<00:02:31.870> ticks

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
delay of about a hundred gem game ticks

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.650 
delay of about a hundred gem game ticks
and<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.590> maximum<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.480> seven<00:02:34.480> or<00:02:34.599> eight

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
and a maximum of like seven or eight

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.470 
and a maximum of like seven or eight
hundred<00:02:34.950> so<00:02:35.950> yeah<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.090> really<00:02:37.330> really

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
hundred so yeah it's really really

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.140 
hundred so yeah it's really really
really<00:02:38.019> random<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.799> it's<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.610> spawn<00:02:39.879> count

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
really random and it's the spawn count

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.030 
really random and it's the spawn count
is<00:02:40.269> set<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.569> one<00:02:40.780> so<00:02:41.290> you'll<00:02:41.410> never<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:41.799> dodgy

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
is set to one so you'll never get dodgy

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.509 
is set to one so you'll never get dodgy
number<00:02:42.459> at<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.239> time<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.510> didn't<00:02:43.720> win<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.519> so

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
number at that time we didn't win and so

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:46.800 
number at that time we didn't win and so
yeah<00:02:45.670> I'm<00:02:45.790> going<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> tie<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.239> world<00:02:46.599> up<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
yeah I'm going to tie this world up a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.990 
yeah I'm going to tie this world up a
