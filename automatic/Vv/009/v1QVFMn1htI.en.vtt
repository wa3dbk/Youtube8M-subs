has a little bit of a wall in the mid

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.160 
has a little bit of a wall in the mid
game<00:02:19.910> just<00:02:20.120> depending<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:20.540> how<00:02:20.660> things<00:02:20.930> have

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170

game just depending on how things have
been<00:02:21.200> going<00:02:21.350> but<00:02:21.860> it's<00:02:21.950> not<00:02:22.130> that<00:02:22.160> bad<00:02:22.490> it's

been going but it's not that bad it's

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.490 
been going but it's not that bad it's
just<00:02:23.240> because<00:02:23.390> you're<00:02:23.510> still<00:02:23.720> scaling<00:02:24.290> really

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500

besides just trolling you so the reason

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.010 
besides just trolling you so the reason
why<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.890> because<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:55.670> know<00:02:55.880> people<00:02:56.120> think<00:02:56.510> teemo

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
why is because I know people think teemo

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.620 
why is because I know people think teemo
is<00:02:57.170> either<00:02:57.350> the<00:02:57.710> worst<00:02:58.040> champion<00:02:58.580> or<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:59.390> best

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
is either the worst champion or the best

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.440 
is either the worst champion or the best
champion<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.250> interesting<00:03:01.880> concept

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
champion and this is interesting concept

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.980 
champion and this is interesting concept
wise<00:03:02.630> one<00:03:03.530> if<00:03:03.830> Teemo<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.730> played<00:03:05.030> slightly

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
wise one if Teemo is played slightly

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.170 
wise one if Teemo is played slightly
incorrectly<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:07.160> usually<00:03:07.340> doesn't<00:03:07.790> work<00:03:07.820> at

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
incorrectly it usually doesn't work at

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.090 
incorrectly it usually doesn't work at
all<00:03:08.240> and<00:03:08.840> he<00:03:08.870> just<00:03:09.140> dies<00:03:09.290> because<00:03:09.590> he's<00:03:09.890> very

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
all and he just dies because he's very

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.650 
all and he just dies because he's very
squishy<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.700> then<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.240> doesn't<00:03:11.390> seem<00:03:11.570> to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
squishy and then it doesn't seem to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.310 
squishy and then it doesn't seem to
offer<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.050> team<00:03:12.260> much<00:03:12.470> but<00:03:13.070> a<00:03:13.250> good<00:03:13.640> team<00:03:13.940> 0<00:03:14.090> is
