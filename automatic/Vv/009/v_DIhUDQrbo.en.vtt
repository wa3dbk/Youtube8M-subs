00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:17.750
 hello dear hungry the brad pitt is 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.240
 a rather American invention 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.579
 and very popular as a gift too 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.110
 grill or other parties or out 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:26.480
 sports events there are many 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.419
 variants we prepare today one 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.980
 simple but very tasty too and it 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.430
 everything is very fast 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.710
 Above all, we need a round one 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.750
 bread to match the event I have one 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.409
 But football must be selected 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.649
 Not be 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:45.829
 we need fresh cheese with herbs 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:48.140
 some mayonnaise tomato salt and 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.809
 sour cream also 1 or 2 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.120
 spring onions and who likes that 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.699
 also the powder of a onion soup 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 or onion or 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.739
 use garlic granules first 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.899
 we need a lid from the bread 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.000
 cut off and you can do that like me 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.630
 with a sharp slice or too 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.190
 Do it all with the tailor 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.500
 Now let's go to the bread inside 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.410
 to extract and cut for it first 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.240
 with the sharpest possible knife 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.310
 deep in and pay attention 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.940
 that the bread is not the biggest 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.950
 get hurt 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.319
 we check if we are deep enough 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.849
 have cut and then take one 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.520
 dice or another suitable 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:31.119
 instrument around the bread inside too 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 to dissolve soil 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.330
 if this is done we can 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.920
 but not 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.479
 still left remnants from the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.459
 bread if he is in remove next 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.239
 we cut the green of the spring 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.860
 or onion in fine thin rings 

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:49.340
 and then enter them into one 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.679
 bowl 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.149
 Now we give the cream cheese and 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.450
 also the sour cream 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.149
 we add the tomato paste and 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.640
 Give the one donkey in as well 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.470
 then season with the salt and me 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.810
 then give me another spoon of 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.700
 onion we have to add onion granules 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.700
 very thoroughly with each other 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.050
 stir and if you still have time 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.520
 should serve up to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.360
 then set the tip once for 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.080
 at least one 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.350
 then fill it for half an hour 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.440
 We selected the bread with it and 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.730
 smooth out the mass a bit now 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.190
 let's cut the inside of the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.410
 bread loaf in mouth or hand just 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:34.610
 pieces and now we can serve 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.100
 put the bread loaf on a plate 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.290
 paper in the bread pieces all around 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.540
 could also like vegetables too 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.520
 Add paprika or tomato to taste 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.230
 excellent and if you have the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.480
 breakball for a special one 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.170
 you can prepare sports event 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.280
 everything is still a bit 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.760
 decorate accordingly 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.050
 cover it and you have to finish 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.130
 not 100% mine here 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.870
 to comply with specifications 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.250
 At least I know this variant 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.950
 it tastes but he could for example 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.350
 also ham or diced collectively 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.489
 with or if it is 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.400
 vegetarian should stay 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.330
 supplement with spinach you can completely 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.670
 be creative 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.830
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.700
 preparation and your good appetite 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.890
 if you prefer something else 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.650
 for example, one would like to prepare 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.930
 surprise bread or pizza dad 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.680
 then just have a look 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.930
 videos into it 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.739
 I still have to say until the 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.640

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.640
 bye Bye
