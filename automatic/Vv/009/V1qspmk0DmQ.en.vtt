 it starts with pictures and i 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:17.029
 agreed to restructure 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.759
 let's say 3 seconds 4 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.599
 6 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.460
 more than 9 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.449

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.919
 15 17 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.919
 largely 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.340

 the boss give me don't know exactly 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.569
 well, that's the script for everyone 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.009
 so now you can quickly spend 10 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.009
 I look from the field until borrow 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.159

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:27.029
 pretty good 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.349
