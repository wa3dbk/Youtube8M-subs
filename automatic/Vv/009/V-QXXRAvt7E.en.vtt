00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 this replenishment try to do it on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.130
 the camera we saw turned out you can 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:42.510
 see her now I will then put a picture 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.610
 power paul voice active trike under 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.470
 I sometimes bump into my fingers 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.710
 stronger thickened places which 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.420
 not amenable to finger it can be 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.600
 made the web but sometimes it's just 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:58.560
 any nerves but every night when 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.650
 we sleep the surface between our muscles 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.840
 can grow cobwebs and 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.860
 in the morning when we wake up and 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.140
 catch up the web thaws we dissolve 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.780
 cobweb this sense of stiffness says 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.649
 us and the hardening of tissues 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.830
 sliding surface is no longer 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:18.660
 glide between them grows web 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.850
 you need to pull up 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.100
 every cat in the world wakes up in the morning 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.899
 pulls up and the web in her body 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.869
 dissolve just like when i 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.830
 ran a finger through it 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.140
 when you move you are like 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.080
 run your finger over the web just like me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.580
 made two friends 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.950
 so we need to pull up and 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.770
 move the axes work their own body to 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.360
 dissolve this web which is growing 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.110
 between sliding on our surfaces 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.729
 muscles of the sliding surface here 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.280
 this shiny white surface is straight 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.780
 thigh muscle glides over the surface 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.310
 intermediate broad thigh muscle and so 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.530
 like the sliding surface inside 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.659
 our whole body and the web inside the whole 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.460
 of our body and when we move we 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.530
 dissolve and the platters and now what 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.150
 will be if we hurt something and mine 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.950
 shoulder my shoulder is now stiff 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
 holds its shoulder nowhere to sleep 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.239
 waking up in the morning i'm not moving my shoulder afraid 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.239
 that she will hurt in short i go 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.310
 something like yesterday's received not 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.500
 dissolved and lord and some more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.040
 I sleep now spider webs for two 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.100
 nights and the web of two nights is more than 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.290
 spider web 1 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.630
 and what if I have a weekly or monthly 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.640
 cobweb now these derived fibers 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.730
 begin to overlap layered and 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.610
 get confused and suddenly you appear 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.630
 formation of thickened fibers and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.580
 now there begins to appear 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.680
 restricting potential movement and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.960
 business is not limited to simple 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 by pulling now we will need 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.340
 you may need to work 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.620
 some sort of systematic examination 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.290
 this area to regain lost 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.550
 mobility usually happens with us 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.770
 temporary injury then we 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.080
 restore mobility but sometimes we 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.970
 call it aging we build up 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.620
 cobweb between sliding surfaces 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.690
 of our body and from this our movement 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 becomes limited and then 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.620
 restrictive cycle and embedded in our 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.690
 normal movement at once 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.870
 then we start moving around 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.240
 And so our field is fully tightened. 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.130
 the body is literally villages and we are cutting 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.930
 the breadth of our movements some 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.230
 certain places of our body or 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.700
 general whole body as a whole so i 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.140
 I think that one of the main advantages 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.690
 bodily work 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.210
 whether massage or structural therapy 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 or physiotherapy and any manual 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:35.530
 therapy is that this type of work 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.300
 introduces a movement by hand into tissues which 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.520
 spider webs due to lack of 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.650
 movement with no matter is a disadvantage 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.660
 motion due to injury which 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:50.230
 man guards or because of personal 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.150
 self expression again for many years I went 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.090
 something like this was very tight and was 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.430
 look like a monk and then I became more 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.320
 I have become a more dynamic person 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.320
 and began to live the life I want 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.750
 and so you can overgrow with cobwebs 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.910
 by choice or by misfortune or somehow 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.590
 but now when you hear the speeches 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.240
 you know what you can take on 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.780
 responsible for dissolving their 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.820
 cobwebs 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.470
 and if your body's web is too much 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.630
 and she with the village la you may 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.730
 need pascal help to lead 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.200
 movement of your fabric to a new one 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.700
 don't mind holding on a little more 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.890
 a little more movement a little more 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:25.540
 movements instead of slightly less movements 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.080
 a little less movement a little less 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.110
 movements 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.790
 the web reflects the time easier for me 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.580
 hold your finger through the web of topics 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.930
 mean less time on there is 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.820
 if i have to grab once 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.380
 calcium and keep your way between 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.400
 once the scheme slides over each other 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.680
 surfaces 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.320
 so they overgrown over a long 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:49.660
 time came can really 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:57.570
 see the web time this was a speech about 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:57.570
 auten cheers good us speech turned out
