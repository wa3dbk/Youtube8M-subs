00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:12.890 
plus was this week when I tried to use
it

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
it

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.829 
it
there<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:13.469> no<00:00:13.650> dial<00:00:13.980> tone<00:00:14.299> now<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.360> reason

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there was no dial tone now the reason

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.269 
there was no dial tone now the reason
for<00:00:15.870> that<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.289> just<00:00:16.320> show<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.920> you<00:00:17.039> plug

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
for that I'm just show you if you plug

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.609 
for that I'm just show you if you plug
it<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.750> there's<00:00:18.750> no<00:00:18.990> light<00:00:19.230> anymore<00:00:20.070> okay

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
it in there's no light anymore okay

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.800 
it in there's no light anymore okay
basically<00:00:22.880> it<00:00:23.880> looked<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.750> dead<00:00:25.160> right

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
basically it looked like it's dead right

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.650 
basically it looked like it's dead right
just<00:00:27.810> show<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.880> so<00:00:29.880> as<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.029> plug<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.510> in

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
just show you here so as I plug it in

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.490 
just show you here so as I plug it in
and<00:00:30.960> here<00:00:31.140> here's<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:32.660> network<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.989> goes<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and here here's the network that goes to

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.080 
and here here's the network that goes to
my<00:00:35.329> router<00:00:36.329> modem<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.340> then<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.790> goes

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
my router modem and then this one goes

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.670 
my router modem and then this one goes
to<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.629> iPhone<00:00:42.620> wireless<00:00:43.620> phone<00:00:44.480> right<00:00:45.680> but

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to my iPhone wireless phone right but

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.440 
to my iPhone wireless phone right but
notice<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.489> no<00:00:47.610> light<00:00:47.820> normally<00:00:48.329> there

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
notice there's no light normally there

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.240 
notice there's no light normally there
will<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> green<00:00:49.230> light<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.890> yellow

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
will be a green light and a yellow

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
will be a green light and a yellow
flashing<00:00:50.640> light<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.539> something<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.440> happening

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
flashing light so something is happening

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850 
flashing light so something is happening
and<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.329> most<00:00:54.570> likely<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.770> do

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
and I think it's most likely has to do

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.310 
and I think it's most likely has to do
with<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> power<00:00:56.280> supply<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.780> reason<00:00:58.170> for

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
with the power supply and the reason for

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.209 
with the power supply and the reason for
that<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.219> take<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.550> out<00:00:59.640> for<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.969> okay<00:01:00.750> is

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
that and take it out for you okay is

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.969 
that and take it out for you okay is
this<00:01:02.219> part<00:01:02.579> here<00:01:03.049> okay<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> need<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> replace

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
this part here okay you need to replace

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.850 
this part here okay you need to replace
this<00:01:05.460> part<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.180> not<00:01:06.420> most<00:01:07.200> likely<00:01:07.290> not<00:01:07.619> this

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this part it's not most likely not this

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.710 
this part it's not most likely not this
part<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:10.140> power<00:01:10.500> adapter<00:01:11.600> which<00:01:12.600> you

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
part so this power adapter which you

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
part so this power adapter which you
have<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.020> careful<00:01:13.380> get<00:01:13.470> look<00:01:13.650> at<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
have to be careful get look at it it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.399 
have to be careful get look at it it
actually<00:01:14.850> needs<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:16.159> output<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.340> 5<00:01:17.700> volt<00:01:18.060> and

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
actually needs an output of 5 volt and

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.940 
actually needs an output of 5 volt and
one<00:01:19.409> amp<00:01:20.119> right<00:01:21.119> those<00:01:21.750> running<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> 5<00:01:22.590> watt

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
one amp right those running on a 5 watt

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.289 
one amp right those running on a 5 watt
hour<00:01:23.729> power<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> that's<00:01:26.460> what's<00:01:26.939> happening

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
hour power so that's what's happening

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
hour power so that's what's happening
this<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.979> working<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
this one is actually not working and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.030 
this one is actually not working and
I'll<00:01:29.820> show<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.229> okay<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> take

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
I'll show you okay so if I have to take

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.700 
I'll show you okay so if I have to take
that<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.600> I'm<00:01:33.600> using<00:01:33.900> another<00:01:34.439> adapter

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that out and I'm using another adapter

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.719 
that out and I'm using another adapter
it<00:01:35.400> doesn't<00:01:35.640> have<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> magic<00:01:36.509> jack<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.729> you

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it doesn't have to be magic jack and you

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.950 
it doesn't have to be magic jack and you
but<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.360> careful<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.780> have<00:01:39.900> to

but you have to be careful you have to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.690 
but you have to be careful you have to
look<00:01:40.079> at<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:42.500> output<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.159> output<00:01:44.189> should

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
look at the the output the output should

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.830 
look at the the output the output should
be<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> same<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.420> should<00:01:45.990> also<00:01:46.170> say<00:01:46.560> here<00:01:47.840> 5

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
be the same it should also say here 5

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.520 
be the same it should also say here 5
volt<00:01:49.229> 1<00:01:49.770> amp<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.759> perfect<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.960> that's<00:01:52.380> what

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
volt 1 amp that's perfect it that's what

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
volt 1 amp that's perfect it that's what
you<00:01:52.619> want<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> as<00:01:54.180> long<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.509> get<00:01:54.600> an

is a USP to a USB and you should be fine

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.790 
is a USP to a USB and you should be fine
I'll<00:02:09.450> show<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:09.750> right<00:02:09.929> now

okay so they like that now different

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.620 
okay so they like that now different
adapter<00:02:17.040> may<00:02:17.520> have<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.239> different

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
adapter may have a different

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.020
