 a good download we look for our self 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.030
 I have many so it will be difficult 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:28.030
 find him 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:38.959
 where are you from 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.020
 please here is you are 21.4 points 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.660
 others 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.730
 we open the green leader will open a 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.930
 wild card and how we see all this 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.990
 files there are 14 we do not go to the folder 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.880
 Maycas point yesterday and we give you control uve 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.440
 to go back and let's accept 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.410
 that is, we fished all the files of 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:01.690
 tourists we hit here simple and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:06.540
 we would have our very installed so 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.540
 I'm going to set the screen for him 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.450
 execute we execute normally as in 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.590
 the black screen and nothing that we go to a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.260
 player let's give a survival 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.010
 because this procedure adapts the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.540
 survival 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.540
 so we hope we hope 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:34.120
 and here we are I do not know why before that the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.549
 young people should read and have our 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.409
 opportunities if we are going to enlarge I'll 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.069
 adopt is the whole image so that it does not 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:43.720
 see cell and we go back to God 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.939
 hello here we are again and now 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.439
 we are amazing cell phone so now 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:50.960
 let's show the cheeks 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:52.730
 applications of the turn it is not here 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.410
 horribly wrong because I do not have 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.100
 installed 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.390
 with just the high mountains 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.330
 Well first I'll show you the 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.490
 first option and if there is a fall and you 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.800
 low a lot of life and you can take it out 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.480
 sometimes the heart and automatically 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.940
 over all life we press continues with 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.490
 the or we can get twitters and now for 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.380
 what's the use here we have all 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.900
 absolutely all the systems of the 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.480
 minecraft by not giving wildlife no if you 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.489
 We give to an order and to maintain and not 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.340
 is 64 diamond or these 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:27.490
 incredible as to play or you have 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.710
 everything well I can put it also can 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.210
 get whatever they want is useful for a 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.190
 survival if they do not know how to do the 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.620
 things and want to have automatically 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.450
 for example in hell positions 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.820
 we started a position was what is the 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.800
 weakness and we throw it away so I'm very 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.720
 useful also the most useful thing is that 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.789
 on a survival map you can put yourself 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.550
 in creative as well as they put them 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.860
 they can put creative we go to each where 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.870
 secrecy links automatically 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.009
 we are in creation or this is 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.870
 amazing amazing incredible too 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.230
 we can make it rain 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.400
 let's make it rain and now we get 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.910
 so we can do is put 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.600
 day to put at night a growing medium 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.920
 appear we can put your rival we can 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.820
 put on very adventure that we can not 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.670
 break nothing so let's kill this 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.220
 do not move with functionality 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.430
 well this tutorial action something else that 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.110
 Now the 1.4 moto2 was a great 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.340
 rebellion because they did update 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.590
 of the turn and rivers 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.140
 we start with the or we can take the turn 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.980
 and from pge here is a search engine here 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.750
 we can see what is in our 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:38.050
 good inventory searched we put by 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.050
 example 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.510
 that is how I have the Spanish market and 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.270
 I keep all things diamond 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.150
 we put wood 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:50.240
 wood foxx does not come out all the things of 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:56.220
 wood we put stones all things 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:59.570
 we say is to look for an anvil 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.040
 there is such a thing that this tutorial action 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.969
 I hope you liked this way that 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.279
