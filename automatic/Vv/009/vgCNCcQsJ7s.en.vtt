00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
so for instance our basic stance is

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.410 
so for instance our basic stance is
actually<00:02:17.740> the<00:02:17.890> center<00:02:18.130> axis<00:02:18.460> relock<00:02:18.940> like

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
actually the center axis relock like

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600 
actually the center axis relock like
this<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.320> gives<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.650> a<00:02:20.710> lot<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.950> advantages<00:02:21.280> to

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
this it gives you a lot of advantages to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.020 
this it gives you a lot of advantages to
be<00:02:21.820> able<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.060> fire<00:02:22.780> like<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:24.030> continue

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
be able to fire like this continue

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.740 
be able to fire like this continue
firing<00:02:25.390> fire<00:02:26.200> fire<00:02:26.710> fire<00:02:26.740> like<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.660> we

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
firing fire fire fire like that so we

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.660 
firing fire fire fire like that so we
have<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> very<00:02:29.140> fast<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.770> fluid<00:02:30.040> system<00:02:30.490> for

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
have a very fast and fluid system for

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.800 
have a very fast and fluid system for
being<00:02:30.880> able<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.090> move<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.480> different

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
couple of gadgets that he'll improvise

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.100 
couple of gadgets that he'll improvise
in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.710> gameplays<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.940> have<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.150> snake<00:02:46.840> cam

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
in the gameplays so we have a snake cam

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.350 
in the gameplays so we have a snake cam
mirror<00:02:47.950> that<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.340> use<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.760> he<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.030> actually<00:02:49.180> a
