00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.140
 Hello, another package from 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.210
 aliexpress this time was ordered 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.340
 keyboard case for 7 inch 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.769
 tablets 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.270
 that's how it looks packed was mean 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:23.880
 standard bag with pimples and plus 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.830
 still such a transparent bag as 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.910
 zip used here such a strap 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:35.120
 with a magnetic open inside we find 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:41.180
 capacitive screen stylus 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.690
 let's check the stylus works right away 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:55.829
 Excellent keyboard with English 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:58.070
 and in Russian letters and about t g stitches with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.020
 microusb plug 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.870
 if you order yourself necessarily 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.570
 specify which plug you need 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.840
 that is, see what your nest 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.000
 tablet and order accordingly 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.400
 what is it that then did not have to love 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.259
 any adapters 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:23.250
 so then the tablet itself is installed 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.840
 Here in this place there is such 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.900
 a piece on a spring that is calculated under 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.790
 slightly different width 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.460
 Any 7-inch tablet here should 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.500
 get in without problems but connects 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.600
 Naturally through such a cord 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:47.009
 I already said let me show you a little 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.680
 keyboard key travel is very nice 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.899
 such a normal keyboard is about 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.810
 laptops have all the necessary keys 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.530
 all signed that is to use 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.890
 should be conveniently made 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.799
 from such a soft leatherette but there apparently 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.530
 under this leatherette still some 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:15.209
 seals of myagenko ie 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.069
 it looks very good 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.060
 there is a stand 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:24.530
 on the skin on a magnet but with 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.510
 need can be done like this 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.290
 put the tablet and what shall we say 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:36.380
 print watch movies cartoons or 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:39.810
 reviews on youtube on this perhaps all 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.940
 if such cheholchik like can 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.050
 boldly order from us in stores 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.830
 sell somewhere from 500 rubles to 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.220
 China is worth 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.170
 of dollars but that's all if you liked 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.170
