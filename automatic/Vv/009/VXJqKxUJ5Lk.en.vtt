00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 work as much in strength when 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.909
 hypertrophy several only works 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.530

 want to cover quickly what is it 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.450
 ya with the subscription or the club of the most 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.850
 big which I was not just dealing with 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.990
 podium that is free with a goal when 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.210
 of fees per share but it's a 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 full subscription acquired that bread from the

 month a dvd from the May 5th collection 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.970
 exercise so these five years of exercise 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.070
 police looking for triceps pecs 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.280
 the isaf so do not have them where there are five 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.750
 years is a license c is free 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.270
 these deadlines are on sale on the site 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.190
 elsewhere 49 95 but we lose a 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.680
 escape as long as it subscribe 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.150
 ultimately all of the coach nor limited by

 answer questions already on 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.070
 mass bodybuilding like that in the

 trained who is answers questions too 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.510
 if it goes beyond the skills they will 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.340
 send us who are not sure about having 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.230
 a good answer to questions from 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.480
 bodybuilding is actively on the threshold and has 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.980
 su tax and the second video to all 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.080
 days this bodybuilding taken in the mask is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 reserved for members and finally you have 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.160
 access to the comments section in 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.989
 below the capsules that are have them 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.800
 so that's just the motivated world that 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.110
 asks the most urgent questions 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.060
 as we can see from time to time 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.800
 youtube facebook this kind of discussion 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.680
 girl or the advice that are there his 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.730
 jumps and then I 'm sure 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.350
 personally from all comments 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.360
 and I approve you and I ate them 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.739
 answer so the guy would say that a month 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.100
 before the comments and it's a beautiful 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.110
 challenge 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.600
 so that's included in the subscription 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.739
 free this word though since all in ten 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.000
 months only outside of this 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.140
 transaction and wishes to have a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.760
 information when a video 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.280
 I strongly encourage France was a 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.080
 of six and jan tech tea motivated by 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.880
 a loud push is in shape it's 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.100
 in my opinion it's one of the best 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.780
 options you can take to reach 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.180
 goals this year to take the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.650
 master class shaped side to bonn too 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.110
 hollow of the word that you the backhoe and 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.820
 then today nothing change the project 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.830
 will be done today to whom we will speak 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.630
 the best exercises to take the 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.130
 Charles said mass not as a one 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.900
 wants to condemn this week 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.460
 a boost the cartier port the year as 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.900
 we have to have it by a technique 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.190
 special which was group 7 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.320
 today we will talk about the masses 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.120
 exercise yet damascus listening and that's 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.250
 important when we want to take the mass 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.710
 to completely develop a 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.250
 small group to do more because he answered 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.780
 what's going on and that's more 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.760
 old basic building philosophy 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.960
 and then if we think about programs 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.670
 classics Bach of golden lions 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.700
 knew programs by burying 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.560
 46 by training with three four 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.959
 exercises by muscle groups and 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.940
 when they aim it at caen this board 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.880
 bodybuilders is going to attack 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.180
 muscle gogh muscle with 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.590
 different angles and it was with his 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.200
 different angles there we will go 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.700
 stimulate all the muscular fibers 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.920
 each of the ends of the moose all the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.750
 muscle portions and lectures and the 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.360
 complete monster to what a cultural 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:45.250
 it seeks to promote the muscle of a 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:46.810
 NATO tendon announced in full and 4 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.200
 combines exercises 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:53.680
 it's important to have exercises 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.840
 which applies force on tmz according to 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.100
 different angles and that's how 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.570
 you're going to fetch like a man 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.280
 different I give you what you 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.160
 see she's developed all the facts 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.080
 so I can give an example of in 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.600
 the application of force if I do a 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.520
 profitable exercise its cavale earth the 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.980
 force is applied towards the south 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.840
 it's the cultural gravity apart that 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:17.260
 I have food so my biceps work 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.390
 against gravity like this one I do 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.820
 the same exercise since his final at 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:25.450
 low pulleys ok I handshake 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.310
 support is there and there is a quarter of it 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.930
 the handle the pulley what is 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.790
 happens when I go down the pope when I 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.380
 give my music fredo days but 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.300
 when a force that is not poking towards 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.580
 the bolt stitched goes the pulley this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.130
 pulleys who knows the handle so the g2 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.800
 different angle of application of the 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:44.470
 force and that's going to change the way that 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.510
 the spare work muscle and the type of 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.250
 stimulation on muscle films 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.170
 but then it'll give me a better 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.160
 driving effect but as muse of 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.840
 grounding whether 2 free 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.460
 since it is true that amateur as for 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.310
 to do there waiting with a ball 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.440
 declared itself but in both cases 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.870
 it is gravity that sorts in ten years 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.410
 firm with an attacker with the support of 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.140
 boss 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.570
 but here the force was applied around 2am 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.880
 different is better to fall so 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:13.610
 that's an example of combinations 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.210
 of exercise that more effective than 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.070
 other 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.080
 to make the mass and then in the 5 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.460
 dvd of the five best exercises 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.170

 five exercises but it's not this time the 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:30.200
 mandate this five exercises that compliments

 to defend the brushed franc to the maximum 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.280
 each of the muscle groups which one 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.620
 share in these times biceps triceps 

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.150
 pectoral and paul abs is 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.190
 also the best exercise for 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.090
 activate the hitherto specific group 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.210
 you will see 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:46.010
 is it also in the background the 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.330
 exercise bonzes because the pictures of 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.430
 muscle groups that have multiple 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.200
 beams for the mu or who have 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.430
 several media the match gives a 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.650
 example for the shoulders
