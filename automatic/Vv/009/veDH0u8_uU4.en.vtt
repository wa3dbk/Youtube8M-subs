fighting and loads of snipers with
thermals<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.380> thought<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.680> would<00:00:28.830> be<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.010> good

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
thermals I thought it would be a good

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.179 
thermals I thought it would be a good
idea<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.789> equipped<00:00:30.660> cold-blooded<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:32.040> as

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
idea that equipped cold-blooded and as

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.000 
idea that equipped cold-blooded and as
you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> notice<00:00:32.669> him<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.450> immediately<00:00:34.110> held

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
you can notice him I immediately held

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.770 
you can notice him I immediately held
for<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> but<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.760> don't<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.149> through<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> center

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
for a but I don't go through the center

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.470 
for a but I don't go through the center
but<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> sort<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.980> stray<00:00:38.370> from<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.820> outside<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
but I sort of stray from the outside and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.959 
but I sort of stray from the outside and
I'm<00:00:39.600> constantly<00:00:40.010> watching<00:00:41.010> for<00:00:41.340> snipers<00:00:41.790> or

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
I'm constantly watching for snipers or

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.090 
I'm constantly watching for snipers or
people<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.510> trying<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.870> cross<00:00:43.110> yeah

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
people that are trying to cross yeah

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
people that are trying to cross yeah
cross<00:00:44.399> them<00:00:44.579> up<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> get<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:46.020> I'm<00:00:46.379> also

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
zigzagging across the open space and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.380 
zigzagging across the open space and
this<00:00:49.020> enables<00:00:49.469> me<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.760> make<00:00:50.760> sure<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> nobody

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
the left on the right to make sure that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
the left on the right to make sure that
no<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.620> sneaky<00:00:59.100> motherfuckers<00:00:59.699> try<00:01:00.000> and

no you know sneaky motherfuckers try and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.130 
no you know sneaky motherfuckers try and

the<00:01:04.229> guy<00:01:04.379> ray<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.869> instead<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> immediately

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
the guy ray and instead of immediately

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
the guy ray and instead of immediately
capturing<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.189> witch<00:01:08.850> lots<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.360> people<00:01:09.600> would

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
capturing a witch lots of people would

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.520 
capturing a witch lots of people would
do<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:11.030> decide<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.060> go<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:13.049> little<00:01:13.260> wall

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
do I decide to go to this little wall

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.550 
do I decide to go to this little wall
here<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:13.979> camp<00:01:14.850> out<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.360> bit<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.780> I

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
here and camp out a little bit and I

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.399 
here and camp out a little bit and I
figured<00:01:16.920> out<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.490> team<00:01:18.270> will<00:01:18.479> soon<00:01:18.869> capture<00:01:19.259> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
figured out my team will soon capture a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.609 
figured out my team will soon capture a
and<00:01:20.180> my<00:01:21.180> best<00:01:21.450> bet<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:21.840> trying<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.259> hold<00:01:22.439> off

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
and my best bet is trying to hold off

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
and my best bet is trying to hold off
the<00:01:22.799> enemy<00:01:22.830> team<00:01:23.310> because<00:01:24.210> if<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.450> had<00:01:24.570> have

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the enemy team because if I had have

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
the enemy team because if I had have
captured<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.740> whole<00:01:25.920> team<00:01:26.189> probably<00:01:26.520> would

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
captured a the whole team probably would

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
captured a the whole team probably would
have<00:01:26.700> stormed<00:01:27.119> me<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.750> backup<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.380> have

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
have stormed me I have no backup I have

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.920 
have stormed me I have no backup I have
no<00:01:28.740> idea<00:01:28.920> where<00:01:29.250> anybody<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.810> would

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
no idea where anybody is and it would

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.899 
no idea where anybody is and it would
just<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> waste<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.950> perfectly<00:01:32.130> good<00:01:32.549> kill

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
just be a waste of a perfectly good kill

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
just be a waste of a perfectly good kill
streak<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.590> even<00:01:34.590> though<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.829> are<00:01:34.979> losing<00:01:35.220> at

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
streak and even though we are losing at

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.060 
streak and even though we are losing at
the<00:01:35.490> moment<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.140> close<00:01:37.470> much<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the moment this was very close much I

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.160 
the moment this was very close much I
was<00:01:38.430> playing<00:01:38.729> against<00:01:39.060> some<00:01:39.720> pretty<00:01:39.900> good

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
was playing against some pretty good

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.030 
was playing against some pretty good
people<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.140> yeah<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.380> just<00:01:43.680> couldn't<00:01:43.860> afford

a<00:02:05.009> few<00:02:05.850> people<00:02:06.090> requested<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.810> gun<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
a few people requested this gun so

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.520 
a few people requested this gun so
that's<00:02:07.560> why<00:02:07.740> I'm<00:02:07.890> doing<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.810> I<00:02:09.810> would

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
that's why I'm doing it and I would

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.949 
that's why I'm doing it and I would
really<00:02:10.830> advise<00:02:11.160> using<00:02:11.970> stopping<00:02:12.540> power<00:02:12.690> with

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
really advise using stopping power with

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.460 
really advise using stopping power with
us

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
us

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.010 
us
I<00:02:13.560> find<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.580> without<00:02:15.360> stopping<00:02:15.840> power

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
I find that without stopping power

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.980 
I find that without stopping power
you'll<00:02:16.440> often<00:02:16.800> need<00:02:17.250> a<00:02:17.280> second<00:02:17.730> burst<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.210> I

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
you'll often need a second burst and I

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.620 
you'll often need a second burst and I
find<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.890> yeah<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.880> time<00:02:21.120> between<00:02:21.300> the

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
find this yeah the time between the

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.720 
find this yeah the time between the
first<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.080> second<00:02:22.440> burst<00:02:22.650> is<00:02:23.310> enough<00:02:23.610> to

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
first and the second burst is enough to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.550 
first and the second burst is enough to
get<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.910> killed<00:02:24.210> you<00:02:24.960> also<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.260> can't

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
get you killed you also you can't

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.440 
get you killed you also you can't
continuously<00:02:26.280> hit<00:02:26.550> somebody<00:02:26.940> with<00:02:26.970> bullets

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
continuously hit somebody with bullets

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.260 
continuously hit somebody with bullets
with<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> m16<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.370> hit<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:29.670> with<00:02:29.790> one<00:02:30.000> burst

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
with the m16 you hit them with one burst

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.330 
with the m16 you hit them with one burst
and<00:02:30.540> in<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.200> split<00:02:31.440> second<00:02:31.920> it's<00:02:32.070> enough<00:02:32.310> for

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
and in that split second it's enough for

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.730 
and in that split second it's enough for
their<00:02:32.730> aim<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.300> sort<00:02:33.840> of<00:02:33.900> get<00:02:34.050> back<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.350> normal

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
their aim the sort of get back to normal

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:35.570 
their aim the sort of get back to normal
and<00:02:34.770> to<00:02:34.920> be<00:02:34.950> able<00:02:35.100> to<00:02:35.220> take<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.550> out

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
and to be able to take you out

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
especially at long distances against

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.360 
especially at long distances against
snipers<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.000> stopping<00:02:39.540> power<00:02:40.010> also<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.040> like

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
snipers so stopping power also I like

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.760 
snipers so stopping power also I like
ninja<00:02:41.820> pro<00:02:42.030> because<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.750> don't<00:02:43.320> want<00:02:43.350> people<00:02:43.680> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and then yeah slowly instead of

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.230 
and then yeah slowly instead of
clenching<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.220> controller<00:03:02.640> really<00:03:02.970> tight

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
clenching the controller really tight

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.390 
clenching the controller really tight
have<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.690> loosely<00:03:03.900> in<00:03:04.110> your<00:03:04.260> hand<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.650> just

ever so gently squeeze the right trigger

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.240 
ever so gently squeeze the right trigger
don't<00:03:08.780> don't<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:10.050> with<00:03:10.590> once<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.950> start

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
don't don't like with once you start

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.370 
don't don't like with once you start
climbing<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.850> time<00:03:12.060> I'm<00:03:12.300> clenching<00:03:13.050> the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
climbing at time I'm clenching the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.260 
climbing at time I'm clenching the
controller<00:03:13.740> then<00:03:14.010> it'll<00:03:14.520> make<00:03:14.670> your<00:03:14.850> thumbs

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
controller then it'll make your thumbs

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.300 
controller then it'll make your thumbs
inaccurate<00:03:16.080> and<00:03:16.290> you<00:03:17.160> won't<00:03:17.310> aim<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.640> well<00:03:17.790> and

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
inaccurate and you won't aim as well and

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.650 
inaccurate and you won't aim as well and
yeah<00:03:20.310> I'm<00:03:20.459> just<00:03:20.670> sticking<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.300> outside<00:03:21.630> of

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
yeah I'm just sticking to the outside of

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.050 
yeah I'm just sticking to the outside of
the<00:03:21.840> map<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.260> know<00:03:22.440> I'm<00:03:22.830> pretty<00:03:23.550> close<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.940> my

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
the map I know I'm pretty close to my

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.750 
the map I know I'm pretty close to my
predator<00:03:24.420> missile<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.680> think<00:03:26.340> it's<00:03:26.610> still

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
predator missile I think it's still

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.080 
predator missile I think it's still
really<00:03:27.120> close<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.769> can't<00:03:28.769> really<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.220> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
really close I can't really see the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.520 
really close I can't really see the
program<00:03:30.480> i'm<00:03:30.570> using<00:03:30.600> doesn't<00:03:31.110> really<00:03:31.230> let<00:03:31.410> me

program i'm using doesn't really let me

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.449 
program i'm using doesn't really let me
see<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.769> but<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.250> it's<00:03:32.580> 73<00:03:33.239> 285<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:36.050> yeah

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
see it but I think it's 73 285 and yeah

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.880 
see it but I think it's 73 285 and yeah
I'm<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:39.150> trying<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> hold<00:03:39.720> back<00:03:39.840> and<00:03:40.230> pick

by sticking to the right side and yeah i
might<00:06:20.840> well<00:06:21.080> i<00:06:21.440> might<00:06:22.190> have<00:06:22.310> won<00:06:22.490> this<00:06:22.640> much<00:06:22.880> I

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
might well i might have won this much I

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.330 
might well i might have won this much I
could<00:06:23.990> have<00:06:24.110> done<00:06:24.230> slightly<00:06:24.530> more<00:06:24.920> that's

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
could have done slightly more that's
