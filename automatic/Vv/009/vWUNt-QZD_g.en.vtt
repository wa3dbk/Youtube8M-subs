00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.040 
cannot afford it
I'm<00:02:32.920> from<00:02:33.220> Africa<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.240> know<00:02:34.300> a<00:02:34.480> lot<00:02:35.020> of

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
I'm from Africa and I know a lot of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.100 
I'm from Africa and I know a lot of
Africans<00:02:35.770> here<00:02:36.220> who<00:02:36.610> if<00:02:37.030> it's<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.600> only<00:02:37.810> for

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
Africans here who if it's not only for

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.140 
Africans here who if it's not only for
extraction<00:02:38.770> they<00:02:38.950> don't<00:02:39.130> go<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.520> dentist
