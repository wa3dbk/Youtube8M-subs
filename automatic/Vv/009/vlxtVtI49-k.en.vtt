good defense by 80 Hz there look at

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:46.450 
good defense by 80 Hz there look at
those<00:04:45.350> tricks<00:04:45.680> he<00:04:45.800> always<00:04:45.979> does<00:04:46.250> that

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
those tricks he always does that

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.550 
those tricks he always does that
forward<00:04:46.940> B's<00:04:47.150> and<00:04:47.690> then<00:04:47.810> he's<00:04:47.930> jumps<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.380> makes

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
forward B's and then he's jumps it makes

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.529 
forward B's and then he's jumps it makes
banana<00:04:48.919> before<00:04:49.789> it<00:04:49.880> bead<00:04:50.030> because<00:04:50.210> he<00:04:50.449> was

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
banana before it bead because he was

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.060 
banana before it bead because he was
looking<00:04:50.720> it's<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.229> Noda<00:04:51.440> would<00:04:51.620> rush<00:04:51.800> forward

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
looking it's the Noda would rush forward

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.620 
looking it's the Noda would rush forward
block<00:04:52.460> and<00:04:52.699> he<00:04:52.760> wanted<00:04:53.030> the<00:04:53.150> aerial<00:04:53.479> command

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
block and he wanted the aerial command

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.750 
block and he wanted the aerial command
grab<00:04:53.990> because<00:04:54.199> he<00:04:54.650> couldn't<00:04:54.949> get<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.160> crab<00:04:55.430> over

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
grab because he couldn't get a crab over

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.550 
grab because he couldn't get a crab over
the<00:04:55.849> bananas<00:04:55.970> so<00:04:56.690> he<00:04:56.780> wanted<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:56.990> for<00:04:57.199> be<00:04:57.349> say

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
the bananas so he wanted to for be say

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.779 
the bananas so he wanted to for be say
all<00:04:57.770> right<00:04:57.860> let<00:04:58.010> me<00:04:58.039> see<00:04:58.160> Mikey<00:04:58.370> if<00:04:58.490> this<00:04:58.610> grab

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
all right let me see Mikey if this grab

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.310 
all right let me see Mikey if this grab
on<00:04:58.970> you<00:04:59.150> of<00:04:59.449> course<00:04:59.690> denote<00:04:59.960> oh<00:04:59.990> did<00:05:00.199> not

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
on you of course denote oh did not

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.680 
on you of course denote oh did not
approach<00:05:00.650> so<00:05:01.220> the<00:05:01.580> board<00:05:01.970> feet<00:05:02.180> did<00:05:02.509> not

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
approach so the board feet did not

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.420 
approach so the board feet did not
confer<00:05:02.990> you'll<00:05:03.289> grab<00:05:03.470> and<00:05:03.710> therefore<00:05:04.070> he<00:05:04.340> was

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:04.430 
confer you'll grab and therefore he was

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.499 
confer you'll grab and therefore he was
forced<00:05:04.639> to<00:05:04.699> jump<00:05:04.940> away<00:05:05.000> he<00:05:05.180> didn't<00:05:05.330> want<00:05:05.449> to

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
forced to jump away he didn't want to

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:06.790 
forced to jump away he didn't want to
aerial<00:05:05.810> instance<00:05:06.139> a<00:05:06.229> notice<00:05:06.470> yield<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.710> would

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
aerial instance a notice yield it would

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.159 
aerial instance a notice yield it would
have<00:05:06.889> been<00:05:06.979> very<00:05:07.130> costly<00:05:07.570> ADHD<00:05:08.570> never<00:05:08.810> stopped

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
have been very costly ADHD never stopped

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.260 
have been very costly ADHD never stopped
him<00:05:09.289> tacking<00:05:09.830> he<00:05:10.340> does<00:05:10.550> these<00:05:10.699> aerials<00:05:11.150> and

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
him tacking he does these aerials and

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.390 
him tacking he does these aerials and
it's<00:05:11.419> so<00:05:11.539> hard<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.780> punish<00:05:11.990> amnesia<00:05:12.380> block<00:05:13.190> it

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
it's so hard to punish amnesia block it

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.210 
it's so hard to punish amnesia block it
and<00:05:13.490> don't<00:05:13.639> do<00:05:13.760> anything<00:05:14.000> or<00:05:14.449> you<00:05:14.599> get<00:05:14.750> hit

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
and don't do anything or you get hit

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.159 
and don't do anything or you get hit
nice<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.669> watch<00:05:17.300> it<00:05:19.539> he'll<00:05:20.539> does<00:05:20.690> not<00:05:20.840> manage

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
nice and watch it he'll does not manage

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.290 
nice and watch it he'll does not manage
so<00:05:21.349> down<00:05:21.560> smashes<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.400> HD<00:05:22.550> has<00:05:22.909> a<00:05:23.030> lot<00:05:23.210> of

so down smashes it HD has a lot of

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.860 
so down smashes it HD has a lot of
momentum<00:05:23.479> here

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:23.870 
momentum here

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.360 
momentum here
oh<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.169> trip<00:05:24.409> could<00:05:24.590> cost<00:05:24.830> it<00:05:25.039> some<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.310> the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
oh the trip could cost it some of the

oh the trip could cost it some of the
momentum

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220

I<00:05:27.250> do<00:05:27.940> it's<00:05:28.180> coming<00:05:28.480> very<00:05:28.750> greedy<00:05:29.170> s<00:05:29.380> smash

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
I do it's coming very greedy s smash

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.990 
I do it's coming very greedy s smash

nice<00:05:45.220> he<00:05:45.610> tried<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:45.910> go<00:05:46.000> for<00:05:46.150> the<00:05:46.240> infinite<00:05:46.450> I

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
nice he tried to go for the infinite I

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.120 
nice he tried to go for the infinite I
hit<00:05:46.870> anything<00:05:47.080> today<00:05:47.440> he<00:05:47.650> just<00:05:47.800> needed<00:05:47.980> the

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
hit anything today he just needed the

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.930 
hit anything today he just needed the
overhead<00:05:48.460> yeah<00:05:48.670> pretty<00:05:48.880> much<00:05:50.580> good<00:05:51.580> ways<00:05:51.760> of

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
overhead yeah pretty much good ways of

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.400 
overhead yeah pretty much good ways of
not<00:05:52.150> using<00:05:52.360> infinite<00:05:52.870> when<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.080> cabbie<00:05:53.290> a
