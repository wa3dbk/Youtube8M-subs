00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.010
 hello dear 1000 ps fans i am here in 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.510
 wales even if you might not 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.910
 necessarily aim it could be our beautiful 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 Styria are not but it is wales 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.179
 and even if the sun is shining now 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 and makes us sweat again 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.050
 Of course it rained as well 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.570
 we could expect it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.250
 I am invited by continental here 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.699
 been continental mature one 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.949
 emerging brand is getting bigger 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.080
 Continental also with the tires 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.520
 have a huge offer and me 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 I have been invited here by one 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.340
 mature new enduro test it is the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.190
 tkc 70-80 sounds like probably all 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 a well-known indoor mature that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.440
 70s is now also an enduro mature ago 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.270
 all because of his good profile so 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.160
 really nice tunnel you can see that it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 but it is also true 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.550
 the street very much so they have one 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.620
 very good mix 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.780
 I personally was very happy with it 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 the mature just in the wet and before 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 especially at high speeds this 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.879
 extremely stable 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.250
 but I have the market next to me 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.340
 is the product manager at continental 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.369
 and the brand can be my main reason 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 tell more about the mature because of the 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.460
 at the moment actually all the tires are hanging like 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.560
 develop or you have come there if 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.509
 others the fourth test is everything 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
 market is also racing driver maria 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.200
 cella blood so the development 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 can not find it right out of mine right now 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.790
 hand instead of that happens directly 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.250
 that's the load book from me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.229
 I screen the market and look what the 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.200
 market wishes which tires which 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.750
 mature we could settle and write 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.009
 then the notebook and yes the result 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.720
 that drove to this day is ours 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.140
 new trailer on road tires 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:46.409
 our ticker to 70 we have the ticker 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.329
 70 between our two active one of the very 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.310
 Road is annoying and our ticker too 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.740
 80 placed offroad properties and 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.260
 I would make it 60 40 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 define 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.410
 where we have very great value 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.890
 placed on that the handiness 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.540
 and the performance is preserved in 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.010
 pretty close to the third day 2 remains 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.520
 because most customers around this 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.440
 machines here in the curvy filled 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.420
 move the want to stop the want this 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.740
 have performance and you want the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 possibility also have from time to time 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.880
 to go off-road and also offers her 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.840
 the mature on it you could yes 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 Today also convince on gravel 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.360
 forest paths we were very fast on the way 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.320
 and so the complication 70 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510
 percent covered 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.860
 So yes, I already anticipated it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.810
 I personally take that very much 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.490
 I was not satisfied with that though 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.930
 road still the largest in the terrain 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.430
 craig but of course we have too 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.940
 We talked to the others as well 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.470
 a german cup either 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:52.709
 state master wm enduro wm is not 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.140
 more active but it is a former one 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.300
 enduro wm rider the tire now in 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.130
 terrain a bit so also to his 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.860
 has driven border and also its much 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.940
 gone was good so he says this at the 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.550
 So normal ratios with 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.450
 Back pressure 25 bar and front of 22 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.580
 was very predictable excellent 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.600
 properties just on the gravel always 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 very very accurate 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.709
 you could optimize it a bit 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.480
 if you would minimize the air pressure 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.110
 So then he stopped packing more traction 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.250
 Offer 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.480
 but that's really been 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.310
 hardcore terrain and there I would 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.959
 recommend to our customers 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.720
 ticker to 80 so go to one 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:31.830
 roughly control tires primarily the ticker 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.940
 c70 just designed for such a large size 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.950
 the bmw gs her the adventure model ktm 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.900
 adventure and the other big ones 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.940
 we just drove and there 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.489
 Above all, the mature is also suitable 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.110
 because as we have already mentioned 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.120
 We were extremely fast on the way 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.150
 have to thank the guides for the guides 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.459
 because he explained us in 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.440
 really take care of the places 30 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.989
 To comply with miles only after the economy 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.570
 The gas was not normal 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.030
 as 120 miles a day, or even is 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:05.489
 We are not so fast but are over 200 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.170
 gramm or just under 200 and there is 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.060
 I noticed extremely stable 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.819
 what did you do that well? 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.629
 is working 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.459
 he has the genes of trade act 2 us 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.829
 have long been killed at the profile design 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.130
 because we are dealing with a mature one 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.780
 with m and s identifier so we with the 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.130
 speed specification in 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.789
 to bring radial proof into shape 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.199
 High speed stability is the 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.759
 biggest challenge especially with these 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.349
 great enduros the customer demands though 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:34.449
 he on the highway also goes with it 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.419
 Luggage system long stretch at high 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.479
 speed quietly and 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:43.930
 that's very good for the c70 theme 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:46.990
 succeeded so far especially trick so far 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.180
 that the tread in the middle no 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.530
 Profit breakthrough, so to speak, has us 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.660
 have used a medium course there so 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.750
 it once comfortable because in the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.520
 then mature wins and wins 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.169
 clearly, the mileage is also the 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.599
 Customers moving these vehicles 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.220
 the want does not mean the mature now 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.410
 change as fast as you want to her 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.300
 you want to arrive in the 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.099
 vacation spot very much have fun 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.139
 demanding a lot of performance from the tires 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:15.479
 and of course want to be the same 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.479
 Ripen back home and arrive 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:23.419
 careless possible it was just here in 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.120
 england careless possible it only has two 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.919
 given small blemishes because easy 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.910
 this left drive here and there 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.590
 would forget 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.729
 but where do I need it ? 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.949
 not in it there is no one has 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.240
 injured 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:36.620
 but why I like the market so much 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.550
 also do the interviews because of 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.169
 has a clue and my predecessor what 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:44.599
 Another continental one comes from him 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.000
 is super equipped with the tires 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:50.630
 road tires also something very 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.520
 sporty comes there so what we must 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:55.220
 Let's be surprised 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.259
 the upcoming intermot now in two 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.590
 months we will be one more 

00:05:57.259 --> 00:06:01.580
 introduce new product and I have to 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.169
 is because, unfortunately, have to torture 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:09.590
 Tighten something like that 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:10.639
 you may be surprised and yes we 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.860
 See you at the latest to intermot 

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:14.030
 where we clearly mature this yet 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.430
 to introduce the generality 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.000
 not just the press and also 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.240
 our portfolio once around a segment 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.930
 expand 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:28.099
 so yes dkc 70s really successful 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:31.460
 conti mature as said extension of the 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:32.780
 segment of the range we wish 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.300
 Continental continues to be peaceful and 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.889
 take it you can have the year if 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.139
 for that the product management 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.479
 is responsible anke painted and much more 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.870
 then this fun book with sunshine 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.870
 again
