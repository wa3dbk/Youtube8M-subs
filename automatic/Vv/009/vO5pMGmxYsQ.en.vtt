00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 glycerin droplets in the glycerin the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.519
 you can find in pharmacies is very 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 cheap this cost me about three euros and 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.570
 serves to better penetrate the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.110
 assets of the preparations and I will throw 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.000

 well as I say I will do little 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.180
 amount because as I'm going to apply 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.380
 in the chest because I do not want to do 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.550
 a lot of 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.700
 depending on the amount you want 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.530
 If you want to use it more often 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.020

 less so a little more 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:28.719

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:31.380
 of almonds now I will put a little trickle 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:31.380
 of glycerin 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.740
 so that I can penetrate better 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.060
 is the divine is completely 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.850
 transparent 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.530

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.080
