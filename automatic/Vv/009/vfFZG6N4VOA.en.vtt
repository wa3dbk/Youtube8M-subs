00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.489
 the situation 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:38.820
 car gai pulls up to the place where we 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.780
 like in any city currency makers hang out 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.010
 and exchange currency 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.699

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 the car 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:51.620
 currency inspectors they spend about 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.620
 2 minutes 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.170

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:23.759
 By the way, this situation is observed in the country 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.910
