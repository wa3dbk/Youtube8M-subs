 there and 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.070
 the game was very important for both compositions 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.509
 the first card will give you something to pass 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.430
 grill board but after a few 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.200
 rounds everything began to change dramatically 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.040
 team players Detroit and steel 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.500
 play pretty good rounds 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
 led to victory and the first half 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.120
 ended with a minimal victory 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.990
 team grille 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.670
 after the change of dominance over

 Petridi team continued the match there 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.630

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 detroit second completion card 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.000
 half was less active and guys 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.810
 constantly let the initiative in their 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.870
 hands as for the composition of the lattice table 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.790
 the players performed very good diction 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.000
 Kindr Aldy 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.820
 like for the first time since the second half 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.220
 final teamwork to them all 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.350
 still not enough 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 final score card 15 15 and the team grid 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.259
 allows you to improve the game position 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.080
 their composition remaining matches before 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.700
 First League Avt. Key Match 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.530
 the sixth round in this division was the game 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.270
 teams of their heads it be 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.610
 both ended up claiming 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.250
 second position their groups game 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.690
 really worth the candle 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.550
 there are cards held in a very stressful 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 the tempo the team spilled was on the verge so 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.580
 say by handing over the card both first and 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.320
 second 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.240
 the lineup so constantly tried to transport 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.080
 its weight but you players just 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.080
 turned away luck so on the first and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.020
 the second picture of the vacuum cleaner calous 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.750
 minimum score of 16 14 and the composition was established 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.180

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.340
 great roster will be interesting too 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.080
 the rest of the matches and the general situation 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080
 teams in front of you 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.659
 The project’s official website was attached to e.p. 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.799
 g.mymyrya 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.269
 in the first league division b 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.409
 Geneva and Bern Kim played out important for 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.419
 yourself glasses team geneva had a chance for 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:48.540
 In order to gain a foothold on the ground 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.040
 place away from 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.329
 closest pursuer in the face 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:52.419
 Kudlai 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.479
 but the composition of their paintings should have been this 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.399
 prevent new but this guy to me 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:58.199
 managed to do whatever they tried to play them 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.819
 do something anyway guy 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.819
 were able to win a single victory card 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.239
 Geneva was exactly 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.089
 ten rounds and on the second score was 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:07.409
 minimum 16 14 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:08.969
 so the winner could 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.010
 come off three points second place a 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.790
 the losers in this match are fixed on 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.899
 third place 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:15.989
 players need to do more 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.029
 emphasis on games so as not to descend below in 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:19.919
 standings but rather improve 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 buy your own situation 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.639
 the second league of the division is the most gangsters 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.519
 became participants in a key match in this 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.349
 division team fm at a fast pace

 earn points to improve your 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.249
 playing position and gradually 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:49.589
 approaching the saints of their division 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.729
 composition and thug sale another option 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.019
 earning points for the franc team 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.469
 Here is the game itself showed that this 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.479
 guys need to play more and never 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.479
 discount rival defended 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:01.589
 draw 3 3 this match ended like this 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.929
 first round of hospital robber 20 10 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:05.909
 the author of the guy zakamsk could win with 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:08.449
 minimum score of 17 13 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:10.509
 for the composition and the bandit spectrum should be 

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.179
 pattern of opportunity 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:13.799
 players should be as clear as possible 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.519
 hold your matches the rest when 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.519
 transfusion general position teams 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 with 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.419
 second league division b squad failed 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.159
 play your matches or technical 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.740
 problems were solved by the composition or 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.469
 the team just brought their 13 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:45.590
 another day 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.550
 so the standings have 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.550
 exchanged 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.090
 second division b team questionnaire and not 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.650
 played the second third line 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.750
 standings in principle the level of these 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.719
 compositions are the same and mother accomplished 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:07.699
 quite logical draw 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.669
 on Thursday, map 18 12 in favor of Spartacus, but 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:11.969
 the second went completely under 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.870
 dictation no abolition yet modest 24 6 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.909
 it means that the end is made 

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.800
 corrected their actions at all 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.529
 maps 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.459
 and some require more stubborn 

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.449
 preparing a separation from each other of these 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.919
 teams is exactly two points 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.779
 so much can change and here 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.519
 somehow we'll see already in 

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:30.609
 the seventh round but for now we are looking at the results 

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:31.979
 the rest of the matches detailed information 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.979
 by the number of points 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.899
 the last division where included 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.999
 teams speed kirensky he only 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:59.960
 one who had an interesting match 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.729
 both form close to 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.490
 leaders of their group and this game could 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.360
 allow better results in general 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.150
 standings 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.080
 but as in the previous match the team play 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.710
 could only end in a draw 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:10.369
 the result 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.259
 In principle, this is quite justified since 

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:14.209
 team 44 could not beat her 

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:16.299
 rival our first pictures only in 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:17.519
 the second batch got this 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:18.349
 opportunity 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:21.500
 before that, at least 16 14 beat 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:23.520
 enters kirensk here and so ended 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.000
 game between these lineups 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.810
 the results of this match will soon experience and 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.100
 occupies the third line of the tournament 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.430
 tables and then fourth 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.479
 the results of the rest 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.069
 leading position of the teams on your 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.529
 passed another round and remains the last 

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.259
 to sum up the first half 

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:39.889
 second season championship about 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.469
