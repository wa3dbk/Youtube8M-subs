00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
pretty remarkable so we're going to

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.440 
pretty remarkable so we're going to
continue<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.380> simmer<00:04:22.560> this<00:04:22.800> down<00:04:23.039> and<00:04:23.550> then<00:04:24.330> we

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
continue to simmer this down and then we

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.820 
continue to simmer this down and then we
want<00:04:24.660> our<00:04:24.840> honey<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.260> we'll<00:04:25.380> put<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.650> in<00:04:25.740> our

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
want our honey and we'll put it in our

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.770 
want our honey and we'll put it in our
jar<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.370> this<00:04:26.880> will<00:04:27.030> keep<00:04:27.210> two<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.570> three

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
jar and this will keep two to three

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
jar and this will keep two to three
months<00:04:28.169> in<00:04:28.349> a<00:04:28.919> sealed<00:04:29.160> jar<00:04:29.460> in<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
months in a sealed jar in the

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.180 
months in a sealed jar in the
refrigerator<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.900> I'm<00:04:31.680> just<00:04:31.830> gonna<00:04:31.919> make<00:04:32.130> a

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
so I've got a little jar here Lauren I

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.370 
so I've got a little jar here Lauren I
still<00:05:41.430> got<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:41.640> on<00:05:41.730> camera<00:05:41.760> hold<00:05:42.300> on<00:05:42.420> let<00:05:43.290> me

still got you on camera hold on let me

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.620 
still got you on camera hold on let me
readjust<00:05:43.620> I<00:05:44.220> said<00:05:44.550> this<00:05:44.700> is<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:45.030> hot<00:05:45.180> water<00:05:45.360> and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
readjust I said this is a hot water and

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.910 
readjust I said this is a hot water and
it's<00:05:45.750> so<00:05:45.870> it's<00:05:46.020> not<00:05:46.110> gonna<00:05:46.290> be<00:05:46.470> thermal

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
it's so it's not gonna be thermal

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.040 
it's so it's not gonna be thermal
shocked<00:05:49.790> how<00:05:50.790> much<00:05:51.120> I'll<00:05:51.390> actually<00:05:51.570> end<00:05:51.930> up

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
shocked how much I'll actually end up

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:59.400 
shocked how much I'll actually end up
with

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.540 

they'll<00:06:00.410> probably<00:06:00.590> end<00:06:00.770> up<00:06:00.860> with<00:06:00.980> better<00:06:01.190> jar

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
they'll probably end up with better jar

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:14.390 
they'll probably end up with better jar
and<00:06:01.700> I<00:06:02.180> guess

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.129 

I'm<00:06:14.940> going<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.270> take<00:06:15.389> a<00:06:15.419> spoonful<00:06:15.900> of<00:06:15.960> this
