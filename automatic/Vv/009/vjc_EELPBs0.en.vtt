 children are the highest of what followed 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.630
 expect 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.620
 besides this display has small

 for home watching movies as well 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.620

 text and draw the hardware stuffing 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.819
 here is the average which includes itself 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.920
 enough production 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.579

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.129
 graphics 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.530
 Of course for modern games of these 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:27.560
 indicators will not be enough but for 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.700
 office work enough margin 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.319
 additional bonus can be considered 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.909
 pre-installed operating system 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.419
 windows 81 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.010
 the laptop is pretty pretty low 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:39.209
 power consumption angles manufacturer not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.760
 began to bother about 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.730
 high capacity battery like 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.469

 gamers need to find something on 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.879
 more powerful
