a<00:00:48.020> combination<00:00:48.500> of<00:00:49.900> athleticism<00:00:50.900> and

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
a combination of athleticism and

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.750 
a combination of athleticism and
sensuality

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.400

Jennifer<00:01:00.040> Lopez's<00:01:00.520> first<00:01:00.730> video<00:01:01.149> if<00:01:01.510> you<00:01:01.930> had

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
Jennifer Lopez's first video if you had

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.900 
Jennifer Lopez's first video if you had
my<00:01:02.200> love<00:01:02.230> where<00:01:03.040> we<00:01:03.130> did<00:01:03.280> three<00:01:03.489> completely

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
my love where we did three completely

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.210 
my love where we did three completely
different<00:01:04.000> sections<00:01:04.629> one<00:01:04.780> was<00:01:04.960> house<00:01:05.290> was

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
different sections one was house was

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.380 
different sections one was house was
hip-hop<00:01:06.550> and<00:01:06.760> one<00:01:06.909> was<00:01:07.060> lat

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.800 

so<00:01:11.390> it<00:01:11.780> kind<00:01:12.050> of<00:01:12.170> encompasses<00:01:12.530> everything<00:01:13.810> for

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
so it kind of encompasses everything for

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.030 
so it kind of encompasses everything for
the<00:01:14.870> average<00:01:15.020> person<00:01:15.350> what<00:01:15.680> would<00:01:15.800> you<00:01:15.890> define

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
the average person what would you define

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.010 
the average person what would you define
a<00:01:16.250> choreographer<00:01:16.940> as<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.450> me<00:01:17.600> there's<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.870> lot

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
a choreographer as to me there's a lot

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.570 
a choreographer as to me there's a lot
that<00:01:18.230> goes<00:01:18.260> into<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:18.860> not<00:01:19.040> just<00:01:19.100> making

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
that goes into it it's not just making

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.460 
that goes into it it's not just making
up<00:01:19.820> steps<00:01:20.120> which<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.420> think<00:01:20.600> technically<00:01:21.200> in<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
up steps which I think technically in a

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.260 
up steps which I think technically in a
dictionary<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.190> might<00:01:22.460> find<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:22.880> it's<00:01:23.120> the

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
dictionary you might find that it's the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.600 
dictionary you might find that it's the
person<00:01:23.930> creates<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:24.530> steps<00:01:24.800> but<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.220> also

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
person creates the steps but you also

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.030 
person creates the steps but you also
need<00:01:26.390> to<00:01:26.420> create<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.020> whole<00:01:27.170> vision<00:01:27.470> what's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
need to create the whole vision what's

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.560 
need to create the whole vision what's
really<00:01:28.280> challenging<00:01:28.730> is<00:01:28.850> it's<00:01:29.090> not<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:29.300> same

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
really challenging is it's not the same

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.880 
really challenging is it's not the same
for<00:01:29.750> everybody<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.230> have<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.620> take<00:01:30.770> the
