00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.710 
the seats mine measured about 18 inches
long<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.280> measured<00:01:11.729> out<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.970> 18<00:01:12.270> inch<00:01:12.450> long

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
long so I measured out an 18 inch long

burrs off the end that you just cut now
we<00:01:23.549> need<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.880> take<00:01:24.030> our<00:01:24.180> newly<00:01:24.509> cut<00:01:24.720> mount<00:01:25.020> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
we need to take our newly cut mount and

hold it up to our headrest supports and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.080 
hold it up to our headrest supports and
using<00:01:28.290> our<00:01:28.409> eye<00:01:28.590> bolts<00:01:28.979> make<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> mark<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.909> where

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
using our eye bolts make a mark of where

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
using our eye bolts make a mark of where
the<00:01:30.210> eye<00:01:30.240> bolts<00:01:30.630> will<00:01:30.780> go<00:01:30.930> around<00:01:31.320> the

the eye bolts will go around the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.679 
the eye bolts will go around the
headrest<00:01:31.979> supports<00:01:32.400> after<00:01:32.909> making<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.420> mark

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
headrest supports after making one mark

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.270 
headrest supports after making one mark
you<00:01:33.840> can<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> bench<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.890> making<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you can put it on the bench for making a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.609 
you can put it on the bench for making a
more<00:01:35.520> exact<00:01:36.060> location<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> second<00:01:37.470> hole

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
more exact location of the second hole

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
more exact location of the second hole
then<00:01:38.009> find<00:01:38.310> yourself<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.700> drill<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.150> that's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
then find yourself a drill bit that's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.719 
then find yourself a drill bit that's
bigger<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> eye<00:01:40.229> bolts<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> drill<00:01:41.579> out

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
bigger than the eye bolts and drill out

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
bigger than the eye bolts and drill out
the<00:01:41.850> holes<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.390> both<00:01:42.630> locations<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the holes in both locations now it's

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620 
the holes in both locations now it's
time<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.220> get<00:01:44.310> our<00:01:44.460> swivel<00:01:44.880> mount<00:01:45.000> ready<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
time to get our swivel mount ready and

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.359 
time to get our swivel mount ready and
we'll<00:01:45.840> do<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.200> by<00:01:46.470> taking<00:01:46.920> apart<00:01:47.009> our

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
we'll do that by taking apart our
