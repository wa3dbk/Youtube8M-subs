00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.109 
there I have a fire tight in here just

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:22.289 
there I have a fire tight in here just
because<00:01:20.259> i<00:01:20.469> suck<00:01:20.770> my<00:01:21.280> summoning<00:01:21.639> as<00:01:21.789> bad<00:01:22.030> and

because i suck my summoning as bad and

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.389 
because i suck my summoning as bad and
low<00:01:22.479> and<00:01:22.780> that's<00:01:23.350> about<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.799> best<00:01:23.979> thing<00:01:24.249> that

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
low and that's about the best thing that

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.719 
low and that's about the best thing that
I<00:01:24.429> can<00:01:24.549> use<00:01:24.759> really<00:01:25.889> probably<00:01:26.889> a<00:01:27.039> budget<00:01:27.520> might

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
I can use really probably a budget might

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.520 
I can use really probably a budget might
be<00:01:27.880> better<00:01:28.119> it's<00:01:28.420> just<00:01:28.719> I'm<00:01:28.840> using<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.380> for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
be better it's just I'm using it for

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.169 
be better it's just I'm using it for
healing<00:01:29.679> purposes<00:01:29.799> and<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.759> guess<00:01:30.909> I<00:01:30.999> could<00:01:31.149> use

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
healing purposes and I guess I could use

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.480 
healing purposes and I guess I could use
my<00:01:31.450> fire<00:01:31.689> Titan<00:01:32.200> to<00:01:32.319> fight<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.679> little<00:01:33.069> bit<00:01:33.249> but

really<00:02:19.120> bad<00:02:19.269> because

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
really bad because

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720 
really bad because
I<00:02:20.450> went<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.960> just<00:02:21.230> killed<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.340> cuz

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.910 
I went and I just killed it and then cuz
I<00:02:22.760> thought<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.270> might<00:02:23.300> get<00:02:23.930> maybe<00:02:24.290> i<00:02:24.440> might<00:02:24.740> get

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
I thought I might get maybe i might get

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.309 
I thought I might get maybe i might get
the<00:02:25.130> count<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.610> the<00:02:25.700> Slayer<00:02:25.940> but<00:02:26.690> i<00:02:26.720> didn't<00:02:27.170> i

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
the count for the Slayer but i didn't i

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.260 
the count for the Slayer but i didn't i
didn't<00:02:27.740> get<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> count<00:02:28.220> for<00:02:28.459> this<00:02:28.550> layer<00:02:28.819> so

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
didn't get the count for this layer so

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.559

wasting their twelve dollars on that

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.249 
wasting their twelve dollars on that
because<00:05:24.710> I<00:05:24.740> did<00:05:25.219> not<00:05:25.250> think<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.819> was<00:05:26.180> good<00:05:26.930> i

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:27.259 
because I did not think it was good i

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.950

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300
