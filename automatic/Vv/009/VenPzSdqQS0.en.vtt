00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.420
 then in day boys and girls of jethro I 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.610
 I am a 'fan' and today we are going to see 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.100
 this one that is called viver viver like ya 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.559
 you know it's an application for what they are 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.880
 various platforms like it is android 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.730
 ios and now recently for mac and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.340
 windows this means that you do not 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.830
 you can go synchronize the messages that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.380
 they will reach your computer when 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.830
 do not have aside the cell phone can 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.590
 receive your calls and messages this 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.300
 yes without necessarily having to go something 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 which is the cell phone for it we 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.309
 we have to go to the ebb page and see 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.350
 and download for what would be 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.720
 our our platform in this case 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.880
 windows 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.880
 let's give here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.390
 let's click here where it says 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.390
 get to live 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.290
 for windows and we wait for us 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.340
 download a program that the truth does not 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 it weighs almost nothing 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.810
 and once we have downloaded it 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.259
 let's execute it as 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.259
 an administrator 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.000
 and we install it like any other 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.000
 Program 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.050
 well here we are in the installer of 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.760
 program and we will accept and install and 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.120
 good here is going to download other others 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.120
 records 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 and is finishing installing 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.000
 I no longer know creditor 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.159
 and maybe he has opened what was coming 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.869
 being the program 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.510
 and good that he told us that if we have 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.430
 a life number 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.730
 because if we were going to enter our 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.730
 phone 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 and good as you can see here already 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.020
 a label has arrived giving us 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.020
 our code 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.359
 as you may notice here makes us 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.269
 a list of what our 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:36.950
 contacts we can if we 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.170
 we press in a contact denies the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.689
 call option or from a 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.519
 video call that maybe it 's in beta I know 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:46.730
 that there may be some problems with 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:50.080
 with that we are going to send a message to 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.190
 see if he answers 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.650
 I want to command you sleep 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.650
 and well we hope you do not answer it 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.320
 and good we see that we have received 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.300
 answers if we go to what 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.630
 that would be our application of 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.630
 bieber 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.000
 we see here show the messages that 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.000
 we have been seeing 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.680
 and in this way is how they live offers us 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.540
 a new alternative for what comes 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.319
 being our communication with our 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.760
 friends and starting a new one a new 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.890
 way to communicate as the 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.950
 video call 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.470
 and in this way be competent at 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.150
 that would be the skype and a friend 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.270
 this would be all about this 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 video I hope you liked it and nothing 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.590
