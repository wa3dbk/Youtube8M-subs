00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.690 
3.6 liter these are now a 3.8 liter
which<00:02:26.340> is<00:02:26.579> put<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.909> our<00:02:27.140> 450<00:02:28.140> horsepower<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.920> I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
which is put in our 450 horsepower and I

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.610 
which is put in our 450 horsepower and I
will<00:02:29.819> see<00:02:29.970> there's<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.659> lot<00:02:30.840> more<00:02:30.870> talk<00:02:31.319> with

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
will see there's a lot more talk with

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.069 
will see there's a lot more talk with
that<00:02:31.829> bigger<00:02:32.340> displacement<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.780> engine

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
that bigger displacement so the engine

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.990 
that bigger displacement so the engine
deck<00:02:34.290> lids<00:02:34.560> changed<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.400> year<00:02:35.459> as<00:02:35.819> well

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
deck lids changed this year as well

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.039 
deck lids changed this year as well
there's<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.420> bigger<00:02:36.659> bigger<00:02:37.260> opening<00:02:37.909> to<00:02:38.909> allow

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
there's a bigger bigger opening to allow

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.500 
there's a bigger bigger opening to allow
better<00:02:40.049> airflow<00:02:40.349> into<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:41.040> engine<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.640> open<00:02:42.420> up

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
better airflow into the engine I open up

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.449 
better airflow into the engine I open up
the<00:02:42.569> engine<00:02:43.049> cover<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.590> can<00:02:43.739> actually<00:02:43.950> see

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
the engine cover you can actually see

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.880 
the engine cover you can actually see
the<00:02:45.269> new<00:02:45.480> air<00:02:45.689> box<00:02:46.940> which<00:02:47.940> helps<00:02:48.650> direct<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
the new air box which helps direct the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.870 
the new air box which helps direct the
air<00:02:50.040> into<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.459> engine

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.060 

so<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.690> air<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:54.840> ducted<00:02:55.320> through<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:55.770> vents

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
so the air is ducted through these vents

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.660 
so the air is ducted through these vents
engineer<00:02:56.900> last<00:02:57.900> year's<00:02:58.230> we<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:58.890> had<00:02:59.040> an<00:02:59.220> air
