00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the baseplate again for some reason I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.950 
the baseplate again for some reason I
lost<00:00:51.960> those<00:00:52.230> screws<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.829> came<00:00:53.039> undone

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
lost those screws or they came undone

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.090 
lost those screws or they came undone
but<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.110> thing<00:00:55.230> I<00:00:55.289> didn't<00:00:55.530> mention<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
but one thing I didn't mention on the a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.450 
but one thing I didn't mention on the a
and<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.850> XOR<00:00:57.449> boards<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:58.020> they<00:00:58.739> do<00:00:58.800> offer<00:00:59.129> two

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and the XOR boards is they do offer two

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.880 
and the XOR boards is they do offer two
positions<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.600> heel<00:01:00.780> plate<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.649> kind<00:01:01.859> of

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
positions for the heel plate so kind of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.740 
positions for the heel plate so kind of
like<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.489> Perl<00:01:02.699> power<00:01:02.969> shifter<00:01:03.390> Pebbles

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
like the the Perl power shifter Pebbles

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.080 
like the the Perl power shifter Pebbles
know<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.729> farther

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
know right now this is in the farther

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
know right now this is in the farther
spot<00:01:06.450> but<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:06.869> know<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.350> take<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> two

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
spot but you know I can take out the two

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.550 
spot but you know I can take out the two
screws<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.820> slide<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.360> forward<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.140> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
screws and slide it forward so then you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.690 
screws and slide it forward so then you
know<00:01:10.680> might<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.369> heavier

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
know might have it in the heavier

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.219 
know might have it in the heavier
position<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.450> regarding<00:01:15.450> setting<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
position and regarding setting up the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.039 
position and regarding setting up the
pedals<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.770> practice<00:01:17.220> paths<00:01:17.720> right<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:18.930> we

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
pedals on practice paths right here we

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.770 
pedals on practice paths right here we
have<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.439> Perl<00:01:19.650> practice<00:01:20.130> pad<00:01:20.600> and<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:21.750> I

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
have the Perl practice pad and when I

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080 
have the Perl practice pad and when I
had<00:01:21.930> mentioned<00:01:22.290> before<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.939> front<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
had mentioned before is the front of the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.990 
had mentioned before is the front of the
access<00:01:24.450> pedal<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.110> actually<00:01:25.650> wider<00:01:25.950> than<00:01:26.729> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
access pedal is actually wider than the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.160 
access pedal is actually wider than the
front<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.409> probe<00:01:29.060> practice<00:01:30.060> pad<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
front of the probe practice pad and you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.560 
front of the probe practice pad and you
can<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> see<00:01:31.799> here<00:01:32.070> when<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.329> get<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.450> in

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
can kind of see here when I get it in

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.980 
can kind of see here when I get it in
closer<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:35.100> how<00:01:35.340> it<00:01:35.610> doesn't<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.450> fit

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
closer see how it doesn't really fit

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.140 
closer see how it doesn't really fit
inside<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.650> so<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.490> can<00:01:38.610> place<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.090> here

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
inside it so you can place it right here

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050 
inside it so you can place it right here
and<00:01:40.049> then<00:01:40.200> when<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> mount<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.670> depending

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and then when you mount it on depending

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.359 
and then when you mount it on depending
on<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> size<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.930> beater<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:44.220> know<00:01:44.280> what

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
on the size of your beater you know what

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
on the size of your beater you know what
your<00:01:44.490> beater<00:01:44.700> might<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.119> hit<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.390> head<00:01:45.630> until

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
your beater might not hit the head until

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.200 
your beater might not hit the head until
it's<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:46.500> past<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> 90-degree

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's you know past and the 90-degree

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.090 
it's you know past and the 90-degree
spot<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.110> actually<00:01:49.530> be<00:01:49.590> pushing<00:01:49.920> farther

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
spot so you actually be pushing farther

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.440 
spot so you actually be pushing farther
down<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> actually<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.240> real

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
down than you actually would on a real

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.560 
down than you actually would on a real
drum<00:01:51.720> set<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.649> what<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> did<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.640> you

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
drum set so what I did is I just you

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
drum set so what I did is I just you
know<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.720> improvised<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.710> added<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> couple

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
know I improvised and added a couple

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.969 
know I improvised and added a couple
bumpers<00:01:56.640> onto<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> bottom<00:01:57.530> so<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:58.649> jacked

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
bumpers onto the bottom so it's jacked

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
bumpers onto the bottom so it's jacked
up<00:01:59.159> in<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> front<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.990> on

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
up in the front some so when I put on

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.420 
up in the front some so when I put on
the<00:02:01.259> access<00:02:01.560> pedal<00:02:01.829> no<00:02:01.920> matter<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.250> size

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
the access pedal no matter what size

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.749 
the access pedal no matter what size
mallet<00:02:02.880> I'm<00:02:03.000> still<00:02:03.210> gonna<00:02:03.329> hit<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.659> beater

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
mallet I'm still gonna hit the beater

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.039 
mallet I'm still gonna hit the beater
you<00:02:05.759> know<00:02:05.820> when<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.420> normally<00:02:06.810> hit<00:02:06.899> on

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you know when it would normally hit on

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:07.840 
you know when it would normally hit on
the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.669 
the
now<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.599> Gibraltar<00:02:09.170> is<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.319> little<00:02:09.590> bit

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
now the Gibraltar is a little bit

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.979 
now the Gibraltar is a little bit
different<00:02:10.039> because<00:02:10.129> it<00:02:11.000> is<00:02:11.030> wider<00:02:11.629> at<00:02:11.870> the

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
different because it is wider at the

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.750 
different because it is wider at the
bottom<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.470> mean<00:02:12.860> zoom<00:02:13.370> in<00:02:13.550> there<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.519> you<00:02:16.640> can

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
bottom I mean zoom in there so you can

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.339 
bottom I mean zoom in there so you can
see<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.030> it<00:02:17.180> mounts<00:02:17.480> on<00:02:17.629> there<00:02:17.870> securely

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
see that it mounts on there securely

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.290 
see that it mounts on there securely
it's<00:02:19.220> just<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.489> matter<00:02:19.640> if<00:02:19.849> then<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.090> have<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
it's just a matter if then you have to

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300 
it's just a matter if then you have to
figure<00:02:20.510> out<00:02:20.629> how<00:02:20.900> far<00:02:21.170> away<00:02:21.349> your<00:02:22.040> bass<00:02:22.280> drum

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
figure out how far away your bass drum

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.009 
figure out how far away your bass drum
mallet<00:02:22.760> normally<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.450> head<00:02:23.660> because

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
mallet normally is from the head because

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.660 
mallet normally is from the head because
you<00:02:24.410> know<00:02:24.470> there's<00:02:24.709> no<00:02:24.799> real<00:02:24.980> stopping<00:02:25.430> point

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
you know there's no real stopping point

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.009 
you know there's no real stopping point
for<00:02:25.879> it<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.060> could<00:02:26.150> put<00:02:26.299> it<00:02:26.450> on<00:02:26.510> as<00:02:26.660> close<00:02:26.870> as

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
for it you could put it on as close as

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.710 
for it you could put it on as close as
you<00:02:27.140> like<00:02:27.319> or<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:27.799> know<00:02:27.920> quite<00:02:28.220> far<00:02:28.489> away<00:02:32.739> and

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
it fairly close you know depending on

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.569 
it fairly close you know depending on
the<00:03:32.720> size<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.049> the<00:03:33.170> beaters<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:33.739> using<00:03:34.099> -<00:03:34.250> so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
the size of the beaters that using - so

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.699 
the size of the beaters that using - so
this<00:03:34.819> this<00:03:35.090> will<00:03:35.239> hit<00:03:35.450> closer<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.410> center

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
this this will hit closer to the center

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.039 
this this will hit closer to the center
of<00:03:36.799> the<00:03:36.919> drum<00:03:37.069> head<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:38.359> know<00:03:38.450> like<00:03:38.599> most<00:03:38.930> of

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:41.800 
of the drum head you know like most of
the<00:03:39.109> pictures<00:03:39.410> I've<00:03:39.620> seen<00:03:40.160> online<00:03:40.639> this<00:03:41.540> this

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
the pictures I've seen online this this

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.300 
the pictures I've seen online this this
isn't<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.319> know<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.530> perfectly<00:03:42.919> level

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
isn't you know the perfectly level

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.890 
isn't you know the perfectly level
position<00:03:43.730> so<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.970> beater<00:03:44.180> appears<00:03:44.599> to<00:03:44.780> be

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
position so the beater appears to be

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.870 
position so the beater appears to be
hitting<00:03:45.109> farther<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.950> the<00:03:45.980> left<00:03:46.280> of<00:03:46.730> the

the detonator and then put back on the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.390 
the detonator and then put back on the
piece<00:04:11.870> that<00:04:12.020> holds<00:04:12.170> the<00:04:12.380> spring<00:04:12.710> you<00:04:13.130> know<00:04:13.160> for

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
piece that holds the spring you know for

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.190 
piece that holds the spring you know for
the<00:04:13.460> beater<00:04:13.640> angle<00:04:14.030> if<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.600> look<00:04:14.780> inside<00:04:15.140> it

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the beater angle if you look inside it

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.539 
the beater angle if you look inside it
it<00:04:15.770> you<00:04:16.700> see<00:04:16.850> if<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:16.970> can<00:04:17.150> zoom<00:04:17.330> in<00:04:17.750> enough<00:04:18.549> this

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
it you see if I can zoom in enough this

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.610 
it you see if I can zoom in enough this
way<00:04:19.760> for<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.030> autofocus<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.690> kick<00:04:20.959> in<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.500> can

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
way for the autofocus to kick in you can

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.290 
way for the autofocus to kick in you can
see<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:21.830> axle<00:04:22.220> doesn't<00:04:22.520> stick<00:04:22.760> out<00:04:22.910> all<00:04:23.180> the

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
see the axle doesn't stick out all the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.850 
see the axle doesn't stick out all the
way<00:04:23.480> because<00:04:23.780> it's<00:04:24.080> not<00:04:24.140> really<00:04:24.440> long<00:04:24.620> enough

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
way because it's not really long enough

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.570 
way because it's not really long enough
to<00:04:24.980> hold<00:04:25.130> on

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
to hold on

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.670 
to hold on
you<00:04:25.940> know<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.240> detonator<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.140> this<00:04:27.410> piece

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
you know the detonator and this piece

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.330 
you know the detonator and this piece
but<00:04:28.780> with<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.960> two<00:04:30.140> Allen<00:04:30.500> screws<00:04:30.530> are<00:04:31.190> on

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
but with the two Allen screws are on

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.000 
but with the two Allen screws are on
there<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:32.090> know<00:04:32.210> there's<00:04:33.020> still<00:04:33.290> attached

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
there you know there's still attached

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.950 
there you know there's still attached
there<00:04:34.310> securely<00:04:34.730> so<00:04:35.000> even<00:04:35.240> though<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.540> axle

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
there securely so even though the axle

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.510 
there securely so even though the axle
doesn't<00:04:36.200> look<00:04:36.320> like<00:04:36.470> it's<00:04:36.680> gonna<00:04:36.830> hold<00:04:37.190> tight

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
doesn't look like it's gonna hold tight

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.310 
doesn't look like it's gonna hold tight
you<00:04:38.030> know<00:04:38.150> since<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.630> screws<00:04:38.900> are<00:04:39.110> touching

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
you know since the screws are touching

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.190 
you know since the screws are touching
it<00:04:39.590> work<00:04:39.830> it<00:04:40.700> doesn't<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.750> know<00:04:41.840> where

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
it work it doesn't you know where

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.720 
it work it doesn't you know where
there's<00:04:42.380> no<00:04:42.500> gap<00:04:42.770> it's<00:04:43.100> still<00:04:43.310> gonna<00:04:43.430> hold<00:04:43.610> the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
there's no gap it's still gonna hold the

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.850 
there's no gap it's still gonna hold the
beater<00:04:43.910> angle<00:04:44.300> you<00:04:44.510> know<00:04:44.750> like<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.050> have<00:04:45.620> use

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
beater angle you know like I have use

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.370 
beater angle you know like I have use
this<00:04:46.040> or<00:04:46.280> you<00:04:46.700> know<00:04:46.820> almost<00:04:47.210> almost<00:04:47.990> two<00:04:48.110> years

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
this or you know almost almost two years

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.110 
this or you know almost almost two years
now<00:04:48.590> and<00:04:48.620> haven't<00:04:49.040> had<00:04:49.130> a<00:04:49.160> problem<00:04:49.460> with<00:04:49.700> it<00:04:49.850> so

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
now and haven't had a problem with it so

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.230 
now and haven't had a problem with it so
even<00:04:50.750> though<00:04:50.930> it<00:04:51.020> looks<00:04:51.170> like<00:04:51.350> it<00:04:51.590> doesn't

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
even though it looks like it doesn't

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.620 
even though it looks like it doesn't
gonna<00:04:53.240> hold<00:04:53.510> it<00:04:53.660> all<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.840> way<00:04:54.050> it<00:04:54.290> will<00:04:54.530> and

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
gonna hold it all the way it will and

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.000 
gonna hold it all the way it will and
that's<00:04:56.630> a<00:04:56.810> non-issue<00:04:57.050> if<00:04:57.590> you're<00:04:57.710> using<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
that's a non-issue if you're using the

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.980 
that's a non-issue if you're using the
double<00:04:58.280> pedal<00:04:58.610> with<00:04:58.790> you<00:04:59.570> know<00:04:59.690> what<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.960> e

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
double pedal with you know what the e

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.780 
double pedal with you know what the e
Pitts<00:05:00.350> because<00:05:00.680> then<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:00.980> just<00:05:01.010> have<00:05:01.280> to<00:05:01.430> hold

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
Pitts because then you just have to hold

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.060 
Pitts because then you just have to hold
on<00:05:02.000> the<00:05:02.210> detonator<00:05:02.510> here<00:05:03.110> because<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:03.770> piece

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
on the detonator here because this piece

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:14.330 
on the detonator here because this piece
is<00:05:04.460> actually<00:05:04.700> on<00:05:05.510> this<00:05:06.140> side

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
the spring tension is depending on you

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.970 
the spring tension is depending on you
know<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.780> access<00:05:19.080> pedal<00:05:19.350> that<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.470> buy<00:05:19.710> if

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
know the access pedal that you buy if

piece right here that actually holds the
spring<00:05:24.900> tension<00:05:25.380> and<00:05:26.010> holds<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:26.610> higher<00:05:27.330> up

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 
spring tension and holds it is higher up

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.320 
spring tension and holds it is higher up
on<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:28.020> on<00:05:28.410> the<00:05:28.530> plate<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.880> can<00:05:30.000> see<00:05:30.150> that

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.720 
on the on the plate you can see that
from<00:05:30.510> here<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:31.139> that<00:05:31.290> that<00:05:31.560> aluminum<00:05:32.550> piece

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
from here so that that aluminum piece

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.970 
from here so that that aluminum piece
air<00:05:33.000> is<00:05:33.180> higher<00:05:33.450> up<00:05:33.690> than<00:05:34.139> it<00:05:34.350> is<00:05:34.470> on<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.770> newer

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
air is higher up than it is on the newer

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.820 
air is higher up than it is on the newer
design<00:05:35.340> where<00:05:35.639> it's<00:05:35.880> lower<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:36.750> since<00:05:37.680> it's

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
design where it's lower so since it's

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.590 
design where it's lower so since it's
lower<00:05:38.040> obviously<00:05:38.639> when<00:05:38.790> you<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.300> know<00:05:39.389> set

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
lower obviously when you you know set

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.000 
lower obviously when you you know set
the<00:05:39.630> spring<00:05:39.930> tension<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.380> the<00:05:40.470> highest<00:05:40.680> the

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
the spring tension to the highest the

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.350 
the spring tension to the highest the
spring<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.370> going<00:05:41.400> to<00:05:41.550> be<00:05:41.639> stretched<00:05:41.970> farther

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
spring is going to be stretched farther

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.379 
spring is going to be stretched farther
so<00:05:42.690> it's<00:05:43.169> a<00:05:43.290> higher<00:05:43.470> tension<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.639> that's<00:05:45.180> why<00:05:45.360> I

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
so it's a higher tension so that's why I

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.390 
so it's a higher tension so that's why I
just<00:05:45.480> got<00:05:45.960> this<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.350> know<00:05:46.380> aftermarket<00:05:47.070> super

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 
just got this you know aftermarket super

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.880 
just got this you know aftermarket super
heavy-duty<00:05:48.060> spring<00:05:48.540> here<00:05:48.780> since<00:05:49.140> since<00:05:49.800> I

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
heavy-duty spring here since since I

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.860 
heavy-duty spring here since since I
can't<00:05:50.130> get<00:05:50.310> it<00:05:50.430> as<00:05:50.669> tight<00:05:51.210> as<00:05:51.240> this<00:05:51.540> one<00:05:51.750> by

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
can't get it as tight as this one by

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.210 
can't get it as tight as this one by
default<00:05:51.930> and<00:05:52.470> it's<00:05:52.590> you<00:05:52.680> know<00:05:52.770> got<00:05:52.980> a<00:05:53.010> bigger

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
default and it's you know got a bigger

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.670 
default and it's you know got a bigger
spring<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.669> compensate<00:05:54.180> so<00:05:54.990> that's<00:05:55.169> another

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
spring to compensate so that's another

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.020 
spring to compensate so that's another
thing<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:56.010> keep<00:05:56.130> in<00:05:56.250> mind<00:05:56.430> if<00:05:56.580> you're<00:05:56.880> buying

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.030 
thing to keep in mind if you're buying

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.000 
thing to keep in mind if you're buying
used<00:05:57.300> pebbles<00:05:57.750> as<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.140> know<00:05:58.230> and<00:05:58.440> you<00:05:58.830> like

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
used pebbles as you know and you like

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:00.500 
used pebbles as you know and you like
high<00:05:59.160> spring<00:05:59.490> tension<00:05:59.880> is<00:06:00.000> kind<00:06:00.210> of<00:06:00.270> note

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
high spring tension is kind of note

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.570 
high spring tension is kind of note
where<00:06:00.990> that<00:06:01.169> where<00:06:01.380> this<00:06:01.560> is<00:06:01.890> compared<00:06:02.490> to

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
where that where this is compared to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.540 
where that where this is compared to
newer<00:06:02.820> ones<00:06:03.350> usually<00:06:04.350> you<00:06:04.440> can<00:06:04.590> tell<00:06:04.620> like<00:06:05.070> the

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
newer ones usually you can tell like the

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.909 
newer ones usually you can tell like the
really<00:06:06.150> older<00:06:06.419> access<00:06:06.810> pedals<00:06:07.200> you<00:06:07.680> know<00:06:07.770> it's

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
really older access pedals you know it's

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.290 
really older access pedals you know it's
not<00:06:08.010> going<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.250> be<00:06:08.340> a<00:06:08.370> round<00:06:08.550> bumper<00:06:09.060> at<00:06:09.180> the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
not going to be a round bumper at the

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.700 
not going to be a round bumper at the
front<00:06:09.570> it's<00:06:09.840> going<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.080> be<00:06:10.169> square<00:06:10.560> or

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
front it's going to be square or

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.310 
front it's going to be square or
rectangular<00:06:11.460> shapes<00:06:11.910> and<00:06:12.180> then<00:06:12.750> at<00:06:13.080> the<00:06:13.169> back

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.320 
rectangular shapes and then at the back

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.870 
rectangular shapes and then at the back
of<00:06:13.380> the<00:06:13.620> foot<00:06:13.800> boards<00:06:14.190> there's<00:06:14.430> I<00:06:14.639> think

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
of the foot boards there's I think

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.310 
of the foot boards there's I think
there's<00:06:15.030> like<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.180> little<00:06:15.270> cutout<00:06:15.750> here<00:06:15.990> you

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
there's like a little cutout here you

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.020 
there's like a little cutout here you
know<00:06:16.410> if<00:06:16.530> you<00:06:16.830> look<00:06:17.010> on<00:06:17.160> auction<00:06:17.669> sites<00:06:17.880> and

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
know if you look on auction sites and

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.640 
know if you look on auction sites and
stuff<00:06:18.210> you<00:06:18.570> can<00:06:18.720> tell<00:06:18.900> an<00:06:19.140> older<00:06:19.440> series

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
stuff you can tell an older series

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.250 
stuff you can tell an older series
access<00:06:20.160> pedal<00:06:20.520> based<00:06:21.060> on<00:06:21.270> how<00:06:21.450> it<00:06:21.479> looks<00:06:21.600> down

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
access pedal based on how it looks down

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.350 
access pedal based on how it looks down
here<00:06:22.530> at<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:22.710> bottom<00:06:23.040> and<00:06:23.220> then<00:06:23.760> you<00:06:24.000> know<00:06:24.090> the

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
here at the bottom and then you know the

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.180 
here at the bottom and then you know the
actual<00:06:24.479> rubber<00:06:24.840> bumpers<00:06:25.320> at<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.560> front<00:06:25.830> they

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
actual rubber bumpers at the front they

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.570 
actual rubber bumpers at the front they
won't<00:06:26.370> be<00:06:26.490> circle<00:06:26.850> to<00:06:26.910> be<00:06:27.030> rectangular
