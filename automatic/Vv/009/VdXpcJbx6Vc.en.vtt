00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the cork the reason you do that is that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.310 
the cork the reason you do that is that

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the cork if it dries it actually shrinks

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.310 
the cork if it dries it actually shrinks
and<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> lets<00:01:14.280> air<00:01:14.580> in<00:01:14.880> once<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.720> get<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.110> air

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
and it lets air in once you get more air

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.700 
and it lets air in once you get more air
circulating<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.369> into<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.759> wine<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
circulating with into the wine it

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.340 
circulating with into the wine it
oxidizes<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.979> ages<00:01:20.520> your<00:01:20.729> wine<00:01:21.200> oxidation<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
oxidizes and ages your wine oxidation is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.570 
oxidizes and ages your wine oxidation is
fine<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.860> very<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.280> small<00:01:23.460> quantities

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
it's the air is away from the wine if

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.590 
it's the air is away from the wine if
the<00:01:58.530> wine<00:01:58.710> gets<00:01:58.890> warmer<00:01:59.399> by<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.450> any

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the wine gets warmer by it for any

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.560 
the wine gets warmer by it for any
reason<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> expands<00:02:02.100> slightly<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.969> pushes

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
reason and expands slightly it pushes

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.100 
reason and expands slightly it pushes
itself<00:02:03.930> out<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.399> actually<00:02:05.579> creates<00:02:06.570> a

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.979 
sealed it keeps the air steady it keeps
them<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.489> dark<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.000> then<00:03:57.690> you<00:03:57.720> can

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
them in the dark and then you can

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.229 
them in the dark and then you can
conveniently<00:03:58.739> shove<00:03:59.280> them<00:03:59.489> somewhere<00:03:59.910> under

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
conveniently shove them somewhere under

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
conveniently shove them somewhere under
the<00:04:00.360> kitchen<00:04:00.690> units<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.500> they<00:04:01.769> will<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:02.040> fine

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
the kitchen units and they will be fine

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.400 
the kitchen units and they will be fine
there<00:04:02.640> but<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.360> key<00:04:03.540> thing<00:04:03.570> about<00:04:03.810> storing

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
there but the key thing about storing

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.910 
there but the key thing about storing
wine<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:05.480> aspect<00:04:06.480> about<00:04:06.630> no<00:04:07.230> vibration

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
wine is that aspect about no vibration

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.580 
wine is that aspect about no vibration
no<00:04:08.790> temperature<00:04:09.239> fluctuations<00:04:09.989> but

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
no temperature fluctuations but

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.590 
no temperature fluctuations but
obviously<00:04:11.040> temperature<00:04:11.670> fluctuations<00:04:12.330> do

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
obviously temperature fluctuations do

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.750 
obviously temperature fluctuations do
happen<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.620> important<00:04:14.070> thing<00:04:14.250> there<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.519> that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
happen the important thing there is that

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.330 
happen the important thing there is that
they're<00:04:14.940> very<00:04:14.970> slow<00:04:15.720> if<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.470> had<00:04:16.769> sudden

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
they're very slow if you had sudden

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.279 
they're very slow if you had sudden
changes<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:17.760> temperature<00:04:17.880> that<00:04:18.840> has<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.020> big

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
changes in temperature that has a big

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.770 
changes in temperature that has a big
effect<00:04:19.440> on<00:04:19.739> wine<00:04:20.010> another<00:04:21.000> very<00:04:21.299> important

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
effect on wine another very important

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.010 
effect on wine another very important
thing<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:22.080> wine<00:04:22.440> should

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
thing is wine should

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.379 
thing is wine should
be<00:04:23.139> stored<00:04:23.440> above<00:04:23.680> 18<00:04:24.160> degrees<00:04:24.520> centigrade<00:04:25.090> or

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
be stored above 18 degrees centigrade or

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.809 
be stored above 18 degrees centigrade or
20<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.259> drinking<00:04:27.129> temperature<00:04:27.310> basically

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
20 the drinking temperature basically

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.390 
20 the drinking temperature basically
because<00:04:28.509> above<00:04:29.259> that<00:04:29.530> you're<00:04:29.770> starting<00:04:30.069> to

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
because above that you're starting to

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.480 
because above that you're starting to
seriously<00:04:31.150> damage<00:04:31.599> your<00:04:31.990> wine<00:04:32.199> and<00:04:32.470> also<00:04:33.280> you

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
seriously damage your wine and also you

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.820 
seriously damage your wine and also you
shouldn't<00:04:33.819> really<00:04:34.120> store<00:04:34.389> your<00:04:34.569> wine

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
shouldn't really store your wine

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.010 
shouldn't really store your wine
anywhere<00:04:35.830> near<00:04:36.069> freezing<00:04:36.520> point<00:04:37.030> so<00:04:37.389> we<00:04:37.900> are

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
anywhere near freezing point so we are

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.390 
anywhere near freezing point so we are
saying<00:04:38.259> about<00:04:38.379> four<00:04:38.800> to<00:04:38.979> six<00:04:39.009> degrees

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
saying about four to six degrees

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.809 
saying about four to six degrees
centigrade<00:04:40.150> below<00:04:41.020> that<00:04:41.259> what<00:04:41.830> water<00:04:42.310> starts

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:42.819 
centigrade below that what water starts

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.149 
centigrade below that what water starts
crystallizing<00:04:43.720> so<00:04:44.289> that's<00:04:44.530> how<00:04:44.680> we<00:04:44.740> store

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:45.159 
crystallizing so that's how we store

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.400 
crystallizing so that's how we store
wine
