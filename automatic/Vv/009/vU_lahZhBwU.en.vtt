new quotes a lot of students will try to

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
jam a quote into the conclusion but

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.689 
jam a quote into the conclusion but
whenever<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.560> introduce<00:00:25.710> a<00:00:25.949> quote<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.460> have

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
whenever you introduce a quote you have

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
whenever you introduce a quote you have
to<00:00:26.910> follow<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.300> quote<00:00:27.539> with<00:00:27.779> two<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> three

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
to follow that quote with two to three

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
to follow that quote with two to three
sentences<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.830> commentary<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.580> explanation

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
sentences of commentary or explanation

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
sentences of commentary or explanation
or<00:00:30.599> analysis<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:31.890> we<00:00:31.980> don't<00:00:32.219> want<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.489> put

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
or analysis and so we don't want to put

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.229 
or analysis and so we don't want to put
a<00:00:32.940> quote<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.320> conclusion<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.640> then

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
a quote in the conclusion because then

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.180 
a quote in the conclusion because then
it<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.450> require<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.320> commentary<00:00:37.980> which

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
it would require that commentary which

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.880 
it would require that commentary which
you<00:00:38.340> don't<00:00:38.610> have<00:00:38.850> room<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:40.140> all<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.800> your

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
you don't have room for so all of your

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.319 
you don't have room for so all of your
quotes<00:00:41.100> should<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.520> your<00:00:41.640> body<00:00:41.790> paragraphs

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
quotes should be in your body paragraphs

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
quotes should be in your body paragraphs
and<00:00:42.540> really<00:00:42.930> your<00:00:43.079> conclusion<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.829> about

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and really your conclusion is about

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.139 
and really your conclusion is about
wrapping<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.570> also<00:00:46.170> ask<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.860> not

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
wrapping up I also ask that you not

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
wrapping up I also ask that you not
introduce<00:00:48.149> new<00:00:48.480> questions<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.379> rhetorical
