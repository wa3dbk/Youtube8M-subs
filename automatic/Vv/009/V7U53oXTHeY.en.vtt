the end of the raid he got 10 trophies
out<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.500> was<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> pretty<00:02:20.980> nice<00:02:21.340> raid

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
out of it so that was a pretty nice raid

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.250 
out of it so that was a pretty nice raid
by<00:02:21.820> dance<00:02:22.120> he<00:02:22.360> almost<00:02:22.720> pulled<00:02:22.900> off<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.140> two

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
star and I think that my base is pretty

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.270 
star and I think that my base is pretty
successful<00:02:25.960> it<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.320> if<00:02:26.350> it<00:02:26.650> can<00:02:26.800> hold<00:02:26.950> off<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
successful it can if it can hold off the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.850 
successful it can if it can hold off the
two<00:02:27.430> star<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.940> successfully<00:02:28.870> secure<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.530> one
