00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
behavior that the AI tries to use which

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.130 
behavior that the AI tries to use which
involves<00:00:51.879> keeping<00:00:52.059> as<00:00:52.300> much<00:00:52.449> cohesion<00:00:53.050> as

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.969 
missile troops into a giant battalion
square<00:01:27.119> where<00:01:28.119> he<00:01:28.720> could<00:01:28.930> place<00:01:29.140> his<00:01:29.409> covering

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
square where he could place his covering

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.300 
square where he could place his covering
and<00:01:30.159> key<00:01:31.030> units<00:01:31.420> inside<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.440> that<00:01:32.620> as<00:01:32.800> these

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
and key units inside so that as these

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.200 
and key units inside so that as these
walls<00:01:33.700> were<00:01:34.030> breached<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.870> the<00:01:35.140> infantry

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
walls were breached as the infantry

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.480 
walls were breached as the infantry
repelled<00:01:37.210> cover<00:01:38.140> units<00:01:38.500> that<00:01:38.680> came<00:01:39.070> in<00:01:39.280> and

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
repelled cover units that came in and

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.780 
repelled cover units that came in and
those<00:01:40.330> walls<00:01:40.570> could<00:01:40.690> be<00:01:40.810> reinforced<00:01:41.440> and<00:01:41.790> it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
those walls could be reinforced and it

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.130 
those walls could be reinforced and it
made<00:01:43.030> it<00:01:43.060> very<00:01:43.210> very<00:01:43.450> difficult<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.960> fight

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
made it very very difficult to fight

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.870 
made it very very difficult to fight
against<00:01:44.530> any<00:01:44.950> it<00:01:45.130> was<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.310> very<00:01:45.400> effective

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
against any it was a very effective

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.310 
against any it was a very effective
tactic<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.600> I'm<00:01:46.690> going<00:01:46.840> to<00:01:46.870> try<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.049> break

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
tactic so I'm going to try and break

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.610 
tactic so I'm going to try and break
this<00:01:47.470> down

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
this down

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:56.070 
this down
with<00:01:48.980> my<00:01:49.130> cover<00:01:49.460> e<00:01:49.580> heavy<00:01:49.760> force

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.740 

alright<00:01:56.320> let's<00:01:56.620> go

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.830 

I<00:02:01.810> see<00:02:02.470> what<00:02:02.590> they're<00:02:02.710> up<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:03.330> I'm<00:02:04.330> formula

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
I see what they're up to I'm formula

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.169 
I see what they're up to I'm formula
there's<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.470> battalion<00:02:05.890> square

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
there's a battalion square

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.539 
there's a battalion square
I'm<00:02:08.689> going<00:02:08.929> to<00:02:08.989> try<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.289> break<00:02:09.709> down<00:02:09.739> their

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
I'm going to try and break down their

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.540 
I'm going to try and break down their
war

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550

charging<00:02:35.599> compilation<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.170> easily<00:02:36.530> get<00:02:36.650> over

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
charging compilation to easily get over

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.930 
charging compilation to easily get over
those<00:02:37.010> conditions

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
those conditions

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:45.010 
those conditions

to<00:03:37.590> take<00:03:37.770> the<00:03:37.860> high<00:03:38.010> ground

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.030 

Oh<00:03:41.200> load<00:03:41.800> into<00:03:42.220> our<00:03:42.370> own

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.770 

i<00:03:46.129> miss<00:03:46.730> our<00:03:46.879> troops<00:03:47.209> should<00:03:47.329> be<00:03:47.450> able<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.629> deal

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
i miss our troops should be able to deal

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.880 
i miss our troops should be able to deal
with<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.019> that's<00:03:48.950> right<00:03:49.159> you<00:03:49.489> go<00:03:49.670> back<00:03:50.890> we're

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
with that that's right you go back we're

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.229 
with that that's right you go back we're
on<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.099> high<00:03:52.219> ground<00:03:52.250> so<00:03:52.819> we<00:03:52.939> have<00:03:53.120> an

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
on the high ground so we have an

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.530 
on the high ground so we have an
advantage

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
advantage

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.440 
advantage
so<00:03:56.530> they're<00:03:56.680> open

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.570 

simile<00:04:02.080> of<00:04:02.110> msu

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.880 

and<00:04:06.580> I<00:04:06.790> am<00:04:06.880> suppose

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.530 

silly<00:04:12.280> cute<00:04:12.460> on<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.760> phone

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.720 

these<00:04:17.170> guns<00:04:17.380> that<00:04:17.650> are<00:04:17.740> providing<00:04:18.220> support

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
these guns that are providing support

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:26.420 
these guns that are providing support
from<00:04:18.910> your<00:04:19.030> ear<00:04:19.210> I<00:04:19.330> think

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.580 

flanking<00:04:27.240> child<00:04:27.539> should<00:04:27.900> get<00:04:28.289> to<00:04:28.440> that

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
flanking child should get to that

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:36.610 
flanking child should get to that
support

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.870 

imagine

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.570 

focused<00:04:42.480> on<00:04:42.600> that<00:04:42.750> general<00:04:43.340> brave<00:04:44.340> lass

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
focused on that general brave lass

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.020 
focused on that general brave lass
downloads<00:04:45.090> but<00:04:45.390> think<00:04:45.660> it's<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.900> bit<00:04:46.050> well

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.000 

and<00:04:51.030> there<00:04:51.180> goes<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.600> general<00:04:52.050> tonight<00:04:52.830> for

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and there goes that general tonight for

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.100 
and there goes that general tonight for
an<00:04:53.070> eye

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:05.360 

victory

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.430 

you
