what<00:00:04.170> I've<00:00:04.319> tried<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.160> what<00:00:05.370> I<00:00:05.400> found<00:00:05.700> works

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
what I've tried and what I found works

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.799 
what I've tried and what I found works
in<00:00:06.930> our<00:00:07.170> climate<00:00:07.560> is<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.730> get<00:00:08.940> one<00:00:09.300> part<00:00:09.630> of

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
in our climate is to get one part of

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.830 
in our climate is to get one part of
clay<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:11.130> part<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.670> compost<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.540> he<00:00:12.599> mix

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
clay and one part of compost and he mix

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.160 
clay and one part of compost and he mix
them<00:00:13.110> together<00:00:13.730> now<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.820> trick<00:00:15.240> into<00:00:15.929> making

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
them together now the trick into making

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.950 
them together now the trick into making
this<00:00:16.940> goes<00:00:17.940> a<00:00:17.970> little<00:00:18.180> bit<00:00:18.390> deeper<00:00:18.449> than

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
this goes a little bit deeper than

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.810 
this goes a little bit deeper than
getting<00:00:19.260> claimed<00:00:19.619> you've<00:00:20.369> got<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.609> get<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
getting claimed you've got to get the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.300 
getting claimed you've got to get the
right<00:00:20.970> type<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.359> clay<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:22.170> make<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.590> work<00:00:22.949> you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
right type of clay to make this work you

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.660 
right type of clay to make this work you
used<00:00:23.640> potter's<00:00:24.180> ball<00:00:24.720> clay<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.039> it's<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.340> part

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
used potter's ball clay so it's one part

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330 
used potter's ball clay so it's one part
of<00:00:26.880> potters<00:00:27.119> ball<00:00:27.510> clay<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.439> part<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> compost

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
of potters ball clay one part of compost

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.359 
of potters ball clay one part of compost
and<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.660> mix<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.199> up<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.250> add

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
and you just mix that up and you add

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.430 
and you just mix that up and you add
your<00:00:32.399> seed<00:00:32.850> cuz<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.420> only<00:00:33.570> limited<00:00:33.899> by

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
your seed cuz this is only limited by

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.240 
your seed cuz this is only limited by
your<00:00:35.040> imagination<00:00:36.110> if<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.620> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.980> grow

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
your imagination if you want to grow

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.330 
your imagination if you want to grow
flowers<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.540> grow<00:00:39.750> flowers<00:00:40.070> if<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.160> want

manures<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.700> whole<00:00:44.879> thing<00:00:45.239> I'm<00:00:45.629> using<00:00:45.930> some

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
manures the whole thing I'm using some

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.430 
manures the whole thing I'm using some
sunflower<00:00:47.219> seeds<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.320> I'll

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
sunflower seeds here and let's see I'll

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.889 
sunflower seeds here and let's see I'll
measure<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.010> out<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.579> half<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.090> cup<00:00:51.300> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
measure that out about half a cup of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
measure that out about half a cup of
sunflower<00:00:52.289> seeds<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.430> they're<00:00:53.610> quite

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
sunflower seeds because they're quite

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.560 
sunflower seeds because they're quite
big<00:00:54.120> and<00:00:54.960> I'll<00:00:55.110> mix<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.270> you<00:00:57.270> add

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
big and I'll mix those in and you add

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.240 
big and I'll mix those in and you add
them<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:58.050> add<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.500> bit<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.829> water<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
them just add a little bit of water to

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.319 
them just add a little bit of water to
it<00:00:59.570> to<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:00.750> these<00:01:00.989> balls<00:01:01.609> as<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.789> say<00:01:03.030> you're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
it to make these balls as I say you're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.210 
it to make these balls as I say you're
only<00:01:03.480> limited<00:01:03.719> by<00:01:04.010> imagination<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.129> you

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
only limited by imagination when you

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.270 
only limited by imagination when you
make<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.640> things<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.869> could<00:01:07.280> revegetate

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
make these things you could revegetate

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.310 
make these things you could revegetate
an<00:01:08.659> entire<00:01:09.659> area<00:01:10.460> something<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> farm<00:01:12.320> by

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
an entire area something like a farm by

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.890 
an entire area something like a farm by
doing<00:01:13.710> this<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.729> most<00:01:14.970> important<00:01:15.630> thing

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
doing this and the most important thing

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.380 
doing this and the most important thing
for<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.640> make<00:01:17.820> sure<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.299> you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
for this is to to make sure that you

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.330 
for this is to to make sure that you
don't<00:01:18.600> put<00:01:18.840> too<00:01:19.020> much<00:01:19.049> seed<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.920> too

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
don't put too much seed in and too

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.760 
don't put too much seed in and too
little<00:01:20.490> seed<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.320> you've<00:01:22.619> got<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
little seed that's where you've got to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.359 
little seed that's where you've got to
sort<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.130> judge<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.700> by<00:01:23.909> eye<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.570> would<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.890> for

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
sort of judge it by eye I would say for

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.300 
sort of judge it by eye I would say for
very<00:01:26.729> fine<00:01:27.090> seed<00:01:27.710> something<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> really

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
very fine seed something which is really

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.210 
very fine seed something which is really
small<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.600> use<00:01:30.869> eucalyptus<00:01:31.710> seed<00:01:31.950> I'd

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
small if you use eucalyptus seed I'd

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969 
small if you use eucalyptus seed I'd
only<00:01:32.400> put<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.759> about<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> quarter<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.750> cup<00:01:33.979> and

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
only put in about a quarter of a cup and

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.890 
only put in about a quarter of a cup and
I<00:01:35.280> would<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.640> small<00:01:36.000> balls<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.780> them

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
I would make small balls out of them

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.690 
I would make small balls out of them
maybe<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.860> smaller<00:01:38.070> than<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
maybe a little bit smaller than this

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.940 
maybe a little bit smaller than this
just<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.840> together<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.500> see<00:01:40.740> that

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
just get this together you can see that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280 
just get this together you can see that
the<00:01:41.100> consistency<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.930> getting

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
the consistency of this is is getting

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
the consistency of this is is getting
quite<00:01:43.680> nice<00:01:44.009> now<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.579> actually<00:01:44.820> making<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
quite nice now it's actually making a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.440 
quite nice now it's actually making a
bit<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> grip<00:01:45.990> here<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.880> so<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.000> possible

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
bit of a grip here and so it's possible

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
bit of a grip here and so it's possible
to<00:01:48.570> actually<00:01:48.689> roll<00:01:49.200> these<00:01:49.439> things<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.040> your

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to actually roll these things in your

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
to actually roll these things in your
hand<00:01:50.509> of<00:01:51.509> course<00:01:51.570> some<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.259> will<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.649> king

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
hand of course some of you will be king

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.340 
hand of course some of you will be king
gardeners<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.570> were<00:01:54.720> saying<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
gardeners and you were saying what the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.770 
gardeners and you were saying what the
hell<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.680> Gerry<00:01:56.009> talking<00:01:56.729> about<00:01:57.030> making<00:01:57.479> seed

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
hell is Gerry talking about making seed

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.530 
hell is Gerry talking about making seed
balls<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:59.070> delayed<00:01:59.579> germination<00:02:00.180> when

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
balls to have delayed germination when

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.910 
balls to have delayed germination when
he's<00:02:00.659> already<00:02:00.840> wetted<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.469> seed<00:02:01.710> it's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
he's already wetted the seed it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.219 
he's already wetted the seed it's
started<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.460> germination<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
started the germination now this is the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.380 
started the germination now this is the
trickiest<00:02:04.649> bit<00:02:05.009> with<00:02:05.369> making<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.880> seed<00:02:06.119> balls

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
trickiest bit with making the seed balls

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
trickiest bit with making the seed balls
you've<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.049> dry<00:02:07.259> these<00:02:07.500> quickly<00:02:07.860> they've

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
you've got to dry these quickly they've

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.330 
you've got to dry these quickly they've
got<00:02:08.879> to<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.090> onto<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> warm<00:02:09.780> windowsill<00:02:10.500> home

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
got to go onto a warm windowsill home

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.430 
got to go onto a warm windowsill home
when<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> tend<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> make<00:02:12.629> these<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> do<00:02:13.080> them<00:02:13.349> in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
when I tend to make these I do them in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.880 
when I tend to make these I do them in
back

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
back

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.980 
back
and<00:02:14.490> I've<00:02:14.610> got<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> herb<00:02:15.030> dryer<00:02:15.360> with<00:02:15.600> various

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and I've got a herb dryer with various

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.690 
and I've got a herb dryer with various
layers<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.560> I<00:02:16.620> put<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.100> there<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.400> after

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
layers and I put them in there and after

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.440 
layers and I put them in there and after
about<00:02:17.850> an<00:02:18.000> hour

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
about an hour

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.410 
about an hour
these<00:02:18.870> balls<00:02:19.200> have<00:02:19.440> completely<00:02:19.980> dried<00:02:20.420> and

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
these balls have completely dried and

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.340 
these balls have completely dried and
what<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.660> tend<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.260> do<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.910> tend<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.510> make<00:02:25.200> them

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
what I tend to do is I tend to make them

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.440 
what I tend to do is I tend to make them
out<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.250> make<00:02:26.460> these<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:27.000> things

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
out a thing and make these with things

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.810 
out a thing and make these with things
which<00:02:27.720> will<00:02:27.870> grow<00:02:28.110> well<00:02:28.380> into<00:02:29.070> street<00:02:29.460> trees

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
which will grow well into street trees

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.220 
which will grow well into street trees
in<00:02:30.150> Brisbane<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.820> so<00:02:32.820> whenever<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.240> see<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.870> tree

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
in Brisbane and so whenever I see a tree

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.770 
in Brisbane and so whenever I see a tree
pit<00:02:34.530> that's<00:02:34.980> empty<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.330> drop<00:02:36.570> one<00:02:36.750> of

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
pit that's empty I just drop one of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.950 
pit that's empty I just drop one of
those<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:38.070> it<00:02:38.190> may<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.940> year<00:02:39.000> before<00:02:39.630> it

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
those in and it may be a year before it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.830 
those in and it may be a year before it
germinates<00:02:40.440> but<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.520> surprising<00:02:42.240> how<00:02:42.540> well

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
germinates but it's surprising how well

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.340 
germinates but it's surprising how well
these<00:02:43.080> plants<00:02:43.650> work<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.190> works<00:02:44.730> better<00:02:45.350> with

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
these plants work it works better with

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.740 
these plants work it works better with
Australian<00:02:46.950> native<00:02:47.130> plants<00:02:47.880> than<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.570> really

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
Australian native plants than it really

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.460 
Australian native plants than it really
does

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
does

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.640 
does
with<00:02:49.920> European<00:02:50.880> plants<00:02:51.420> you<00:02:52.170> put<00:02:52.440> these

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
with European plants you put these

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.160 
with European plants you put these
things<00:02:52.950> out<00:02:53.250> towards<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> end<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.930> dry

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
things out towards the end of the dry

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.090 
things out towards the end of the dry
season<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.720> allow<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.780> rain<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.560> naturally

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
season and allow the rain to naturally

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.030 
season and allow the rain to naturally
stimulate<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.790> germination<00:03:00.470> there's<00:03:01.470> only<00:03:01.830> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
stimulate the germination there's only a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.830 
stimulate the germination there's only a
few<00:03:02.280> things<00:03:02.520> that<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.120> wrong<00:03:03.360> with<00:03:03.600> these

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
few things that can go wrong with these

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.640 
few things that can go wrong with these
now<00:03:04.770> with<00:03:05.180> sunflower<00:03:06.180> seed<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:07.500> is<00:03:07.620> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
now with sunflower seed that is a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.940 
now with sunflower seed that is a
powerful<00:03:08.160> attractant<00:03:08.970> for<00:03:09.209> rats<00:03:09.890> they<00:03:10.890> do

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
powerful attractant for rats they do

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.610 
powerful attractant for rats they do
like<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.090> bit<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.450> easy<00:03:12.720> lunch<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.500> my

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
like a little bit of easy lunch and my

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.190 
like a little bit of easy lunch and my
first<00:03:13.980> attempts<00:03:14.610> at<00:03:14.640> growing<00:03:15.630> things<00:03:15.930> with

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
first attempts at growing things with

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.190 
first attempts at growing things with
sunflower<00:03:16.800> seeds<00:03:17.480> didn't<00:03:18.480> work<00:03:18.660> because<00:03:18.870> the

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
sunflower seeds didn't work because the

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.009 
sunflower seeds didn't work because the
rats<00:03:19.410> ate<00:03:19.620> them<00:03:20.000> so<00:03:21.000> what<00:03:21.209> I<00:03:21.239> did<00:03:21.360> was<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.840> got

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
rats ate them so what I did was I got

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.740 
rats ate them so what I did was I got
some<00:03:22.380> powdered<00:03:22.920> sulfur<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.670> while<00:03:24.510> they're

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
some powdered sulfur and while they're

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.570 
some powdered sulfur and while they're
damn<00:03:24.959> you<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.709> put<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.920> little<00:03:26.040> bit<00:03:26.250> it's<00:03:26.400> bit

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
damn you just put a little bit it's bit

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.190 
damn you just put a little bit it's bit
like<00:03:26.760> making<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.269> cake<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:27.780> know<00:03:27.900> but<00:03:28.080> when

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
like making a cake you know but when

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.050 
like making a cake you know but when
you're<00:03:28.320> rolling<00:03:28.739> it<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> cover<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.700> table

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
you're rolling it you cover the table

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.699 
you're rolling it you cover the table
with<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.390> bit<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.630> flour<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.380> just<00:03:31.560> put<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
with a bit of flour you just put a

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.890 
with a bit of flour you just put a
little<00:03:31.769> bit<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.130> flour<00:03:32.340> of<00:03:32.730> sulfur<00:03:33.269> on<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.540> or

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
little bit of flour of sulfur on it or

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.500 
little bit of flour of sulfur on it or
powdered<00:03:34.500> sulfur<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:35.160> just<00:03:35.940> put<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.269> on<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
powdered sulfur and just put that on the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.540 
powdered sulfur and just put that on the
air<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:36.810> then<00:03:36.900> dry<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.200> and<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.130> rats<00:03:38.310> won't

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
air and then dry it and the rats won't

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.140 
air and then dry it and the rats won't
touch<00:03:38.850> it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
touch it

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.980 
touch it
and<00:03:39.810> they'll<00:03:39.959> germinate<00:03:40.200> very<00:03:40.739> well
