00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
battery in theory it should take roughly

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.010 
battery in theory it should take roughly
about<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.800> hours<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.430> charge<00:00:41.870> assuming<00:00:42.870> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
about two hours to charge assuming that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290

cut the time in half

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.039 
cut the time in half
because<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.340> putting<00:01:02.579> out<00:01:02.789> 2<00:01:03.059> amps<00:01:03.510> now<00:01:03.989> 2

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
because you're putting out 2 amps now 2

amps is if your phone has a 2,000
milliamp<00:01:07.170> battery<00:01:07.460> it<00:01:08.460> would<00:01:08.640> be<00:01:08.850> 1<00:01:09.299> hour<00:01:09.600> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
milliamp battery it would be 1 hour so

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.580 
milliamp battery it would be 1 hour so
you're<00:01:10.170> cutting<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.680> time<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.159> half<00:01:11.600> now<00:01:12.600> most

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
you're cutting the time in half now most

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
you're cutting the time in half now most
of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> time<00:01:14.040> Chargers<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.700> chips<00:01:15.030> inside

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
of the time Chargers have chips inside

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.440 
of the time Chargers have chips inside
them<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.170> control<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> voltage<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.640> that's

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
them that control the voltage so that's

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.580 
them that control the voltage so that's
something<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.990> you're<00:01:19.110> going<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.439> to

look<00:01:19.770> at<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> why<00:01:20.970> Apple<00:01:21.270> devices<00:01:21.900> won't

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
look at this is why Apple devices won't

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.920 
look at this is why Apple devices won't
charge<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.400> other<00:01:23.880> chargers<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.659> they

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
charge with other chargers as they

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.710 
charge with other chargers as they
regulate<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> voltage<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> times<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
regulate the voltage a lot of times I

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
regulate the voltage a lot of times I
get<00:01:27.960> emails<00:01:28.439> from<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.799> guys<00:01:28.920> asking<00:01:29.520> you

the<00:01:41.939> phone<00:01:42.360> charger<00:01:42.960> instead<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> tablet

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
the phone charger instead of the tablet

charger the one that came with the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.960 
charger the one that came with the
device<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.890> probably<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.490> doing<00:01:47.850> that

device and you probably are doing that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
device and you probably are doing that
because<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.960> realize<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.439> it's<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.920> same

microUSB so you already have one in the
wall<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:52.979> say<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.490> I'm

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
battery life first of all there are some

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.119 
battery life first of all there are some

particularly slim on resources and that

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.409 
particularly slim on resources and that
will<00:03:59.439> use<00:03:59.620> a<00:03:59.799> lot<00:04:00.040> less<00:04:00.099> resources<00:04:00.819> than<00:04:01.329> the

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
will use a lot less resources than the

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:02.819 
will use a lot less resources than the
ROM<00:04:01.599> none<00:04:01.780> like<00:04:01.900> them<00:04:02.079> stock<00:04:02.319> on<00:04:02.500> your<00:04:02.530> phone

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
ROM none like them stock on your phone

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.199 
ROM none like them stock on your phone
so<00:04:03.040> something<00:04:03.310> like<00:04:03.340> Saanich<00:04:03.909> and<00:04:04.060> mods

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
so something like Saanich and mods

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.429 
so something like Saanich and mods
something<00:04:04.540> like<00:04:04.659> a<00:04:04.870> okp

00:04:05.429 --> 00:04:05.439 
something like a okp

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:07.530 
something like a okp
very<00:04:06.069> stable<00:04:06.370> roms<00:04:06.849> with<00:04:06.939> great<00:04:07.180> resource

very stable roms with great resource

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.089 
very stable roms with great resource
management<00:04:07.930> will<00:04:08.409> actually<00:04:08.799> end<00:04:08.949> up<00:04:09.040> using

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
management will actually end up using

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.819 
management will actually end up using
less<00:04:09.459> RAM<00:04:10.060> while<00:04:10.479> idling<00:04:10.930> then<00:04:11.379> something

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
less RAM while idling then something

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.309 
less RAM while idling then something
like<00:04:11.979> stock<00:04:12.400> TouchWiz<00:04:13.030> or<00:04:13.209> stock<00:04:13.479> sense<00:04:13.810> UI<00:04:14.019> so

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
like stock TouchWiz or stock sense UI so

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.719 
like stock TouchWiz or stock sense UI so
you<00:04:14.379> can<00:04:14.470> go<00:04:14.560> ahead<00:04:14.650> and<00:04:14.739> flash<00:04:15.009> whatever<00:04:15.400> ROM

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
you can go ahead and flash whatever ROM

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.460 
you can go ahead and flash whatever ROM
you<00:04:15.909> want<00:04:16.150> on<00:04:16.329> your<00:04:16.359> rooted<00:04:16.870> android<00:04:17.109> device

you want on your rooted android device

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:18.930 
you want on your rooted android device
but<00:04:17.739> then<00:04:17.889> what<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.310> have<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.519> choose<00:04:18.909> a

but then what you have to choose a
kernel<00:04:19.329> there<00:04:19.720> are<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.900> lot<00:04:20.019> of<00:04:20.049> great<00:04:20.500> kernels

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:40.719 
kernels the voltage basically means how

little bit more complicated than I'd

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.129

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
like to be able to explain here but

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.920 
like to be able to explain here but
basically<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:48.039> ultra<00:04:48.490> low<00:04:48.669> voltage<00:04:48.930> kernels
