00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.019
Hello, dear animal friends, glad to see you
again.

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.769
Today I'll show you how to measure cat's temperature.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.819
I think it makes sense to deal with what to do in time

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:19.909
and not wait 
until the cat became ill.

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:24.020
For not to bother the cat with the procedur longer than it is necessarily

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.920
before starting the temperature measurement I prepare as much as possible.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.510
I have two bowls ready, olive oil,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.009
Disinfectants or alcohol, a rubber glove

00:00:34.009 --> 00:00:37.700
and of course the medical thermometer.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.400
I reject vaseline for this purpose because it's made of mineral oil

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.890
and if the cat cleans herself up after finishing the procedure, she inevitably sucks of the olive oil

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.260
I just think olive oil is more natural

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.840
and it serves the same purpose.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.420
I fill the olive oil in one bowl

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.450
and in the second bowl i put in some desinfectants, e.g. you get in a drugstore.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.920
or some alcohol from the pharmacy,

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.040
For desinfecting the measuring tip of the
Clinical thermometer

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.370
I put the bowl slightly slope, so you don't need so much of the respective fluids.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.830
For the hand you use for the measurement you can put the rubber glove ready.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.999
You need some time for measurement, and therefore you should take good care of the clinical thermometer

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.450
for it should not put in inadvertently deeper as needed.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.580
You can prevent this by applying the finger in the anus,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.210
while holding the thermometer at the same time.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.990
So please put in the thermometer only with metal tip,

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.920
because only the tip can register the body temperature.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.840
I put the cat on its body on my lap

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.960
and talk to her very gently.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.860
I put her head, or better said

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.669
her upper body in my arms,

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.810
which I don't need for the mesurement later on.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.670
If the cat feels that she is in good hands,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.760
I put her tail gently 
between my legs,

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:14.069
so that he doesn't interfere the temperature measurement and the process can be as short as possible.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.699
You always should caress and soothe the cat

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.349
and also encourage her how great she behaves. 
The sound of friendly spoken words is always understood

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.320
no matter which language you speak.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.049
While the cat relaxes on the
lap,

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.079
you can dip the tip of the thermometer in olive oil

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.999
and switch on the thermometer.

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.689
I advise against a thermometer made of glass and filld with mercury

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:43.150
because the cat can cause uncontrollable movements if she's frighten of somehing.

00:02:45.029 --> 00:02:48.739
If a digital thermometer drops
down, there is no danger of leaking toxic mercury.

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:56.279
and another advantage is
the acoustically announcement of  the end of the measuring process.

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.820
The body temperature of the cat is
higher than the human ones.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.509
and with its 38.5 Celsius degrees it is still acceptable.

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:15.219
If it goes beyond one should
watch definitely

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.539
and if you're in doubt about you should contact a veterinarian.

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:23.159
If you need help, please don't hesitat to contact a vet.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.889
look for a veterinarian emergency phone number in time.

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:33.349
You can find this service number  in the 
local newspapers

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.889
or in the phone book or in
Internet for your location,

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.679
Your vet will definetely support you to find this number.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.889
And if you have  figured it out, 
deposite it where you will immediately find it in an emergency

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.709
When a cat is sick, you will see it.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.389
If you watch your cat, you can see an 
optical and psychic change

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:02.289
The coat often seemed neglected and
disheveled,

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:05.520
the cat appears listless and backtracked.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:10.460
Fever often means loss of appetite and reduction of weight.

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.480
Therefore, I recommend to weigh even the healthy cat regularly.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.970
How to do this, I showed you in my "Katzentipp Nr. 1" (advice for cat No. 1)

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.410
A cat with a weight of 11lb, which looses 1lb of weight,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.869
this doeshn't sound much at first

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.100
but if one applies the percentage of
a human,

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.890
then 110 lb quickliy become 99 lb body weight.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.140
If a cat already became sick
and you have called the veterinary emergency phone number,

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.220
then it makes sense, to gather concrete informations as many as possible

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.479
because the more effective and faster you can get help for the cat.

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.989
After an illness with weight loss
there are liquid tonics that

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.540
can help a cat very quickly.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.479
With these products  you can quickly give
your cat

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.679
the necessaryly needed vitamins and minerals for recreation.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.160
So, thank you for your
attention,

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.139
May you and your cat stay healthy

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:25.139
and I am happy if your watching again
 my next advices for cat care.

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:40.190
You did a good job Louis!

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.190
That's what I've already said!
