00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
so no further ado we're gonna go

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.459 
so no further ado we're gonna go
straight<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> replays<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.239> I'll<00:00:52.199> show

you<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:53.730> first<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> two<00:00:55.829> where<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> win

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.399 

okay<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.820> the<00:01:02.820> first<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:03.420> do<00:01:03.480> with<00:01:04.140> this

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
okay so the first thing I do with this

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.800 
okay so the first thing I do with this
is<00:01:04.680> deploy<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.580> arches<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.420> clear<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
is deploy the arches to clear the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.440 
is deploy the arches to clear the
structures<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.530> outside<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.240> for

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
structures on the outside I do this for

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
structures on the outside I do this for
one<00:01:09.600> specific<00:01:09.900> reason<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.740> that's<00:01:10.950> for<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
one specific reason and that's for the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.880 
one specific reason and that's for the
peckers<00:01:11.670> when<00:01:11.880> I<00:01:11.970> deploy<00:01:12.299> them<00:01:12.600> if<00:01:13.500> they<00:01:13.680> don't

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
peckers when I deploy them if they don't

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.810 
peckers when I deploy them if they don't
clear<00:01:14.360> clearing<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
clear clearing or on the the way you

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.719 
clear clearing or on the the way you
want<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> enter<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:20.100> peckers<00:01:20.400> we'll<00:01:20.520> just

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
want to enter the peckers we'll just

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
want to enter the peckers we'll just
follow<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.240> structures<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> way<00:01:21.960> around

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
follow the structures all the way around

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
follow the structures all the way around
the<00:01:22.290> base<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.880> it'll<00:01:23.880> make<00:01:24.270> them<00:01:24.479> useless<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the base and it'll make them useless so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859 
the base and it'll make them useless so
I<00:01:25.500> put<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> golem<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:27.000> absorb<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
I put a golem in to absorb all the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.850 
I put a golem in to absorb all the
damage<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> wall<00:01:30.840> breakers<00:01:31.200> come<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
damage so the wall breakers come in and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
damage so the wall breakers come in and
break<00:01:31.979> through<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> wall<00:01:32.750> now<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> foil<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
break through the wall now to foil the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.319 
break through the wall now to foil the
Wizards<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.070> peckers<00:01:35.640> actually<00:01:36.090> are

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
Wizards and the peckers actually are

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.219 
Wizards and the peckers actually are
going<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.810> way

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
going the right way

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
going the right way
because<00:01:37.590> there's<00:01:37.920> no<00:01:38.070> structures<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
because there's no structures on the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.499 
because there's no structures on the
outside<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:40.049> distract<00:01:40.470> them<00:01:40.680> okay<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:41.509> perfect

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
outside to distract them okay so perfect

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630 
outside to distract them okay so perfect
scenario<00:01:42.780> now<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> packet<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.280> going

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
scenario now is a packet is going

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.090 
scenario now is a packet is going
through<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.869> middle<00:01:46.079> breaking<00:01:46.770> through<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
through the middle breaking through the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.819 
through the middle breaking through the
wall<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.549> get<00:01:47.700> into<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.060> middle<00:01:48.439> with<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> few

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
wall to get into the middle with a few

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.539 
wall to get into the middle with a few
wizards<00:01:50.220> behind<00:01:50.939> him<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> stage

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
wizards behind him so this is a stage

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
wizards behind him so this is a stage
where<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> actually<00:01:54.030> drop<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.689> rage<00:01:54.960> spell<00:01:55.140> so

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
where I actually drop a rage spell so

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.370 
where I actually drop a rage spell so
they<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:55.950> damage<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.610> center<00:01:57.149> area<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.719> much

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
they can damage that center area as much

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.230 
they can damage that center area as much
as<00:01:58.590> possible<00:01:58.829> and<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.759> quickly<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.149> possible

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
as possible and as quickly as possible

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.929 
as possible and as quickly as possible
and<00:02:00.960> I've<00:02:01.140> got<00:02:01.320> several<00:02:02.159> peckers<00:02:02.909> in

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and I've got several peckers in

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.910 
and I've got several peckers in
different<00:02:03.540> areas<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.049> base<00:02:04.229> destroying

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
different areas of the base destroying

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.860 
different areas of the base destroying
everything

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
everything

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.470 
everything
they<00:02:05.990> can<00:02:06.710> find<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> main<00:02:10.580> thing<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
they can find the main thing with the

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.650 
they can find the main thing with the
the<00:02:11.990> peckers<00:02:12.350> is<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:13.670> they're<00:02:14.030> they're

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
the peckers is that they're they're

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.500 
the peckers is that they're they're
immune<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.230> traps

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
immune to traps

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.570 
immune to traps
especially<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.900> golems<00:02:18.230> as<00:02:18.380> well<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.370> they're

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
especially the golems as well so they're

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.540 
especially the golems as well so they're

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
great against an anti hog base you just

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.740 
great against an anti hog base you just
rush<00:02:22.970> them<00:02:23.210> in<00:02:23.390> duck

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
long as they go in the right direction

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.350 
long as they go in the right direction
you<00:02:41.060> pretty<00:02:41.330> much<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:42.110> two<00:02:42.350> or<00:02:42.620> three<00:02:42.890> star

ones<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.330> yeah<00:02:51.320> so<00:02:51.650> use<00:02:51.980> a<00:02:52.010> strategy<00:02:52.550> if<00:02:52.880> you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
ones so yeah so use a strategy if you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.990 
ones so yeah so use a strategy if you
come<00:02:53.270> across<00:02:53.740> something<00:02:54.740> that<00:02:54.980> has<00:02:55.130> lots<00:02:55.910> of

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
come across something that has lots of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.100 
come across something that has lots of
traps<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:57.350> know<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.830> you<00:02:57.950> feel<00:02:58.220> unsure<00:02:58.460> of

traps you know that you feel unsure of

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.530 
traps you know that you feel unsure of
and<00:03:00.110> hard<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.800> lower<00:03:01.010> heroes<00:03:01.610> which<00:03:01.880> with<00:03:02.420> the
