pattern I think you just take these two

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.310 
pattern I think you just take these two
things<00:04:29.740> for<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:29.980> one<00:04:30.310> higher<00:04:30.520> down<00:04:30.970> down<00:04:31.630> take

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
things for the one higher down down take

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.450 
things for the one higher down down take
that<00:04:32.470> off

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.530 

switch<00:04:38.270> down

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.879 

and<00:04:42.540> we<00:04:42.960> can<00:04:43.080> easier<00:04:43.410> for<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:43.860> don't
