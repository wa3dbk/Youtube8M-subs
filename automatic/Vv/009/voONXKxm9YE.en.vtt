00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
it's a good thing and the plants are

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's a good thing and the plants are
growing<00:01:37.020> really<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.590> well<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.970> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
growing really really well and that is a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
growing really really well and that is a
thing<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:40.110> can<00:01:40.229> also<00:01:40.350> add<00:01:40.650> co2<00:01:41.159> or

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
thing you can do you can also add co2 or

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.609 
thing you can do you can also add co2 or
have<00:01:42.049> basically<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.430> dirt<00:01:44.430> substrate<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:45.659> some

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
have basically a dirt substrate now some

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.319 
have basically a dirt substrate now some
people<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.549> don't<00:01:47.790> recommend<00:01:48.060> it

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
people do this but I don't recommend it

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.950 
people do this but I don't recommend it
because<00:01:48.600> it's<00:01:49.079> quite<00:01:49.729> messy

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
because it's quite messy

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.179 
because it's quite messy
so<00:01:51.960> either<00:01:52.560> co2<00:01:53.310> or<00:01:53.340> iron<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.210> fine<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:56.159> can

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so either co2 or iron is fine you can

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.160 
so either co2 or iron is fine you can
also<00:01:56.460> just<00:01:56.759> have<00:01:57.000> quite<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> lot<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> fish<00:01:57.899> and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
also just have quite a lot of fish and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830 
also just have quite a lot of fish and
they<00:01:58.350> will<00:01:58.579> release<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.640> lot<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.969> places<00:02:00.240> into

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
they will release a lot of places into

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.469 
they will release a lot of places into
the<00:02:00.960> water<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.530> give<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.920> find<00:02:02.189> some<00:02:02.479> good

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.529 
stuff so you see this point here in the
front<00:02:07.220> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> actually<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> same<00:02:09.179> plant

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
front this is actually the same plant

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.270 
front this is actually the same plant
that's<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.170> described<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.649> crazy

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
that's the one that described my crazy

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.300 
that's the one that described my crazy
here<00:02:11.580> it's<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.900> have<00:02:13.140> just<00:02:13.380> replanted<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.100> over

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
here it's I have just replanted it over

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.570 
here it's I have just replanted it over
there<00:02:14.690> for<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.930> month<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.400> has

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
there for about a month or so and it has

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.040 
there for about a month or so and it has
basically<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.560> completely<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:20.840> covered<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
basically just completely it covered the

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.290 
basically just completely it covered the
top<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.130> aquarium<00:02:23.340> which<00:02:23.819> looks<00:02:24.060> really

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
top of the aquarium which looks really

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.110 
top of the aquarium which looks really
really<00:02:24.510> cool<00:02:25.040> but<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.160> can<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.459> those<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
really cool but you can see those in the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.440 
really cool but you can see those in the
front<00:02:27.390> here<00:02:27.720> are<00:02:27.870> actually<00:02:28.170> turning

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
front here are actually turning

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.320 
front here are actually turning
extremely<00:02:30.450> small<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.110> dying<00:02:31.819> well<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:32.850> don't

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
extremely small and dying well I don't

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.120 
extremely small and dying well I don't
know<00:02:33.480> if<00:02:33.630> it's<00:02:33.750> dying<00:02:33.989> because<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.620> had<00:02:34.800> I

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
know if it's dying because it had I

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.630 
know if it's dying because it had I
think<00:02:35.819> this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.930> looks<00:02:37.170> like<00:02:37.430> it<00:02:38.430> has

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
think this is it looks like it has

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.050 
think this is it looks like it has
looked<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.180> this<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:40.440> about<00:02:40.970> three<00:02:41.970> weeks

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
looked like this for about three weeks

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.559 
looked like this for about three weeks
now

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
now

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.070 
now
and<00:02:43.010> they're<00:02:44.010> still<00:02:44.310> growing<00:02:44.459> great<00:02:44.959> you<00:02:45.959> can

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
and they're still growing great you can

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
great and yeah that is basically how I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
great and yeah that is basically how I
get<00:03:01.380> extreme<00:03:01.890> plant<00:03:02.250> growth<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:04.220> extreme

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
get extreme plant growth and extreme

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.970 
get extreme plant growth and extreme
plant<00:03:05.489> growth<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.940> mostly<00:03:06.390> for<00:03:06.810> stem<00:03:07.350> plants

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
plant growth is mostly for stem plants

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.750 
plant growth is mostly for stem plants
like<00:03:08.850> these<00:03:09.360> guys<00:03:09.690> or<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.890> big<00:03:11.160> ear<00:03:11.370> or

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
like these guys or the big ear or

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.940 
like these guys or the big ear or
something<00:03:12.360> like<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.870> is<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.350> stem<00:03:13.650> plant

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
something like that that is a stem plant

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.500 
something like that that is a stem plant
and<00:03:14.190> they<00:03:14.280> will<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:14.640> grow<00:03:14.850> really<00:03:15.239> really

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
and they will just grow really really

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.050 
and they will just grow really really
fast<00:03:15.870> with<00:03:16.079> iron<00:03:16.320> and<00:03:16.709> they're<00:03:17.280> also<00:03:17.549> some<00:03:17.940> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
fast with iron and they're also some of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.750 
fast with iron and they're also some of
them<00:03:18.209> will<00:03:18.360> get<00:03:18.540> red<00:03:19.049> colors<00:03:19.500> which<00:03:20.489> looks

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
them will get red colors which looks

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.030 
them will get red colors which looks
really<00:03:20.910> cool<00:03:21.360> but<00:03:22.350> that's<00:03:22.530> basically<00:03:22.950> all
