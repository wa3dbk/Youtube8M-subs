 speed 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.539

 but the camera compostela sorry 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.080
 attentively 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.770
 in them masistas because 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.629

 the one that supposedly the Alzheimer and once they give him a power I am here the sticks 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.819
 sad transformers 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.029
 either in buses or in desert 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.449
 and these gives them as well as basilica power themes 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:23.259
 so put us machines 

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:25.279
 i but low iva 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:28.279
 be able to monitor bible of adversities 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:30.719
 hockenheim 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.769
 he also wanted to see 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.859
 well yes they are the ailerons but 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.299
 it was like that a power like that is not the truth either but 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.180
 it was a situation was the power of the fabrics then of the staff of the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.959
 character 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.659
 per cent in the cartoon push-up according to this one there compete on this planet that 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.189
 I tell you I think it's faster speed planet 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.219
 and iberia square said that if it will be faster then I think they had to 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:03:00.680
 compete to win I do not know that something ma part of village something they are looking for 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:04.279
 then this event was flown faster 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.669
 nothing to see or what we are going to proceed to transform them very simple 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:14.489
 this quick comment on this precisely has very good detail of 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.969
 painting and that pleases me 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.939
 I know what we call figures today girls in 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:23.279
 very very well painted everything that voted fifth and sixth bean kevin 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.699
 because our economy is this paintings 

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:29.919
 very well painted track that pleases me very much 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:32.659
 aquino Acosta all the robot is very simple transformed into the figure 

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.659
 we open the doors to the sides 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.809
 i then lift the windshield 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.829
 until he does so as they listened 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.129
 i after that here the shoulders are separated 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:51.680
 sideways shock and this already you discover the head of 8 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.950
 what for the detail in the painting as I tell you the truth is that the figures 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.369
 now they are not so well painted and that's bad 

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:00.829
 the locker 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.749
 same as translucent plastic 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:05.979
 but they do not have the advantage as more figures now that they have left 

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:08.949
 lately they also have the classic behind that makes between 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.139
 the light and reflected in front of these scares this one does not have 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.829
 but what the painting does makes up for everything the truth from my point 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:16.669
 of sight 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.120
 it will become a little bit the camera 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.550
 now what we do that separate 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.770
 that after the aspenns poplars is already 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.590
 this afternoon here at 360 degrees then to the right or to the 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.110
 left with you want 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.020
 sorry it is that he erred he gets very crazy this the signings of benítez 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.220
 the upper area is not upwards 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:40.969
 perfect 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.969
 then let me raise little matagalpa 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.759
 this artist feet down 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.669
 2 climb 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.599
 since it was not 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.110
 we separate 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.270
 and carver 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.499
 tom little and a half country 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:58.610
 perfect 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:59.849
 we have a 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:04.360
 jorge oteiza everton articulation customs articulations the truth

 I go I did in the elbows include the 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:10.270
 in the things in the waist 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.490
 then the hip then that gives the figure a very good chance 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.939
 volcanoes in that part are not very delicate as 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:22.019
 what are the new bulls that also jealous of my mind to say an example 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:23.910
 this 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.470
 Well then this if you go everywhere 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.460
 and that as I said to them very good possibility 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.759
 same here the shoulders this part turns up and down

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.849
 put it as move it then prefer to leave it in that part but I do not know 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.759
