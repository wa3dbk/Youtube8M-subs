00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
color and I'm just taping off random

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.750 
color and I'm just taping off random
triangles<00:00:33.540> across<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.200> nails<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.760> painting

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
triangles across the nails and painting

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.670 
triangles across the nails and painting
two<00:00:36.090> coats<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.570> light<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.110> looks<00:00:37.290> nice<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
two coats of light to looks nice and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.209 
two coats of light to looks nice and
opaque<00:00:37.980> um<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.350> keep<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.710> triangles

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
opaque um I like to keep the triangles

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.240 
opaque um I like to keep the triangles
different<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.120> each<00:00:42.300> nail<00:00:42.570> because<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.320> makes

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
different on each nail because it makes

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.330 
different on each nail because it makes
it<00:00:44.460> look<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> bit<00:00:44.910> more<00:00:44.940> abstract<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.680> guess

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
it look a bit more abstract and I guess

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.890 
it look a bit more abstract and I guess
a<00:00:47.579> bit<00:00:47.910> more<00:00:48.390> wild

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:50.900 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:56.970 

you

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.530 

you

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.900 

after<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.720> remove<00:01:05.050> the<00:01:05.200> tape<00:01:05.440> go<00:01:06.130> in<00:01:06.340> with<00:01:06.670> a

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
after you remove the tape go in with a

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.630 
after you remove the tape go in with a
toothpick<00:01:07.420> or<00:01:07.840> I'm<00:01:08.740> using<00:01:08.980> an<00:01:09.220> orange<00:01:09.520> stick

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
toothpick or I'm using an orange stick

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
toothpick or I'm using an orange stick
to<00:01:10.270> create<00:01:11.080> your<00:01:11.110> own<00:01:11.380> leopard<00:01:11.890> pattern<00:01:12.660> you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
to create your own leopard pattern you

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.770 
to create your own leopard pattern you
can<00:01:14.050> be<00:01:14.410> really<00:01:14.830> random<00:01:15.070> with<00:01:15.490> this<00:01:15.760> and<00:01:16.060> just

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
can be really random with this and just

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.860 
can be really random with this and just
consist<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:18.010> bunch<00:01:18.550> of<00:01:18.730> see<00:01:19.180> shapes<00:01:19.510> and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
consist of a bunch of see shapes and

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.090 
consist of a bunch of see shapes and
backwards<00:01:20.800> see<00:01:20.980> shapes<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.610> brackets<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
backwards see shapes and brackets and

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:46.750 
backwards see shapes and brackets and
random<00:01:24.100> spots

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:56.650 

I

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.360 

next<00:01:57.660> go<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.770> color<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.340> you

00:01:59.360 --> 00:01:59.370 
next go in with the color that you

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.270 
next go in with the color that you
originally<00:02:00.120> painted<00:02:00.330> an<00:02:00.630> outlet<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.230> fill<00:02:02.160> in

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
originally painted an outlet and fill in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:20.410 
originally painted an outlet and fill in
some<00:02:02.550> of<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:03.210> bracket<00:02:03.780> shapes

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.930 

now<00:02:21.080> i'm<00:02:21.319> just<00:02:21.530> using<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:22.160> silver<00:02:22.670> glitter

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
now i'm just using a silver glitter

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.460 
now i'm just using a silver glitter
striper<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:24.410> outline<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.280> pattern<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.470> i'm

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
striper to outline my pattern and i'm

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.320 
striper to outline my pattern and i'm
also<00:02:27.709> extending<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.489> line<00:02:28.700> all<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.030> way

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
also extending the line all the way

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.620 
also extending the line all the way
across<00:02:29.569> so<00:02:30.080> that<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.560> gives<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:31.010> nice<00:02:31.730> circline

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
across so that it gives a nice circline

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:46.300 
across so that it gives a nice circline
effect

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.930 

step<00:02:47.150> is<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:48.050> seal<00:02:48.950> in<00:02:49.130> your<00:02:49.160> design<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.910> a
