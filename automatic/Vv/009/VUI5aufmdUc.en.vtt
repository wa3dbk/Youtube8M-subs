 make green-black of a screen for the Mac specifically now 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:15.809
 Unique Users say it can be useful cases in Excel Word offers so many 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.779
 possibilities 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.339
 that means too many possibilities but actually enough possibilities that one 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.429
 nothing else needed Tomsic screenshots from his screens 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.909
 take 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:29.119
 jok earned keyboard shortcut Shift April and 3 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.480
 so you just take a screenshot of the complete picture which then 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.490
 also your percent 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.070

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.109
 Hommel Shift 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:39.570
 apple or com Arndt and 30 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.720
 there is no point in taking a screenshot 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.770
 From the screen ran in the end two screens because I have one now 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.720
 second strength in Deutschkreutz leaves 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.300
 we're here short of your complete screen 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 without problems in school quality 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.810
 there is to remember 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.340
 SID what now but if you have not saved the whole thing but just 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.270
 would like to pack in the clipboard 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.470
 also no problem 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.550
 then we just take 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.450
 Comarch or apple 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.370
 Hugging signature deduction 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.500
 one of corn is 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 you yourself key basically 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.689

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.400
 the TTR Rheine 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.350
 round 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.890
 like the reefer made in the clipboard removals because they 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.640
 reversed world for a short time 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.790
 the programs trial field 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.719
 insert 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.299
 In the past we now have the screenshot in the clipboard and that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.410
 becomes so necessary he will this year from the desktop 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.210
 Percent 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.970
 But what if I had to be the partner so that means she feels 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.240
 the complete map complete the screen and then their sequence 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 Percent later 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.760
 who have to strap everything out 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.580
 Also for that miss miss combination 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.690
 come on Arndt 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:48.940
 we are here now 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.160
 bell bright areas were crosshairs I hope that they can 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.140
 the recording 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.000
 and because Köls select which area should be photographed 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.210
 and just show new Schultes okay 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.530
 Percent I have here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.670
 KNA external hard drive with order 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.650
 save a terabyte 4 though still lead 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.250
 Marc Adam area and became extent Kühn show of exactly this area 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.549
 created 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.150
 Without that big other things must stay calm also Center Parcs 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.569
 is turning 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.469
 the name the possibility 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.749
 Percent shift 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.949
 Dr Coma did not make it 

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:27.119
 4 and if he is now 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.450
 Press space then everything will be 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.999
 more or less 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.459
 The list of examples for the Internet is grouped by itself 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.349
 Screen as he is alone 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.369
 can lead to eggs or lead Euro status bar alone 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:45.279
 we can talk about status bar alone individually alone 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 and that his then become this 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.709
 now he has taken a screenshot only of the lower one was own without 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:53.649
 background 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.579
 that means they have to look at the slideshow as well 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.519
 bit outside 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.200
 this is called Amy 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.659
 to be able to work the world 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.559
 really handy for me 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:05.559
 and last but not least there is the possibility to 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.079
 because alerted all the track windows functions as alerts 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:12.909
 come on Arndt 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.909
 and 11 4 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:19.859
 that would have to be around 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.249
 Vienna looks Merle less 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.109
 everywhere have led all individual window cleaners 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.829
 however, it comes down to a native four he was used differently 45 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:29.629
 hurt 4 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.269
 is she at Meteo Richards and thus percentage points the whole is not me 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.429
 can still be busy in March 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.479
 around 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.519
 and Roman Tomanek 4 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.529
 and that fits always earlier with this long-distance goal Aachen from photographing 

00:03:43.529 --> 00:03:45.819
 I exactly this window 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.299
 Photographed medium is stored 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.809
 So people often say you do not have to spend money on unnecessary software 

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:55.939
 You do not have to try this on the internet either 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.879
 Even Rohde Apple offers the percent ideal opportunities for new wave 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.659
 Screenshots or record 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.829
 and percent directly more or less percent to use as a graphic 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:07.319
 I believe that many people drive 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.529
 Percent maybe mainly for new mac users 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:13.269
 Percent but maybe also for the people that men use that 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.199
 did not know yet 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:17.439
 I myself knew that he was looking for a possibility of complete screen 

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.449
 I did not know yet that it could record individual areas 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.190
 So as I said if you have questions then through these we see each other 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.669
 Write to us until next time and believe
