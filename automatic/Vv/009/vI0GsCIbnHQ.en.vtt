00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 guzmán presenting his album the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.550
 initiative like this is good first of all 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.099
 thank you for being here in this 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.139
 my third album the second one in studio already 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.250
 as a producer as an arranger 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.710
 happy excited and happy babe disco 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:23.039
 first of being in the videos videos in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.529
 social networks today in front of cameras 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.820
 good as you say your third album and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.680
 videos also as a composer 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.090
 tell us a little about this good album 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.790
 it has been an experience a learning 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.649
 during these years that are almost three 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.180
 may be few but I think they are the 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.590
 most important for a new artist 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.500
 because it's where you stumble 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.390
 where you learn now as a composer 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.070
 a few years ago I felt sorry 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.050
 afraid to fear or show what I could 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.640
 feel now we could already record it in a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.670
 disco I'm super happy that I 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.379
 have left the office they have given me the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.420
 trust to bring my material I have already 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
 done and present it before my team 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 who has always trusted me my 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.649
 label of records 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.149
 well happy very grateful to all 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.980
 with my family with the label that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.480
 has always been supporting me with the 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.170
 public with you who are here 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.560
 lending of his time tonight and then 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.200
 I can say very happy if you did not go or 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.909
 you are but rather you were one of the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 first women who dared to sing 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.600
 narcocorridos or being in a genre where 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.030
 there is a lot of competition but in men 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 not death if the truth is something that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.409
 brand has marked my life because from there 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.450
 was born guzmán babe to sing a cover of 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.600
 a run of one of my classmates a 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.090
 young very successful that I think is 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.220
 known today very much gerardo 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.500
 ortiz I sing your cover and good thank you 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.450
 to that cover to which artists that 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.960
 belong to my label as a regulator 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.399
 expensive as he saw me I think he is 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.289
 something that has marked then could not not 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.360
 We could forget even though we already 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.940
 we have known our audience that is 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.170
 feminist that is the one that is struck 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.909
 with the songs as I declare the 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.920
 war like the intruder right now 60 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.729
 seconds that we are promoting 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.920
 there are always people who will remember us 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.450
 by how we were born that are the corridos and 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.729
 also in this album comes a balance 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.289
 comes what is half band half 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.030
 northern but we do not forget that 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.619
 public that knew us by the corridos 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.870
 and me personally I love me 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.579
 love to sing a corrido but also 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.799
 you bring a very moving song that 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:18.260
 learners to public media 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.450
 communication a cumbia like this we are encouraged 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.670
 we wanted something new and this album was 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.170
 totally that balance we needed to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.760
 I was sorry because my 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.540
 personality is always very serious shy 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.989
 perhaps 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.900
 and so do not come baby like that girl but 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.849
 in this fact we wanted to give everything a turn 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.620
 the 60-second song as it shows 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.049
 a very strong woman independent and 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.750
 hurt but very very sure that it is a 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.400
 ultimatum in the your sweetheart good to a 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.400
 funny girl a funny woman who 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.689
 dances and good is one is something for 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.159
 change a bit to what we had 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.450
 done previously 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.510
 Well, also three songs from 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.579
 this alex rivera among other good 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.189
 composers that's the way it's looking 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.420
 les javier javier is released that giovanni 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.519
 cabrera that was product in the first 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 disco I'm very happy and well in 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.250
 new composers in the air in their 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.260
 airs that also belongs to the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.970
 new composers company we gave him the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.169
 opportunity too and I'm fine 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.930
 happy because I think this album does not 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:15.530
 have a song that can jump today 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.959
 this and finally the absent of the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.000
 night we have not seen much in the 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.319
 social networks that study or put 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.590
 photos of him 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.880
 martín that past rumored around there 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.280
 bad tongues that they thundered 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.740
 we are only each one working 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.390
 in theirs people form an idea of 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.180
 a perfect couple maybe we are not 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.040
 we are an ordinary couple with everything not 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.360
 also sometimes it is distanced in 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.770
 this case for work he has been 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480
 working on your initiative and I'm 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.730
 working on mine and for the moment not 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.950
 We have been able to see each other a lot but we are 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.600
 together he still supports from the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.100
 distance then the project tonight I 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.230
 I would have loved it if he were here 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.180
 could because he's also working and in 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.680
 its time they will know all that is not 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.290
 if we have been a little distant but 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.060
 together at the end of the day we talked about how 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.530
 it went to you how it went and I think he is 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.640
 very happy tonight or will the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.840
 very happy time when I tell you what 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.310
 you were here because they are 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.560
 people who have interviewed us together 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.420
 they have seen us together and it does not happen 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.740
 nothing is simply a stage where no 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.970
 we can be together because of 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.600
 work and but everything is fine 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.850
 then all clear have not broken no no 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.220
 not yet 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.110
 in the past months we have seen some 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.020
 some pictures of him that you are 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.210
 painting the nails some pictures of him in 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.910
 even in heels 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.410
 if we have always been a very couple 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.699
 fun and we play a lot like you 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.860
 mentioned we have not had opportunity to 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.840
 being together has done and on time 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.310
 but good is part of the work is part 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.110
 of this relationship that is very difficult to 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.910
 that we from the beginning what 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.349
 we accept so that it was going to be hard 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.360
 even something that I do not forget that he 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.160
 mentioned I do not know if we are going to know how to take 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.410
 the ship that was one of the things that 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.360
 we talked the first day I was declaring 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.979
 and yes it has been very difficult but it has also 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.169
 been a relationship that has fun 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.520
 a lot in when shown together that 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.580
 we have learned a lot both and that has 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.820
 there was a lot of support for the questions to 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.639
 this is said is said out there that is 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.610
 martín came out of caliber 50 because a 

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:11.979
 rumor because dente threw the dogs 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.199
 to you not at all in fact I in fact to 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.539
 the first person known caliber 50 

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:18.550
 was of is a person that every I 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:20.830
 who greets me like this is nothing but not 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.539
 Until then we never became friends or 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.460
 There is how you have gone to talk 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:26.650
 We respect each other with great respect 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.940
 but not for nothing did not come out that's why he 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.699
 I already had his concern to do his 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:33.249
 project I support it and I still stand 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.019
 waiting for your project to come out 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:37.929
