using<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> iphone<00:02:23.879> as<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> comparison<00:02:24.540> i<00:02:24.930> do

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.589 
using the iphone as a comparison i do
realize<00:02:25.349> that<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.489> blackberry<00:02:26.970> storm<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.390> new

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
realize that the blackberry storm is new

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.750 
realize that the blackberry storm is new
the<00:02:28.049> iphone<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.829> its<00:02:29.010> second<00:02:29.489> generation

the iphone is in its second generation

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.930 
the iphone is in its second generation
so<00:02:30.540> might<00:02:31.290> not<00:02:31.470> be<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.799> fairest<00:02:32.129> comparison

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
so might not be the fairest comparison

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.850 
so might not be the fairest comparison
but<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.720> still<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.170> comparison<00:02:34.709> i'm

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
but that's still the comparison i'm

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.720 
but that's still the comparison i'm
going<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.190> use<00:02:35.780> also<00:02:36.780> on<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.409> iphone<00:02:37.860> going

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
which is in second generation so might

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.460 
which is in second generation so might
not<00:06:02.010> be<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.340> fairest<00:06:02.640> comparison<00:06:03.450> but<00:06:03.750> when

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
not be the fairest comparison but when

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.190 
not be the fairest comparison but when
you<00:06:04.650> still<00:06:05.010> step<00:06:05.430> out<00:06:05.670> onto<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.690> marketplace
