00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:20.029
 always the padilla command shows it if 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.949
 you love her and in the venues in others 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.380
 I do not know want to point out that some of 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.300
 you like to buy the boxes these 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.189
 and then I will teach the next one 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.869
 what's coming so you can see that 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.079
 really the price that they have that are 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:36.120
 995 I believe that my 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.470
 code that is aesthetic 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.380
 the truth that impressed me first 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.850
 the weight so I weighed a lot and I say 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:48.400
 that brings here a hip area of and good 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.340
 Well, it does not raise it, because if not everything 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.770
 It is valid and comes as usual with the card 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:58.050
 is where all the products come from 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.050
 that brings and others and good 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.100
 the first thing that taught me that the truth 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.970
 which is also super good for those who 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.950
 we cook and another kitchen is worth a salt 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.799
 to bake a kitchen salt 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.020
 hernandez and they know it huge and good this 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.320
 is used for one if you want to do 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.180
 some fish baked and what I do the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.649
 recipe 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.680
 in such a way comes here a little book that 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.960
 here come several recipes where you can 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.970
 use and know how it is used but 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 well I tell you what I use it for 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.960
 for example in sea bass or sea bream what 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.700
 What I do is put the salt in the lame 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.460
 aluminum tray 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.920
 below and I put a capital as a 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.350
 little bed of salt of this salt I put the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.880
 sea ​​bass or sea bream to whatever you want 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 do or any fish is what I do 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.039
 that or the logo itself you can also 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.830
 make an equal tenderloin and put it on top and 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.600
 then with the rest of the salt you cover it 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.750
 whole vale among others that does not look 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.260
 nothing and if you do fish or do it and 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.810
 you put it in the oven for 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.430
 I put it 20 minutes you put the top 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.440
 and down to be done by the two 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.090
 sides and then later when you 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.330
 off and the oven is created as a 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.770
 kind of crust that is the salt 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 remove that scab and if for example if 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.130
 is the sea bass 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.280
 it really is great is a kind 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.680
 of how to steamed fish and is super 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.660
 good and it is already done in a moment and 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.550
 if it is the back of the ones that must be left 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.460
 so take the shoulder you put it in a 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.170
 place it into slices and then 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.900
 Then you put it in a container and 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.330
 you put a capital of loin slices 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.480
 unusual oil until well up 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.250
 completely cover it with the oil that 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.680
 recipe you put it in the m &amp; t in the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.080
 refrigerator and they last a long time 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.700
 it's a very easy tenderloin I'm here 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.920
 doing the times but that is like 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.230
 more like this one that austro like cardinal 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.540
 pz and I think it's a good way to 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.580
 know how this salt is used as it is 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 just cover with oil what they put in the 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.420
 refrigerator and they last a long time 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.590
 because because oil makes the loin 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.450
 I dont know 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.269
 do not spoil what when you go to 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.250
 to consume it is to cover the slices 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.900
 It cost mail and it's super super good 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.379
 then I think it's a super thing 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.379
 practice 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.010
 is worth another of the thing the things that 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.290
 come what good I thought the 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.640
 true that are the qualities these are 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.100
 to try things that do not 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.690
 we usually try it on a lot of 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.690
 live in a lot of infusions 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:41.390
 tells me the pile of red 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:46.370
 melissa and also herbal inclusion stack 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:50.490
 black tea brand montecelo 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.440
 a lot of them come singles and 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.550
 good still does not use any tea 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.410
 green 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.850
 even the dance 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:06.130
 and this one comes from having 20 greens and it's 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.080
 of the case that does not have a lot of them 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:13.690
 then it comes also is to have two 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.680
 Nail polishes worth of the ego brand 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.989
 this is black 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:23.350
 and this is therefore the most normal for 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.350
 parties have a sort as well as 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.350
 half 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.319
 are a few months of great 16,000 kilos 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.550
 making it permanent that I already have 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:42.229
 uploaded the tutorial I did not make the video 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.229
 to eat audio 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.750
 good also comes in this broth of 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.580
 Christmas chicken broth I do not think 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.229
 puts 100% 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.330
 I the truth that these wines do not 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.099
 I use not bought them I do them here 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.810
 only because I like them but good 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.550
 for a hurry, it's always good 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.940
 also try some things and have them 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:04.350
 there in the pantry 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:09.020
 and this is what I like the most 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:11.660
 and well this also comes is a 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.550
 a bit of the novel the man in the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.200
 forgetfulness is worth so that one 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.440
 so that we also with Let's Hook 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.969
 such 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:25.339
 try to search if I did not like it 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:28.669
 and well, life and that's why I've 

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:30.799
 used it did not use clear us 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:33.049
 use not the food I have not eaten 

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:34.339
 but now the last thing that comes to me 

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.789
 love that everything I like most about 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.789
 the carlos iii 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.799
 and that we have also tried because 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:44.719
 I was waiting in the video to wait 

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:46.479
 that the video are these chocolates of the 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:49.479
 widow 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.479
 4 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:54.020
 and then also this is super 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.320
 good that this proved that these are 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.600
 mikado sticks coming 2 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.100
 It's worth with dark chocolate 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.880
 They are sticks that have covers 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.820
 chocolate 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.860
 and well we do not have to talk to you because 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.110
 Now I 'm going to put this little figurine 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.129
 Christmas to be put on the tree 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.110
 that also super nice 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.580
 and well I know what comes in the box 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.500
 light 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.500
 it's pretty practical, well cut 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.720
 it's like when we have to make a 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.760
 gift that as you do not know what they are going to 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.250
 give away because it's the same for you to say 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.840
 I think that comes to us because they are because 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.430
 as you do not know what will come can 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.590
 do other industries and so on that are 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.600
 things that at least I see the armpits 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.750
 or hair but for example, 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.850
 infusions this never has me either 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.300
 the logical thing because I have not either 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.879
 seen but good that seems 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.770
 to try it and that's super good and the 

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:52.919
 outside broth I do not buy it but neither 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:55.940
 I have not seen either a has trouble in the 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.940
 Pantry needs it 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.479
 many thanks 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.690
 and well, that's what comes in the 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.699
 box of these previous samples of 

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.039
 December you know my link I put it 

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:09.780
