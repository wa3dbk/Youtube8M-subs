trees let me show it what's done in that
what<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.239> they<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.780> an<00:00:36.989> armature

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
what you have is they have an armature

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.170 
what you have is they have an armature
is<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.040> stick<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.309> size<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.820> machines

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is like this stick and size all machines

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.240 
is like this stick and size all machines
for<00:00:39.390> trees

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
for trees

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.439 
for trees
so<00:00:41.250> what<00:00:41.609> you<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.239> you're<00:00:42.359> going

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449 
so what you have to do is you're going

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.569 
so what you have to do is you're going
to<00:00:42.510> take<00:00:42.690> these<00:00:42.809> armatures<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.530> you've<00:00:44.429> got<00:00:44.550> a

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
to take these armatures and you've got a

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.720 
to take these armatures and you've got a
pen<00:00:44.820> them<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:46.739> they<00:00:46.890> treat<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.309> they're<00:00:47.489> flat

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
pen them so they treat like they're flat

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.849 
pen them so they treat like they're flat
to<00:00:47.940> start<00:00:48.179> off<00:00:48.300> with<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.260> bend<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.679> that

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
to start off with you bend them so that

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.549 
to start off with you bend them so that
you<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.190> like<00:00:50.219> this<00:00:50.929> twist<00:00:51.929> that<00:00:52.109> armature

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
you like like this twist that armature

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:02.080 
you like like this twist that armature
around<00:00:55.100> get<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.579> three-dimensional

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.229 

and<00:01:02.750> then<00:01:02.870> use<00:01:03.170> your<00:01:03.200> hobby<00:01:03.500> tack<00:01:04.030> that's<00:01:05.030> a

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
really well get really really sticky did

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.760 
really well get really really sticky did
a<00:01:41.119> good<00:01:41.300> tack<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.290> what<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:42.470> do<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.680> you

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
a good tack to it so what you do is you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.230 
a good tack to it so what you do is you
apply<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.010> glue<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.250> inside<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.850> side<00:01:44.030> for

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
apply the glue to inside of the side for

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.480 
apply the glue to inside of the side for
maybe<00:01:44.390> 10-15<00:01:44.960> minutes<00:01:45.229> when<00:01:45.860> you<00:01:45.950> check<00:01:46.160> on<00:01:46.369> it

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
maybe 10-15 minutes when you check on it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.430 
maybe 10-15 minutes when you check on it
but<00:01:46.850> that's<00:01:47.390> Hobby<00:01:47.660> jack<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:48.260> the

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
but that's Hobby jack and that's the

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.609 
but that's Hobby jack and that's the
best<00:01:48.560> stuff<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:49.010> really<00:01:49.100> works<00:01:49.340> well<00:01:49.550> so

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
best stuff that really works well so

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.590 
best stuff that really works well so
while<00:01:51.619> we<00:01:51.710> sent<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:52.070> tree<00:01:52.250> aside<00:01:55.330> we<00:01:56.330> wanted

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
while we sent that tree aside we wanted

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.390 
while we sent that tree aside we wanted
to<00:01:56.660> show<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:56.840> a<00:01:56.930> couple<00:01:57.110> more<00:01:57.229> things<00:01:57.530> you

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.150 
have a nice shell here on your diagram
on<00:02:00.530> what<00:02:00.650> you<00:02:00.740> do<00:02:00.830> is<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:01.009> poke<00:02:01.160> a<00:02:01.190> hole<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.430> it

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
on what you do is you poke a hole in it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.340 
on what you do is you poke a hole in it
so<00:02:04.160> you<00:02:04.250> treat<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:07.990> put<00:02:08.990> it<00:02:09.080> out<00:02:09.200> of

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
so you treat like that put it out of

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:18.020 
so you treat like that put it out of
glue<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.649> there

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.020 

now<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.530> had<00:02:20.530> prepared<00:02:20.980> already<00:02:21.519> prepared<00:02:21.879> an

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
now I had prepared already prepared an

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.270 
now I had prepared already prepared an
armature<00:02:22.299> for<00:02:22.599> retrieve<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.260> little<00:02:23.950> while<00:02:24.069> ago

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
armature for retrieve a little while ago

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.559 
armature for retrieve a little while ago
and<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.700> starting<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.239> pretty<00:02:25.360> good

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
and it's starting to get a pretty good

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.339 
and it's starting to get a pretty good
tack<00:02:25.840> -<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.349> a<00:02:26.500> weasel<00:02:26.709> stick<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.310> nice

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
tack - it's a weasel stick to it nice

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.470 
tack - it's a weasel stick to it nice
did<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.379> take<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.680> foliage<00:02:29.950> material<00:02:30.480> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
did you take the foliage material and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.839 
did you take the foliage material and
you<00:02:31.569> just<00:02:31.750> put<00:02:31.840> the<00:02:31.930> tree<00:02:32.110> right<00:02:32.260> in<00:02:32.290> there<00:02:38.849> you

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:39.849 
you just put the tree right in there you

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.490 
you just put the tree right in there you
see<00:02:40.000> how<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.180> foliage<00:02:40.750> is<00:02:40.930> starting<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.290> stick

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
see how the foliage is starting to stick

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.479 
see how the foliage is starting to stick
to<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.769> just<00:02:42.129> like<00:02:42.220> that

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
to it just like that

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.910 
to it just like that
now<00:02:43.060> one<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.870> things<00:02:44.049> about<00:02:44.140> trees<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.680> I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
now one of the things about trees is I

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.100 
now one of the things about trees is I
like<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.489> do<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.000> looks<00:02:46.030> better<00:02:46.390> because

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
like to do and it looks better because

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.890 
like to do and it looks better because
if<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.379> use<00:02:47.530> more<00:02:47.769> than<00:02:47.890> one<00:02:48.069> color<00:02:48.099> foliage

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
if you use more than one color foliage

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.500 
if you use more than one color foliage
so<00:02:49.900> mix<00:02:50.379> that<00:02:50.470> up<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.730> wooden<00:02:51.910> teeth<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
so mix that up and the wooden teeth it

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.309 
so mix that up and the wooden teeth it
comes<00:02:52.750> with<00:02:52.900> a<00:02:52.930> variety<00:02:53.079> of<00:02:53.440> foliage<00:02:53.769> colors

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
comes with a variety of foliage colors

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:05.490 
comes with a variety of foliage colors
just<00:02:56.319> dump<00:02:56.620> that<00:02:56.739> in<00:02:56.920> there<00:02:59.760> good<00:03:04.470> get<00:03:05.470> a

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
just dump that in there good get a

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.009 
just dump that in there good get a
couple<00:03:05.709> of<00:03:05.799> different<00:03:06.069> colors<00:03:06.370> on<00:03:06.489> that<00:03:07.019> touch

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
couple of different colors on that touch

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:17.099 
couple of different colors on that touch

it up a little bit and there we go we
got<00:03:17.260> our<00:03:17.290> first<00:03:17.560> tree<00:03:18.090> now<00:03:19.090> I'm<00:03:19.269> just<00:03:19.390> doing

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
got our first tree now I'm just doing

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.270 
got our first tree now I'm just doing
this<00:03:19.750> quick<00:03:20.049> but<00:03:20.319> you'll<00:03:20.859> want<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.069> take<00:03:21.220> your

time take a good look at it again I seek

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.710 
time take a good look at it again I seek
to<00:03:23.739> that<00:03:23.889> tree<00:03:24.099> where<00:03:24.340> I<00:03:24.370> want<00:03:24.669> you<00:03:25.299> take<00:03:25.510> that

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
to that tree where I want you take that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.680 
to that tree where I want you take that
and<00:03:26.650> you<00:03:26.709> place<00:03:26.980> it<00:03:27.160> right<00:03:28.150> in<00:03:28.329> the<00:03:28.419> hole<00:03:28.450> you

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
process put a little bit of ground cover

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.619 
process put a little bit of ground cover
around<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:43.970> blue<00:03:44.150> even<00:03:44.390> though<00:03:44.540> the

about these homages - they're a nice
soft<00:03:56.150> plastic<00:03:56.599> you<00:03:56.720> can<00:03:56.930> cut<00:03:57.080> this<00:03:57.200> in<00:03:57.380> half

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
soft plastic you can cut this in half

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.140 
soft plastic you can cut this in half
-<00:03:57.830> I<00:03:57.890> like<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.160> smaller<00:03:58.400> tree<00:03:58.670> you<00:03:58.790> can<00:03:58.910> cut<00:03:59.060> up

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
- I like the smaller tree you can cut up

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.120 
- I like the smaller tree you can cut up
some<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.330> the<00:03:59.420> branches<00:03:59.630> just<00:04:00.530> at<00:04:00.650> any<00:04:00.769> way<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
some of the branches just at any way you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.280 
some of the branches just at any way you
want<00:04:01.370> would<00:04:02.209> be<00:04:02.269> a<00:04:02.330> lot<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.480> fun<00:04:02.660> so<00:04:02.840> I'm<00:04:03.140> gonna

at<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.220> looks<00:04:16.459> pretty<00:04:16.579> good<00:04:17.109> important

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
at that looks pretty good important

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.319 
at that looks pretty good important
thing<00:04:18.260> about<00:04:18.350> trees<00:04:18.979> like<00:04:19.160> this<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:20.150> want

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
thing about trees like this is you want

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.030 
thing about trees like this is you want
to<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.870> little<00:04:20.989> bit<00:04:21.169> of<00:04:21.229> variety<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.709> size

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
to have a little bit of variety and size

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.920 
to have a little bit of variety and size
of<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:22.550> trees<00:04:22.820> and<00:04:23.060> a<00:04:23.419> little<00:04:23.600> bit<00:04:23.690> of<00:04:23.780> variety

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
of the trees and a little bit of variety

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.659 
of the trees and a little bit of variety
in<00:04:24.139> tension<00:04:24.530> of<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.770> trees<00:04:24.979> and<00:04:25.160> if<00:04:25.490> you'll

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
in tension of the trees and if you'll

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.879 
in tension of the trees and if you'll
notice<00:04:25.850> this<00:04:26.090> tree<00:04:26.360> here<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.930> use<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> different

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
notice this tree here I use a different

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.080 
notice this tree here I use a different
type<00:04:28.010> of<00:04:28.040> material<00:04:28.250> I<00:04:28.669> get<00:04:28.820> this<00:04:28.910> material

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
type of material I get this material

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.300 
type of material I get this material
this<00:04:29.930> is<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.229> packing<00:04:30.650> material<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.160> got

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
this is like a packing material I got

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.610 
this is like a packing material I got
out<00:04:31.400> of<00:04:31.430> a<00:04:31.970> box<00:04:32.750> of<00:04:32.990> something<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.410> was

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
out of a box of something that was

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.800 
out of a box of something that was
shipped<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.880> this<00:04:35.090> is<00:04:35.210> quite<00:04:35.600> different

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
shipped and so this is quite different

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.960 
shipped and so this is quite different
but<00:04:36.050> I<00:04:36.110> plucked<00:04:36.380> some<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.770> off<00:04:37.010> and<00:04:37.280> I'm

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
but I plucked some of this off and I'm

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.640 
but I plucked some of this off and I'm
putting<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.660> one<00:04:38.900> of<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.080> arms<00:04:39.229> just<00:04:39.530> with

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
putting it in one of the arms just with

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.080 
putting it in one of the arms just with
the<00:04:39.740> tree<00:04:39.889> so<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.400> point<00:04:40.610> there<00:04:40.760> is<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.970> be

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
the tree so the point there is to be

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.360 
the tree so the point there is to be
flexible<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:42.470> use<00:04:42.590> lots<00:04:42.770> of<00:04:42.889> materials

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
flexible you can use lots of materials

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.219 
flexible you can use lots of materials
you<00:04:43.910> could<00:04:44.060> even<00:04:44.210> make<00:04:44.330> your<00:04:44.600> own<00:04:44.660> trees<00:04:45.050> if

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
you could even make your own trees if

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.659 
you could even make your own trees if
you<00:04:45.350> wanted<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.740> see<00:04:45.919> homages<00:04:46.310> using

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
you wanted to see homages using

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:47.980 
you wanted to see homages using
different<00:04:46.940> kinds<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.270> wire<00:04:47.450> where<00:04:47.720> you<00:04:47.810> can

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
different kinds of wire where you can

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.650 
different kinds of wire where you can
shape<00:04:48.229> that<00:04:48.410> into<00:04:48.650> a<00:04:48.680> tree<00:04:48.979> and<00:04:49.400> I<00:04:49.880> would<00:04:50.360> I

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
shape that into a tree and I would I

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.740 
shape that into a tree and I would I
wouldn't<00:04:51.260> use<00:04:51.700> the<00:04:52.700> red<00:04:52.850> and<00:04:52.970> black<00:04:53.210> like<00:04:53.539> this

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
wouldn't use the red and black like this

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.129 
wouldn't use the red and black like this
I<00:04:53.960> would<00:04:54.590> use<00:04:54.800> maybe<00:04:55.100> a<00:04:55.250> bare<00:04:55.550> copper<00:04:55.850> wire<00:04:56.139> so

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
I would use maybe a bare copper wire so

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.700 
I would use maybe a bare copper wire so
it's<00:04:57.350> more<00:04:57.560> read<00:04:58.430> like<00:04:58.700> in<00:04:59.600> color<00:04:59.990> but<00:05:00.470> you

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
it's more read like in color but you

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.529 
it's more read like in color but you
could<00:05:00.950> always<00:05:01.070> whatever<00:05:01.760> you<00:05:01.940> use<00:05:02.180> you<00:05:02.419> could

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
could always whatever you use you could

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.980 
could always whatever you use you could
always<00:05:02.660> just<00:05:02.840> paint<00:05:03.260> it<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:04.630> that's<00:05:05.630> obviously

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
always just paint it so that's obviously

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.659 
always just paint it so that's obviously
I<00:05:06.470> think<00:05:06.620> that<00:05:06.889> cover<00:05:07.070> just<00:05:07.220> about<00:05:07.340> everything

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
I think that cover just about everything

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.159 
I think that cover just about everything
as<00:05:07.880> far<00:05:08.060> as<00:05:08.210> that<00:05:08.360> goes<00:05:08.419> making<00:05:08.930> your<00:05:09.050> little

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
as far as that goes making your little

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.379 
as far as that goes making your little
trees<00:05:09.440> in<00:05:09.620> your<00:05:09.650> bushes<00:05:09.889> um<00:05:10.370> I<00:05:10.820> wanted<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.210> say

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:11.389 
trees in your bushes um I wanted to say
