00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:10.208
 Your brain is a very amazing machine, a network consisting of about 86 billion neurons 

00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:15.927
 The researchers predicted that if we compared it to the computer it would be capable of more than a billion processes 

00:00:15.927 --> 00:00:17.288
 Every second. 

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:24.288
 But he is so wrong that we hate to admit it, we are just human beings. 

00:00:24.338 --> 00:00:29.168
 Cognitive biases are mental shortcuts that we take when we process information 

00:00:29.168 --> 00:00:34.108
 They are mistakes in our judgment .. Let's take a closer look 

00:00:34.108 --> 00:00:41.108
 For me, building anything is a work that expresses love, but our work can lead us to love. 

00:00:42.648 --> 00:00:48.688
 The effect of IKEA tends to place disproportionately high values 

00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:54.008
 Think of combinations of makeup games, paper shapes, of course IKEA furniture. 

00:00:54.008 --> 00:00:58.758
 In a series of studies where participants gathered those three things 

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:05.488
 They saw that the value of their creations resembled the creations of experts and mistakenly thought that others 

00:01:05.488 --> 00:01:08.698
 Share this view. 

00:01:08.698 --> 00:01:12.958
 The researchers found that the effect occurs only when the whole creations are collected 

00:01:12.958 --> 00:01:18.448
 It had no effect when it was placed and partially assembled and then shatter. 

00:01:18.448 --> 00:01:25.208
 Perhaps our love for hand creations comes from investing our time in it. But how long? 

00:01:26.668 --> 00:01:33.668
 The wrong planning occurs when we underestimate the time we need to complete a task. 

00:01:33.678 --> 00:01:39.178
 The researchers suggested that we underestimate the times of our missions. Not the time others need. 

00:01:40.888 --> 00:01:46.228
 In a study, participants were asked to estimate how much time they needed to accomplish a particular task 

00:01:46.228 --> 00:01:52.818
 Shopping to buy a gift, file format or meal processing. They found that participants who 

00:01:52.818 --> 00:01:59.168
 They did not divide tasks into smaller parts that were more biased, and they tended to underestimate 

00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:02.687
 Time you need tasks. 

00:02:02.687 --> 00:02:08.908
 So when things are fragmented it becomes easier to pick them up, certainly still 

00:02:08.908 --> 00:02:13.238
 Try to accommodate how much you need to install IKEA furniture. 

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:20.208
 Post-purchase justification happens when you convince yourself and use the rational argument 

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:26.578
 The value of these purchases was good. Such as spending $ 480 on ah-pp-lar-oh loveseat-wooden seats from IKEA 

00:02:26.578 --> 00:02:32.328
 With two chairs for feet. Most of us refuse to accept that we have made a mistake and are convinced 

00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:38.998
 We have made a good decision. I mean it is even with two chairs for feet. 

00:02:38.998 --> 00:02:45.057
 Serial availability is a subjective process to promote the formation of universal belief. So 

00:02:45.057 --> 00:02:50.337
 If you repeat something for a long time, something most people say 

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.417
 Will become a reality. 

00:02:53.417 --> 00:02:58.868
 If you hear that IKEA is a good cultural establishment and read that IKEA is a good cultural establishment 

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:04.718
 You will probably believe that IKEA is a good cultural establishment. 

00:03:04.718 --> 00:03:10.658
 It is an idea to follow the herd based on what is acceptable in society. 

00:03:10.658 --> 00:03:16.038
 I mean, IKEA is a good cultural establishment. Those seats are sold as foot chairs. 

00:03:16.038 --> 00:03:20.358
 Sometimes we do not realize that these biases have affected our behavior 

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:26.748
 Mistakes are often made in our judgments subconsciously. I am one of those who committed themselves to wrong plans 

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:32.117
 I still did not finish it with most of the things I said I would do. 

00:03:32.117 --> 00:03:34.548
 Or reply to your letters, I apologize 

00:03:34.548 --> 00:03:39.138
 Let me know below in comments or in Twitter if you notice any of these cognitive biases 

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:44.977
 In your behavior. If you do not subscribe to the BrainCraft channel
