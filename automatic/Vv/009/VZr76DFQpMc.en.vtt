00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.739
 in principle we have to comment that the 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:23.300
 pain has a concept that the 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.070
 international association for the study 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.300
 and pain treatment 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 I bet you this conceptualizes it as 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.010
 an emotional sensory experience 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.430
 unpleasant that will be associated with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.670
 a damage that sometimes we can see 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.090
 palpate diagnose or that is in 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.590
 power 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.030
 that's why we have to 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.700
 identify all patients who 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.920
 they have pain with these concepts 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:03.309
 Sensitive and emotional sensation exists 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.410
 another concept that constantly 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.320
 we see as doctors we are 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.930
 exposed to this type of patients that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.030
 are those who have pain 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.940
 perioperative we can not talk about the 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.370
 concept of postoperative pain when 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:24.230
 many of our patients 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:28.400
 before presenting a surgery an act 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.590
 surgical already have a pain and we have 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.400
 have to work from before the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.950
 patient is already with this injury that's why 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.320
 the concept that has been given is pain 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.450
 but operative everything that is 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.550
 around what is causing the 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.100
 surgery 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.620
 this is the pain is the one that is going to 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 present in a surgical patient 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.760
 where there is a disease that is 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.390
 leading to surgery 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.280
 be of any nature be urgent 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.150
 scheduled 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.850
 is serious or is not serious of any 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.900
 but nothing so disease 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.990
 but also all those 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.300
 surgical procedures that we 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.240
 we need to handle the patient 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.050
 call yourself a channel 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.610
 a nasogastric tube or the combination 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.820
 of these techniques 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.770
 whatever it is however also 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.940
 we have to know that there are different 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.220
 types of pain 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.160
 apart from the surgical we can have 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.980
 acute pain and chronic pain within the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.170
 acute pain we can talk about some 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.470
 pain that is caused in a way 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.690
 abrupt may be in a patient who 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.960
 previously he was healthy or can be in 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.920
 an already ill patient with a pathology 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.870
 then we can have a pain 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:57.950
 traumatic in a healthy patient or in a 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.370
 sick but also this this trauma or 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.830
 this injury can cause a disease 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.409
 we talk about perioperative pain 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.230
 also in small surgeries or surgeries 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:12.650
 older these earlier then the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:16.370
 we can qualify as acute pains the 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.890
 chronic pain that is a pain that no longer 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.560
 it is useful as the acute that the acute one 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.079
 warns that something is happening and that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.959
 something is damaging the tissues and that there 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:30.890
 to take care of it in a timely manner 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.160
 Chronic pain is different from chronic 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.590
 it's not useful you're already making changes in 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.349
 the patient's life and we have to 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.120
 diagnose it and treat it also between 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.489
 more timely is better 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.250
 We can divide chronic pain into 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.400
 cancer pain those patients who 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.370
 they have a tumor or a cancer that is 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.640
 causing pain or that the 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.370
 curative or diagnostic treatments 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.680
 they are also causing this kind of 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.349
 pain or it looks like a tumor invasion 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.739
 we have the other aspect that is pain 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:12.560
 not oncological this is the one that 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:15.530
 presents in patients who have pain 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 chronic and do not have cancer but that 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.310
 They have other conditions such as what 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.360
 osteoporosis 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.610
 joint diseases of 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.380
 Inflammatory back pain 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.570
 chronic low back pain 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.340
 a concept called a syndrome 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.270
 failed back that is when a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.570
 patient has required surgeries and that 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.910
 despite one or two or more surgeries that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.560
 they have done the patient continues with 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.450
 pain 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:52.090
 others are for example patients with 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.910
 polyneuropathies either by diabetes by 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:05:00.480
 toxic substances due to diseases 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.480
 viral by chemotherapies etc
