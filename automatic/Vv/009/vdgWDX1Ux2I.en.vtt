00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
the evidence because they couldn't be

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.529 
the evidence because they couldn't be
deciphered<00:01:14.189> later<00:01:15.189> on<00:01:15.460> where<00:01:16.090> we<00:01:16.210> learned<00:01:16.390> a

little Sanskrit and we could read the
commentaries<00:01:20.409> that<00:01:20.439> are<00:01:20.680> available<00:01:21.149> we<00:01:22.149> could

commentaries that are available we could

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.349 
commentaries that are available we could
reconstruct<00:01:23.259> that<00:01:23.560> very<00:01:23.890> easily<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:25.180> sir

transcribed it gets edited guess I did

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.320 
transcribed it gets edited guess I did
it<00:02:12.220> again<00:02:12.520> get<00:02:12.700> proof<00:02:12.970> read

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it again get proof read

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.120 
it again get proof read
then<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.540> gets<00:02:13.630> published<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.770> where's<00:02:14.980> the
