00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
energy density octane requirements
productivity<00:00:51.379> is<00:00:52.379> also<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.769> special<00:00:53.250> emphasis

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
productivity is also a special emphasis

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.700 
productivity is also a special emphasis
on<00:00:53.760> cleanliness<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> injector<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
on cleanliness of the injector and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.369 
on cleanliness of the injector and
across<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.220> need<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:56.970> bio<00:00:57.510> component<00:00:58.260> which

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
across the need for bio component which

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.530 
across the need for bio component which
is<00:00:58.410> compulsory<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.280> few<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.360> this

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
is compulsory in a few and so this

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.020 
is compulsory in a few and so this
advanced<00:01:01.500> energy<00:01:01.739> formula<00:01:02.430> essentially

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
advanced energy formula essentially

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.020 
advanced energy formula essentially
cleans<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.720> engine<00:01:04.050> for<00:01:04.980> good<00:01:05.339> fuel<00:01:05.610> delivery

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
cleans the engine for good fuel delivery

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.540 
cleans the engine for good fuel delivery
yeah<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.140> ensures<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.100> has<00:01:08.190> a<00:01:08.220> final

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
yeah it also ensures that it has a final

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.730 
yeah it also ensures that it has a final
few<00:01:08.820> spray<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.960> combustion<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
few spray of that the combustion and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
few spray of that the combustion and
energy<00:01:11.100> release<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> onion<00:01:12.780> also

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
energy release and in the onion also

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.490 
energy release and in the onion also
improves<00:01:13.980> fuel<00:01:14.520> efficiency<00:01:14.840> so<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.230> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
improves fuel efficiency so this is the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.110 
improves fuel efficiency so this is the
way<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.920> done<00:01:17.040> this<00:01:17.190> year<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.760> it's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.970> bit

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
way we have done this year so it's a bit

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.380 
way we have done this year so it's a bit
less<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.620> power<00:01:19.620> more<00:01:20.130> efficiency<00:01:20.820> oh<00:01:21.000> yes

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
less about power more efficiency oh yes

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.820 
less about power more efficiency oh yes
indeed

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
indeed

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.280 
indeed
now<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.580> new<00:01:23.730> engine<00:01:24.120> to<00:01:24.960> get<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
now with the new engine to get the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
now with the new engine to get the
performance<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:26.250> need<00:01:26.370> to<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> for

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
performance you need to go for

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.420 
performance you need to go for
efficiency<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.110> efficiency<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.310> new

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
efficiency so efficiency is the new

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.600 
efficiency so efficiency is the new
measurement<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.120> performance<00:01:30.270> ok<00:01:31.190> ok<00:01:32.190> this<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
measurement of performance ok ok this is

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.610 
measurement of performance ok ok this is
of<00:01:32.730> course<00:01:32.940> link<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:33.990> new<00:01:34.140> fuel

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
of course link to the new fuel

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.830 
of course link to the new fuel
restrictions<00:01:35.040> for<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.370> season<00:01:36.210> right<00:01:36.330> yeah

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
restrictions for this season right yeah

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.170 
restrictions for this season right yeah
for<00:01:36.990> 2014<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.830> have<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.010> new<00:01:38.040> regulation<00:01:38.580> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
for 2014 we have a new regulation the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.810 
for 2014 we have a new regulation the
driver<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:40.050> only<00:01:40.290> allowed<00:01:40.440> 100<00:01:40.890> kilos<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.730> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
driver was only allowed 100 kilos in the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.240 
driver was only allowed 100 kilos in the
race<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.900> last<00:01:43.260> year<00:01:43.530> they<00:01:43.710> were<00:01:43.860> typically

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
race so last year they were typically

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.200 
race so last year they were typically
filling

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
filling

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.560 
filling
cards<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.690> 153<00:01:46.620> days<00:01:46.770> or<00:01:46.979> more<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.090> hundred

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
cards with 153 days or more so hundred

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.109 
cards with 153 days or more so hundred
kilos<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:49.740> than<00:01:50.010> the<00:01:50.220> 30%<00:01:50.970> reduction

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
kilos that's more than the 30% reduction

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.840 
kilos that's more than the 30% reduction
in<00:01:51.600> fuel<00:01:51.840> consumption<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:53.070> yet<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.430> cars<00:01:53.640> are

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
in fuel consumption and yet the cars are

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.300 
in fuel consumption and yet the cars are
going<00:01:53.940> just<00:01:54.479> as<00:01:54.600> fast<00:01:54.869> in<00:01:55.320> just<00:01:55.560> as<00:01:55.680> far<00:01:55.920> yeah

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
going just as fast in just as far yeah

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.090 
going just as fast in just as far yeah
so<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.090> an<00:01:57.210> incredible<00:01:57.630> achievement<00:01:58.100> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so that's an incredible achievement and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.730 
so that's an incredible achievement and
that's<00:01:59.250> largely<00:01:59.970> down<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.470> technology<00:02:01.470> around

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
that's largely down to technology around

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's largely down to technology around
the<00:02:01.860> fuel<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> fuel<00:02:03.990> isn't<00:02:04.170> there<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.560> up

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
the fuel so fuel isn't there right up

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.290 
the fuel so fuel isn't there right up
there<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.070> everything<00:02:05.520> else<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
there with everything else but the

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.469 
there with everything else but the
engine<00:02:06.659> breaks<00:02:07.580> aerodynamics<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.090> even<00:02:09.360> the

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
engine breaks aerodynamics and even the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.979 
engine breaks aerodynamics and even the
talent<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:09.989> drivers<00:02:10.380> this<00:02:11.989> partnership

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
talent that the drivers this partnership

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.740 
talent that the drivers this partnership
with<00:02:13.319> Petronas<00:02:13.920> been<00:02:14.340> crucial<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:15.060> delivering

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
with Petronas been crucial in delivering

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.720 
with Petronas been crucial in delivering
a<00:02:15.810> great<00:02:16.319> solution<00:02:16.650> for<00:02:16.920> our<00:02:17.190> race<00:02:17.459> around

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
a great solution for our race around

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
a great solution for our race around
this<00:02:17.910> year<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:18.720> that's<00:02:18.870> really<00:02:19.230> being<00:02:19.380> part

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
this year and that's really being part

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.729 
this year and that's really being part
of<00:02:20.180> such<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.209> successful<00:02:21.720> championship<00:02:22.470> yeah

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
of such a successful championship yeah

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.680 
of such a successful championship yeah
it's<00:02:23.670> quite<00:02:23.850> incredible<00:02:24.269> when<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.420> think

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it's quite incredible when you think

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.259 
it's quite incredible when you think
about<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:25.019> just<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.830> same<00:02:26.040> about<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.310> less<00:02:27.000> fuel

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
about it just the same about a less fuel

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.120 
about it just the same about a less fuel
but<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.540> same<00:02:27.750> distance<00:02:28.110> is<00:02:28.350> quite<00:02:28.620> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
but the same distance is quite it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.979 
but the same distance is quite it
shouldn't<00:02:29.459> an<00:02:29.700> amazing<00:02:30.209> addition<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.780> the

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
shouldn't an amazing addition to the

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.470 
shouldn't an amazing addition to the
same<00:02:31.170> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.590> power<00:02:32.180> muscle<00:02:33.180> this<00:02:33.239> year

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
same kind of power muscle this year

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.150 
same kind of power muscle this year
that's<00:02:34.260> quite<00:02:34.410> unreal

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
that's quite unreal

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.030 
that's quite unreal
how<00:02:36.090> does<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.320> translate<00:02:37.320> with<00:02:37.890> the

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
how does that translate with the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400 
how does that translate with the
technology<00:02:38.490> that<00:02:38.520> we<00:02:38.670> have<00:02:38.850> on<00:02:39.210> on<00:02:40.050> down<00:02:40.230> the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.680 
track that we've developed for the
season<00:02:41.730> how<00:02:41.880> does<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.090> translate<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.600> the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
season how does that translate to the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.960 
season how does that translate to the
road<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:43.560> people<00:02:43.830> can<00:02:43.950> use<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.430> doesn't

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
road so that people can use it doesn't

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.090 
road so that people can use it doesn't
does<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.330> come<00:02:45.570> across<00:02:45.660> oh<00:02:46.080> yes<00:02:46.440> it<00:02:46.590> does<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:46.950> is

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
does it come across oh yes it does do is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.800 
does it come across oh yes it does do is
