00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
here's the thing here's the interesting

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.250 
here's the thing here's the interesting
thing<00:00:59.550> the<00:01:00.120> reason<00:01:00.539> why<00:01:00.629> all<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:01.020> people

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
thing the reason why all these people

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.900 
thing the reason why all these people
have<00:01:01.500> these<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.800> powers<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.460> different<00:01:02.760> type

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
have these I powers these different type

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
have these I powers these different type
of<00:01:02.940> powers<00:01:03.329> i<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> because<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:05.070> have

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
of powers i think is because they have

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.590 
of powers i think is because they have
had<00:01:05.369> their<00:01:05.519> bodies<00:01:05.909> transferred<00:01:06.390> into

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
had their bodies transferred into

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
had their bodies transferred into
something<00:01:06.930> else<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.409> they're<00:01:07.650> given<00:01:07.770> powers

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
something else and they're given powers

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.620 
something else and they're given powers

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
this and he's getting dragged in by
serpents<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:22.080> then<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.320> also<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.799> see

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
serpents and then we also get to see

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.469 
serpents and then we also get to see
talk<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.369> transferred<00:01:23.759> into<00:01:23.939> her<00:01:24.150> new<00:01:24.330> body

talk and transferred into her new body

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
talk and transferred into her new body
so<00:01:25.049> overall<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.830> now<00:01:26.340> understand<00:01:26.909> exactly<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
so overall I now understand exactly what

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.670 
so overall I now understand exactly what
how<00:01:27.450> they're<00:01:27.630> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.140> getting<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.500> powers

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
how they're kind of getting your powers

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.990 
how they're kind of getting your powers
and<00:01:29.009> shutting<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.400> original<00:01:29.820> little

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
and shutting this original little

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.550 
and shutting this original little
monster<00:01:30.360> girl<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.689> didn't<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.229> think<00:01:31.439> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
monster girl I didn't really think that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
monster girl I didn't really think that
that<00:01:31.770> any<00:01:32.009> segment<00:01:32.310> after<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> credits

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
that any segment after the credits

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
that any segment after the credits
really<00:01:33.360> had<00:01:33.479> any<00:01:33.630> pacific<00:01:34.140> meaning<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.650> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
really had any pacific meaning to the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
really had any pacific meaning to the
overall<00:01:35.100> series<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.270> i<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.689> wrong<00:01:36.900> i<00:01:37.079> was

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
overall series but now i was wrong i was

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.100 
overall series but now i was wrong i was
incorrect<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.610> does<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:38.880> major<00:01:39.479> impact

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
incorrect and it does have major impact

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.870 
incorrect and it does have major impact
to<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.380> overall<00:01:40.619> series<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> i'm<00:01:41.610> def<00:01:41.729> gonna

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
to the overall series so i'm def gonna

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.980 
to the overall series so i'm def gonna

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
monster girl pretty much was stating

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.919 
monster girl pretty much was stating
that<00:02:08.280> ok<00:02:08.610> your<00:02:08.819> body<00:02:09.030> your<00:02:09.330> new<00:02:09.479> body<00:02:09.660> will<00:02:09.840> be

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
so what does this mean

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.520 
so what does this mean
exactly<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.270> because<00:02:13.569> of<00:02:13.599> the<00:02:13.870> sensei<00:02:14.349> that

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
exactly is it because of the sensei that

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.290 
exactly is it because of the sensei that
was<00:02:14.650> there<00:02:14.830> doing<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.640> or<00:02:16.000> was<00:02:16.150> there

condo<00:03:31.570> definitely<00:03:31.900> has<00:03:32.019> an<00:03:32.140> ulterior<00:03:32.500> motive

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
condo definitely has an ulterior motive

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.620

behind the scenes that nobody else knows
of<00:03:34.660> and<00:03:35.200> maybe<00:03:35.320> that's<00:03:35.500> why<00:03:35.739> he's<00:03:35.859> trying<00:03:36.100> to

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
of and maybe that's why he's trying to

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.370 
of and maybe that's why he's trying to
grow<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.730> entire<00:03:37.269> group<00:03:37.600> so<00:03:37.870> one<00:03:38.109> thing

that talking a das this episode she dies
and<00:04:07.840> gets<00:04:08.260> transferred<00:04:08.739> into<00:04:09.040> another<00:04:09.400> body

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
and gets transferred into another body

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.460 
and gets transferred into another body
and<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.030> monster<00:04:10.389> as<00:04:10.510> I<00:04:10.540> said<00:04:10.900> inject<00:04:11.319> her

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
and the monster as I said inject her

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.170 
and the monster as I said inject her
with<00:04:11.500> something<00:04:12.190> and<00:04:12.459> she<00:04:12.549> gets<00:04:12.730> her<00:04:12.819> red<00:04:13.000> eyes

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
with something and she gets her red eyes

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.670 
with something and she gets her red eyes
and<00:04:13.209> we<00:04:13.510> see<00:04:13.660> her<00:04:13.720> turn<00:04:13.900> into<00:04:14.109> na<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.440> all<00:04:14.530> that

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
and we see her turn into na and all that

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.229 
and we see her turn into na and all that
so<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.310> gonna<00:04:15.430> take<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.670> guess<00:04:15.940> right

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
so I'm just gonna take a guess right

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.360 
so I'm just gonna take a guess right
there<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.780> say<00:04:17.169> most<00:04:17.470> likely<00:04:17.950> it's<00:04:18.100> at<00:04:18.280> the

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
there and say most likely it's at the

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.560 
there and say most likely it's at the
time<00:04:18.609> of<00:04:18.760> death<00:04:18.880> they<00:04:19.060> get<00:04:19.209> these<00:04:19.329> type<00:04:19.539> of

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
time of death they get these type of

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.870
