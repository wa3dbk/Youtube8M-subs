00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hi and welcome to moomoomath today we're

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.880 
hi and welcome to moomoomath today we're
going<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.600> look<00:00:03.750> at<00:00:03.899> how<00:00:04.049> to<00:00:04.110> find<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.589> volume

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
going to look at how to find the volume

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.509 
going to look at how to find the volume
of<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.910> cube<00:00:06.540> okay<00:00:07.290> over<00:00:07.589> here<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:07.919> have<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> cube

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
of a cube okay over here we have a cube

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.509 
of a cube okay over here we have a cube
in<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.790> cube<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.990> like<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.800> rubik's<00:00:11.160> cube

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
in a cube is I like the rubik's cube

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.070 
in a cube is I like the rubik's cube
it's<00:00:11.790> got<00:00:12.210> six<00:00:12.840> sides<00:00:13.230> six<00:00:13.740> faces<00:00:14.660> four<00:00:15.660> sides

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
it's got six sides six faces four sides

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.560 
it's got six sides six faces four sides
on<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> base<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:17.070> they're<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.340> equal<00:00:18.000> so

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
on the base and they're all equal so

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.040 
on the base and they're all equal so
this<00:00:18.810> particular<00:00:19.430> cube<00:00:20.430> has<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> font<00:00:21.480> size<00:00:21.600> of

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
this particular cube has a font size of

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.519 
this particular cube has a font size of
five<00:00:22.289> five<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.830> five<00:00:23.369> now<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> prism

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
five five and five now this is a prism

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.560 
five five and five now this is a prism
so<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.310> going<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.519> look<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> prism

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
so we're going to look at the prism

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.950 
so we're going to look at the prism
formula<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> kind<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.300> simplify<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.359> down<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
formula and kind of simplify it down to

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.580 
formula and kind of simplify it down to
make<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.140> specific<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:33.360> cube<00:00:33.840> okay<00:00:34.410> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
make it specific to the cube okay the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.720 
make it specific to the cube okay the
base<00:00:34.829> area<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:36.809> prism<00:00:37.500> times<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.520> height

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
base area of a prism times the height

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.119 
base area of a prism times the height
that<00:00:39.000> give<00:00:39.210> us<00:00:39.329> gives<00:00:39.750> us<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> volume<00:00:40.200> so<00:00:40.980> we

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
that give us gives us the volume so we

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
that give us gives us the volume so we
need<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.430> find<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.730> area<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.510> base<00:00:42.690> well

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
need to find the area of the base well

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.920 
need to find the area of the base well
the<00:00:43.559> base<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.010> just<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> square<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.210> five<00:00:45.600> by

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the base is just a square that's five by

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.150 
the base is just a square that's five by
five<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:47.010> five<00:00:47.399> times<00:00:48.059> five<00:00:48.539> gives<00:00:49.110> us<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.920> base

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
five so five times five gives us a base

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.760 
five so five times five gives us a base
area<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.879> twenty-five<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.320> I'm<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.559> plug

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
area of twenty-five so I'm going to plug

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.150 
area of twenty-five so I'm going to plug
a<00:00:52.800> 25<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:54.120> my<00:00:54.239> base<00:00:54.449> area<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.620> I'm<00:00:55.980> going

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
a 25 in for my base area then I'm going

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.939 
a 25 in for my base area then I'm going
to<00:00:56.219> multiply<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.699> times<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.300> height<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:58.050> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
to multiply it times the height of the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.420 
to multiply it times the height of the
cuban<00:00:59.370> height<00:00:59.640> is<00:00:59.940> also<00:01:00.300> five<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> i'm<00:01:02.340> going

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
cuban height is also five so i'm going

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.759 
cuban height is also five so i'm going
to<00:01:02.550> multiply<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:03.090> by<00:01:03.149> five<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.809> 25<00:01:04.260> times<00:01:04.530> 5

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
to multiply that by five so 25 times 5

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.539 
to multiply that by five so 25 times 5
is<00:01:05.100> 125<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> because<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.860> volume<00:01:08.340> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
is 125 and because this is volume is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820 
is 125 and because this is volume is
units<00:01:09.330> cubed<00:01:09.990> because<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.530> three

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
units cubed because it's three

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.340 
units cubed because it's three
dimensional<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:12.060> let's<00:01:12.360> simplify<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:13.080> down

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
dimensional now let's simplify that down

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
dimensional now let's simplify that down
a<00:01:13.380> little<00:01:13.530> bit<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.610> do<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
a little bit because we do have a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.780 
a little bit because we do have a
special<00:01:15.330> case<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> cube<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.310> all<00:01:17.460> sides

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
special case we have a cube or all sides

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
special case we have a cube or all sides
of<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> same<00:01:18.360> length<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.350> since<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.680> have<00:01:19.770> to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of the same length so since we have to

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
of the same length so since we have to
find<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.159> base<00:01:20.340> area<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.030> height<00:01:21.360> they're

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
find the base area and height they're

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.580 
find the base area and height they're
all<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.049> same

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
all the same

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.850 
all the same
we<00:01:22.890> can<00:01:23.040> actually<00:01:23.520> simplify<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.420> s<00:01:24.930> times

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
we can actually simplify that to s times

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.490 
we can actually simplify that to s times
asks<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.670> base<00:01:26.820> area<00:01:27.119> times<00:01:27.299> s<00:01:28.170> for<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
asks for the base area times s for the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.480 
asks for the base area times s for the
height<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.070> s<00:01:29.960> cubed<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.430> you

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
height or s cubed so that is how you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.830 
height or s cubed so that is how you
would<00:01:32.729> find<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.509> volume<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:35.040> cube<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.630> let's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
would find the volume of a cube so let's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.890 
would find the volume of a cube so let's
review<00:01:37.049> very<00:01:37.560> quickly<00:01:38.210> here<00:01:39.210> are<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> rules

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
review very quickly here are the rules

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.160 
review very quickly here are the rules
for<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.100> volume<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.790> cube<00:01:42.210> it's<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.930> s

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
for the volume of a cube it's just s

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.130 
for the volume of a cube it's just s
times<00:01:43.439> s<00:01:43.590> times<00:01:43.860> s<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.340> s<00:01:44.369> cubed<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.689> units

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
times s times s or s cubed the units

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
times s times s or s cubed the units
will<00:01:46.409> also<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:47.280> cute<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:47.850> let's<00:01:48.060> add<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
will also be cute so let's add that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
will also be cute so let's add that
units<00:01:49.259> cubed<00:01:49.710> whether<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.100> inches<00:01:50.460> cubed

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
units cubed whether it's inches cubed

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.319 
units cubed whether it's inches cubed
centimeters<00:01:51.780> cubed<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:53.009> derived<00:01:53.640> from<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
centimeters cubed it is derived from the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.450 
centimeters cubed it is derived from the
prism<00:01:54.750> formula<00:01:55.229> which<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.500> base<00:01:55.920> area<00:01:56.369> times

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
