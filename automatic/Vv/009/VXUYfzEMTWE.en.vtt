complicated<00:00:22.670> I've<00:00:23.670> been<00:00:23.910> watching<00:00:24.150> videos<00:00:24.750> on

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
complicated I've been watching videos on

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080 
complicated I've been watching videos on
hidden<00:00:26.010> PISTON<00:00:26.369> doors<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.820> thought<00:00:27.000> would

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
hidden PISTON doors and I thought would

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.749 
hidden PISTON doors and I thought would
be<00:00:27.119> pretty<00:00:27.390> cool<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.570> see<00:00:27.810> one<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.230> ground

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:42.729 

all<00:00:32.759> right<00:00:33.649> you<00:00:34.649> will<00:00:34.890> need<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.600> 6<00:00:36.600> x<00:00:37.320> 7<00:00:37.920> x<00:00:38.100> 3<00:00:39.230> hole

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.310 

first<00:00:43.739> thing<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.100> want<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:45.989> four

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
first thing you want to do is put four

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.029 
first thing you want to do is put four
pistons<00:00:46.890> down<00:00:47.160> facing<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.469> since<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.680> wall<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
pistons down facing up since the wall is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.709 
pistons down facing up since the wall is
an<00:00:50.129> odd<00:00:50.340> number<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.090> put<00:00:51.239> them<00:00:51.360> off<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
an odd number you can put them off to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.470 
an odd number you can put them off to
either<00:00:51.809> side<00:00:53.899> then<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.079> need<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> have<00:00:56.480> four

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
either side then you need to have four

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.439 
either side then you need to have four
pistons<00:00:57.870> there<00:00:58.520> and<00:00:59.520> then<00:00:59.879> another<00:01:00.059> four

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
pistons there and then another four

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.350 
pistons there and then another four
opposite<00:01:01.609> like<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:04.519> then<00:01:05.519> next<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.150> put

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
opposite like so then next you can put

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.760 
opposite like so then next you can put
two<00:01:06.540> blocks<00:01:07.520> two<00:01:08.520> blocks<00:01:08.850> two<00:01:09.659> blocks<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.320> two

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
two blocks two blocks two blocks and two

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
two blocks two blocks two blocks and two
blocks<00:01:12.439> now<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> actually<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:14.310> down

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
blocks now you can actually put down

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.390 
blocks now you can actually put down
some<00:01:14.880> redstone<00:01:16.700> first<00:01:17.700> repeaters<00:01:19.220> need<00:01:20.220> to

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
some redstone first repeaters need to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.580 
some redstone first repeaters need to
put<00:01:20.700> repeaters<00:01:21.210> facing<00:01:21.720> all<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.170> Pistons

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.740 

the<00:01:25.759> repeater<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.880> going<00:01:27.180> against<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the repeater is going against the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.770 
the repeater is going against the
stacked<00:01:28.200> up<00:01:28.380> pistons<00:01:28.799> need<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.850> be<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.090> three

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.370 

these<00:01:33.780> ones<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:34.229> need<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> change<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> all

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
these ones don't need to change it all

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
these ones don't need to change it all
then<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.650> need<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.979> wrap<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:39.000> piston

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
then you just need to wrap your piston

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.399 
then you just need to wrap your piston
air<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:41.040> hand

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.789 

and<00:01:46.100> that's<00:01:46.399> actually<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:47.229> like<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.380> said<00:01:48.619> it's

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and that's actually it like I said it's

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.569 
and that's actually it like I said it's
not<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.130> complicated<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.249> just<00:01:52.310> need

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
not that complicated now you just need

00:01:52.579 --> 00:02:02.040 
not that complicated now you just need
to<00:01:52.729> hook<00:01:52.850> it<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.359> reliever

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:10.469 

and<00:02:02.860> you<00:02:02.980> got<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.130> place<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.670> blocks<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
and you got to place the blocks and

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.870 
and you got to place the blocks and
that's<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:13.600> course<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.550> fill<00:02:15.550> up<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
that's it of course you can fill up the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:25.320 
that's it of course you can fill up the
hole<00:02:17.790> however<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:18.940> would<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:24.330> maybe

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
hole however you would like that maybe

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.580 
hole however you would like that maybe
dig<00:02:25.690> down<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.960> bit<00:02:29.220> there<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.310> have<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:31.500> just<00:02:32.500> to

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
dig down a bit there you have it just to

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.370 
dig down a bit there you have it just to
show<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.920> can<00:02:32.950> be<00:02:33.160> done<00:02:33.340> with<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:34.450> trapdoor<00:02:34.840> I

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
show it can be done with that trapdoor I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.250 
show it can be done with that trapdoor I
have<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.430> little<00:02:36.670> tiny<00:02:37.200> building<00:02:38.970> here<00:02:39.970> with<00:02:40.150> a

have a little tiny building here with a

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.570 
have a little tiny building here with a
trapdoor<00:02:41.260> rigged<00:02:41.890> up<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.100> it<00:02:42.310> with<00:02:42.460> this

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
trapdoor rigged up to it with this

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:49.560 
trapdoor rigged up to it with this
button<00:02:47.040> some<00:02:48.040> reason<00:02:48.460> that<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.910> can't<00:02:49.240> explain

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570

it is extremely laggy I have a bunch

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.680 
it is extremely laggy I have a bunch
more<00:02:54.070> redstone<00:02:54.310> than<00:02:54.760> what<00:02:55.270> I<00:02:55.300> just<00:02:55.420> showed

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
more redstone than what I just showed

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.660 
more redstone than what I just showed
you<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.230> there's<00:02:56.380> these<00:02:56.530> extra<00:02:57.040> piston<00:02:57.460> doors
