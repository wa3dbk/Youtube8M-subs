00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:15.360
 today we will make the Bari focaccia 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 we have 250 g of semolina of 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:23.130
 durum wheat 250 g of wheat flour 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 soft 350 g of water 100 g of yeast 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.929
 mother or 10 grams of yeast 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:34.559
 compressed 150 g of boiled potato 4 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.120
 grams of sugar or honey I have 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.360
 put honey , I'll explain why 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 then go on the tomatoes 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.899
 cherry barisan and oregano olives 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.620
 extra virgin olive oil and salt meanwhile we go 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.230
 forward and we see the re-milled semolina 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.230
 wheat flour 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.289
 the potato must be lukewarm not cold 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:08.160
 so be careful because otherwise 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:10.020
 then when it is too hot from a 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.009
 a little annoying if too cold 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.679
 we have a little bit of trouble with it 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:23.179
 crush and put the sourdough 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:29.399
 which is very important for focaccia 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:31.259
 we put the quantity we need there 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.590
 I can also put a little bit of honey 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:38.039
 just to avoid the sugar 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.479
 you know that I prefer it but I have 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:45.270
 asked for permission to do so but have 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:50.959
 said yes we put away this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.959
 we put water and salt 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:03.060
 and now we're going to knead myself 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:07.509
 I recommend if you use a car 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.010
 that are not those kneading machines that 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:17.519
 blend because otherwise the potato 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:17.519
 there will be a lot of dough 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:27.819
 it could also be slightly more 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.610
 soft but okay even so you do 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.849
 rise directly in the pan from 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:41.590
 this mixture I get two now 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:51.430
 let's put some oil on it, that's why 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:58.930
 it's beautiful soaked I divide the dough in 22 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:04.530
 equal parts and now it gets to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:13.290
 rise directly in the pan 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.290
 we also spread the sides well above 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:25.040
 let it rise in this way at 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:35.150
 center you see is very simple 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:42.970
 then cover it with the cloth let us take it 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:48.380
 double we put it here 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:51.280
 we also cover the other this one's is 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:56.660
 the classic method 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.840
 just for the focaccia from Bari 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.290
 I have already leavened it now 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.290
 we take 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:14.150
 I'll show you what an explosion we clean 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.639
 for not having so many things in between when 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.640
 we always try to work 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.260
 clean even if we have so many here 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.500
 ingredients with dough that 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:31.030
 leavened one to rise look at 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:34.280
 how it is enlarged I also take the other one 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.600
 I now used not those here 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.100
 classic ones I brought them 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:44.750
 directly from bari now what is 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:51.610
 ago you take this dough I wear 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:53.419
 even a little oil I take it back 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:03.010
 look how wonderful 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:08.590
 wow I'll take it back like this now 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.590
 with greasy hands off 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:16.580
 the tomatoes must be the people of 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:22.040
 cherry that you have to open with 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:27.890
 hands and when we open them 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:34.030
 we put the juice on the focaccia 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:42.230
 with the part you see it splashes with the skin 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:45.370
 above and is covered is covered by 

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:50.560
 small tomatoes put the barisan olives e 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:56.410
 after that my hands must now 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:06:01.910
 to dry that we put the oregano e 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:05.240
 so we finish the focaccia in place vi 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:09.260
 I show the baked focaccia that 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:13.910
 I took ten minutes out of the oven 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:16.280
 ago and the goodness of this focaccia which it is 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.790
 that the many flavors put together the 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.000
 crunchiness on the outside the softness 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:26.360
 that there is softness within 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.810
 dough and tomatoes and olives do 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.810
 all the rest
