00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.470
 find for a video tips i'm going 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.940
 show you how to go from an end a 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.810
 case to a palette of blushes to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.760
 eyelids that you will be able to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.840
 make yourself very quickly and 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.550
 very simple in the last video 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.519
 favorite I had you very quickly 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.379
 showed this little hungry malud that I 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.699
 myself make myself 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.960
 so before I start I want to 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.590
 specify that this idea does not come 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.070
 absolutely not me since I took 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.330
 the idea of â€‹â€‹miss had skis there 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.500
 there's a lot of time we had 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.689
 spoken in one of her videos that she 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 kept the boxes like those that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.460
 are simply boxes that are 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.469
 offered that are offered by donation with 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.309
 the hygienic service packs so there 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.250
 right now it's a little less than 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 love but hey so these are 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.309
 boxes that are offered with packs 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.200
 of gene services and in his video 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 she was talking about some of the titles 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.219
 beyond to make pallets 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 I found the ingenious idea and hyper 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.250
 that I had put in a small corner of my 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.750
 head is that today I come out for 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.920
 make me my little whale but very 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.969
 of course the link of the chain of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 miss him sanbar 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.579
 information I urge you to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.410
 to go see her chain is a girl who 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.390
 is very friendly whose videos 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.070
 are super varied very nice to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 look briefly go quickly see his channel 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.210
 do not be disappointed so I'm going 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.369
 start by showing you the strong ones that 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.510
 I have in my little palette since I 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.520
 think it'll interest you and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.170
 then I explain briefly 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.189
 how did I do it and of course at the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.229
 end of the video I would put you a 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 little editing in music that will not 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.860
 not how I made my little palette 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.450
 then that night it is far number 134 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.640
 and it's a chestnut of cold that I have 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.470
 bought lately he is beautiful he 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.939
 is very finely t it is slightly 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.610
 sequined is placed on my eyelid 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.079
 do not see each other so much 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.970
 here I have a lighthouse that is the lighthouse 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.220
 number 2 143 it's a beacon of the 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.960
 new collection that is extremely 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.729
 difficult to dump anything to do with the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.990
 former end so I got into 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.259
 this experience I will not make them two 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.540
 time 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.890
 but now it's done 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.869
 make any tutorials on order 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.189
 hotpot the new lighthouses I think 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.140
 you will find on the internet 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.480
 in short we are not here to talk about that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.070
 it's number 2 143 goes out 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.080
 bordeaux you have the colors a little 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.730
 little burgundy that will be very trendy 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.490
 this winter which is beautiful that I 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.920
 find all the eris 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.330
 really then I have a beige lighthouse 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.020
 clear who is beautiful it is him 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:18.100
 number 118 which is very very bright 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.150
 here is here I have a math clasp that is 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.730
 very pigmented as you can 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 see it's number 180 and finally 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.380
 I make them a number 167 here that is 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.610
 a beige white is not quite white 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.530
 but in any case he is very very 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.730
 bright and he is mate too for him 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.620
 to explain a little more how 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 I did I first remove 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.850
 the lighthouse label then I 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.980
 heated my lighthouse to be able to deposit 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.180
 anyway you will see more in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.900
 detail how I did in the video 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.580
 who will follow 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.850
 once I had my lighthouse or 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.790
 I put them in my little 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.070
 palette and then I stuck every 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.330
 references to have them here so here I 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.590
 I used a little box 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.840
 hygienic servo but you can 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.820
 very well for example buy the boxes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.380
 in iron colored pencils for them 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.340
 children or others I took some 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.290
 little boxes like that since I 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.580
 find that the pattern is nice that the 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.780
 pattern on a crime box colors a 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.220
 little more childlike etc 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.360
 it's a little less my style admits you 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.860
 that initially I wanted to use a 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.170
 method that is slightly different 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.730
 since I wanted to collar mepha between 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.720
 quotation marks with tape and go up I 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.920
 found to be very practical and that 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.090
 avoided me to see take off 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.250
 lozenge with the references and the 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.570
 put in there but impossible to find 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.860
 scotch is mounted it's really been the 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.110
 prey the way we can find 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.700
 so finally I resigned myself and 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.130
 I stuck but do with double 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.080
 face is very good too but that you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.570
 force to put your references elsewhere 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.130
 if you want to keep your references and 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.090
 I can assure you that even if up 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.340
 where my box 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.720
 no parent can we do you can 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.500
 take him on vacation or on weekends 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.480
 in your purse 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.560
 the headlights are very well fixed they do not 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.970
 risk nothing no I leave you 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.290
 watch the little music tutorial 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.940
 I hope you like it I make you 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.480
 big kisses and I tell you see you soon 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.480
