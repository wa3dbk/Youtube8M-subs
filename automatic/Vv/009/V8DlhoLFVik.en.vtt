00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.000
 Welcome to CARP ZWOLLE. 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
 The carp exchange, the largest carp exchange in the world. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 CARP ZWOLLE is the largest carp show in Europe, spread over five halls. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.000
 People come from all over Europe to talk, watch and learn with their fellow fishermen. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 CARP ZWOLLE is of course retailers, wholesalers, fishing clubs, groups of people who like to fish for carp. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 Travel agencies. 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 In short, everything you want as a sport fisherman, as a carp fisher, you can experience here. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
 It is a real experience this. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 We have one hundred and forty-five stands from eight different countries. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.500
 If it is not here then it does not exist! 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
 Guys, this is the way to show citizens how healthy the water is in the Netherlands. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Or how well carp are doing in the Netherlands and how many people enjoy it. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I would say walk around and see for yourself because this is just really unique. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
 It is the largest exhibition in Europe. The English stock markets are nothing compared to this. 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
 English scholarships are much smaller. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 People come from all over Europe. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 We talk to Germans, Norwegians, Poland, and of course Dutch and Belgians. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.500
 You make friends. You see many familiar faces every year. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 We always have many new things to show. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
 There is a good atmosphere. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
 My first time CARP ZWOLLE was 2004. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 So you can say that it feels like coming home. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 The CARP ZWOLLE always feels good. There are always a lot of people. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800
 There is always a lively atmosphere in Zwolle. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.500
 That's why I like it so much here. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.500
 Some fairs are very quiet but here it is very busy both Saturday and Sunday. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.000
 You see the audience behind us. It's alive. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.000
 I think CARP ZWOLLE is a scholarship, just like you imagine. 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.500
 So no small hall with a number of positions. 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500
 CARP ZWOLLE is a large exhibition with many stands where people can get information and see everything well. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 It is worth making so many kilometers because everything can be found here. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
 It is a bit of a meeting place and it is the start of the season. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
 Then we go loose again. 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.000
 CARP ZWOLLE is ... 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
 A fantastic excuse to meet a lot of friends. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 It's lifestyle, it's excitement, it's experience, it's outdoor, adventure. 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.500
 It is something ... 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.000
 If you really want to enjoy nature, really want to be in it, carp fishing is just your thing. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.500
 I love CARP ZWOLLE. A fantastic trade show. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 CARP ZWOLLE is the heart of carp fishing ...
