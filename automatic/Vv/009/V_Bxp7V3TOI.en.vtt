00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.570
 katys game gmbh a specialist with 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.059
 fight prizes moin people herbert 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 gamer tv new murder new day and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.090
 welcome to city 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.460
 driving today with the mercedes s i 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.400
 faith 600 means if I'm not 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.230
 crazy or 500 I'm not sure 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 I think it's the 600 and one 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.780
 view does not quite work here 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.910
 really should be much further 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.219
 So he remembers being in front 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.820
 of course, whiz out without end is one 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.820
 automatic transmission 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:55.460
 unfortunately he knows how he drives 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:55.460
 not yet there 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.260
 so 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.230
 and then we see something this 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:14.970
 mercedes at that time where came out 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.970
 is quite old for qualities has 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.370
 all the caution there is the pressure behind 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.370
 without end 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.160
 madness 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.480
 what's up, what was that? 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.390
 Just always spontaneously 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.390
 so bad 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.149
 you really have to say that's the thing 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.149
 like a vacuum cleaner 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.460
 with the accelerated but also extreme 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.460
 Wow 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.160
 madness 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 how fast does the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.129
 140 44 46 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.260
 even more 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.480
 more than taboo drives in any case 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.540
 looking for a fast car addiction 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:03.860
 so 1 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.680
 nearly 300 managed determined 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.160
 drive now at 271 must brake 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.690
 otherwise a possible turn comes 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.680
 that stays in the curve at all 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.680
 madness 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.180
 275 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.980
 wow, the game stuttered slightly 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.790
 and of course I did not have any 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.530
 chance more 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:39.990
 but have you seen that properly ? 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.630
 purely driven the car directly in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:46.550
 we have to be reverse gear in there 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:50.000
 purely as easy once out of here 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.000
 shocked as we are 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.320
 madness 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.959
 so I personally 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.750
 I'm baffled I do not know what I mean 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.410
 should say 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:09.080
 I would not have expected that 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.080
 now over 275 km / h 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.640
 and that shit sound misfire the 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.630
 I have no nerves there so far 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.630
 Solution for found 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.710
 madness 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:46.360
 I'm really baffled so have it 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.360
 counted on such an old car 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.389
 Above all, the automatic belongs 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.389
 be so awesome 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.270
 class 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:14.460
 even if one now imagines 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:19.389
 easy to chill in the car is the 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:22.000
 Sounded quite pleasant but if you then 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.699
 you decide to give gas 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:32.410
 the thing yells at you like that 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:34.600
 old vacuum cleaner madness i am 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.900
 Excited about the car I'm easy 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.900
 just excited 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.669
 I think it's great I have to give real 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.180
 we make right now a cold start of 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.940
 So , do not start here 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:59.680
 cold city karlstadt would be if the engine 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:04.800
 would be cold and then accelerate to 100 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.800
 Let's see how Ratzfatz return 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.480
 what an action the dutch 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:27.080
 we try normally so on 100 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:28.699
 I'm trying to share it that way 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.139
 I do not know if this is possible 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.139
 did not speak to press the clutch 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:48.660
 that takes six seconds six seconds 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.660
 this car to come to 100 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.040
 that's nothing 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.830
 and it can jump great case hears 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.090
 I really belong there now 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.090
 but six seconds 

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:13.460
 do not even test from 100 to 200 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:32.040
 that would not have worked 

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.380
 actually a shame but the thing 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.610
 is awesome horny I like it we 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.920
 see you again in the next part 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.840
 this gamer tv until the people stop the 

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.840
 ears stiff and maybe until 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:45.180
 next ingenious mod here we have to 

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.040
 for example the s 600 v 12 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.180
 until then you stay and 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.950
 Tchaikovsky is doing well 

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:51.930
 oh now rolled back where in the 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:55.040
 reverse gear is not in it is okay 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.040
