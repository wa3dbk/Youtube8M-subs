00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello my name is jim pansa and that 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.910
 Here is a video for the second weapon 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.680
 we now in the spring patch the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.150
 battlefield 4 thinks 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.320
 You can and do these weapons 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 of course the gear master mode 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.289
 even if you do not play a battlefield 4 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 should be premium user but where we 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.470
 especially when it comes to the topic of premium masseurs 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.180
 I have these words are still one month 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 bit advertising I have a popping 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 my contract here once master 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.119
 staeck product placement you can 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.550
 course battlefield 4 premium on ebay 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 cheap purchase look at link finds 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.969
 See below in the video description 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.290
 back to the topic so eps from the beginning 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.899
 from video already seen what a 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 I setup here with the weapon I drive 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.200
 I do not really have much 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.340
 unlocked and that is also a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.989
 a little bit that the weapon is not mine 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.640
 so special is why that is so 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.559
 I'll tell you here in this one 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.520
 video now in the beginning in the form of video 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.010
 seen I just said 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.690
 meant by that, of course, what do you do yourself 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.829
 have on it and special the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 special feature of this weapon is that 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 the two slots has the fixed specified 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.879
 So, first of all, are the small handle and 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 second, the compenser are both 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.149
 attachments that you replace again 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.129
 still can unscrew that is they are 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.350
 always firmly attached to the weapon and 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 of course, make sure that they are quite a 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
 special feeling, so to speak 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.860
 otherwise the weapon is somewhere like that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.330
 I'll say in the middle and lower 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.280
 This is not what they are called before 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.350
 especially fast is relatively precise 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.180
 at medium and short distance though 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.130
 as soon as I say so to the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.840
 longer distances or people is synonymous 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.040
 It will change a bit further 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.409
 really difficult because I have so 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.390
 feel that the spread is unbelievable 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.040
 So people really do increase it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.900
 you can change a bit further 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.009
 almost always completely forgotten and the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.450
 I would not do that anymore 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.579
 attack that means that is now one 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 you almost even weapon in that 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.950
 area posts the fans weapons 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.509
 can classify 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.280
 I have now after the patch 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.600
 hardly any other carbine played by 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.549
 therefore if the spread is still 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.439
 should have increased significantly 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.090
 various weapons then I have to 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.950
 of course, later corrected again 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.140
 or change 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.119
 otherwise that is of course a whole 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.979
 normal carabiner should just 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.760
 However, I think how to play 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.130
 already 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.110
 he on i'll say shorter distances 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.790
 what does that mean they are 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.320
 you are very good at cdm and of course 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.510
 So I can play domination right now 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.060
 I've been gambling here right now 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.980
 played on three different maps and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.260
 the whole thing on the same server 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.720
 teams were relatively balanced 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.880
 I'll say it and we have it now 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.730
 won twice overall and won 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.350
 the whole always with just under 10 20 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.750
 tickets projection from therefore that was 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.250
 already a relatively fair match I will 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.150
 this weapon probably also on 500 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.520
 kills course, high game 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.780
 logically, however, it will open 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.670
 no way one of my favorite 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.980
 weapons do not become one 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.510
 particularly high ball obhut secondly 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.920
 spread as I said I think that 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.450
 will be relatively high here also sets 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 right here in this scene that is there 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.160
 the second not even great with 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.570
 got caught and it is a multiple 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.060
 that happened to the opponent 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.620
 little further change not so 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 caught right and that is 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.950
 just a sign that the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.720
 balls are distributed in all directions 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.610
 but do not go where you like them 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.650
 I would either be on arms with 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.940
 an extremely high ball output is there 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.800
 it then relative no matter how I use 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.170
 then rather on a very short distance or 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.970
 on weapons that are extremely precise because 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.050
 then I can use it then too 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.940
 if people go a bit further 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.170
 change so here again briefly the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.630
 Server changes here I am now too 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.310
 been on the road and he knows himself 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.630
 if you are on the map here 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.220
 when you go from one building to the other 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.310
 ford or sometimes so big 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.870
 map attack somewhere can yes that will 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.090
 is possible, however, as I said with 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.190
 the grotta 1 I would from it 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.709
 otherwise nice new weapon I have 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.060
 have already mentioned very briefly 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.500
 relatively many people now in the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.610
 livestreams asked me how they do that 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.410
 because now i can hope 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.940
 Play now and play gambas anyway 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.560
 I have no premium I can 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.230
 do not gamble then say you said 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.760
 Of course you do not need premium for 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.080
 the new contents that is all five 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 You already have to want weapons with you 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.500
 eventually find so speaks completely 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.850
 normal from fall be this weapon 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.380
 Here is a carbine that is called 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.959
 would have to be the last carabiner now 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.489
 you in the arsenal of weapons available 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.330
 stand and of course you can also like 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.850
 masters play 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.590
 yes there is no restriction that 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.910
 only thing that can be natural is if 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.830
 in the rotation still some 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.060
 other maps are on it 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.349
 standard so vanilla are then it can 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.390
 Of course, that new browser will be yours 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.310
 hey says on this server you can 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.200
 unfortunately only play if you have the dlc 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.389
 owns or holds accordingly 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.739
 However, premium users are the most 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.840
 like master server that I have seen 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.010
 most of them were not that 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.630
 case my own server is also available 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.979
 currently test for 64 zloty 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.630
 I'll do that again though 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.100
 so what do you think of the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.080
 Glotz writes for the comments 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.190
 My favorite weapon will be like I said 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.240
 Not 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.190
 we will meet tonight 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.780

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.410
 because as I said before 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.880
 Of course, the weapons will all be at 500 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.680
 kills jump up name is the fans me
