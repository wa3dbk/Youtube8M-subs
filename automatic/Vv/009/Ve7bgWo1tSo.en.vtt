leveling lift kit so this is the kit
that<00:00:07.170> has<00:00:07.710> basically<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.790> two<00:00:08.970> parts<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.870> go

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
that has basically the two parts to go

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.470 
that has basically the two parts to go
on<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> strut<00:00:10.530> one<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.370> upper<00:00:12.059> strut

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
on the strut one is the upper strut

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.680 
on the strut one is the upper strut
spacer<00:00:13.049> which<00:00:13.440> looks<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:13.799> this<00:00:14.160> they<00:00:15.150> do<00:00:15.210> go

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
spacer which looks like this they do go

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.960 
spacer which looks like this they do go
on<00:00:15.809> directional<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> lower

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
on directional and this is the lower

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.040 
on directional and this is the lower
strut<00:00:18.420> spacer<00:00:20.539> rough<00:00:21.539> country

there<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.650> go<00:00:22.970> so<00:00:23.970> first<00:00:24.210> step<00:00:24.449> take<00:00:25.410> off<00:00:25.619> your

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
there you go so first step take off your

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.630 
there you go so first step take off your
wheel<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.900> use<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> jack<00:00:28.289> stand<00:00:28.320> I've<00:00:29.220> got<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
wheel I use a jack stand I've got the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.339 
wheel I use a jack stand I've got the
jack<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.300> there<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.689> right<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.080> frame

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
jack in there it's right on the frame

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.380 
jack in there it's right on the frame
and<00:00:32.279> then<00:00:32.880> use<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.870> jack<00:00:33.899> stand<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> then

and then use the jack stand and then

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.470 
and then use the jack stand and then
throw<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.570> tire<00:00:36.809> underneath<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:38.270> truck<00:00:39.270> just

ball joint to the last few threads like
I<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.700> saying<00:01:17.060> see<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.240> left<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.659> bolts<00:01:19.020> in

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.249 
place but they're loosened off and now
I'm<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> hit<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.799> ball<00:01:22.799> joint<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:24.259> I

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
I'm going to hit that ball joint and I

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.530 
I'm going to hit that ball joint and I
put<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> jack<00:01:25.799> under<00:01:25.979> there<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.640> won't<00:01:26.759> flop

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
put a jack under there so it won't flop

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
put a jack under there so it won't flop
around<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.020> should<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.320> pop<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:31.909> just<00:01:32.909> like

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
around it should just pop it just like

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.069 
around it should just pop it just like
so<00:01:36.140> you're<00:01:37.140> taking<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.890> control<00:01:38.400> arm

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
so you're taking off this control arm

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
so you're taking off this control arm
the<00:01:40.079> bolt<00:01:40.320> from<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.590> bottom<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.070> believe<00:01:41.310> it's

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the bolt from the bottom I believe it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480 
the bolt from the bottom I believe it's
a<00:01:41.579> 22<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.420> don't<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.320> proper<00:01:43.619> 22<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.340> use

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
a 22 I don't have a proper 22 so I use

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
a 22 I don't have a proper 22 so I use
an<00:01:44.640> adjustable<00:01:45.079> that<00:01:46.079> comes<00:01:46.380> out<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.799> you're

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
an adjustable that comes out and you're

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.139 
an adjustable that comes out and you're
just<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.310> hit<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> bottom<00:01:48.030> and

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
just going to hit it from the bottom and

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.679 
just going to hit it from the bottom and
it<00:01:48.240> pop<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:49.759> I've<00:01:50.759> got<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.180> bolt<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.659> I

the space room put it on there so spacer
only<00:03:09.780> on<00:03:09.900> one<00:03:10.320> way<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:11.130> doesn't<00:03:11.520> look<00:03:11.670> like

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
only on one way it doesn't look like

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.160 
only on one way it doesn't look like
it'll<00:03:12.000> go<00:03:12.180> on<00:03:12.210> different<00:03:12.480> ways<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:12.990> this

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
it'll go on different ways but this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.520 
it'll go on different ways but this
little<00:03:13.440> arrow<00:03:13.740> kind<00:03:14.730> of<00:03:15.050> pointy<00:03:16.050> part<00:03:16.320> there

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
little arrow kind of pointy part there

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.140 
little arrow kind of pointy part there
that's<00:03:16.890> in<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.100> middle<00:03:17.280> that<00:03:17.580> goes<00:03:17.760> towards

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
that's in the middle that goes towards

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:50.809 
that's in the middle that goes towards
the<00:03:18.180> back<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.650> goes<00:03:19.860> back<00:03:19.890> in

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.479

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
then you can choose your bottom spacer

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.280 
then you can choose your bottom spacer
this<00:03:53.670> goes<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.180> backside<00:03:54.749> of<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.989> struck

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
this goes on the backside of the struck

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.239 
this goes on the backside of the struck
it<00:03:55.530> faces<00:03:56.159> in<00:03:56.310> this<00:03:56.459> way<00:03:57.469> so<00:03:58.469> in<00:03:58.680> behind<00:03:59.010> here

00:03:59.239 --> 00:03:59.249 
it faces in this way so in behind here

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.250 
it faces in this way so in behind here
it<00:03:59.489> goes<00:03:59.700> underneath<00:04:00.090> these<00:04:00.389> so<00:04:01.079> you're<00:04:01.170> gonna

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
it goes underneath these so you're gonna

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.910 
it goes underneath these so you're gonna
have<00:04:01.379> to<00:04:01.469> push<00:04:01.680> down<00:04:01.709> and<00:04:03.439> get<00:04:04.439> that<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.739> there

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
have to push down and get that in there

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.050 
have to push down and get that in there
if<00:04:05.010> you<00:04:05.099> can't<00:04:05.340> get<00:04:05.459> in<00:04:05.579> there<00:04:05.730> just<00:04:05.879> by

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
if you can't get in there just by

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.099 
if you can't get in there just by
pushing<00:04:06.269> down<00:04:06.450> you're<00:04:06.659> gonna<00:04:06.780> have<00:04:06.930> to<00:04:06.989> use

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
pushing down you're gonna have to use

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.229 
pushing down you're gonna have to use
something<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.379> pry<00:04:07.650> down<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.250> arm<00:04:08.459> I'm

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
something to pry down that a arm I'm

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.000 
something to pry down that a arm I'm
going<00:04:09.450> to<00:04:09.510> do<00:04:09.629> that<00:04:09.810> now<00:04:11.719> so<00:04:12.719> as<00:04:13.469> you<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:13.799> see

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
going to do that now so as you can see

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.610 
going to do that now so as you can see
here<00:04:14.519> I've<00:04:14.909> got<00:04:15.120> the<00:04:15.389> two<00:04:15.900> bolts<00:04:16.139> in<00:04:16.349> you<00:04:16.500> got

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
here I've got the two bolts in you got

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.810 
here I've got the two bolts in you got
to<00:04:16.709> make<00:04:16.799> sure<00:04:16.949> that<00:04:16.979> they<00:04:17.250> go<00:04:17.370> from<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.639> top

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
to make sure that they go from the top

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.849 
to make sure that they go from the top
down<00:04:18.150> and<00:04:19.019> then<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.259> nuts<00:04:19.440> are<00:04:19.620> going<00:04:19.739> to<00:04:19.799> go

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
down and then the nuts are going to go

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.820 
down and then the nuts are going to go
on<00:04:19.949> the<00:04:20.039> bottom<00:04:20.340> side<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.849> your<00:04:21.239> spacer<00:04:21.840> I

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
actually had to remove the ball joint

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.080 
actually had to remove the ball joint
just<00:04:25.199> because<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.530> couldn't<00:04:25.800> pry<00:04:26.009> it<00:04:26.070> down<00:04:26.310> just

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
just because I couldn't pry it down just

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.700
