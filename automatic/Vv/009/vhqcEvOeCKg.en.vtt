when<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.620> have<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:10.889> massive<00:00:11.400> oil<00:00:11.790> spill<00:00:12.330> in

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
when we have this massive oil spill in

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.419 
when we have this massive oil spill in
the<00:00:12.660> Gulf<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.110> Mexico<00:00:13.170> in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.799> northern<00:00:14.160> part

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
the Gulf of Mexico in the northern part

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.859 
the Gulf of Mexico in the northern part
and<00:00:15.109> of<00:00:16.109> course<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:16.980> South<00:00:17.609> Florida

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
and of course here in South Florida

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.240 
and of course here in South Florida
we're<00:00:18.869> very<00:00:19.080> interested<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.680> how<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.010> may

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
we're very interested in how that may

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.970 
we're very interested in how that may
have<00:00:20.789> some<00:00:21.180> influence<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.869> our<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.650> marine

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
have some influence on our of marine

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.670 
have some influence on our of marine
habitats<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> fisheries<00:00:25.019> impact<00:00:25.380> this<00:00:25.619> bill

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
habitats the fisheries impact this bill

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.900 
habitats the fisheries impact this bill
probably<00:00:26.400> are<00:00:26.820> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.210> major<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:29.789> we

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
probably are going to be major so we

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.089 
probably are going to be major so we
have<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.390> type<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> current<00:00:31.920> which

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
have for this type of current which

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.180 
have for this type of current which
enters<00:00:32.930> Gulf<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.079> Mexico<00:00:34.739> through<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
enters Gulf of Mexico through the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.229

Yucatan<00:00:35.730> Channel<00:00:36.440> and<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.590> course<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
Yucatan Channel and of course here the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.930 
Yucatan Channel and of course here the

loop current loop currently it produces

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.510 
loop current loop currently it produces
little<00:00:42.270> loop<00:00:42.510> here<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.559> little<00:00:43.680> bit<00:00:44.010> up

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
little loop here going a little bit up

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.869 
little loop here going a little bit up
north<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.079> loop<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.649> oscillating<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
north but this loop is oscillating it

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.260 
north but this loop is oscillating it
may<00:00:48.120> move<00:00:48.450> up<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.579> this

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
may move up and down and then this

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
may move up and down and then this
current<00:00:51.539> enters<00:00:52.079> states<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.829> Florida<00:00:53.280> where

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
current enters states of Florida where

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.590 
current enters states of Florida where
it's<00:00:53.670> again<00:00:53.910> called<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.870> Florida<00:00:55.289> current

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's again called the Florida current

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
it's again called the Florida current
and<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.260> leaves<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.710> Florida<00:00:59.129> current

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and when it leaves the Florida current

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.130 
and when it leaves the Florida current
it<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.609> Gulf<00:01:00.570> Stream<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.530> are<00:01:01.649> certain<00:01:02.100> that

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
it is Gulf Stream we are certain that

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.080 
it is Gulf Stream we are certain that
it's<00:01:04.140> such<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> massive<00:01:04.890> oil<00:01:05.040> spill<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.670> it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's such a massive oil spill and it's

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's such a massive oil spill and it's
so<00:01:06.330> relatively<00:01:07.080> close<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> loop<00:01:07.860> current

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so relatively close to the loop current

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
so relatively close to the loop current
that<00:01:08.760> at<00:01:08.939> some<00:01:09.119> point<00:01:09.150> oil<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.530> be

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that at some point oil is going to be

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
that at some point oil is going to be
entrained<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.220> loop<00:01:11.400> current<00:01:11.580> things

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
entrained in the loop current things

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.969 
entrained in the loop current things
that<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> loop<00:01:13.140> current<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.710> travel

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that get in the loop current can travel

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.130 
that get in the loop current can travel
