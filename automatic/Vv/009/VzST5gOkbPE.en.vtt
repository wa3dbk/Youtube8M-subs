00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 yes hello and welcome dear 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.529
 friends to a short gÃ¼nther shadow 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.420
 tutorials robben 2 vr and the units 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 I am working today 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.230
 with a problem since last 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.230
 patch 4 and patch five became acute at 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.720
 Rome 2 was totally and I have already 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.330
 more often problems with the 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.410
 Mouse Control says and many of you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 know the problem 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.449
 you have chosen a unit and up 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.800
 once you move this one but so 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 actually you do not want that at all 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.989
 what you want to do is you want that 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.260
 units was something like that 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.469
 example so and this problem occurs in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.219
 two situations on the first problem 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.079
 has something to do with that first time 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.340
 very close to the unit must be ran 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.710
 to select them if that is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.809
 are relatively close together as well 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.969
 here in the case then you have to be relative 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.289
 close to the one run not the wrong one 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.140
 to go out 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.570
 and on the other side that happens 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:07.200
 problem if you then moved this movement 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.619
 makes and fame uses its own 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.909
 I'll call it rom two now 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 he used his own mouse 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.070
 controller something happened you go 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.990
 well that's what happened and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.060
 This problem arises for her 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.130
 close to this unit ran and from one 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.570
 the unknown reason snaps the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.890
 left mouse button 1 for a certain time 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.659
 and in the moment when you are 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 actually make the selection mark 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.530
 you have to move your unit and 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.630
 your unit makes at once a very 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 funny maneuver that is very annoying 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.299
 Fighting in the distance because they stop 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.710
 to shoot 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.119
 and it is also very annoying 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
 cavalry units because then 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.950
 danger in a case as pure to 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.980
 race or similar and up to this 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.190
 problem comes you can do that 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.810
 I just can not do it right now 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.980
 reproduce because I already have the problem 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.870
 have solved 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.310
 but how it comes to this problem and 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.650
 many of you already know 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.770
 I have explained my videos now and 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.840
 Now I'll show you how to solve it and 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.300
 here we are already at the place of 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.110
 particular presentation 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 you need the file preference script 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:27.320
 and this is in the following 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:29.450
 folder and then users then comes 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.670
 your username is my name 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.820
 just because of that reason that's what it stands for 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.920
 so appdata roaming the creative 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.790
 assembly and then you go to the rome 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.860
 two folders and there you are looking for 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.660
 about the windows search function after the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.150
 file references point script and in 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:57.290
 this file is the most telling 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:03:02.090
 designation battle left click greg move 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:06.709
 delay the fat is called in again 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.860
 a little explanation still little 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.730
 understandable number of second have to 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:18.610
 have mouse click down still and unit like 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 before not every heft click drag action 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:28.820
 packed with a day makes the move 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:31.370
 responsive obviously and that value of 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.800
 is standard and for me he was 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.250
 to zero maybe he is with you 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.260
 different 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:42.980
 that seemed a bit low for me because 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.320
 when i click on a unity clique 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.070
 that delay is only 0 seconds, that is 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.400
 means I choose the unit immediately 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.170
 I choose the unit immediately and 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.770
 User automatically this betclic 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.310
 dirt move delay and that's why I put 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.170
 the now on two file save completely 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.640
 important is that your rom ends two 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.250
 I can not do that anymore 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.840
 otherwise the changes would not be effective 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:12.269
 the value changes to two or three 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.860
 I last two, because a lot 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:17.100
 longer you have to press the left mouse button 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.789
 do not hold down and fix that 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.709
 problem 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.699
 i hope i could help you me 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.500
 happy as always if hers 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:26.240
 comment because I wish all the best 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.240
 which will be good until next time
