 a baking sheet with parchment paper and 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:15.310
 set aside now to put 150 g of 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:29.920
 flour does not fall cariano that we dress now

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.930
 add 100 g of sugar 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.680

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:52.000
 nothing we go on with 200 g of butter 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:02:00.590
 world in pieces and or what I cut it 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:08.240
 so then we add let's go ahead e 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:10.850
 add then place 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.570
 let's go ahead add a teaspoon 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:23.570
 of baking powder so here it is 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:35.900
 nice add and go ahead 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:41.420
 place measuring cup we get go 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:44.140
 forward and clock the knob in the 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.140
 speed 6 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.950
 but you have understood this so let's go 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:06.310
 ahead distribute a little sugar on 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.750
 a plate followed by a little sugar 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.280
 on a plate 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.620
 now let's see what else we need to do 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.570
 so let's go ahead and pick up a 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.170
 spoon of pattern forming a ball 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:24.070
 then with your hands about 4 centimeters then 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.770
 we are removing the cover and these 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.510
 result is that if the dough then now 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.720
 with a spoon I believed a little 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.050
 impact was therefore with a spoon 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:46.000
 we expect a little jump in his hand us 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.910
 we make a ball my balls 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.550
 about 4 cm let's see what else to do then 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.190
 let's proceed support is the ball from a 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.140
 side in the dish with sugar 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:02.500
 let's take the ball back from a 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:04.180
 side we see flatten with the tines of 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 a fork to give a theatrical shape 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.180
 round then a mafia fork we are 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.150
 we see what else to do 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.480
 caceres the prepared baking sheet 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.030
 repeats the operation until completed 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.040
 in the dough and let's go to cook in 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.260
 hot oven for 20 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.330
 tough cookies are golden so now 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.220
 I will arrange to form the balls with 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.810
 dough remained to put it in the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.660
 sugar and square with the fork of 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.810
 flatten and sweeten this cookies 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.720
 the result is the 20 and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.240
 so now let's look at the picture and 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.700
 Click to see what else the body 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.370
 overwhelmed after the deal left here 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:59.940
 we cook in the oven for 20 minutes a 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.940
 180 degrees 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.850
 we then let it cool on one 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.740
 grill before serving or storing 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.270
 a jar with hermetic closure e 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.270
 so we finished our product 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.810
 so now we dream about the market and 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.669
 expect institutions 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.890
 ok these are the biscuits just come out 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.660
 a tip I can give you 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.090
 is to make the little ones because with 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.950
 this is the inter so they grow indeed 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.410
 as you can see they admit grown up 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:32.430
 so let you know you enjoyed it there 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.430
