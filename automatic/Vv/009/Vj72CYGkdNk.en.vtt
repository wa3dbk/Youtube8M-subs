00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
getting past the lightning here cuz I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.839 
getting past the lightning here cuz I
won't<00:02:07.590> consult<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.099> guide<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.489> figure<00:02:08.729> out

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
won't consult the guide to figure out

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.029 
won't consult the guide to figure out
how<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> do<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> right<00:02:09.599> way

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
how to do it the right way

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.870 
how to do it the right way
baboom<00:02:11.039> that's<00:02:11.819> right

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
baboom that's right

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.120 
baboom that's right
it<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.110> was<00:02:14.200> tough<00:02:14.380> folks<00:02:14.680> but<00:02:14.860> we<00:02:14.980> got

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
it was it was tough folks but we got

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.510 
it was it was tough folks but we got
through<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.370> you<00:02:15.610> made<00:02:15.790> it<00:02:15.910> through<00:02:16.320> all<00:02:17.320> right

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
through it you made it through all right

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.880 
through it you made it through all right
so<00:02:18.520> right<00:02:18.940> about<00:02:19.180> here<00:02:19.240> I<00:02:19.750> want<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.440> cross<00:02:20.650> this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
so right about here I want to cross this

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.300 
so right about here I want to cross this
gap<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.580> right<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.650> there's<00:02:23.650> a<00:02:23.740> green<00:02:24.040> key

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
gap to the right and there's a green key

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.820 
gap to the right and there's a green key
keyhole<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.270> green<00:02:25.810> key<00:02:25.990> lock<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.440> tried<00:02:26.770> to

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
keyhole a green key lock I tried to

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.900 
keyhole a green key lock I tried to
figure<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.370> heck<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.610> was<00:02:27.670> supposed

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
figure out what the heck I was supposed

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.240 
figure out what the heck I was supposed
to<00:02:27.970> do<00:02:28.120> with<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.420> and<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.410> went<00:02:29.560> you<00:02:29.980> know<00:02:30.010> up

to do with it and and I went you know up

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.970 
to do with it and and I went you know up
and<00:02:30.280> down<00:02:30.640> back<00:02:31.570> up<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.500> back<00:02:32.680> then<00:02:32.890> I'm

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
and down back up here and back then I'm

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
and down back up here and back then I'm
here<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.520> one<00:02:33.700> time<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.240> hit<00:02:34.540> up<00:02:34.690> once<00:02:34.960> too<00:02:35.170> many

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
here and one time I hit up once too many

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.460 
here and one time I hit up once too many
times<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.980> boom<00:02:36.300> tiny<00:02:37.300> area<00:02:37.780> with<00:02:37.960> green<00:02:38.230> key

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
times and boom tiny area with green key

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.750 
times and boom tiny area with green key
how<00:02:39.040> are<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.550> supposed<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.270> find<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:41.760> also

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
how are you supposed to find that also

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.200 
how are you supposed to find that also
what<00:02:43.750> does<00:02:43.840> this<00:02:43.960> button<00:02:44.170> do<00:02:44.440> oh<00:02:44.910> crap

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210
