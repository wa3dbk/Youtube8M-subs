00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
1 cap this is a the biggest wheel we do

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.390 
1 cap this is a the biggest wheel we do
right<00:00:27.180> now<00:00:27.390> 110<00:00:28.199> millimeter<00:00:28.710> wheel<00:00:28.949> skate

right now 110 millimeter wheel skate
that's<00:00:29.789> huge<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.570> huge<00:00:32.090> this<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.270> out<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
that's huge it's huge this is out of the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.940 
that's huge it's huge this is out of the
tempest<00:00:34.110> family<00:00:34.559> which<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:36.750> lower<00:00:37.590> boot

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
tempest family which is a lower boot

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.619 
tempest family which is a lower boot
that<00:00:38.399> we<00:00:38.579> do<00:00:39.350> it's<00:00:40.350> designed<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.920> actually

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
that we do it's designed to actually

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.720 
that we do it's designed to actually
free<00:00:42.629> up<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.960> ankle<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> skater<00:00:44.309> can

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
free up the ankle so that the skater can

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.990 
free up the ankle so that the skater can
take<00:00:45.719> longer<00:00:45.989> strides<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:47.129> more<00:00:47.520> range<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
take longer strides have more range of

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.319 
take longer strides have more range of
motion<00:00:48.059> more<00:00:48.780> freedom<00:00:50.570> so<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:53.329> put

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
motion more freedom so so that they put

that one except for this one yeah what
we're<00:01:12.510> trying<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.500> you'll<00:01:13.680> notice<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
we're trying to do if you'll notice the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
we're trying to do if you'll notice the
extra<00:01:14.520> ten<00:01:14.939> millimeters<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:15.900> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.409> did<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
extra ten millimeters well if you did it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.789 
extra ten millimeters well if you did it
if<00:01:18.030> you'll<00:01:18.210> notice<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.990> that's<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.619> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
if you'll notice with that that's is it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.520 
if you'll notice with that that's is it
it<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.580> enables<00:01:21.150> us<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> lower<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.810> boot<00:01:21.990> these

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it it enables us to lower the boot these

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
it it enables us to lower the boot these
big<00:01:22.860> wheels<00:01:23.070> pull<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> far<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> ground

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
big wheels pull you far from the ground

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.510 
big wheels pull you far from the ground
this<00:01:25.049> would<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.290> good<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.740> short<00:01:26.040> guy<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
this would be good for a short guy but

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.770 
this would be good for a short guy but
that<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.820> put<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> middle<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.570> whenever

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
that really put a middle there whenever

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.359 
that really put a middle there whenever
we<00:01:28.259> give<00:01:28.409> them<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.619> big<00:01:29.400> Sheila<00:01:30.210> big<00:01:30.390> ego<00:01:30.659> boost

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
we give them a big Sheila big ego boost

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.069 
we give them a big Sheila big ego boost
however<00:01:32.369> what<00:01:33.090> we're<00:01:33.240> trying<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> get

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
however what we're trying to do is get

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
however what we're trying to do is get
the<00:01:34.470> boot<00:01:34.860> as<00:01:35.159> close<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> ground<00:01:35.939> as<00:01:36.180> we

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the boot as close to the ground as we

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.480 
the boot as close to the ground as we
can<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.930> compromises<00:01:37.740> we<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.070> 100

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
can so the compromises we use 100

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.950 
can so the compromises we use 100
millimeter<00:01:38.880> wheel<00:01:39.119> here<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.780> mount

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
millimeter wheel here and we can mount

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.639 
millimeter wheel here and we can mount
the<00:01:40.170> boot<00:01:40.350> lower<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:41.250> notice<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.820> those<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the boot lower you notice how those the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.850 
the boot lower you notice how those the
blue<00:01:44.070> level<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.970> boot<00:01:45.210> yes<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.960> ball<00:01:46.829> of

blue level the boot yes and the ball of

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.700 
blue level the boot yes and the ball of
the<00:01:47.040> foot<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.340> below<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.140> top<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.500> three

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the foot is below the top of the three

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.469 
the foot is below the top of the three
wheels<00:01:49.920> yeah<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.610> we're<00:01:50.729> trying<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.270> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
wheels yeah so we're trying to get that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.359 
wheels yeah so we're trying to get that
skater<00:01:51.780> as<00:01:51.960> low<00:01:52.110> as<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.380> can<00:01:52.590> so<00:01:53.040> we've<00:01:53.220> got<00:01:53.340> a
