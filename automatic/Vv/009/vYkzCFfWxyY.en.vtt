00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 Hello dear musicians in this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.250
 review we will look at cheap electro 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'll say the violin right away 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 I understand issues related to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 choosing electric violins and fiddles in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.470
 Overall because I play the violin 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.930
 only two and a half years and study 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.580
 myself without a teacher so I tell you 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.680
 I will not advise anything 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:30.000
 today we will just look at this 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:34.050
 instrument and listen to it sound she 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.890
 I got attention for 24 thousand 600 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.410
 rubles probably now some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 knowledgeable uncle and beat aunt looking 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.789
 This video and think but you loshara 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.980
 I certainly understand that I screwed up with this 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.899
 a violin but living in a remote village without 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.120
 music stores I had to go 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.129
 to cities over fifty kilometers and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.030
 order this violin musical 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.250
 the store business was in mid january 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.979
 2015, at the height of 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 dollar when prices inflated to heaven 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.250
 maybe buying it later it's me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.250
 got cheaper 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.970
 brought her 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:22.100
 the first plus picking with her was in 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.060
 complete case bow 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 chin-up cord from jack to minijack 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.840
 I once saw in one bourgeois 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.259
 yamaha violin store 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.399
 then it cost 70 1 thousand rubles and this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.380
 It was the summer of 2014 before the fall of the ruble and 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.100
 in the configuration she had only 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.640
 cardboard box and all 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 2 plus is very convenient to speak and and not 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.340
 need to sound microphones and nothing 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.340
 to others 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.550
 and if there are radio stations there is confusion 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.820
 with cords will not be our planted and I 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:03.080
 she is not there before her I played acoustics with 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.119
 a cherub pickup for 200 rubles 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:11.790
 the final sound was difficult to call sound 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.790
 rather bang and noise 3 plus it can 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.870
 be and cherish well of course it 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.590
 sound 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.630
 compared to acoustic instruments 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.510
 voiced by che robo final sound with 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.209
 scenes pleasant of course there are such 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.090
 types of people who sound electric violin 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:35.180
 do not accept the pier 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.180
 synthetic well not for me to judge them 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.310
 minus 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.819
 Well, finally we come to this topic 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:50.849
 probably went the most important minus 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:53.950
 This tool is of course defects 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.470
 when you buy a musical instrument 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.680
 as a kettle, take with you a knower 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.410
 man if there is such a thing that me 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.380
 there was not that he poked his nose 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.720
 if something is wrong with the tool first 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.030
 the defect was that of a violin 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.480
 was too hard and spanned 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.970
 the strings lay straight on the neck I had to 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:20.549
 take a file hacksaw skin glue 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.220
 add old porozhek and cut out a new 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.950
 2 defect it can and not defect after 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.450
 as I connected it to the amplifier I heard 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.450
 very unpleasant background 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.460
 I had to stretch the recoil wire like 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.320
 tailpiece so that time 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:46.010
 fingers touching the strings background 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.260
 disappeared there is another nuance of this of course 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.870
 same without violin compared to 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:57.940
 acoustic instrument he's heavy but 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:04:01.880
 you can get used to postcards 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.270
 A little and its manufacturer's sensors as 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.430
 and the violin itself is unknown I shoveled 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.550
 all internet but about this sensor so 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.040
 I did not find anything, too, there are no pictures 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.910
 Only the fact that it is actively powered 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.709
 from the crown we see on it two twists 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:24.920
 volume and tons 3 outputs linear instant 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:27.880
 headphones and fiddle herself like 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.850
 not bad done no cracks of curvature 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:37.930
 I did not find potholes for painting claims 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.930
 also not . 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.870
 and 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.639
 not 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.340
 Well 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
 and 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.460
 and 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.390
 did not throw 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.070
 at 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:47.100
 Well 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.100
 and
