the dials and buttons and switches are

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.039 
the dials and buttons and switches are
and<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.240> they<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:29.570> finally<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.020> have

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and what they do and finally you have

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
and what they do and finally you have
the<00:01:31.680> four<00:01:32.250> settings<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:33.570> over<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the four settings they go over the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
the four settings they go over the
settings<00:01:34.290> which<00:01:34.979> are<00:01:35.159> stereo<00:01:35.729> cardioid

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
settings which are stereo cardioid

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.660 
settings which are stereo cardioid
omnidirectional<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.650> by<00:01:37.860> directional<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
omnidirectional and by directional and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.969 
omnidirectional and by directional and
it<00:01:39.509> says<00:01:39.810> what<00:01:40.229> they're<00:01:40.380> good<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
it says what they're good for

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.840 
it says what they're good for
so<00:01:41.790> for<00:01:42.450> example<00:01:42.509> cardioid<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.829> says<00:01:44.430> here

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
so for example cardioid it says here

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.910 
so for example cardioid it says here
recommended<00:01:45.600> for<00:01:45.750> podcast<00:01:46.259> voiceovers

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
