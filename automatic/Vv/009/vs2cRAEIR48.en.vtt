00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.760
 Hello and welcome to Atom Gamer 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.360
 and indeed, the two types of videos have succeeded in getting a leg 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.349
 so this subfunction so function for the PlayStation 3 a 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:12.899
 the number of currently approx 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:13.799
 the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.259
 not quite 9 in the ventilation in the ventilation shaft 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:19.529
 hidden subfunction 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.359
 annoyingly Serviced it means if you can 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.730
 breaks down or should he said it was too loud 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.630
 look the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.569
 with this and that's how it works 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.289
 but most use these and those for and for 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.950
 Internal cleaning in Yangon 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.670
 it's just 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 very conditionally necessary 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.370
 it's true that dust 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.280
 coming in from the institution and to the election 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.890
 this has to do now every month as I have heard or 19 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 specially made for it probably is not true 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.760
 Embarrassing is most of the time the air comes out in the air now 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.110
 for the older models this is true from the beginning 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.649
 for the eighties yet 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.649
 from the side up 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.550
 by brands 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.400
 the air comes in front 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.590
 a part 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740
 to show a niche segment 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.600
 what looks like this is here 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.090
 the left side 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.970
 right side 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.960
 bottom left 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 is 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.969
 Delius slots for crime in the archives is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.830
 it means air 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.300
 Come visit from below 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.630
 has come up high now 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.170
 Zander side very little 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 One can also sense with this feature where most airspaces are not so good 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.100
 going 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.520
 the warm air comes out at the top 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.140
 even from the hard drive 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.000
 is extra here you can do everything and back 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.390
 are enough after all 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.000
 After all, there is still a gap in Volume 3 Klein 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.510
 Louvers to 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.270
 So high is not only the best 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.710
 Warm air will come out this year 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.189
 do not really have to if we communicate 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.229
 around 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.749
 except 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.799
 the consumer would have built my part 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.969
 I'm standing here in Greens yet that does not make you the most heat 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.499
 but they wanted to recognize the body again in the sockets 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.649
 So it's only one 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:31.669
 Features of the country but most use Sissi not bad 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:33.990
 two now 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.209
 that you have the ten motifs number of hours so many 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.249
 so that it does not overheat so exceeded 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.049
 in the new models happens rarely 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:44.889
 possible 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:46.669
 a lot of money 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:48.289
 Hardcore 

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.249
 to hold for a year 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.009
 the same as 84 hours played until 10 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.339
 waalre 

00:02:58.339 --> 00:03:01.339
 no problem 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.129
 that nothing 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.249
 if you do not do it 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:07.249
 and once dust makes time 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.939
 slightly exaggerated though 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:15.299
 ten times as silly and dusting helps mostly 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:20.009
 because not everywhere in the air is so much dust that she goes with it 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:27.089
 just for info 

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:31.109
 I am also no luck failed comments if that's the case 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.559
 a lot of fun
