membrane<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.950> let's<00:02:08.099> take<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> closer<00:02:08.640> look<00:02:08.789> at

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
membrane so let's take a closer look at

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720 
membrane so let's take a closer look at
this<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:10.470> respiratory<00:02:10.800> membrane<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.430> made<00:02:11.580> up

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
this the respiratory membrane is made up

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.970 
this the respiratory membrane is made up
of<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.970> single<00:02:12.239> epithelial<00:02:13.170> cell

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
of a single epithelial cell

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.970 
of a single epithelial cell
as<00:02:14.250> part<00:02:14.579> of<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> alveolar<00:02:15.239> wall<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:15.840> with<00:02:16.769> all

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
as part of the alveolar wall as with all

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.160 
as part of the alveolar wall as with all
epithelial<00:02:17.640> cells<00:02:17.909> this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.689> accompanied<00:02:19.140> by

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
epithelial cells this is accompanied by

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.190 
epithelial cells this is accompanied by
a<00:02:19.349> basement<00:02:19.950> membrane<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.200> capillary

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
a basement membrane on the capillary

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.530 
a basement membrane on the capillary
side<00:02:22.439> there<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.069> thin<00:02:23.430> layer<00:02:23.670> made<00:02:24.269> up<00:02:24.390> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
side there is a thin layer made up of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.190 
side there is a thin layer made up of
single<00:02:24.840> endothelial<00:02:25.799> cells<00:02:26.659> this<00:02:27.659> minimal

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
single endothelial cells this minimal

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.459 
single endothelial cells this minimal
barrier<00:02:28.560> allows<00:02:29.010> carbon<00:02:29.790> dioxide<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.569> oxygen

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
barrier allows carbon dioxide and oxygen

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:33.920 
barrier allows carbon dioxide and oxygen
to<00:02:32.099> readily<00:02:32.400> diffuse<00:02:32.849> across<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.450> membrane

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
to readily diffuse across the membrane

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.610 
to readily diffuse across the membrane
down<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.739> partial<00:02:35.189> pressure<00:02:35.400> gradients

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
down there partial pressure gradients

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.349 
down there partial pressure gradients
this<00:02:37.620> was<00:02:37.799> the<00:02:37.889> process<00:02:38.159> of<00:02:38.459> alveolar<00:02:38.909> gaseous

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
this was the process of alveolar gaseous

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.479 
this was the process of alveolar gaseous
