that these desktop icons can be locked

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.750 
that these desktop icons can be locked
they<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.110> also<00:01:10.290> be<00:01:10.530> positioned<00:01:11.130> relative<00:01:11.340> to

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
each other via alignments or you can

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.130 
each other via alignments or you can
even<00:01:14.340> change<00:01:14.640> their<00:01:14.909> z-order<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:15.990> can

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
even change their z-order so you can

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.380 
even change their z-order so you can
overlap<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.710> have<00:01:17.220> them<00:01:17.340> always<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.180> top

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
overlap them have them always on top

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.630 
overlap them have them always on top
send<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> z<00:01:19.799> stack<00:01:20.100> etc

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
send them to the back of the z stack etc

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.550 
send them to the back of the z stack etc
so<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.090> they<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> be<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.170> front<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.470> each

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
so they can they can be in front of each

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.990 
so they can they can be in front of each
other<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.369> nice<00:01:23.520> if<00:01:23.700> you're<00:01:23.820> trying

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
clicking a single box so that's built

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.389 
clicking a single box so that's built
into<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> system<00:01:54.119> very<00:01:54.420> easy<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> this

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
into the system very easy to use so this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.190 
into the system very easy to use so this
is<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:56.909> like<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:57.329> Start<00:01:57.600> button<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:58.020> here

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
is also like your Start button up here

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.510 
is also like your Start button up here
they've<00:01:58.380> moved<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.189> configure

which<00:02:07.799> i<00:02:07.920> think<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.429> lot<00:02:08.789> better<00:02:09.060> than

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
which i think is a lot better than

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.639 
which i think is a lot better than

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
notice as I drag this up I can increase

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.050 
notice as I drag this up I can increase
the<00:03:33.900> amount<00:03:34.230> or<00:03:35.130> decrease<00:03:35.459> it<00:03:35.640> or<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.820> could<00:03:35.880> do

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
the amount or decrease it or I could do

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
the amount or decrease it or I could do
it<00:03:36.180> incrementally<00:03:36.510> using<00:03:37.380> these<00:03:37.500> buttons<00:03:37.739> I

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
probably going to have to get a program

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.920 
probably going to have to get a program
like<00:04:55.500> XML<00:04:55.950> notepad<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.420> you<00:04:57.540> can<00:04:57.720> edit
