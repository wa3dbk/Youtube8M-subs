what we've just done and that's all
there<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.760> it

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
there is to it

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.030 
there is to it
playing<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.080> crochet<00:02:36.500> thread<00:02:36.770> or

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040

dental floss sometimes dental floss
might<00:02:38.690> actually<00:02:38.840> be<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.080> little<00:02:39.140> bit<00:02:39.380> easier

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
might actually be a little bit easier

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.170 
might actually be a little bit easier
because<00:02:39.860> it's<00:02:40.160> thinner<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.580> just<00:02:40.760> use<00:02:40.850> crochet

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
because it's thinner I just use crochet

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.760 
because it's thinner I just use crochet
thread<00:02:41.420> because<00:02:41.750> I'm<00:02:41.959> in<00:02:42.110> my<00:02:42.140> craft<00:02:42.470> room<00:02:42.560> and

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
thread because I'm in my craft room and

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.210 
thread because I'm in my craft room and
that's<00:02:42.860> handy<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.920> basically<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.130> the<00:02:46.160> same

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
that's handy but basically it's the same

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.530 
that's handy but basically it's the same
technique<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.940> can<00:02:47.060> pull<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.360> yarn

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
technique and you can pull the yarn

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.300 
technique and you can pull the yarn
right<00:02:47.750> through<00:02:47.990> there<00:02:48.140> obviously<00:02:49.010> there<00:02:49.190> will

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
right through there obviously there will

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.890 
right through there obviously there will
be<00:02:49.370> an<00:02:49.520> upper<00:02:49.790> limit<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:50.150> couldn't<00:02:50.450> get<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.570> super

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
be an upper limit I couldn't get a super
