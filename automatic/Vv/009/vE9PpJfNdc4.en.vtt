00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
get a ballpark idea of what your macros

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.960 
get a ballpark idea of what your macros
should<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.860> how<00:03:53.130> well<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.940> how

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
should be but it's how well and how

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.360 
should be but it's how well and how
efficiently<00:03:54.720> you<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.560> adjust<00:03:56.190> those

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
efficiently you can adjust those

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.069 
efficiently you can adjust those
macronutrients<00:03:56.730> as<00:03:57.269> you<00:03:57.480> progress<00:03:57.660> in<00:03:58.019> your

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
macronutrients as you progress in your

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.640 
macronutrients as you progress in your
diet<00:03:58.320> and<00:03:58.590> when<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.640> adjust<00:04:00.030> them<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.650> that's

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
diet and when you adjust them so that's

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.560 
diet and when you adjust them so that's
what's<00:04:01.950> really<00:04:02.160> key<00:04:02.489> in<00:04:02.730> a<00:04:02.880> good<00:04:03.060> solid<00:04:03.269> diet

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
what's really key in a good solid diet

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.569 
what's really key in a good solid diet
so<00:04:03.870> this<00:04:04.079> is<00:04:04.260> the<00:04:04.380> macros<00:04:04.829> that<00:04:05.070> cow<00:04:05.280> hunt

kept the car back I'd the carbohydrate

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.210 
kept the car back I'd the carbohydrate
it's<00:04:44.060> pretty<00:04:44.360> high<00:04:44.590> we<00:04:45.590> kept<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.950> fats

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
it's pretty high we kept the fats

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.040 
it's pretty high we kept the fats
actually<00:04:46.460> moderately<00:04:47.360> low<00:04:47.630> they're<00:04:47.930> not

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
shred weight pretty fast the first like

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.200 
shred weight pretty fast the first like
a<00:05:17.620> couple<00:05:18.620> of<00:05:18.680> months<00:05:18.980> of<00:05:19.100> a<00:05:19.160> diet<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:20.090> the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
a couple of months of a diet so the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.820 
a couple of months of a diet so the
first<00:05:20.450> two<00:05:20.630> weeks<00:05:20.870> I<00:05:21.020> should<00:05:21.170> respond<00:05:21.560> pretty

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
first two weeks I should respond pretty

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.310 
first two weeks I should respond pretty
well<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:22.190> this<00:05:22.660> tighten<00:05:23.660> ups<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.930> little<00:05:24.200> bit

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
well to this tighten ups a little bit

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.360 
well to this tighten ups a little bit
since<00:05:24.500> it's<00:05:24.650> not<00:05:24.740> like<00:05:24.890> I<00:05:24.950> have<00:05:25.070> a<00:05:25.100> whole<00:05:25.220> lot

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
since it's not like I have a whole lot

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.560 
since it's not like I have a whole lot
of<00:05:25.400> fat<00:05:25.670> to<00:05:25.820> actually<00:05:26.060> lose<00:05:26.240> that's<00:05:26.420> gonna

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
of fat to actually lose that's gonna

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.980 
of fat to actually lose that's gonna
harden<00:05:26.900> up<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.320> then<00:05:28.250> the<00:05:28.880> 3000<00:05:29.420> calorie<00:05:29.720> diet

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
harden up and then the 3000 calorie diet

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.440 
harden up and then the 3000 calorie diet
should<00:05:30.260> kind<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.470> allowed<00:05:30.800> me<00:05:31.040> to<00:05:31.270> plateau<00:05:32.270> and

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
should kind of allowed me to plateau and

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.570 
should kind of allowed me to plateau and
maintain<00:05:32.930> at<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.230> point<00:05:33.470> because<00:05:33.620> again<00:05:34.040> 3k

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
maintain at that point because again 3k

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.630 
maintain at that point because again 3k
is<00:05:35.380> not<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> deficit<00:05:36.980> for<00:05:37.130> me<00:05:37.250> when<00:05:37.370> I'm<00:05:37.460> only<00:05:37.550> a

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 
is not a deficit for me when I'm only a

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.710 
is not a deficit for me when I'm only a
hundred<00:05:37.850> and<00:05:37.880> seventy-three<00:05:38.240> pounds<00:05:38.600> that's

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
hundred and seventy-three pounds that's

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.330 
hundred and seventy-three pounds that's
actually<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.050> good<00:05:39.320> amount<00:05:39.500> of<00:05:39.650> calories<00:05:40.070> to

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 
actually a good amount of calories to

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.800 
actually a good amount of calories to
maintain<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:41.060> keep<00:05:41.150> adding<00:05:41.360> on<00:05:41.570> lean<00:05:41.780> muscle

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 
maintain and keep adding on lean muscle

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.290 
maintain and keep adding on lean muscle
with<00:05:42.290> so<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.070> game<00:05:43.220> plan<00:05:43.430> basically<00:05:43.700> is<00:05:44.030> at<00:05:44.270> a

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
with so the game plan basically is at a

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.090 
with so the game plan basically is at a
slight<00:05:44.690> deficit<00:05:45.200> in<00:05:45.320> the<00:05:45.380> beginning<00:05:45.830> compared

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
slight deficit in the beginning compared

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.770 
slight deficit in the beginning compared
to<00:05:46.160> what<00:05:46.310> I've<00:05:46.400> been<00:05:46.640> taking<00:05:47.000> in<00:05:47.150> hopefully

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:47.780 
to what I've been taking in hopefully

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.080 
to what I've been taking in hopefully
hardened<00:05:48.380> me<00:05:48.440> up<00:05:48.530> a<00:05:48.620> little<00:05:48.800> bit<00:05:49.160> first<00:05:49.760> couple

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
hardened me up a little bit first couple

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.150 
hardened me up a little bit first couple
of<00:05:50.150> weeks<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.660> then<00:05:51.260> hopefully<00:05:51.500> allow<00:05:51.890> me<00:05:52.040> to

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
of weeks and then hopefully allow me to

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.890 
of weeks and then hopefully allow me to
just<00:05:52.280> continue<00:05:52.760> maintaining<00:05:53.000> and<00:05:53.510> slowly

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
just continue maintaining and slowly

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.840 
just continue maintaining and slowly
adding<00:05:54.440> on<00:05:54.590> lean<00:05:54.800> muscle<00:05:54.830> as<00:05:55.190> we<00:05:55.340> go<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:55.760> then

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
adding on lean muscle as we go and then

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.370 
adding on lean muscle as we go and then
of<00:05:55.940> course<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.360> diet<00:05:56.540> will<00:05:56.660> be<00:05:56.750> adjusted<00:05:57.230> I

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
of course the diet will be adjusted I

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.490 
of course the diet will be adjusted I
