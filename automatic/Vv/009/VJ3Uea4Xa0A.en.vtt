00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
impacted by Hurricane Ike and we

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.600 
impacted by Hurricane Ike and we

actually had but five and a half feet of
water<00:00:43.700> in<00:00:44.690> our<00:00:45.079> downstairs<00:00:45.350> so<00:00:45.950> to<00:00:46.700> say<00:00:46.910> we

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
water in our downstairs so to say we

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.580 
water in our downstairs so to say we
were<00:00:47.149> impacted<00:00:47.780> would<00:00:47.870> be<00:00:47.989> an<00:00:48.320> understatement

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
were impacted would be an understatement

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.819

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
cube with the thought that we could take

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.049 
cube with the thought that we could take
some<00:00:53.930> of<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.350> fish<00:00:54.559> out<00:00:55.070> of<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.309> main<00:00:55.489> display

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
use it on my main tank sorry about that

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.210 
use it on my main tank sorry about that
and<00:03:38.620> it's<00:03:39.620> it's<00:03:40.070> just<00:03:40.250> too<00:03:40.370> small<00:03:40.610> it's<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:40.970> 1/10

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
and it's it's just too small it's a 1/10

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.470 
and it's it's just too small it's a 1/10
horsepower<00:03:43.220> chiller<00:03:43.519> and<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.880> just<00:03:44.150> was<00:03:44.299> not

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
horsepower chiller and it just was not

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.670 
horsepower chiller and it just was not
enough<00:03:45.820> to<00:03:46.820> chill<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.570> big<00:03:47.750> display<00:03:48.230> tank

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680

enough to chill the the big display tank
so<00:03:50.049> since<00:03:51.049> upgraded<00:03:51.590> those<00:03:51.739> jokes<00:03:52.010> but<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.549> have

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
so since upgraded those jokes but I have

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.440 
so since upgraded those jokes but I have
decided<00:03:54.560> that<00:03:55.989> since<00:03:57.610> since<00:03:58.610> I<00:03:58.730> tore<00:03:58.970> down<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
actually really likes the fish moving

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.640 
actually really likes the fish moving
around<00:04:36.550> so<00:04:37.170> but<00:04:38.170> since<00:04:38.410> moving<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:40.650> toadstool

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
around so but since moving the toadstool

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.210 
around so but since moving the toadstool
leathers<00:04:42.100> back<00:04:42.940> into<00:04:43.270> this<00:04:43.420> tank<00:04:43.750> they<00:04:44.170> I<00:04:44.560> just

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
leathers back into this tank they I just

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.680 
leathers back into this tank they I just
don't<00:04:45.550> think<00:04:45.730> there's<00:04:45.880> enough<00:04:46.090> lighting<00:04:46.540> with

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
don't think there's enough lighting with

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.960 
don't think there's enough lighting with
the<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:47.230> standard<00:04:47.650> power<00:04:47.890> compact<00:04:48.580> center

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
the the standard power compact center

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.410 
the the standard power compact center
that<00:04:49.690> are<00:04:49.810> in<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.170> tank<00:04:50.440> so<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> tentacles

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
that are in this tank so the tentacles

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.730 
that are in this tank so the tentacles
never<00:04:52.630> really<00:04:52.930> come<00:04:53.140> out<00:04:53.290> and<00:04:55.740> they're

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
never really come out and they're

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.440 
never really come out and they're
suffering<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.430> little<00:04:57.550> bit<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:57.850> don't<00:04:57.970> they're

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450

not<00:04:58.660> they're<00:04:59.050> definitely<00:04:59.230> not<00:04:59.590> growing<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
not they're definitely not growing and

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.630 
not they're definitely not growing and
there's<00:05:02.260> enough<00:05:02.530> there's<00:05:02.710> three<00:05:03.010> toadstools

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
there's enough there's three toadstools

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.500 
there's enough there's three toadstools
in<00:05:03.820> here<00:05:04.000> one's<00:05:04.240> lower<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:06.790> smaller<00:05:07.210> one

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
in here one's lower the smaller one

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.600 
in here one's lower the smaller one
that's<00:05:07.690> up<00:05:07.930> higher<00:05:08.200> on<00:05:08.560> the<00:05:08.830> back<00:05:09.040> right<00:05:09.310> hand

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
that's up higher on the back right hand

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:15.540 
that's up higher on the back right hand
side<00:05:10.770> up<00:05:11.770> here<00:05:12.990> is<00:05:14.010> you<00:05:15.010> know<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.280> looked

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
side up here is you know it looked

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.390 
side up here is you know it looked
better<00:05:15.850> than<00:05:16.120> the<00:05:16.240> one<00:05:16.390> that's<00:05:16.510> down<00:05:17.220> see<00:05:18.220> if<00:05:18.250> I

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
better than the one that's down see if I

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.490 
better than the one that's down see if I
can<00:05:18.520> get<00:05:18.640> my<00:05:18.760> finger<00:05:19.150> in<00:05:19.200> there's<00:05:20.200> one<00:05:20.350> right

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
can get my finger in there's one right

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.310 
can get my finger in there's one right
there<00:05:20.860> that's<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:22.120> little<00:05:22.300> one<00:05:22.570> it's<00:05:22.840> not<00:05:23.020> doing

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
there that's a little one it's not doing

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.100 
there that's a little one it's not doing
real<00:05:23.530> well<00:05:24.150> and<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.330> think<00:05:25.720> it's<00:05:25.840> just<00:05:25.900> all

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
real well and I think it's just all

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.930 
real well and I think it's just all
because<00:05:26.350> the<00:05:26.440> lights<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.830> it's<00:05:27.430> just<00:05:27.490> got<00:05:27.820> the

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
because the lights I it's just got the

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.130 
because the lights I it's just got the
standard<00:05:28.300> power<00:05:28.570> compacts<00:05:29.110> in<00:05:29.350> here<00:05:31.140> right

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
standard power compacts in here right

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.040 
standard power compacts in here right
now<00:05:32.170> I'm<00:05:32.470> just<00:05:32.680> running<00:05:33.010> the<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:34.330> 12<00:05:34.570> K<00:05:34.780> bulb

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
now I'm just running the the 12 K bulb

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.240 
now I'm just running the the 12 K bulb
I'm<00:05:35.200> not<00:05:35.350> running<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.680> attending<00:05:36.010> bulb

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
I'm not running the attending bulb

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.650 
I'm not running the attending bulb
because<00:05:36.430> that<00:05:36.550> kicks<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.880> fans<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.390> it<00:05:37.510> makes

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
because that kicks the fans on it makes

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.870 
because that kicks the fans on it makes
a<00:05:37.810> lot<00:05:37.930> of<00:05:37.990> noise<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.530> so<00:05:39.280> I'm<00:05:39.400> not<00:05:39.580> running

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
a lot of noise so so I'm not running

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.760 
a lot of noise so so I'm not running
that<00:05:40.030> that<00:05:40.450> bowl<00:05:40.690> right<00:05:40.900> now<00:05:40.930> it<00:05:41.200> does<00:05:41.500> look<00:05:41.710> a

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
that that bowl right now it does look a

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.960 
that that bowl right now it does look a
little<00:05:41.890> better<00:05:42.100> when<00:05:42.340> both<00:05:42.550> of<00:05:42.580> them<00:05:42.820> are

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
little better when both of them are

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.360 
little better when both of them are
running<00:05:43.270> but<00:05:43.620> but<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:44.770> just<00:05:44.950> doesn't<00:05:45.250> have

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
running but but it just doesn't have

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.390 
running but but it just doesn't have
enough<00:05:45.400> light<00:05:45.910> in<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.810> so<00:05:47.050> I<00:05:47.350> have<00:05:47.770> decided

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
enough light in it so I have decided

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.260 
enough light in it so I have decided
that<00:05:48.760> I'm<00:05:48.970> going<00:05:49.210> to<00:05:49.270> go<00:05:49.420> ahead<00:05:49.540> and<00:05:49.870> upgrade

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:51.270 
that I'm going to go ahead and upgrade

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.020 
that I'm going to go ahead and upgrade
the<00:05:52.270> lighting<00:05:52.660> fixture<00:05:53.200> in<00:05:54.190> this

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
the lighting fixture in this

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.060 
the lighting fixture in this
system<00:05:55.570> and<00:05:55.720> I<00:05:55.810> thought<00:05:56.340> that<00:05:58.500> i'ma<00:05:59.500> go<00:05:59.650> ahead

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
system and I thought that i'ma go ahead

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.010 
system and I thought that i'ma go ahead
make<00:06:00.250> a<00:06:00.310> video<00:06:00.640> series<00:06:00.910> of<00:06:01.240> that<00:06:01.390> and<00:06:01.810> see

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
make a video series of that and see

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.220 
make a video series of that and see
because<00:06:02.920> I<00:06:03.130> looked<00:06:03.790> around<00:06:03.910> at<00:06:04.420> and<00:06:04.900> I've<00:06:05.020> seen

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
because I looked around at and I've seen

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.770 
because I looked around at and I've seen
some<00:06:05.410> other<00:06:05.500> people<00:06:05.920> have<00:06:06.220> done<00:06:06.460> some<00:06:07.360> some

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
some other people have done some some

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.820 
some other people have done some some
lighting<00:06:08.080> upgrades<00:06:08.700> a<00:06:09.960> little<00:06:10.960> bio<00:06:11.320> cubes<00:06:11.710> and

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
lighting upgrades a little bio cubes and

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.500 
lighting upgrades a little bio cubes and
they<00:06:11.950> look<00:06:12.190> dramatically<00:06:12.880> better<00:06:13.120> and<00:06:13.420> it

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
they look dramatically better and it

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.930 
they look dramatically better and it
doesn't<00:06:13.620> the<00:06:14.620> cost<00:06:14.920> to<00:06:15.250> do<00:06:15.430> a<00:06:15.460> lighting

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
doesn't the cost to do a lighting

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.730 
doesn't the cost to do a lighting
upgrade<00:06:16.270> on<00:06:16.450> these<00:06:16.570> bio<00:06:16.810> cubes<00:06:17.140> isn't<00:06:17.470> nearly

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
upgrade on these bio cubes isn't nearly

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.250 
upgrade on these bio cubes isn't nearly
as<00:06:17.890> expensive<00:06:18.250> as<00:06:18.700> like<00:06:19.540> my<00:06:19.690> main<00:06:19.840> display

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 
as expensive as like my main display

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.500 
as expensive as like my main display
tank<00:06:20.290> that's<00:06:20.830> that's<00:06:21.190> gonna<00:06:21.400> be<00:06:21.610> thousands<00:06:22.420> of
