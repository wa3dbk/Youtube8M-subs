00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.919
 of our channel with you Iâ€™m at once full and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.070
 Today I will tell you how to get rid of 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.200
 lags absolutely any game I do this to us 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.839
 need a program 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 razer game booster him which can 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:22.609
 download on featherton dot com 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.109
 slash game booster you download and 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:30.599
 establish 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.470
 and so while i'm picking places 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.110
 destination 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.579
 where and stop and so on I tell you 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.770
 I will say a few words about this program for 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.420
 the program helps speed up your 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.969
 computer even if you have very much 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.270
 computer I advise you to use it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.570
 since this program includes 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:01:00.899
 unnecessary programs that you have 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.030
 work continues your computer when 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.619
 the help of this game I whale sought 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 results of raising show this ps3 qi 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.930
 recurrence such as son term for the line not a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.720
 30 fps at maximum settings with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.720
 help razer game booster I seek in 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.710
 paul 60 62 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:27.920
 so we downloaded we click finish 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.920
 we learned that piece of remove 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.830
 just pearl that the record was not ours 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:46.320
 files let's start all over again I 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 explain how you should register 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.100
 I will show you how to change 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 user so in general you create 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.180
 Account 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.180
 and then here you are kernels come in 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:15.510
 so we go here we went 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:22.100
 first we can customize our 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:27.840
 the program is clear here you can 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.900
 a recipe to dig but I'm not much into this 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.180
 I understand and therefore I do not climb here and 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.459
 it actually for this, we do not 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.709
 I recommend so we go into the settings 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.690
 here you can change the language 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.870
 I even recommend changing the language to 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.220
 Russian is it supported you go to 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.500
 construction site and so here we are from the settings you can 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.640
 set up anyway tel notification 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.319
 everything is there and how many seconds will it be 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.769
 speed up the game before launching bright everything 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:08.280
 for the site the most minimal additional 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.299
 here you can enable the game mode 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.079
 eat it grill understand 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:15.079
 mood of someone and 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:22.950
 Proxy is also possible he 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.880
 I didn't use screen capture 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.579
 I want to try it somehow and there even in pps 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.590
 here shows write now it 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:36.170
 I'll try and tell you later, well, the main 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.400
 function 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:44.310
 acceleration of games click add in the window 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.079
 launch we click add choose 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.590
 here 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:53.160
 label you can choose deshek April want 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.459
 call of duty 4 speed up whitford portal 2 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:04:02.459
 and stalker sims row 2 l 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:07.519
 tom clancy's and it seems I have nothing 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:11.150
 more of this and friends no way 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.000
 Goal one by one only oh well 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.419
 I'll tell you the details of this program. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.769
 and made her pens by the way are not removed with 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.340
 screens for you add 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.830
 and this program can also perceive 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.470
 games and and steam and if you have a credit 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.930
 on screen or somewhere in folders 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:37.370
 you add this and add here 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.699
 enough here let's say I and by the way they 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.330
 You can bring so much 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:47.300
 easier here you press run you 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.520
 waiting for a second report from me for example 4 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.930
 seconds because here are the settings 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.580
 and I set four seconds possible 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.120
 Principle 10 I recommend 4 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.270
 because the program is minimized 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:08.120
 the game starts and you see you are ruining and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:10.699
 tide pps your game also say that 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.669
 it all depends on your computer and game 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.349
 of you have r computer and basically like u 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.800
 me and you try to run 

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:23.090
 battlefield 4 I do not envy you because 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:27.020
 which is nothing of such tremendous effect 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:30.050
 you would not notice a rush of traffic accident with 5 well 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.110
 because i fell out filty seeing here personally 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.760
 My computer 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:39.050
 about knowing your category you can even 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:42.919
 say so well, and this principle is all 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:47.720
 what I wanted to tell you by the way is 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:49.250
 works with regge games which ways 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.490
 increase fps 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:58.789
 well, for example through the contour alt david well 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:06:01.610
 or rather through the task manager you are now 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.780
 do not see my screen now you 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.300
 must see so we need to store 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.849
 the game is running and not necessarily the game 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.580
 can there in another example be shown well 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:16.849
 let's say you played for example a 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:21.099
 sprint he's whole it yes he you be here 

00:06:16.849 --> 00:06:26.270
 carved push it right reeds 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:30.500
 set priority and set a high 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:35.960
 then you will just have not manifested a 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:39.289
 song 10-15 this every that is such 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.800
 way also i way is setting 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:48.349
 new patches it is natural there fixes 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:51.759
 all there with DPS 35 but still something 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:55.219
 gives and also various third-party 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:59.659
 installation programs can be achieved 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:01.129
 lifting fps that is for minecraft it 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:01.940
 for example optifine and all sorts of other 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.360
 programs 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:08.090
 I know programs that are mods that 

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.819
 adding 5 fps there that is it a little but 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:13.759
 if you pick up ten pieces you already 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:17.389
 tide with 50 will be and that is this it 

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:21.050
 cool so i told you everything except 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:23.120
 what else to say what shows 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.650
 temperature hard discs 40 degrees 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:30.520
 cpu see he 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:33.550
 his temperature drops 

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:37.849
 Fahrenheit in Celsius is shown 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.940
 Tips we are already bathing and watching 

00:07:37.849 --> 00:07:43.159
 what functions does it have and whiskey 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:46.129
 Bruce tried to capture the screen 

00:07:43.159 --> 00:07:49.719
 thank you all and all the best of luck and while the cork 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.719
 it was all that was all
