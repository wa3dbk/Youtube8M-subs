I will have to admit that there was a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.979 
I will have to admit that there was a
little<00:01:02.579> bit<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.850> concern<00:01:03.239> about<00:01:03.300> college

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989

students painting my home I wasn't quite

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.520 
students painting my home I wasn't quite
sure<00:01:05.820> if<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.960> were<00:01:07.050> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.410> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
sure if they were going to have the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
sure if they were going to have the
experience<00:01:08.009> they<00:01:08.190> needed<00:01:08.610> when<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:08.970> was

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
experience they needed when I was

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
experience they needed when I was
approached<00:01:09.509> by<00:01:09.600> someone<00:01:10.020> from<00:01:10.080> college<00:01:10.470> works

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
approached by someone from college works

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.139 
approached by someone from college works
I<00:01:10.890> realized<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.399> this<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.640> something<00:01:12.000> that

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
I realized that this was something that

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:14.480 
I realized that this was something that
would<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.539> much<00:01:13.020> more<00:01:13.229> meaningful<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:14.280> only

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
would be much more meaningful not only

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.830 
would be much more meaningful not only
to<00:01:14.640> me<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> person<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.600> was<00:01:15.720> working

with<00:01:16.140> someone<00:01:17.070> came<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.490> home<00:01:17.700> knocked<00:01:18.150> on

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
with someone came to my home knocked on

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.890 
with someone came to my home knocked on
the<00:01:18.420> door<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.400> seemed<00:01:20.400> very<00:01:20.729> professional<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
little bit shy but as we talked I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.050
