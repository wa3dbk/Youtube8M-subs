00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
machines we first march right around 34

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
machines we first march right around 34
to<00:00:27.630> 36<00:00:28.170> seconds<00:00:28.619> or<00:00:28.890> 30<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> 35<00:00:30.119> seconds<00:00:30.630> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to 36 seconds or 30 to 35 seconds and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.220 
to 36 seconds or 30 to 35 seconds and
here<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> cast<00:00:32.369> at<00:00:32.579> 36<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> just<00:00:33.510> lasted<00:00:33.989> and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
here I cast at 36 and I just lasted and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
here I cast at 36 and I just lasted and
is<00:00:34.320> you're<00:00:34.800> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.489> actually<00:00:35.760> slows

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
is you're going to see it actually slows

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.479 
is you're going to see it actually slows
me<00:00:36.149> down<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.350> takes<00:00:37.500> about<00:00:37.680> 10<00:00:37.950> seconds<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
me down so it takes about 10 seconds to

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
me down so it takes about 10 seconds to
get<00:00:38.579> from<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.879> mid<00:00:39.090> lane<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.690> ancients

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
get from the mid lane to the ancients

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.000 
get from the mid lane to the ancients
and<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.850> stack<00:00:42.090> need<00:00:42.390> ankle

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
and if you want to stack need ankle

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.590 
and if you want to stack need ankle
52-34<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> need<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.910> leave<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.360> lane

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
52-34 so you need to leave your lane

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200 
52-34 so you need to leave your lane
right<00:00:45.809> another<00:00:46.079> 43<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.460> then<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.730> left<00:00:47.910> right

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
right another 43 and then I left right

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.770 
right another 43 and then I left right
around<00:00:48.420> 45<00:00:49.020> minutes<00:00:49.440> really<00:00:49.800> close<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.780> of

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
around 45 minutes really close and of

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.600 
around 45 minutes really close and of
course<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.379> without<00:00:52.530> boots<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.370> boots

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
course this is without boots with boots

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.689 
course this is without boots with boots
I<00:00:53.760> probably<00:00:54.120> make<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.390> clean<00:00:54.920> so<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
I probably make you clean so that is the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.580 
I probably make you clean so that is the
timing<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.059> stack<00:00:57.300> leave<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.780> laying<00:00:58.020> around

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
timing to stack leave your laying around

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
timing to stack leave your laying around
43<00:00:59.340> seconds<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.850> make<00:01:00.000> sure<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.210> push<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> up

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
43 seconds to make sure to push it up

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.750 
43 seconds to make sure to push it up
towards<00:01:00.780> town<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:02.129> next<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> talk

towards town so next we're going to talk

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.860 
towards town so next we're going to talk
about<00:01:02.879> where<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.149> cast<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.660> marching

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
about where to cast your marching
machine<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.470> I've<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> circle<00:01:05.100> dis<00:01:05.250> going

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489

machine so I've got a circle dis going
ranger's<00:01:06.119> march<00:01:06.150> nine<00:01:06.720> hundred<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:09.360> want

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

to stand in that little privacy trees
and<00:01:11.520> face<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.119> cast<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.570> much<00:01:12.810> upwards

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and face up and cast your much upwards

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.820 
and face up and cast your much upwards
and<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.210> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.570> pull<00:01:15.810> out<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.320> ancients

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
before you cast your march usually that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
before you cast your march usually that
will<00:01:18.869> increase<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> amount<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.890> damage<00:01:20.220> as

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
will increase the amount of damage as

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.630 
will increase the amount of damage as
the<00:01:21.330> radius<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> Marchetti<00:01:22.890> spread<00:01:23.369> along

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
the radius of the Marchetti spread along

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
the radius of the Marchetti spread along
the<00:01:24.200> ancient<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> reason<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.070> like<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.340> cast

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the ancient so the reason I like to cast

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
the ancient so the reason I like to cast
from<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.790> point<00:01:27.200> because<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.560> can't<00:01:28.829> see

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
from this point because you can't see

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.580 
from this point because you can't see
the<00:01:29.220> march<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.570> middling<00:01:30.990> is<00:01:31.170> easily

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the march from the middling is easily

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.859 
the march from the middling is easily
like<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.159> it's<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> hit<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.329> entire

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
like and it's going to hit the entire

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
like and it's going to hit the entire
camp<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.500> it's<00:01:35.250> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.610> able<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> follow

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
camp and it's going to be able to follow

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850 
camp and it's going to be able to follow
it<00:01:36.299> up<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.930> they're<00:01:37.170> never<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> walk

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it up and they're never going to walk

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.240 
it up and they're never going to walk
outside<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> March<00:01:39.049> as<00:01:40.049> in<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:40.829> side<00:01:41.070> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
outside of the March as in from side to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.090 
outside of the March as in from side to
side<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.500> best<00:01:43.619> way<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> catch

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
side so that is the best way to catch

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.749 
side so that is the best way to catch
march<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.549> baby<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:46.409> when<00:01:47.040> we<00:01:47.189> move<00:01:47.340> on<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.520> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
march on baby so when we move on to the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.510 
march on baby so when we move on to the
dire<00:01:47.970> side<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:49.140> timing<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.009> stacking

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dire side the timing or stacking

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069 
dire side the timing or stacking
ancients<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> mid<00:01:51.540> lane<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.869> very

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
ancients from the mid lane is very

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.039 
ancients from the mid lane is very
different<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.280> takes<00:01:53.850> 18<00:01:54.390> seconds<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
different because it takes 18 seconds to

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.200 
different because it takes 18 seconds to
about<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.770> walk<00:01:55.950> from<00:01:56.130> mid<00:01:56.340> lane<00:01:56.520> over<00:01:56.969> two

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
about to walk from mid lane over two

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.050 
about to walk from mid lane over two
inches<00:01:57.649> so<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.710> need<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.280> give<00:01:59.490> an<00:01:59.729> extra

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
inches so you need to give an extra

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.679 
inches so you need to give an extra
eight<00:02:00.329> seconds<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.229> leave<00:02:02.479> meaning<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> you

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
eight seconds to leave meaning that you

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.319 
eight seconds to leave meaning that you
need<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.960> leave<00:02:04.110> around<00:02:04.290> 34<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> 35<00:02:05.670> seconds

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
need to leave around 34 and 35 seconds

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.529 
need to leave around 34 and 35 seconds
so<00:02:06.540> Castro<00:02:06.960> march<00:02:07.229> around<00:02:07.409> 26<00:02:08.129> seconds<00:02:08.550> make

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so Castro march around 26 seconds make

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.320 
so Castro march around 26 seconds make
sure<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.560> mail<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.220> creeps<00:02:11.489> and

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
sure to get the mail it creeps and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.910 
sure to get the mail it creeps and

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.310 
don't actually a time elastic for Main
Street<00:02:14.220> usually<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.630> you're<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.050> gonna<00:02:16.200> have

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
Street usually so you're just gonna have

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.100 
Street usually so you're just gonna have
to<00:02:16.440> grab<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.920> XP<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.720> you're<00:02:18.720> not<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:19.050> to

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
to grab the XP and you're not going to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.070 
to grab the XP and you're not going to
be<00:02:19.200> able<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.130> blasted<00:02:20.850> on<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.450> unless

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
be able to get the blasted on it unless

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.360 
be able to get the blasted on it unless
you<00:02:23.870> focus<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:25.080> or<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.620> opponent<00:02:26.040> starts<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
you focus it or the opponent starts to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.450 
you focus it or the opponent starts to
deny<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.880> or<00:02:27.060> no<00:02:27.210> you're<00:02:27.390> lucky<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> then

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
deny it or no you're lucky and then

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.370 
deny it or no you're lucky and then
you're<00:02:29.730> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> stop<00:02:30.500> 53<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.050> you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
you're going to stop 53 just like you

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.020 
you're going to stop 53 just like you
normally<00:02:34.650> would<00:02:34.920> when<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.490> stuck<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.880> your

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
normally would when you're stuck in your

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.430 
normally would when you're stuck in your
inches<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:37.500> that's<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.770> timing<00:02:38.160> for<00:02:38.400> slightly

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
inches so that's the timing for slightly

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.340 
inches so that's the timing for slightly
from<00:02:40.440> the<00:02:40.470> mid<00:02:40.680> lane<00:02:40.890> eat<00:02:41.160> your<00:02:41.310> ring<00:02:41.550> at<00:02:42.350> 35

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
from the mid lane eat your ring at 35

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.070 
from the mid lane eat your ring at 35
seconds<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:44.130> now<00:02:44.510> we've<00:02:45.510> got<00:02:45.660> a<00:02:45.690> few<00:02:45.840> stacks

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
seconds so now we've got a few stacks

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.500 
seconds so now we've got a few stacks
we're<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.550> march<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.970> you're<00:02:48.390> gonna

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
we're going to march and you're gonna

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.510 
we're going to march and you're gonna
last<00:02:48.660> even<00:02:48.990> a<00:02:49.110> smaller<00:02:49.470> circle<00:02:49.860> indicate<00:02:50.370> on

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
last even a smaller circle indicate on

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.580 
last even a smaller circle indicate on
the<00:02:50.550> ground<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.120> you're<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.080> march<00:02:52.350> to

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
the ground and you're going to march to

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.380 
the ground and you're going to march to
the<00:02:52.620> left<00:02:52.920> your<00:02:53.130> much<00:02:53.340> up<00:02:53.580> into<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.940> left<00:02:54.150> I

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the left your much up into the left I

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.780 
the left your much up into the left I
can<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.440> kind<00:02:55.770> of<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.920> little<00:02:56.220> research<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.670> I

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
can have kind of a little research and I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.520 
can have kind of a little research and I
think<00:02:56.820> that<00:02:57.330> straight<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> left<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.500> a

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
think that straight to the left is a

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.560 
think that straight to the left is a
little<00:02:59.010> better<00:02:59.250> but<00:02:59.940> they're<00:03:00.150> both<00:03:00.360> pretty

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
little better but they're both pretty

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.160 
little better but they're both pretty
efficient<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.850> again<00:03:02.850> some<00:03:03.120> reason<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.959> want

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
efficient and again some reason you want

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.080 
efficient and again some reason you want
to<00:03:04.260> Nepal<00:03:04.590> amount<00:03:04.860> before<00:03:05.220> casting<00:03:05.760> remarks

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
to Nepal amount before casting remarks

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.110 
to Nepal amount before casting remarks
usually<00:03:06.480> but<00:03:07.380> it's<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> huge<00:03:08.400> deal<00:03:11.120> so

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
usually but it's not a huge deal so

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.180 
usually but it's not a huge deal so
again<00:03:12.480> stand<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.050> the<00:03:13.170> circle<00:03:13.350> on<00:03:13.620> Castillo

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
again stand in the circle on Castillo

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.600 
again stand in the circle on Castillo
and<00:03:15.470> again<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> like<00:03:16.769> this<00:03:16.950> because<00:03:17.160> the

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
and again I like this because the

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.520 
and again I like this because the
ancients<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.480> our<00:03:18.600> walk<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.959> when<00:03:19.140> I<00:03:19.170> do<00:03:19.290> my
