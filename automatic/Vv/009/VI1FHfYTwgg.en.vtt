thing that I notice about it is I like

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.439 
thing that I notice about it is I like
the<00:00:45.480> packaging<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> lot<00:00:46.199> it's<00:00:46.550> just<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.730> plastic

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
the packaging a lot it's just as plastic

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.490 
the packaging a lot it's just as plastic
packaging<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> as<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.789> think<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.289> can

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
packaging and as I think that you can

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.970 
packaging and as I think that you can
like<00:00:52.739> oh<00:00:53.180> yeah<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.719> those<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
like oh yeah it's one of those with a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.610 
like oh yeah it's one of those with a
very<00:00:56.309> pointy<00:00:57.030> tip<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.679> extend<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.910> by

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
very pointy tip and you can extend it by

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
very pointy tip and you can extend it by
like<00:01:01.620> rolling<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:03.210> I<00:01:04.199> got<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.920> one<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like rolling this I got this one in the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.180 
like rolling this I got this one in the
color<00:01:06.320> 24<00:01:07.370> red<00:01:08.370> diva<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.540> I<00:01:10.350> think<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.950> think

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
color 24 red diva and I think I think

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.740 
color 24 red diva and I think I think
the<00:01:11.310> color<00:01:11.550> is<00:01:11.730> nice<00:01:11.940> I'm<00:01:12.210> not<00:01:12.360> sure<00:01:12.570> it's

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
the color is nice I'm not sure it's

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.880 
the color is nice I'm not sure it's
pretty<00:01:13.050> hard<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.500> me<00:01:13.620> to<00:01:14.280> pick<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:14.970> red

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
pretty hard for me to pick out red

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.680 
pretty hard for me to pick out red
lipsticks<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.520> my<00:01:18.030> hair<00:01:18.240> color<00:01:18.480> it's

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
lipsticks because of my hair color it's

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.660 
lipsticks because of my hair color it's
I<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.230> it's<00:01:19.470> easier<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.770> like<00:01:20.070> blondes<00:01:20.550> and

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
I think it's easier for like blondes and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.670 
I think it's easier for like blondes and
brunettes<00:01:20.940> cuz<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.170> red<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.470> red<00:01:22.620> on

brunettes cuz you know red is red on

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.230 
brunettes cuz you know red is red on
their<00:01:23.070> hair<00:01:23.310> and<00:01:23.430> stuff<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.970> will<00:01:24.090> be

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
their hair and stuff like that will be

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330

it<00:02:19.890> might<00:02:20.160> be<00:02:20.310> too<00:02:20.520> blue<00:02:20.790> for<00:02:20.820> me<00:02:21.350> then<00:02:22.490> orange

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
it might be too blue for me then orange

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:38.000 
it might be too blue for me then orange
oh<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> little<00:02:34.290> soft<00:02:36.800> okay<00:02:37.800> I'm<00:02:37.860> just

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
oh it's a little soft okay I'm just

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.250 
oh it's a little soft okay I'm just
gonna<00:02:38.160> fill<00:02:38.430> my<00:02:38.640> my<00:02:39.030> lips<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.840> we<00:02:39.930> can<00:02:40.050> see

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
gonna fill my my lips in so we can see

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:50.080 
gonna fill my my lips in so we can see
the<00:02:40.410> color<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.920> really<00:02:41.250> really

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.150 

oh<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.660> think<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:51.110> color<00:02:51.349> gets<00:02:51.650> better<00:02:51.980> when

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
oh I think the color gets better when

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:03.010 
oh I think the color gets better when
you<00:02:52.340> layer<00:02:52.580> it<00:02:56.920> it's<00:02:57.920> not<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.340> blue<00:02:58.580> then<00:03:02.020> see

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
you layer it it's not so blue then see

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.350 
you layer it it's not so blue then see
it<00:03:03.200> already<00:03:03.620> ran<00:03:03.860> down<00:03:04.220> because<00:03:04.670> I'm<00:03:04.849> it's<00:03:05.150> so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
it already ran down because I'm it's so

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.309 
it already ran down because I'm it's so
soft<00:03:07.390> maybe<00:03:08.390> you<00:03:08.569> need<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.750> keep<00:03:09.019> these<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.200> the

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
soft maybe you need to keep these in the

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.220 
soft maybe you need to keep these in the
fridge<00:03:09.680> I<00:03:10.040> don't<00:03:10.970> know<00:03:11.090> I<00:03:13.900> really<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.080> this
