00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.309
 online consulting service with 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.839

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.250
 sport would really be accessible to all 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.450
 let's see what we thought yes I 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.310
 think it's good for people 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.070
 competent to come into store concept 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.050

 he cat would help with the choice just like this 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.300
 service we chose a 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.160
 association whose sport is very little 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.050
 known and who would have the merit of being 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.820
 accessible to all we are the team 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.369
 of eckbolsheim's horse ball so the bear 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 port sas flights to castres mixed that get 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.880
 so plays in teams and the goal of the game 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.170
 it's to make three passes with this 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 balloon there between three different players 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.659
 and then to score for that purpose 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.220
 when we are alone in Alsace we 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.990
 let's play our champion in lorraine and 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.509
 it requires a lot of ways we 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.549

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.619
 category where you kehl amateur elite and 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.409
 so at least double the budget we 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.030
 now here to continue in 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.439
 this discipline I think it takes 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.240
 that we give ourselves the means and that we 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:00.240
