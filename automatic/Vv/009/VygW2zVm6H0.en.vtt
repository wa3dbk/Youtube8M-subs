 which is a small option of the 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.489
 precision classics 1 are the 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.950
 command settings to assign the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.660
 buttons as you want I let him do 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.690
 a personalized to observe that 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.720
 it is equally stable also what of the memory 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.220
 card what the saved data that I 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.690
