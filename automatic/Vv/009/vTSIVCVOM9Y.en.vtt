00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.660
 in mines I'll try to give some tips 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.610
 For you more or less what I think 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.400
 that I think what I think the country 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.920
 really busy a catwalk 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.630
 the first thing resembles breathing 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.599
 because we get so nervous and even 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.680
 Today she is 28 years old and she is 14 years old. 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.759
 I was dying 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.689
 so my nerves the document then I 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:34.590
 I think the most important part is to stop 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:39.570
 breathing and lighting food always 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.160
 cup and go out on the catwalk you forget 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.649
 who is not on the catwalk forget that 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.289
 It has to be there how many people. 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 watching the parade I picked up 51 points 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.289
 focus on the bottom of the catwalk i come back 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.140
 I look for another point the future of 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.670
 other than when I see it has passed 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.379
 It's another thing when we walk in the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 street we walk so I at least 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.780
 200 but in pastoral this does not look beautiful 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.180
 so breathe 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:11.780
 I put it back and when you put it 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.780
 how to treat your posture go you walk 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.250
 hence clothes 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.630
 I think it's important that you look for the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.460
 your style to your 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.280
 both against the catwalk and the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.900
 photography because each person has a 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.460
 something special in or as 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.170
 walk on your face she has an aura 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.300
 special then look for the can 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.270
 comfortable being you 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:51.920
 The more you feel you will not be 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.920
 on the catwalk and in the photo and even life 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:42.480
 I think is cool 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.470
 plays with 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:21.599
 on one side this is what I use we are 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.470
 even better 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.470
 squirrel 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.849
 according to him the pt 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.520
 t 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.980
 also en 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.030
