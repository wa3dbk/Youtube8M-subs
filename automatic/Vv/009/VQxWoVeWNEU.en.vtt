makes it so much fun to play but brought
to<00:00:44.370> life<00:00:44.550> in<00:00:44.760> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.600> new<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:45.809> new<00:00:46.020> fresh<00:00:46.350> way

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
to life in kind of a new a new fresh way

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
to life in kind of a new a new fresh way
I<00:00:46.590> think<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:47.550> will<00:00:47.640> introduce<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.120> lot<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> new

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I think it will introduce a lot of new

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.000 
I think it will introduce a lot of new
people<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> civilization<00:00:49.559> gameplay

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
people to the civilization gameplay

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
people to the civilization gameplay
really<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.000> brings<00:00:51.300> strategy<00:00:51.750> gaming<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
really I think brings strategy gaming to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920 
really I think brings strategy gaming to
the<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.829> fore<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.340> console<00:00:53.969> gaming<00:00:54.149> also

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the to the fore in console gaming also

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.250 
the to the fore in console gaming also

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
of a new approach to it we've got the

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.119 
of a new approach to it we've got the
the<00:01:00.809> game<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.170> week<00:01:01.320> which<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.949> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
the game of the week which is a way that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.650 
the game of the week which is a way that
you<00:01:02.250> can<00:01:02.399> kind<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.670> compare<00:01:02.820> your<00:01:03.180> best<00:01:03.390> scores

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
with everybody else in the world I think

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
with everybody else in the world I think
all<00:01:06.119> our<00:01:06.270> hard<00:01:06.479> core<00:01:06.689> two<00:01:06.990> players<00:01:07.260> will<00:01:07.439> want

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
all our hard core two players will want

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920 
all our hard core two players will want
to<00:01:07.619> be<00:01:07.740> on<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.890> leaderboard<00:01:08.750> we've<00:01:09.750> got<00:01:09.900> a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to be on that leaderboard we've got a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.200 
to be on that leaderboard we've got a
multiplayer<00:01:10.590> gameplay<00:01:10.860> single<00:01:11.850> player<00:01:12.000> game

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
multiplayer gameplay single player game

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.899 
multiplayer gameplay single player game
play<00:01:12.590> very<00:01:13.590> unique<00:01:13.890> civilizations<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.729> play

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
play very unique civilizations to play

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.420 
play very unique civilizations to play
each<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.270> with<00:01:15.390> their<00:01:15.420> own<00:01:15.630> special<00:01:15.900> powers

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
each one with their own special powers

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.130 
each one with their own special powers
so<00:01:17.430> it's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.000> fun<00:01:18.090> game<00:01:18.270> we<00:01:18.840> had<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so it's a really fun game we had to

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
so it's a really fun game we had to
really<00:01:19.350> take<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> look<00:01:19.799> at<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> couple<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.189> things

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
really take a look at a couple of things

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.590 
really take a look at a couple of things
before<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.670> brought<00:01:20.850> us<00:01:20.970> into<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> console

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
before we brought us into the console

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
before we brought us into the console
and<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> could<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.049> be<00:01:22.080> played<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.710> console

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
and it could it be played on the console

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
and it could it be played on the console
controller<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:23.970> players<00:01:24.210> are<00:01:24.390> used<00:01:24.509> to

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
controller so players are used to

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.570 
controller so players are used to
keyboard<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.140> mouse<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.950> we<00:01:26.040> found<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.340> the

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
keyboard and mouse but we found that the

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.830 
keyboard and mouse but we found that the
things<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.390> suit<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
things that you do in a suit in a

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200 
things that you do in a suit in a
typical<00:01:28.200> civ<00:01:28.380> turn<00:01:28.680> map<00:01:29.490> very<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
typical civ turn map very well to the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
typical civ turn map very well to the
buttons<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.930> joysticks<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.590> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
buttons and the joysticks on the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
buttons and the joysticks on the
controller<00:01:32.220> since<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:32.970> turn-based<00:01:33.270> you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
controller since it is turn-based you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.810 
controller since it is turn-based you
can<00:01:33.780> play<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.049> your<00:01:34.140> own<00:01:34.259> pace<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:34.920> there's<00:01:35.640> no

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
can play at your own pace so there's no

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.310 
can play at your own pace so there's no
trying<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> rush<00:01:36.299> around<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.659> map<00:01:36.810> clicking

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
trying to rush around the map clicking

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.630 
trying to rush around the map clicking
here<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.680> there<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.009> whatever<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.490> that

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
here and there or whatever so that

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.780 
here and there or whatever so that
worked<00:01:38.880> very<00:01:39.090> well<00:01:39.500> playing<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.340> TV<00:01:41.610> screen

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
worked very well playing on a TV screen

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
worked very well playing on a TV screen
i<00:01:42.119> think<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.570> allowed<00:01:42.869> us<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.020> bring<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
i think really allowed us to bring the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.710 
i think really allowed us to bring the
camera<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.220> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> really<00:01:45.270> show<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.509> in

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
camera in and kind of really show you in
