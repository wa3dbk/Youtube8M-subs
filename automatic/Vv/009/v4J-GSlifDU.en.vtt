00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello I am people were coming from 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 brussels today i'm going to you 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.940
 explain the difference between the cross 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.410
 media and transmedia you will see 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 it is very simple 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.849
 nowadays we do not consume 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.050
 media the same way we talk about them 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:24.510
 multi tasking we can watch TV 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.939
 tap on our keyboard is tweeted on 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.279
 our smartphone at the same time 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 search first 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.800
 the interactivity of these new uses 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.950
 new forms of creation are born 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 like cross-media and transmedia 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.059
 but what does diantre mean which of these 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.840
 barbaric notions the cross media continues 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.030
 first and foremost a marketing goal is 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.600
 the declension of a main content 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.550
 on complementary media 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.530
 good maybe you do not see well 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.520
 what I mean 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.800
 so to illustrate our purpose 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.739
 let's take common room imagine that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.719
 this comet is a chain month series 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.670
 of TV I will set up a 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 cross media device to communicate 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.750
 around magnets to promote my 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.520
 series before it's broadcast I'm going to create 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.380
 the buzz by launching a quiz for 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.820
 win comets on facebook but I 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.409
 can also during the broadcast of the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 series create a video game around 20 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 comet to build my audience 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.619
 once the broadcast ended game can 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.210
 monetize the series yet again by creating a 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.189
 iphone app to relive the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
 best moments of the comet the cross 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.759
 therefore aims to optimize the effect 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.560
 a marketing campaign by focusing on 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.520
 synergies between different media 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 you have drawn 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.420
 so let's move on to the media a little 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.280
 more complicated this time the transmedia 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.340
 it is not reproduction 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.630
 but the fragmentation of a story is 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.220
 each of the media will deliver some 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.049
 of the story then in the manner of the pieces 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.430
 of a puzzle the different stories one 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.820
 Completed to form a superb 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.439
 history 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.970
 to illustrate this your first names 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.860
 stickers and dishes are there in the heart of a 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.420
 transmedia device others like 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.240
 with the heroine of a TV series 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 police officer who killed the comet between 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.940
 broadcast two episodes I'm going 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.100
 able to help investigators on the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 current circuit at goal.com is lucid and 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.970
 the mystery of Gothic assassination 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.450
 for this I will receive hints 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.709
 by texting on my smartphone finally I 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.030
 will be able to find my gum is a 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.769
 baby in new adventures 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.260
 exploring the past of our heroine 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.060
 you see it these different media 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.420
 allow a total immersion of 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.069
 spectator in history 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.630
 good and you will tell me cross-media 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.580
 all media is fine but not 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.760
 free as so where does the money come from 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.269
 confiscated 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.560
 today we have two groups of actors 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.420
 we have public TV channels 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.350
 which are in a logical 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.940
 experimentation to favor 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.100
 the emergence of these new gods as 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.810
 transmedia and chain 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.760
 private TVs that are more worn 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.989
 towards cross-media projects aimed at 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.209
 see the content she broadcasts 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.860
 let's not forget the clc who participate 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.769
 actively to finance these 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.349
 new forms of creation this is it 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.819
 finished for today then at times 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.819
