00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.250
 and the honor is all our 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.440
 why do not you let us go practically 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.590
 we just finished recording port 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.330
 years super mega force and for me it is a 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.900
 honor and a pleasure that has come this to 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.279
 roseo make us attentive and meadow 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.340
 recover 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.250
 karabin there is almost no for me it has been a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.220
 wonderful emotion because in addition to 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.840
 tell them that it was he who started the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:42.489
 dubbing of payments in Mexico 21 or 22 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.489
 years, more or less, 21 years 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.989
 completely different technique for 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.620
 record by technology then it was 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.450
 different tell us if it was even very 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.670
 complicated because we only had 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.440
 two tracks to record one for the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.080
 filters and another one for the voices in 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.970
 presence of the filter as deaf not at 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.340
 side of these two things as per 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 phone then it was not all they had to 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.110
 give me two cartridges to record this 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.440
 series and it was truly complicated 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.420
 join the 45 power rangers so that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.450
 will record in a single channel at the same 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.700
 time when one was missing I already 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.160
 put together a 5 could mention that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.259
 then they all recorded together and they were 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.270
 the stars of the moment 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.070
 because it was the young people who used them 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.539
 for all the series and they were very 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.190
 important and suddenly they were 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.259
 running from one place to another I had 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.170
 that organize the work plan for 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.960
 that they could all be together to leave 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.750
 soon for our others to leave 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.619
 you give the barreros bill and escandón 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.619
 marine orchard 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.130
 carlos Íñigo and later he joined 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.130
 adrián fogar de walking 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.049
 people people who in their Greek follows 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.810
 being very important people not people who 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.110
 has left a path a trace in 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.420
 this hidden but necessary already public 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.900
 dubbing environment in terms of 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.900
 legendary captain 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:31.760
 it seems very interesting to us like the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.670
 character almost says that for me it's like 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.560
 very important and finally for now 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.850
 I 'm in charge of the series but the 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.630
 fact that he could return that 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.630
 would you like to do it 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:50.930
 for us, each character is a son 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 the re give the voice to a character like 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.560
 that do not fit are part of us are 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.610
 the area since there is there is like a 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.440
 personal seal that was put on 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:09.150
 at that time robot and now alpha 5 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.150
 and 6 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.660
 again we meet the team and for 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.170
 the original sold fortunately 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.170
 they could go back 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.960
 I hope you like that you liked it 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.160
 work and then 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.160
 then rangers
