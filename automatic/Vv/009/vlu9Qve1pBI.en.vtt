 facebook out there have just got this 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.460

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.420
 velox is a tweet that I spoke to you already 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.740
 five or six videos back and do what 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.660
 next note that it adds a 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.120
 kind of piquet on our springboard 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.440
 and open those open as a folder in 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.750
 each of these applications of 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.399
 This agreement is what makes it Velox 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.469
 Well, I'm going to recommend three tweets that 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.690
 we vitamin in a little faster 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:47.079
 the first one is this for the clock it 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.909
 llama stop watch by velox is a tweet 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.739
 that is freely available in the 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.839
 big boss repository 'and nothing 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.730
 simply when we deploy we do 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.409
 a gesture such that this one here for 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.329
 unfold the beat get we could 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.309
 click to enter the application 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.620
 normally not, but note that from 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.530
 here it would appear the beat get not here 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.240
 what we get is a chronometer to the use 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.020
 with which we will be able to 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:14.170
 anything very quickly good there 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.060
 another tweet that is called dial agreement 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.890
 this tweet that is available in the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 Maya repository mod and dotcoms and 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.850

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.909
 directly the contact list 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.709
 when this tweet is a little better 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.840
 because we have access to the dial and we have 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.310
