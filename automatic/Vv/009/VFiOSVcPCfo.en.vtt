dimensional<00:02:46.430> mirror<00:02:46.909> is<00:02:47.209> in<00:02:47.599> almost<00:02:48.169> every

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
dimensional mirror is in almost every

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.399 
dimensional mirror is in almost every
single<00:02:48.980> place<00:02:49.220> again<00:02:50.030> excluding<00:02:50.480> shawa<00:02:51.139> and

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
single place again excluding shawa and

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.979 
single place again excluding shawa and
other<00:02:51.980> places<00:02:52.250> like<00:02:52.489> that<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.900> pretty

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
other places like that but it's pretty

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.479 
other places like that but it's pretty
much<00:02:54.139> everywhere<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.859> could<00:02:54.980> always<00:02:55.189> go

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
much everywhere and you could always go

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.390 
much everywhere and you could always go
to<00:02:55.549> newly<00:02:56.389> city<00:02:56.689> and<00:02:57.079> just<00:02:58.010> repeat<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
to newly city and just repeat the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.679 
to newly city and just repeat the
process<00:02:58.609> if<00:02:58.969> you<00:02:59.060> want<00:02:59.209> to<00:02:59.269> go<00:02:59.359> somewhere<00:02:59.510> else

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
process if you want to go somewhere else

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:02.949 
process if you want to go somewhere else
so<00:03:00.469> it's<00:03:00.709> a<00:03:00.739> really<00:03:00.889> cool<00:03:01.129> tip<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.700> takes<00:03:02.150> like

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
so it's a really cool tip it takes like

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.929 
so it's a really cool tip it takes like
30<00:03:03.230> seconds<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.769> do<00:03:03.919> it<00:03:04.069> all<00:03:04.250> in<00:03:04.400> total<00:03:04.760> you

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:04.939 
30 seconds to do it all in total you

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.149 
30 seconds to do it all in total you
know<00:03:05.329> minus<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:05.930> wait<00:03:06.230> for<00:03:06.439> the<00:03:06.530> subway<00:03:06.739> train

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
know minus the wait for the subway train

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.339 
know minus the wait for the subway train
but<00:03:07.549> yeah<00:03:08.209> it's<00:03:08.359> pretty<00:03:08.480> good<00:03:08.689> tip<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.139> those

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
but yeah it's pretty good tip for those

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.259 
but yeah it's pretty good tip for those
