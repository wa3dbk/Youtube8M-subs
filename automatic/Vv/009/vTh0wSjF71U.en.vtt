what's<00:00:25.050> going<00:00:25.380> on<00:00:28.880> you're<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.060> load<00:00:30.179> up

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
what's going on you're going to load up

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.410 
what's going on you're going to load up
her<00:00:30.420> head<00:00:30.689> model<00:00:30.869> are<00:00:31.740> made<00:00:32.040> head<00:00:32.489> base<00:00:32.780> open

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
her head model are made head base open

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.490 
her head model are made head base open
I'm<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> draw<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.110> onto<00:00:37.410> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
I'm just going to draw it onto the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'm just going to draw it onto the
canvas<00:00:37.649> click<00:00:38.899> hold<00:00:39.899> shift<00:00:40.320> -<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.190> just

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
canvas click hold shift - I just

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.889 
canvas click hold shift - I just
realized<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:42.090> got<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> flat<00:00:42.480> color<00:00:42.690> we

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
realized it's got a flat color we

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.430 
realized it's got a flat color we
actually<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.649> shader<00:00:44.460> material<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.230> as<00:00:46.350> we

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
actually want a shader material so as we

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.729 
actually want a shader material so as we
can<00:00:46.590> see<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:47.190> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> form<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> I'm

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
can see a little bit of the form so I'm

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.369 
can see a little bit of the form so I'm
just<00:00:49.920> letting<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.340> for<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> drawer<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.379> drag

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
just letting that for a drawer it drag

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.860 
just letting that for a drawer it drag
down<00:00:52.620> alt<00:00:52.860> shift<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> right<00:00:55.520> edit<00:00:57.710> or<00:00:58.710> T

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
down alt shift to get it right edit or T

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.810 
down alt shift to get it right edit or T
go<00:01:00.870> into<00:01:01.020> edit<00:01:01.260> mode<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.890> we<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.550> move<00:01:02.670> the

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
go into edit mode now we can move the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.380 
go into edit mode now we can move the
mesh<00:01:02.969> around<00:01:03.920> so<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.010> straight<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.820> i'ma<00:01:06.270> hold

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
mesh around so I'm straight on i'ma hold

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.000 
mesh around so I'm straight on i'ma hold
down<00:01:06.600> shift<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> make<00:01:07.110> sure<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.530> facing<00:01:07.710> us

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
down shift to make sure it's facing us

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.960 
down shift to make sure it's facing us
exactly<00:01:08.430> straight<00:01:08.820> on<00:01:09.380> holding<00:01:10.380> alt<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.760> can

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
exactly straight on holding alt you can

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.850 
exactly straight on holding alt you can
position<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> face<00:01:13.049> basically<00:01:13.619> we<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
position the face basically we want to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
position the face basically we want to
get<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> back<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> same<00:01:14.430> size<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.909> scale<00:01:15.180> as

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
get the back the same size and scale as

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.260 
get the back the same size and scale as
the<00:01:15.979> front<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.159> view<00:01:17.189> we're<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.150> turn

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
the front on view we're going to turn

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.810 
the front on view we're going to turn
off<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> Z<00:01:18.630> dad<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.409> leave<00:01:19.560> RGB<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.580> because

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
off the Z dad just leave RGB on because

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.300 
off the Z dad just leave RGB on because
we<00:01:20.909> only<00:01:21.030> want<00:01:21.090> color<00:01:21.479> information<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:23.250> we

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we only want color information and we

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.219 
we only want color information and we
click<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.820> Z<00:01:24.390> project<00:01:24.810> brush<00:01:25.460> click<00:01:26.460> move

click the Z project brush click move
you're<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.439> set<00:01:29.090> where<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.659> want<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
you're going to set where we want the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're going to set where we want the
paint<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.400> where<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
paint to go and also where we want it to

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.840 
paint to go and also where we want it to
come<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:34.369> you're<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
come from so you're going to go for the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.679 
come from so you're going to go for the
top<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> bridge<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> nose<00:01:38.390> as<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
top of the bridge of the nose as you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
top of the bridge of the nose as you can
see<00:01:40.009> go<00:01:41.009> back<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> draw<00:01:41.520> tool<00:01:43.790> when<00:01:44.790> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
see go back to the draw tool when you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.569 
see go back to the draw tool when you
draw<00:01:45.119> it's<00:01:45.390> basically<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> clone

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
draw it's basically going to clone

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.740 
draw it's basically going to clone
texture<00:01:47.579> information<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.600> background

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
texture information from the background

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:55.280 
texture information from the background
onto<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.530> model<00:01:50.180> pretty<00:01:51.180> cool<00:01:53.180> but<00:01:54.259> not<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
onto the model pretty cool but not a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.639 
onto the model pretty cool but not a
lower<00:01:55.470> resolution<00:01:55.649> there<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.469> going

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
lower resolution there so I'm just going

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.060 
lower resolution there so I'm just going
to<00:01:58.680> subdivide<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.280> couple<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.670> times<00:02:01.070> divided

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
to subdivide it couple the times divided

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.890 
to subdivide it couple the times divided
right<00:02:02.969> again

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.999 

basically<00:02:06.900> now<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.200> should<00:02:07.500> go<00:02:07.620> a<00:02:07.650> lot<00:02:07.830> more

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
basically now you should go a lot more

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.370 
basically now you should go a lot more
texture<00:02:08.460> information<00:02:09.030> in<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.210> mesh<00:02:09.420> I'm<00:02:10.200> just

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
texture information in the mesh I'm just

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.120 
texture information in the mesh I'm just
going<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.560> try<00:02:10.740> a<00:02:10.770> different<00:02:10.920> position

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
going to try a different position

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.720 
going to try a different position
sighing<00:02:11.910> in<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> grab<00:02:13.370> somewhere<00:02:14.370> from<00:02:14.520> by<00:02:14.700> the

sighing in a grab somewhere from by the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.870 
sighing in a grab somewhere from by the
eyebrow<00:02:15.240> or<00:02:15.900> hang<00:02:16.830> on<00:02:16.950> let's<00:02:17.370> try<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.640> end<00:02:17.820> of

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
eyebrow or hang on let's try the end of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.730 
eyebrow or hang on let's try the end of
the<00:02:17.940> nose<00:02:18.090> end<00:02:18.750> of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.930> nails<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> end<00:02:19.650> of

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the nails up to the draw tool draw using

the nails up to the draw tool draw using

background straight onto the model which
is<00:02:29.640> pretty<00:02:29.910> slick<00:02:30.240> you<00:02:30.720> can<00:02:30.900> use<00:02:31.020> any<00:02:31.200> texture

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
is pretty slick you can use any texture

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.300 
is pretty slick you can use any texture
obviously<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.490> a<00:02:32.670> part<00:02:33.120> of<00:02:33.240> it<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.980> I'm<00:02:35.190> just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
obviously and a part of it so I'm just

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.300 
obviously and a part of it so I'm just
going<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.520> block<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:39.410> now<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.220> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
going to block that in now back to the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.680 
going to block that in now back to the
move<00:02:41.460> tool<00:02:41.490> if<00:02:41.820> we<00:02:41.910> want<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.090> align<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> mouth

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
move tool if we want to align the mouth

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.910 
move tool if we want to align the mouth
if<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:42.990> get<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.230> center<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.740> mouth

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
if it can get the center of the mouth

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.110 
if it can get the center of the mouth
and<00:02:44.100> line<00:02:44.250> it<00:02:44.280> up<00:02:44.400> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.610> center<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.030> the

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
mouth up to the draw tool as we draw we

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.530 
mouth up to the draw tool as we draw we
should<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.730> texture<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.300> mayor

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
should get the texture from the mayor

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.630 
should get the texture from the mayor
with<00:02:51.690> exactly<00:02:52.140> over<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.590> mesh<00:02:53.040> part<00:02:53.340> of<00:02:53.490> the

with exactly over the mesh part of the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.380 
with exactly over the mesh part of the
ellipse<00:02:55.430> all<00:02:56.430> right<00:02:56.550> going<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.790> the<00:02:56.940> side<00:02:57.180> left

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
ellipse all right going to the side left

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.340 
ellipse all right going to the side left
so<00:02:57.540> I'm<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.930> tell<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
so I'm just going to tell you to the

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
so I'm just going to tell you to the
side<00:02:58.590> hold<00:02:58.890> down<00:02:59.070> shift<00:02:59.400> so<00:02:59.640> it's<00:02:59.790> definitely

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
side hold down shift so it's definitely

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.830 
side hold down shift so it's definitely
side<00:03:00.690> on<00:03:00.959> I'll<00:03:01.680> down<00:03:02.160> alt<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.700> move<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> across

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.240 

slip<00:03:09.840> move<00:03:10.230> now<00:03:11.100> click<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.760> top<00:03:11.970> of<00:03:12.090> the<00:03:12.180> ear

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
slip move now click the top of the ear

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.560 
slip move now click the top of the ear
drag<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.580> top<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.090> area<00:03:15.269> on<00:03:15.420> the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
drag it to the top of the area on the

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:23.540 
drag it to the top of the area on the
picture<00:03:15.930> back<00:03:16.769> to<00:03:16.920> draw<00:03:18.470> start<00:03:19.470> drawing<00:03:22.550> and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
picture back to draw start drawing and

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.130 
picture back to draw start drawing and
again<00:03:23.790> it's<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.060> clown<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.660> from<00:03:25.050> the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
again it's just clown in from the

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.590 
again it's just clown in from the
background<00:03:25.320> onto<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.950> model<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:27.300> you<00:03:27.390> just

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
background onto the model and you just

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.300 
background onto the model and you just
set<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:28.019> reference<00:03:28.709> point<00:03:28.950> where<00:03:29.130> you<00:03:29.190> want

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
set the reference point where you want

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.740 
set the reference point where you want
it<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.459> go<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:29.970> reference<00:03:30.300> point<00:03:30.570> where

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
it to go and the reference point where

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
it to go and the reference point where
you<00:03:30.840> want<00:03:30.989> it<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.140> take<00:03:31.320> texture<00:03:31.830> from

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.910 

obviously<00:03:39.090> set<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.590> intensity<00:03:40.590> down<00:03:40.860> a

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
obviously set the intensity down a

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.700 
obviously set the intensity down a
little<00:03:41.130> bit<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.550> blend<00:03:41.880> out<00:03:42.060> the<00:03:42.210> edges<00:03:42.360> or<00:03:42.870> use

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
little bit to blend out the edges or use

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.920 
little bit to blend out the edges or use
all<00:03:43.890> the<00:03:43.980> parts<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.460> texture<00:03:47.690> and<00:03:48.690> just<00:03:48.840> go

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
all the parts of the texture and just go

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.150 
all the parts of the texture and just go
quick<00:03:49.140> look<00:03:49.290> around<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.500> other<00:03:49.590> side<00:03:49.680> as<00:03:50.070> you

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
quick look around the other side as you

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.500 
quick look around the other side as you
can<00:03:50.280> see<00:03:50.460> the<00:03:50.700> other<00:03:50.850> side<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:51.180> gotten<00:03:51.420> on

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
can see the other side is gotten on

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.200 
can see the other side is gotten on
texture<00:03:53.150> so<00:03:55.610> we're<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:56.640> basically<00:03:56.850> going<00:03:57.150> to

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.210 
texture so we're just basically going to

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.270 
texture so we're just basically going to
turn<00:03:57.390> on<00:03:57.600> X&amp;Y<00:03:58.170> symmetry<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:58.860> it<00:03:58.980> works<00:03:59.160> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
turn on X&amp;Y symmetry and it works the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.520 
turn on X&amp;Y symmetry and it works the
same<00:03:59.310> as<00:03:59.670> when<00:03:59.790> you're<00:03:59.880> sculpting<00:04:00.530> basically

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
same as when you're sculpting basically

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.890 
same as when you're sculpting basically
in<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.650> pane<00:04:01.910> takes<00:04:02.910> you<00:04:03.030> from<00:04:03.180> this<00:04:03.330> side<00:04:03.390> onto

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
in a pane takes you from this side onto

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.120 
in a pane takes you from this side onto
the<00:04:03.990> other<00:04:04.110> side<00:04:04.320> as<00:04:04.500> well<00:04:09.770> I'm<00:04:10.770> just<00:04:10.980> going<00:04:11.100> to

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
the other side as well I'm just going to

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.860 
the other side as well I'm just going to
go<00:04:11.220> over<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.460> same<00:04:11.640> little<00:04:11.940> bit<00:04:12.060> just<00:04:12.600> so<00:04:12.720> as

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
go over the same little bit just so as

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.510 
go over the same little bit just so as
it's<00:04:13.020> painting<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.620> on<00:04:13.710> this<00:04:13.860> side<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.340> on<00:04:14.430> the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
it's painting it on this side and on the

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.170 
it's painting it on this side and on the
other<00:04:14.580> side

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
other side

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.410 
other side
Rob<00:04:16.170> realized<00:04:16.530> that<00:04:16.769> I've<00:04:16.859> got<00:04:17.070> RGB<00:04:17.850> intensity

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
Rob realized that I've got RGB intensity

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.780 
Rob realized that I've got RGB intensity
down<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.900> 32<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:20.040> it's<00:04:20.190> probably<00:04:20.430> not<00:04:20.580> going<00:04:20.730> to

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
down to 32 so it's probably not going to

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.230 
down to 32 so it's probably not going to
be<00:04:21.800> going<00:04:22.800> through<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.130> darkly<00:04:23.760> it's<00:04:24.060> just

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
be going through that darkly it's just

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.640 
be going through that darkly it's just
going<00:04:24.450> through<00:04:24.510> quite<00:04:24.840> lightly<00:04:25.110> as<00:04:25.380> you<00:04:25.410> can

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
going through quite lightly as you can

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.909 
going through quite lightly as you can
