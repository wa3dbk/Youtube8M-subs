00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.369 
bottom that's it quite right ok on the
bottom<00:05:32.679> there<00:05:33.099> is<00:05:33.339> more<00:05:33.669> more<00:05:34.059> padding<00:05:34.659> it

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:37.329 
looks like it's bumpy and that's

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:38.969 
looks like it's bumpy and that's
probably<00:05:37.809> to<00:05:37.929> protect<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.409> bottom<00:05:38.709> of<00:05:38.860> the

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979
