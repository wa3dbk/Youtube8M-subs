00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.390
 with them they will sell this sea as much as this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.859
 and nestlé happens not only for 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.350
 cause of the strong in this but also by 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.420
 because of false so it gives a jump and 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.830
 always important to know these things 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.830
 let's go the pictures 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 let's go here to the meadow hotel link 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.140
 10 million in the new terminal has a 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.570
 battery of 10 thousand milan loses already made 10 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.790
 even before leaving the breast is a 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.720
 link size of what would be the mode of the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.750
 equipment 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.799
 today we have some other images 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.600
 with respect to the terminal 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.340
 we have then and before but before 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.590
 to begin, I would also like to thank the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.140
 our source and also say that you have a 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.210
 link in conjunction with pontocom pt pt 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 that's why they link to the inscription they will 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.840
 sell mobile phones soon 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.360
 so keep an eye out for years he 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.640
 rudimentary equipment itself we 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.590
 look will certainly enter that point 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.259
 excited not to get guarantor but 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.350
 will be so excited 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.000
 we also have what is and this part 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.790
 I also want you to go along to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.340
 minc on the top as it is to face 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.370
 normal and initially as we know 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.840
 that 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.480
 opposite we know that it is a terminal 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 specific we can see here is thick 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.700
 greater than we are accustomed years but 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.670
 however here are also the good ones 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.110
 pictures and design itself was not as 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.720
 it was all 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.830
 this is an idea of ​​the equipment but it is 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.840
 next 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.970
 as we can see is not is an equipment 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.470
 and it certainly has the appearance of being 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.720
 robust and bizarre 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
 however the such then look for a 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.710
 10 thousand milan battery loses not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.420
 Expect something else on the side 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:36.820
 we find that the home button 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.560
 office or reader of the moon and that 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:42.220
 silly that 's why I say it 's 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.530
 guaranteed a smartphone taste part 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.540
 and now let's look at this in a more 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.300
 the same level of people in the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.580
 terminal and notes that is unfortunately not 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.860
 here we can not compare notes 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.270
 which thicker than any other 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.650
 smartphone to date 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.660
 is interesting to see and have a 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.810
 ideology than what is a smartphone 10 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.560
 thousand feet a battery that according to our 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.210
 hard source give for an intensive use of 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.340
 a week 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.410
 until when will this be the real number 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.180
 is to believe 3,000 milan loses it 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.120
 really a lot of scene 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.470
 this terminal is and that's it then here 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.630
 some of the photographs 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.970
 I hope they like us to leave 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.739
 the bank to help until you can speak 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.420
 in Portuguese us at this time is no longer 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.280
 the first nor hide third 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.770
 exclusive we have brands 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.130
 htc 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.530
 we had even super important 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.050
 so only with your support is 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.330
 we will be able to go further and are the 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.920
 if they let me and understand that I 'm going 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.200
