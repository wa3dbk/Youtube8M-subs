work every day for over the next month

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.870 
work every day for over the next month
and<00:01:39.810> then<00:01:40.260> splice<00:01:41.160> all<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> videos<00:01:41.700> together

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
and then splice all the videos together

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.580 
and then splice all the videos together
so<00:01:42.270> as<00:01:42.390> I'm<00:01:42.570> driving<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> street<00:01:43.670> it'll

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
so as I'm driving down the street it'll

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
so as I'm driving down the street it'll
the<00:01:46.590> video<00:01:46.920> will<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.610> jump<00:01:47.880> from<00:01:48.060> day<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.300> day

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
the video will will jump from day to day

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.250 
the video will will jump from day to day
and<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.070> my<00:01:50.550> goal<00:01:50.760> is<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.240> see<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.540> changing<00:01:52.140> of

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.800 
and so my goal is to see the changing of
the<00:01:52.320> seasons<00:01:53.210> from<00:01:54.410> snow<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.650> bare<00:01:55.830> trees<00:01:56.190> to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the seasons from snow and bare trees to

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.860 
the seasons from snow and bare trees to
green<00:01:57.810> grass<00:01:58.440> and<00:01:58.470> leaves
