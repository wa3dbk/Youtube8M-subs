modeling software lacks Maya 3ds max or
Katya<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:38.180> can<00:00:38.360> see<00:00:38.570> in<00:00:38.629> the<00:00:38.720> viewport

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
Katya and you can see in the viewport

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.500 
Katya and you can see in the viewport
directly<00:00:39.440> with<00:00:39.589> the<00:00:39.710> glasses<00:00:40.000> you<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.150> work

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
directly with the glasses you have work

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.410 
directly with the glasses you have work
in<00:00:41.780> 3d<00:00:42.140> so<00:00:42.799> it's<00:00:42.949> a<00:00:43.100> very<00:00:43.489> nice<00:00:43.760> revolution

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
in 3d so it's a very nice revolution

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.200 
in 3d so it's a very nice revolution
because<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:45.350> cost<00:00:46.070> of<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.309> solution<00:00:46.580> is<00:00:47.000> very

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
because the cost of the solution is very

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.229 
because the cost of the solution is very
low<00:00:47.690> and<00:00:47.900> is<00:00:48.589> every<00:00:49.220> professional<00:00:49.729> yes

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
low and is every professional yes

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.090 
low and is every professional yes
dimension<00:00:50.780> 3<00:00:51.019> are<00:00:51.320> very<00:00:51.589> impressed<00:00:51.979> by

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
dimension 3 are very impressed by

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.430 
dimension 3 are very impressed by
solution<00:00:52.670> directly<00:00:52.850> in<00:00:53.119> 3d<00:00:53.330> and<00:00:53.479> Maya<00:00:53.629> how

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
solution directly in 3d and Maya how

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.840 
solution directly in 3d and Maya how
much<00:00:54.589> difference<00:00:54.949> other<00:00:55.129> than<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.400> graphics

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
much difference other than the graphics

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.990 
much difference other than the graphics
board<00:00:56.119> is<00:00:56.989> our<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.470> is<00:00:57.619> the<00:00:57.769> glasses<00:00:58.159> set<00:00:58.369> so

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
board is our the is the glasses set so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.240 
board is our the is the glasses set so
the<00:00:59.479> glasses<00:00:59.689> for<00:01:00.019> the<00:01:00.199> consumer<00:01:00.830> side<00:01:01.040> are

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
the glasses for the consumer side are

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.280 
the glasses for the consumer side are
infrared<00:01:01.760> connected<00:01:02.360> to<00:01:02.600> them<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.930> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
infrared connected to them and the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.530 
infrared connected to them and the
professional<00:01:03.830> version<00:01:04.159> will<00:01:04.309> be

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
professional version will be

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.969 
professional version will be
radiofrequency<00:01:05.540> connected<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.560> will<00:01:06.770> launch

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
radiofrequency connected it will launch

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.560 
radiofrequency connected it will launch
me<00:01:07.610> later<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.210> yours

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
me later this yours

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.539 
me later this yours
so<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.170> more<00:01:09.380> Hardy<00:01:09.710> connection<00:01:10.189> in<00:01:10.399> other

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
so a more Hardy connection in other

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.569 
so a more Hardy connection in other
words<00:01:10.759> yes<00:01:11.450> exactly<00:01:11.780> because<00:01:12.289> the<00:01:12.920> in<00:01:13.340> fried

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
words yes exactly because the in fried

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.609 
words yes exactly because the in fried
corn<00:01:13.789> a<00:01:13.850> treatment<00:01:14.210> of<00:01:14.420> some<00:01:14.810> interference<00:01:15.469> in

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
corn a treatment of some interference in

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:16.660 
corn a treatment of some interference in
the<00:01:15.710> professional<00:01:16.159> world<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:16.520> the

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
the professional world and the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.749 
the professional world and the
radiofrequency<00:01:17.030> no<00:01:17.659> interference

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
radiofrequency no interference

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:20.919 
radiofrequency no interference
okay<00:01:19.759> that's<00:01:20.149> great<00:01:20.359> we're<00:01:20.479> gonna<00:01:20.539> go<00:01:20.719> take<00:01:20.869> a

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
okay that's great we're gonna go take a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.910 
okay that's great we're gonna go take a
look<00:01:21.109> at<00:01:21.229> it<00:01:21.320> right<00:01:21.409> now

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
have an affordable system that they can

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.340 
have an affordable system that they can
go<00:01:30.740> ahead<00:01:30.859> and<00:01:31.130> see<00:01:31.369> their<00:01:31.609> work<00:01:31.850> in<00:01:32.119> 3d<00:01:32.630> here

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
go ahead and see their work in 3d here

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.169 
go ahead and see their work in 3d here
we<00:01:33.469> have<00:01:33.679> invidious<00:01:34.280> system<00:01:34.700> that's<00:01:34.880> going<00:01:35.119> to

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
we have invidious system that's going to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.719 
we have invidious system that's going to
come<00:01:35.359> out<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.780> when<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.009> this<00:01:37.429> is<00:01:37.549> an<00:01:37.640> early

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
come out and when so this is an early

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.239 
come out and when so this is an early
preview<00:01:38.210> of<00:01:38.569> new<00:01:38.780> driver<00:01:39.049> for<00:01:39.350> quad<00:01:39.590> robot<00:01:40.009> and

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:40.249 
preview of new driver for quad robot and

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:42.190 
preview of new driver for quad robot and
it<00:01:40.700> will<00:01:40.850> be<00:01:40.969> launched<00:01:41.179> at<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.689> end<00:01:41.869> of<00:01:42.049> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
it will be launched at the end of the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.249 
it will be launched at the end of the
years<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.979> we<00:01:43.369> can<00:01:43.549> see<00:01:43.759> ya<00:01:43.999> in<00:01:44.359> Maya<00:01:44.749> in<00:01:45.109> the

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
years so we can see ya in Maya in the

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.919 
years so we can see ya in Maya in the
viewport<00:01:45.740> so<00:01:46.130> pretty<00:01:46.640> directly<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.719> the

and we researched glasses you can see it
very<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.920> can<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.280> in<00:02:52.400> 3d<00:02:52.610> so<00:02:53.180> it's<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.599> very

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
very you can see it in 3d so it's a very

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.890 
very you can see it in 3d so it's a very
interesting<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:54.709> you<00:02:54.769> have<00:02:54.980> only<00:02:55.190> zeros<00:02:56.150> you

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
interesting so you have only zeros you

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.640 
interesting so you have only zeros you
have<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.140> activate<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.220> active<00:02:58.579> stereos<00:02:58.940> and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
have to activate so active stereos and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.460 
have to activate so active stereos and
that's<00:03:00.650> it<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.040> you<00:03:01.489> can<00:03:01.670> see<00:03:01.849> them<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:03.260> same
