00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 and they also get this might sp 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.549
 strong or video on this occasion as is 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.290
 being good because it is a new 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.059
 video in which I'm going to show you a 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.740
 new patch and how are you seeing then 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 There is one of the main novelties by 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 do not say the main one change the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.250
 minotaurs by the titans this is a 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 thing that I warned you already a couple of 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.710
 months or so if things will occur 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.320
 this change and now it comes as you see in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.820
 ours in this case is this camille 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.220
 I do not think it's particularly cool 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 because that's how good it is to us 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.210
 weird are not two titans but good 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.190
 they're pretty good the other titan is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.110
 different and how I'm going to show it 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 Well, there's the grace because 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.410
 he chose mercury what I'm going to try 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 to do is so that you do not have to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.440
 work all the part of practice that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590
 because it will be boring because 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.739
 obviously good because it does not have much 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.510
 thing to play against a bot then what I'm going 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.910
 to do is when you have level 5 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.559
 just infiltrate your base and that 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.829
 you see the minotaur then some seconds 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.170
 what allows me and what allows me 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.159
 Well, to get in there, not so good 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.740
 yes yes 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.560
 the idea that I have planned here I'm going to 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.700
 die and that more than more includes this 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.920
 patch not for the truth enough 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.689
 explicit interesting very remarkable 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.609
 but something interesting is how you see 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.549
 changed a bit this this aspect the 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.200
 store in exchange also this bookmark and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.030
 this marker of 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.560
 here that it's good for me to have died for 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.869
 show you the good, the truth is that 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.509
 they are visual changes that good for you 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.090
 you can like more or less no more little things 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.310
 more things TV by two towers all 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.819
 these the sports have gone up a lot their 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.799
 rope as you see here 180 what before 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:44.969
 they were good here they were 60 seconds now 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.619
 they are 120 is the truth a bitch pretty 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.719
 great for me for example who buys it 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.369
 always in on it because 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:53.689
 obviously has double pull 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:56.909
 down then well enough 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.530
 annoying not as you see have added a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.579
 new hugo teleport option that is going to 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.379
 allow teleport to the gods 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:07.140
 allies so well then it's pretty 

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:10.109
 interesting as you can see it's worth a thousand 100 or more 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.760
 little things that have been established in this 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:14.310
 upgrade 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.840
 that not too much remarkable a new 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.480
 he is the one who gives clouds that the truth is very 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.670
 very cool and something else 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.079
 torra has suffered a kind of robot 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.360
 that although it is not a balloon I would not call it 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.579
 robot because it is not, but it has been 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.299
 made a kind of good improvement by 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:31.980
 so to say it in which as we explain 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.480
 you will have to see it but I did not want 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.640
 take it because if he could not teach us 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.010
 the other minotaur that was the thing 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 principal have only obscured a 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.200
 little their shoulder pads so to speak and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.120
 Landa a little more serious touch not by 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.590
 so to say that I think we will do well 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.510
 what we are going to buy now 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.359
 then it will be life to be able 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.790
 hold more when the minotaur us 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:55.440
 hit as I tell you they have done it a bit 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.359
 more serious the radio I think you need 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.599
 this update because everything seemed 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.549
 as a toy is not like that 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.950
 other gods because they have a more more tone 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 serious more than god this one seemed like as 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:11.430
 a child toy no no no I did not have 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.530
 it seems too much presence so 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.870
 say it and I think good bastard today 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.239
 palau is going to be pretty good for you 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.600
 that's good just so that what 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.970
 know 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.040
 at level five because they are killing us 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.750
 all the time and that favors us we go to 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.390
 try to kill some children here 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.100
 we already have it, let's see if we die 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.590
 new for 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.550
 As you can see, his icon has also changed 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.320
 of which we obviously do not see each other and 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.510
 when we take away life from him 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.890
 as you see, now it is different 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:48.250
 let's try to try to infiltrate 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.220
 at the base of the minotaur for good 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.840
 of the titans and well he wanted that 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.950
 I put is also in comments that 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.140
 it seems to you that it is not necessary 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.060
 update if you like it more like this 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.430
 like minotaurs more man I think 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.379
 that to see the minotaurs will be a bit 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.879
 the essence of smile but good 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.440
 titans these can be also 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.790
 quite obviously it's nothing 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.370
 that affects the game or anything but good 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:11.230
 Well yes it will be noticed a little bit we are going to 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.359
 use and the last to get us there so 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.700
 They are very attentive because you are going 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.310
 to see a few seconds as you see 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.320
 load now the last mercury is loaded and 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.150
 here you are seeing the enemy titan the 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.610
 truth I think it's much cooler 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.400
 that ours as you are seeing 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.020
 Well, that's the enemy minotaur, not like that 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.430
 that this has been all the whole 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.100
 information that he had to give on the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.330
 parquet I hope you liked it 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.330
 enjoying maita until another goodbye
