00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.700 
can see you won't see me break at all as
indicated<00:01:30.450> by<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> breaking<00:01:31.229> lights<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
indicated by the breaking lights and

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.620 
indicated by the breaking lights and
what<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> recommend<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.880> also<00:01:33.240> putting<00:01:33.450> your

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
what I recommend is also putting your

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.420 
what I recommend is also putting your
finger<00:01:33.960> underneath<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.860> trigger<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.340> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
finger underneath the trigger so you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210 
finger underneath the trigger so you
don't<00:01:35.610> accidentally<00:01:36.180> press<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> by<00:01:37.320> habit<00:01:38.070> or

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
don't accidentally press it by habit or

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700 
don't accidentally press it by habit or
instinct<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.259> achievement

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
instinct and that's the achievement

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
instinct and that's the achievement
pretty<00:01:41.070> easy<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> ask<00:01:41.880> me<00:01:42.119> again<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.780> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pretty easy if you ask me again you can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
pretty easy if you ask me again you can
change<00:01:43.140> your<00:01:43.200> difficulty<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:43.950> easy<00:01:44.189> if

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
change your difficulty to very easy if

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.850 
change your difficulty to very easy if
you<00:01:44.670> desire<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.930> recommend<00:01:46.380> this<00:01:46.530> track

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
you desire and I recommend this track

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.560 
you desire and I recommend this track
