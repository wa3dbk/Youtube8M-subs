00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.170 

you'll<00:01:52.770> see<00:01:53.040> it's<00:01:53.250> starting<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> grind<00:01:53.970> off

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
you'll see it's starting to grind off

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.170 
you'll see it's starting to grind off
the<00:01:54.360> bottom<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> model<00:01:55.460> very<00:01:56.460> evenly<00:01:57.060> in

the bottom of the model very evenly in
uniformly

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.859 

the<00:02:00.490> more<00:02:00.670> pressure<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.120> apply<00:02:01.210> the<00:02:01.450> quicker

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
the more pressure you apply the quicker

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:10.730 
the more pressure you apply the quicker
it<00:02:02.110> will<00:02:02.260> grind<00:02:02.440> off

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.640 

and<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.460> can<00:02:11.610> trim<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.970> sides<00:02:12.650> by

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and then you can trim the sides by

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.840 
and then you can trim the sides by
either<00:02:13.860> placing<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.490> table<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
either placing it on the table and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.400 
either placing it on the table and
advancing<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.390> towards<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.810> disc<00:02:16.020> now<00:02:16.260> it's

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
advancing it towards the disc now it's

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.500 
advancing it towards the disc now it's
hard<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.800> see<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.580> buckle<00:02:17.910> side<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.330> teeth

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
hard to see the buckle side of the teeth

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.480 
hard to see the buckle side of the teeth
from<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.680> may<00:02:19.890> want<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> tilt<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
from here so you may want to tilt the

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.890 
from here so you may want to tilt the
model<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:20.970> make<00:02:21.120> sure<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.660> good

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
model but make sure that you have a good

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:30.110 
model but make sure that you have a good
grip<00:02:22.140> on<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> model<00:02:22.680> when<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:22.830> do<00:02:23.010> so
