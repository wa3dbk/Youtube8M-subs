 thanks to an enrollee, I do not 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.630
 I know if I can speak the whole name 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.340

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.349
 chatting with me I was trading 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.750
 a role that was a chat with 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.510
 him and he asked me he bought the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.219

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
 asked me to say dude how do i 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 switch off the engine. 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.950
 price of 14 né 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.899

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 I can not get it together. 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.940
 the control because they do not leave three was 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.680
 It's very simple, just you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.600
 button here 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.840
 let's see if this little button gives focus 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.140
 of ps that already seemed the option for you 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.110
 turn the right control and and this is not a 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.060
 same doubt can not turn off then 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.750
 adjusting devices left to give a focus 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 best is to do playstation 4 site 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.360
 standby mode is turned off in this 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.890

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.189
