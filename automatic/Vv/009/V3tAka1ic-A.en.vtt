00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:11.550
 Welcome to a cooperative mode 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:14.370
 technological another mobile that is fine 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.020
 if he paints very well and also baratito that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.230
 it's affordable it 's very affordable also the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.230
 people 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.970
 IE6 which the Spanish brand bq and 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.380
 I brought in the box because it has 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.000
 seemed good is a detail that now 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
 I will go deeper than 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.840
 it has a very very good packaging very 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.480
 It is not a pack because they already had it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.719
 open in boxing but but good what 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.090
 I have here because look has the phone 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.590
 here nothing else and then this to me 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.200
 personally, then I have to 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.710
 come back and it's a book put the charger and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.600
 everything has it very neat 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.230
 army took cardboard boxes a 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.780
 alone and good apart from the foolishness of a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.059
 phone by the house the box but it is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.769
 that is a test of quebec and he hears 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.400
 is taking seriously what to enter into 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.800
 a kind of range 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.350
 and especially now that we remember that the 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.560
 nexus already costs money at junctions 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.510
 it's already six hundred and a half euros then bq 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.850
 He said hey, we can do 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.730
 also be a good phone a good 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.550
 quality alternative price and here 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.670
 we have the tacuary is six at least 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.930
 good much 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.909
 but for a lot here come the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.350
 instructions and such and it reminds me a lot 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.970
 to the apple that comes here in the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.000
 cardboard stored the key to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.009
 take them out and although you're pretty careful 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.090
 and good today the phone at the end yes alone 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.759
 take care in the box because it does not help 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.070
 the phone is pretty good are this 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.299
 is the 6-inch we already had here not 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.659
 I know if you remember because it was a while ago 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.180
 the 5 in the hd there is another full hd that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.039
 day with this the high-end 3 that are 6 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.789
 inches is a pretty big phone 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.550
 it is even merited but good does not weigh 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.560
 a lot we have to remember that we can not 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.899
 compare with much more expensive phones 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.560
 because yes they would take much more care 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.480
 edges but today is not kind is not 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.580
 uncomfortable to wear are not many 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.950
 inches then allows loading 6 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.989
 inches to see to see content 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 audiovisual are going to play because it is very 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.319
 all right 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.230
 and good then the design apart from that 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.939
 It could be not rough, but it's a tad 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.260
 voluminous is pretty careful we see 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.650
 the back I liked 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.879
 a lot here is a 7 a plastic but 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:39.489
 well very this opaque tone is from 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:42.400
 This is very good, it's pretty good and 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.290
 the most important screen that is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.170
 quite important are already I tell you if 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.969
 inches a pretty quality is in 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.829
 around 320-odd or pixels by 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.000
 inch that good a few years ago we 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.189
 It had seemed one of the best 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.340
 market is now good now the 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.109
 large reach 400 500 but that 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.579
 it's pretty good performance 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.230
 quite well in a processor 8 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.000
 cores so obviously here for the same 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.609
 we are not talking about a snapdragon but about a 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.139
 cortex to 7 but enough then the 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.359
 pretty components and energies of rne 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.430
 16 storage camera 13 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.720
 megapixels what we always say with 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.419
 these devices can not wait 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.579
 wonders very tight good 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:21.639
 components but very tight to be able 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.319
 offer about what 299 euros is to say 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.900
 below 300 euros find a 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:29.829
 terminal of these characteristics is 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.030
 well it's a mid- range high- end range too 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.110
 another detail by the way that we have previously 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.989
 talked about the sim has for two 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.110
 then it does not always allow a saving of 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.110
 resources 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.400
 because although now it is taking more 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.870
 seriously what would be its high-end 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.040
 he knows that he is not going to go 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.349
 aimed at an audience that seeks more 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.989
 save you are more concerned about the price and 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.900
 having a slot for the sims is one of 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.349
 the key to saving time as 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.090
 it's very good I'm telling you it's a terminal 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.970
 of everything else that is very 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.790
 well, there is not much offer in this 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.310
 format on such a large screen and 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.269
 recusa positioned and right now has 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.659
 two terminals I hope we can 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.069
 teach both the 5-inch full hd and 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.069
 right now it has two terminals that 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.380
 they are quite good in their range yes yes yes 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.359
 what you say is six inches there 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.729
 very few very few especially for this 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.110
 price and 209 very little and on android 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.419
 yes we have some lumia for example 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.880
 the 1320 but but for this price 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.030
 Android with good performance is difficult 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.030
 find something 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.360
 it's something that competes with this aquarium 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.520
 it is also Spanish we have also spoken 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.080
 always very good to see how he has gone 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.790
 positioning and good a company that has 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.050
 grown a lot that started doing me 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.330
 it seems that electronic books 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.010
 electronic and now they are doing this 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.390
 printer stress neighbor of the headquarters 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.490
 avoidable has gotten into the subject of 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.870
 smartphone and very well very well happened to 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.990
 step and making a product that every 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:02.140
 true orejÃ³n and competing then thank you 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.140
 for bringing us Guillermo this aquarium and 6 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.060
 thank you 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.700
 Guillermo and we are going here the ones that you are looking for 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.110
