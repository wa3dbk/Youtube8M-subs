but I have to do a RiRi Archer track
thing<00:01:17.750> so<00:01:18.750> we<00:01:19.080> could<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.320> more<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.680> next

thing so we could use more in the next

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.710 
thing so we could use more in the next
games<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.549> there's<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:20.850> gonna<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.330> one

anti-gravity<00:02:04.530> around<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.890> walls<00:02:05.100> here<00:02:05.700> so

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
anti-gravity around the walls here so

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:11.100 
anti-gravity around the walls here so
yeah<00:02:08.539> there's<00:02:09.539> not<00:02:09.690> much<00:02:09.840> detail<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.259> it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
yeah there's not much detail to it

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.229 
yeah there's not much detail to it
kind<00:02:11.860> of<00:02:11.890> for<00:02:12.069> our<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.370> boss<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:12.940> work<00:02:13.090> for

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
kind of for our the boss to work for

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.790 
kind of for our the boss to work for
some<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.540> courses<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.470> why<00:02:14.620> didn't

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
some of the courses so that's why didn't

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.460 
some of the courses so that's why didn't
put<00:02:14.890> him<00:02:14.980> in<00:02:16.140> shell<00:02:17.140> cup<00:02:17.319> to<00:02:17.530> GBA<00:02:18.250> she's<00:02:18.790> lying

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
put him in shell cup to GBA she's lying

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.580 
put him in shell cup to GBA she's lying
like<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.560> said<00:02:20.769> not<00:02:20.980> much<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.519> see<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:23.500> you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
like I said not much to see but if you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.530 
like I said not much to see but if you
want<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.830> see<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.069> pause<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.670> can<00:02:25.330> take<00:02:25.510> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
want to see it pause it you can take a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.809 
want to see it pause it you can take a
look<00:02:25.690> at<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:25.989> I<00:02:26.170> looked<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.769> the<00:02:26.860> on<00:02:27.160> Super

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
look at it I looked at the on Super

right<00:02:38.799> here<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.610> mountain<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:43.150> he<00:02:43.420> is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
right here of the mountain and he is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.050 
right here of the mountain and he is
frappe<00:02:43.840> snow<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:45.340> anti-gravity

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
frappe snow and there's anti-gravity

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.120 
frappe snow and there's anti-gravity
around<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.810> wall<00:02:47.019> are<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.860> to<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
around the wall are you going to the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.550 
around the wall are you going to the
yeah<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:49.060> kind<00:02:49.239> of<00:02:49.269> wall<00:02:49.420> thing<00:02:49.630> so<00:02:50.410> yeah

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
yeah that kind of wall thing so yeah

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.259 
yeah that kind of wall thing so yeah
this<00:02:50.920> I<00:02:51.099> hadn't<00:02:51.370> really<00:02:51.519> use<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.760> course<00:02:52.060> for

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
this I hadn't really use this course for

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:56.250 
this I hadn't really use this course for
Mario<00:02:52.480> Kart<00:02:52.510> BS<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:55.239> our<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:55.599> to<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.019> this

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
Mario Kart BS and our on to be it this

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.600 
Mario Kart BS and our on to be it this
is<00:02:56.440> me<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.650> shorter<00:02:56.920> video<00:02:57.160> because<00:02:57.459> there's

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
is me a shorter video because there's

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.280 
is me a shorter video because there's
not<00:02:57.700> much<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.910> show<00:02:57.940> water<00:02:58.750> park<00:02:59.049> from<00:02:59.140> will

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
not much to show water park from will

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.900 
not much to show water park from will
you<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.739> really<00:03:00.069> this<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.459> pretty<00:03:00.610> tricky

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
you this is really this is pretty tricky

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.900 
you this is really this is pretty tricky
to<00:03:01.030> duplicate<00:03:01.629> because<00:03:02.040> even<00:03:03.040> though<00:03:03.190> lots<00:03:03.819> of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
to duplicate because even though lots of

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.630 
to duplicate because even though lots of
cruisers<00:03:04.269> kind<00:03:04.510> of<00:03:04.569> easier<00:03:04.870> ironically<00:03:05.680> so

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
cruisers kind of easier ironically so

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.970 
cruisers kind of easier ironically so
this<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.150> pretty<00:03:07.329> hard<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.660> duplicate<00:03:08.110> due<00:03:08.860> to

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
this is pretty hard to duplicate due to

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.500 
this is pretty hard to duplicate due to
the<00:03:09.099> fact<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.430> was<00:03:09.700> actually<00:03:09.790> anti-gravity<00:03:10.450> in

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
the fact it was actually anti-gravity in

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.930 
the fact it was actually anti-gravity in
the<00:03:10.599> car<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.140> course<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:12.069> I<00:03:12.099> would<00:03:12.370> I<00:03:12.670> can

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
the car and of course so I would I can

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.369 
the car and of course so I would I can
really<00:03:13.120> put<00:03:13.510> anything<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:13.900> besides<00:03:14.200> the

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
really put anything in besides the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.150 
really put anything in besides the
antigravity<00:03:14.859> in<00:03:15.040> which<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.060> already<00:03:16.269> in<00:03:16.359> there

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
antigravity in which is already in there

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.770 
antigravity in which is already in there
cuz<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.370> don't<00:03:18.519> really<00:03:18.880> have<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> plate<00:03:19.450> marker

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
cuz I don't really have a plate marker

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.410 
cuz I don't really have a plate marker
Nate<00:03:19.930> I<00:03:20.200> played<00:03:20.889> marker<00:03:21.220> Nate<00:03:21.370> just<00:03:21.609> have<00:03:22.239> wait

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
Nate I played marker Nate just have wait

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.039 
Nate I played marker Nate just have wait
that<00:03:22.630> much<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.019> know<00:03:23.370> mushroom<00:03:24.370> city<00:03:24.750> lots<00:03:25.750> of

that much to know mushroom city lots of

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.890 
that much to know mushroom city lots of
anti-gravity<00:03:26.819> because<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:28.000> city<00:03:28.209> there's

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
anti-gravity because the city there's

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.660 
anti-gravity because the city there's
lots<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.260> go<00:03:31.799> like<00:03:32.799> I<00:03:32.889> said<00:03:32.950> pause<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:33.579> want

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
lots to go like I said pause if you want

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.670 
lots to go like I said pause if you want
to<00:03:33.819> look<00:03:33.940> at<00:03:34.030> it<00:03:34.150> even<00:03:34.329> more<00:03:34.630> Givi<00:03:35.139> our<00:03:35.319> star

there's<00:03:41.049> some<00:03:41.290> trench<00:03:41.859> parting<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.370> this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
there's some trench parting and this

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.690 
there's some trench parting and this
track<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:43.930> don't<00:03:44.799> this<00:03:44.980> first<00:03:45.250> track<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.459> do

it was pretty big now this was even

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.350 
it was pretty big now this was even
trickier<00:04:11.590> there's<00:04:12.489> lots<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.970> anti-gravity

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
trickier there's lots of anti-gravity

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.990 
trickier there's lots of anti-gravity
here<00:04:13.780> do<00:04:13.989> this<00:04:14.110> next<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.620> wall<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.730> put<00:04:15.909> it

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
here do this next to a wall so I put it

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.090 
here do this next to a wall so I put it
in<00:04:16.090> here<00:04:16.359> it's<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:17.019> bumpy<00:04:17.320> area<00:04:17.620> we're<00:04:17.979> on<00:04:18.070> a

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
in here it's a bumpy area we're on a

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.200 
in here it's a bumpy area we're on a
leaf<00:04:18.340> Cup<00:04:18.579> now<00:04:20.370> but<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.669> one<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:21.970> was

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
leaf Cup now but I like one this was

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.939 
leaf Cup now but I like one this was
extremely<00:04:22.570> hard<00:04:22.810> to<00:04:22.930> duplicate<00:04:23.350> because<00:04:23.530> it's

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:23.949 
extremely hard to duplicate because it's

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.680 
extremely hard to duplicate because it's
I<00:04:24.250> can't<00:04:24.940> do<00:04:25.060> it<00:04:25.150> perfectly

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
I can't do it perfectly

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.450 
I can't do it perfectly
obviously<00:04:26.080> all<00:04:26.530> I<00:04:26.590> did<00:04:26.860> was<00:04:27.009> it's<00:04:27.130> just<00:04:27.250> kind

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
obviously all I did was it's just kind

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.340 
obviously all I did was it's just kind
of<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.610> revansch<00:04:28.270> rugged<00:04:28.810> shape<00:04:29.050> around<00:04:29.199> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
of the revansch rugged shape around the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:36.060 
of the revansch rugged shape around the
sides<00:04:29.610> those<00:04:34.259> this<00:04:35.259> is<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.590> hardest<00:04:35.889> to

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
sides those this is the hardest to

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.770 
sides those this is the hardest to
duplicate<00:04:36.460> cuz<00:04:36.699> I<00:04:36.940> don't<00:04:37.240> really<00:04:37.449> know<00:04:37.600> if<00:04:37.630> I

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
duplicate cuz I don't really know if I

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.980 
duplicate cuz I don't really know if I
was<00:04:37.900> doing<00:04:38.050> it<00:04:38.199> right<00:04:39.690> yeah

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
was doing it right yeah

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.010 
was doing it right yeah
looks<00:04:41.289> looked<00:04:41.770> pretty<00:04:41.919> hard<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> just<00:04:43.840> took

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
looks looked pretty hard so I just took

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.050 
looks looked pretty hard so I just took
part<00:04:44.560> of<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:44.680> corset<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.490> put<00:04:45.699> that<00:04:45.850> there

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
part of the corset and put that there

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.240 
part of the corset and put that there
instead<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.680> decided<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.830> leave<00:04:47.949> that<00:04:47.979> as<00:04:48.220> a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
instead I decided to leave that as a

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.430 
instead I decided to leave that as a
gliding<00:04:48.940> area<00:04:49.210> because<00:04:49.479> it's<00:04:49.930> fun<00:04:52.139> okay<00:04:53.139> we're

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
gliding area because it's fun okay we're

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.390 
gliding area because it's fun okay we're
all<00:04:53.620> done<00:04:55.080> we<00:04:56.080> move<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.349> highway<00:04:56.830> a<00:04:57.070> lot<00:04:57.250> to

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
all done we move you highway a lot to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.129 
all done we move you highway a lot to
venture<00:04:57.669> gravity<00:04:58.060> like<00:04:58.210> I<00:04:58.240> said<00:04:58.510> before<00:04:58.690> it's

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
venture gravity like I said before it's

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.050 
venture gravity like I said before it's
a<00:04:59.169> city<00:04:59.380> level<00:04:59.590> now<00:05:00.340> just<00:05:00.520> notice<00:05:00.669> they<00:05:00.820> took

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
a city level now just notice they took

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.730 
a city level now just notice they took
two<00:05:01.240> city<00:05:01.509> levels<00:05:03.960> concept<00:05:04.960> crews<00:05:05.139> from<00:05:05.410> we

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
two city levels concept crews from we

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.219 
two city levels concept crews from we
you<00:05:05.949> I<00:05:06.160> messed<00:05:07.090> up<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.240> first<00:05:07.449> time<00:05:07.690> like<00:05:08.020> I

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
you I messed up the first time like I

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.110 
you I messed up the first time like I
put<00:05:08.500> the<00:05:08.620> bouncy<00:05:09.160> mushroom<00:05:09.250> right<00:05:09.520> here<00:05:09.729> so

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
put the bouncy mushroom right here so

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.279 
put the bouncy mushroom right here so
I'd<00:05:10.240> redo<00:05:10.990> it

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
I'd redo it

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:13.320 
I'd redo it
I<00:05:11.320> put<00:05:12.310> the<00:05:12.430> portal<00:05:12.699> in<00:05:12.760> there<00:05:12.880> but<00:05:13.120> kept<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
I put the portal in there but kept the

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.450 
I put the portal in there but kept the
glad<00:05:13.630> you're<00:05:13.840> here<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:16.560> then<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.770> have<00:05:17.979> sure

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
glad you're here and then we have sure

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.689 
glad you're here and then we have sure

city<00:05:21.970> levels<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.419> just<00:05:22.750> realized<00:05:23.050> that

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
city levels I just realized that

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.300 
city levels I just realized that
Oh<00:05:25.229> don't<00:05:26.229> rock<00:05:26.289> me<00:05:26.470> anymore<00:05:26.650> for<00:05:27.039> the<00:05:27.159> next

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
Oh don't rock me anymore for the next

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.939 
Oh don't rock me anymore for the next
game<00:05:27.780> alright<00:05:28.780> all<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.020> new<00:05:29.139> knew<00:05:29.590> about<00:05:29.710> the

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
game alright all the new knew about the

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:33.779 
game alright all the new knew about the
city<00:05:30.130> we<00:05:31.120> bounced<00:05:31.419> her<00:05:31.539> castle<00:05:32.280> so<00:05:33.280> yeah<00:05:33.490> and

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
city we bounced her castle so yeah and

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.430 
city we bounced her castle so yeah and
for<00:05:34.120> gravity<00:05:34.449> around<00:05:34.570> the<00:05:34.750> walls<00:05:34.960> they're

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
for gravity around the walls they're

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.379 
for gravity around the walls they're
gonna<00:05:36.220> think<00:05:36.370> figure<00:05:36.729> out<00:05:36.849> another<00:05:37.000> place<00:05:37.270> to

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:37.389 
gonna think figure out another place to

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.000 
gonna think figure out another place to
put<00:05:37.419> it<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:38.340> to<00:05:39.340> cut<00:05:39.610> this<00:05:39.699> video<00:05:39.909> pits<00:05:40.210> shorts

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
put it and to cut this video pits shorts

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.980 
put it and to cut this video pits shorts

GB RAM run um transporting sections so

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.140 
GB RAM run um transporting sections so
yeah<00:05:47.169> this<00:05:47.710> was<00:05:47.889> not<00:05:48.039> the<00:05:48.310> longest<00:05:48.520> video<00:05:49.030> in

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
yeah this was not the longest video in

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.779 
yeah this was not the longest video in
the<00:05:49.240> world<00:05:49.389> but<00:05:50.380> it<00:05:50.530> was<00:05:50.560> pretty<00:05:51.099> well<00:05:51.340> pretty

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
the world but it was pretty well pretty

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.820 
the world but it was pretty well pretty
fine<00:05:52.060> so<00:05:53.220> next<00:05:54.220> I'll<00:05:54.580> be<00:05:54.639> doing<00:05:55.800> characters<00:05:56.800> I

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
fine so next I'll be doing characters I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.850 
fine so next I'll be doing characters I
think<00:05:57.099> will<00:05:57.460> be<00:05:57.550> in<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.699> next<00:05:57.880> game<00:05:58.440> so<00:05:59.440> um<00:05:59.680> if

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860
