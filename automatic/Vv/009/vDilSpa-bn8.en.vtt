 bundesliga season 2014/2015 we type 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.929
 if it gets this year and more 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.640

 kiki live underlined on fish going on 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.109
 let's go with our forecast 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.660
 relegation battle on 34 games 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.160
 how is the initial situation very surprised 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.260
 because six teams are still stuck in the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.550
 descent hard on the thirteenth 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.059
 place can still be in the relegation 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.100
 slip 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.500
 for freiburg hannover stuttgart and the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 HSV in places 14 to 17 is everything 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.570
 possible direct relegation or relegation 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.219
 class retention and for paderborn on the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.079
 eighth place is still the maximum 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.149
 relegation on place 16 in it 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.309
 So we're tapping the players of all 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.289
 involved teams hope home 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.340
 against heart he must abroad in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.500
 compete in hope home 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.420
 for the tsg is in this game and 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.589
 nothing at all you want to maximize 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.339
 still good from your own fans 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.380
 saying goodbye 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.540
 after two recent defeats that would be 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
 also necessary and on paper you have 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.049
 the better squad than the hertha 's 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 berliner, on the other hand , still needs at least 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.689
 but one point has been playing for six 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.430
 without victory 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.530
 You are on a clear downward trend 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.780
 are still not through though they are 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.850
 a few weeks already saved ours 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.070
 tip hope home game frees up and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.990
 wins at home against the hertha's 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.340
 hsv plays at home against Schalke 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.840
 Everyone already has the hamburger 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.740
 written off actually speaks 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.570
 nothing for her anymore 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.250
 the stadium will still be full 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 and the fans will be everything again 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.439
 give 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 Schalke sees it 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.130
 also not good from the royal blue ones are 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.409
 a very bad form and by mr 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.149
 Protest and internal disputes 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.840
 it is also unsettled for her 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.329
 nothing more 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.860
 the europe league is for sure our tip 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.479
 the hsv grabs him surprisingly 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 act and strike the Schalke 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.140
 last game at home 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.180
 it gets really exciting in hannover where 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.189
 with 96 and freiburg two direct 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.570
 competitors meet each other 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.640
 they can not draw either 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.899
 directly but hannover could 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.329
 still in the relegation need 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.369
 in the 96ern the knot seems to be 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.349
 the victory in Augsburg bounced si 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.819
 have a home game in front of full house and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.959
 Actually , the team is much too 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.060
 good to descend 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.920
 on the other hand, freiburg is on paper 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.720
 worse team after the victory against 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.890
 bavaria could be the breisgauer already 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.269
 feeling a bit too safe 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.069
 besides, they were always over again 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.540
 surprising and constant the last 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 weeks like the home defeat 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.030
 against paderborn and put ball like that 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.799
 Hanover wins at home against Freiburg 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.810
 and the last game with paderborns 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.129
 stuttgart meet again two direct 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.290
 competitors on each other 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.970
 the stuttgarters have the last weeks 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.470
 with two wins in a row the most 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.430
 ground well done and one clear 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.319
 positive trend 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.940
 also with huub stevens a very 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.769
 good and experienced trainer at the 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.650
 side and here is the team 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.849
 actually too good for the descent 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.319
 Although paderborn has a home game 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.359
 but the last games like for example 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.250
 on Schalke have shown that the squad 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.709
 for the national league just too weak 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.480
 is and the quality is missing our tip 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.790
 Stuttgart wins in Paderborn 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.129
 the table so as to see our 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.810
 tip from hannover in stuttgart would be 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.409
 Saved directly by her victories and 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.359
 love in it 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:11.040
 Paderborn and Freiburg would have to oppose it 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.730
 the direct way to the second league 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.620
 compete 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.090
 Harder would be despite the defeat 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.440
 saved because you at the same score 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.650
 the much better goal ratio 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.540
 under hsv would get the once again 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.639
 other networks chance as in the previous year in 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 the relegation to keep the class 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.879
 that was our kick tip for the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.769
 relegation battle on the 34th of the season
