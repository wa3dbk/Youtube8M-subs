will be it could be a full out trailer
for<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.350> expansion<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.100> could<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.549> bungee

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
for this expansion it could be bungee

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
for this expansion it could be bungee
just<00:01:15.240> letting<00:01:15.479> us<00:01:15.570> know<00:01:15.630> it's<00:01:15.840> coming<00:01:16.080> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
just letting us know it's coming and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
just letting us know it's coming and
giving<00:01:16.680> us<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.130> name<00:01:17.340> even<00:01:17.729> though<00:01:17.759> really

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
giving us the name even though really

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.630 
giving us the name even though really
narrow<00:01:18.420> or<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:18.840> might<00:01:19.020> even<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.560> CG<00:01:20.189> trailer

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
narrow or we might even get a CG trailer

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
narrow or we might even get a CG trailer
like<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.180> for<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> house<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.869> wolves<00:01:22.049> but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
like we did for the house of wolves but

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
like we did for the house of wolves but
I<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.460> does<00:01:23.759> confirm<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.420> we<00:01:24.509> are

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
I do think it does confirm that we are

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.600 
I do think it does confirm that we are
going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.960> be<00:01:25.049> seeing<00:01:25.380> some<00:01:25.740> presence<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.340> this

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
going to be seeing some presence of this

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480 
going to be seeing some presence of this
expansion<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.540> e3<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> what<00:01:29.340> this

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
expansion at e3 now as to what this

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
expansion at e3 now as to what this
expansion<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> contain<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:31.140> we

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
expansion is going to contain what we
