 please do not judge 5 above 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.680

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.160
 raphael tÃ©llez aka both people 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.250
 and how to play world number 5 with the 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.460
 This boy's invitation in my plan 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.460
 is to do 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.220
 your book and now guys welcome from 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.800
 new clear that is okay the last time 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.740
 we passed in the world number four of 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.670
 some pastries and it went pretty well 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.670
 I definitely have to say that 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.870
 is a great team I wish I could play 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.060
 always with me ok 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.080
 let's go to our world number 5 which is the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.220
 world that follows us 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.050
 and it's called 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:33.760
 I can not know I 'll know it after 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.760
 about 5 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.580
 is that we are playing in a format 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.400
 different from the game normally and a 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.650
 for governed ok let's start with 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.550
 our world is called rain of three 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.550
 letters 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.960
 and that was not necessary pseudo 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.729
 dies our special guest can not 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.729
 have a bubble 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.680
 he was not homosexual at all 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.110
 something that I remember this has another 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.610
 option 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.610
 and so it almost comes back 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.000
 ok and let's continue here let's move on 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.860
 at the first check point so that the first 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.900
 support as we can see well the 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.100
 you did good without waste before 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.370
 first check point as you can see 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.590
 we had the first star and here I can 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.450
 see the view is attacked by Caesar very 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.400
 all right 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.590
 and now we are going to call you will be undone 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.590

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.530
 and no no no no no 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:28.690
 and so they steal me in search of a very life 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.989
 all right 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.329

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.400
 tour 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.700
 or 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.030

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.840

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.490
 platform 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.490
