the<00:02:03.190> hatchlings<00:02:03.729> emerge<00:02:04.000> from<00:02:04.989> those<00:02:05.410> beaches

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
the hatchlings emerge from those beaches

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.760 
the hatchlings emerge from those beaches
they<00:02:07.180> would<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.480> swimming<00:02:07.990> into<00:02:08.259> an

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
they would be swimming into an

you<00:02:16.810> know<00:02:16.930> Sargassum<00:02:17.500> ly<00:02:17.620> well<00:02:18.310> that's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you know Sargassum ly well that's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.030 
you know Sargassum ly well that's
exactly<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:19.840> region<00:02:20.290> where<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:20.650> oil<00:02:20.830> was

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
exactly the region where the oil was

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
exactly the region where the oil was
accumulated<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.480> it<00:02:23.230> became<00:02:23.530> clear<00:02:23.800> that<00:02:24.060> they

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
accumulated so it became clear that they

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.660 
accumulated so it became clear that they
would<00:02:25.210> really<00:02:25.420> be<00:02:25.630> swimming<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.140> their<00:02:26.290> doom

way to clean it up

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.240 
way to clean it up
you<00:02:30.610> know<00:02:30.700> rapidly<00:02:31.590> it's<00:02:32.590> certainly<00:02:32.860> not<00:02:33.040> by

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
you know rapidly it's certainly not by

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.650 
you know rapidly it's certainly not by
the<00:02:33.310> time<00:02:33.580> that<00:02:33.730> these<00:02:33.820> hatchlings<00:02:34.090> began<00:02:34.510> to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the time that these hatchlings began to

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.170 
the time that these hatchlings began to
emerge<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.530> there<00:02:35.710> began<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.100> be<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:36.550> discussion

emerge so there began to be a discussion
about<00:02:37.510> what<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.020> alternatives<00:02:38.620> were<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.220> and

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
swim through the oil and we endorsed and

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.449 
swim through the oil and we endorsed and
supported<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:07.510> very<00:03:08.020> unique<00:03:08.380> plan<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:09.010> relocate

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
supported a very unique plan to relocate

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.410 
supported a very unique plan to relocate
the<00:03:09.880> eggs<00:03:10.060> from<00:03:10.989> from<00:03:11.260> from<00:03:11.590> those<00:03:11.739> beaches<00:03:12.420> to

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the eggs from from from those beaches to

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.199 
the eggs from from from those beaches to
essentially<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.290> safe<00:03:15.190> hatchery<00:03:15.880> or<00:03:15.970> an

incubation Center on the east coast of

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.370 
incubation Center on the east coast of
Florida<00:03:18.660> where<00:03:19.660> they<00:03:19.900> could<00:03:20.050> then<00:03:20.230> be

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
Florida where they could then be

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.770 
Florida where they could then be
released<00:03:20.560> into<00:03:21.040> the<00:03:21.190> Atlantic<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.690> know

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
released into the Atlantic and you know

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.910 
released into the Atlantic and you know
away<00:03:22.930> from<00:03:23.110> the<00:03:23.350> spill

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
away from the spill

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.120 
away from the spill
so<00:03:24.550> we<00:03:25.239> supported<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.900> plan<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:26.709> the

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
so we supported that plan and the

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.330 
so we supported that plan and the
development<00:03:27.640> of<00:03:27.730> it<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.100> when<00:03:30.250> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
development of it and and then when the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.759 
development of it and and then when the
process<00:03:30.730> began<00:03:31.090> we<00:03:31.570> provided<00:03:32.230> direct

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
things you look for when you know in

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.950 
things you look for when you know in
moving<00:04:32.670> nests<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.150> this<00:04:33.360> one<00:04:33.660> things<00:04:33.870> were

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
moving nests like this one things were

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.170 
moving nests like this one things were
most<00:04:34.110> concerned<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.650> was<00:04:34.980> the<00:04:35.730> hatching

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
most concerned about was the hatching

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.080 
most concerned about was the hatching
success<00:04:36.690> rate<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.560> know<00:04:37.680> it<00:04:38.250> did<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.730> at<00:04:38.880> least

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
success rate you know it did it at least

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.560 
success rate you know it did it at least
close<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.900> mimic<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.980> natural<00:04:41.550> level<00:04:41.820> were<00:04:42.420> we

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
close to mimic the natural level were we

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.380 
close to mimic the natural level were we
able<00:04:42.720> to<00:04:42.900> produce<00:04:43.260> as<00:04:43.620> many<00:04:43.740> h<00:04:44.070> lanes<00:04:44.430> as<00:04:44.700> would

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
able to produce as many h lanes as would

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.970 
able to produce as many h lanes as would
have<00:04:45.570> been<00:04:45.600> produced<00:04:45.930> on<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.440> natural<00:04:46.800> beach

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
have been produced on the natural beach

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.890 
have been produced on the natural beach
and<00:04:47.280> and<00:04:47.910> and<00:04:48.240> i<00:04:48.390> know<00:04:48.420> they're<00:04:48.720> still

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
and and and i know they're still

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.110 
and and and i know they're still
analyzing<00:04:49.110> that<00:04:49.680> data<00:04:49.740> but<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:50.730> looks<00:04:51.030> like

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
analyzing that data but it looks like

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.750 
analyzing that data but it looks like
the<00:04:51.390> answer<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.780> yes<00:04:52.110> it<00:04:52.800> was<00:04:52.980> very<00:04:53.220> close<00:04:53.730> to

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
the answer is yes it was very close to

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.620 
the answer is yes it was very close to
the<00:04:54.360> natural<00:04:55.400> incubation<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.430> success<00:04:57.360> rate

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the natural incubation a success rate

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.870 
the natural incubation a success rate
and<00:04:57.840> emergent<00:04:58.800> success<00:04:59.190> rate<00:04:59.430> that<00:04:59.460> we<00:04:59.760> would

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
and emergent success rate that we would

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.820 
and emergent success rate that we would
have<00:04:59.970> seen<00:05:00.210> had<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:01.050> moved<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.470> nests<00:05:01.680> at

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
have seen had we not moved the nests at

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.240 
have seen had we not moved the nests at
all<00:05:01.950> so<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:03.030> ultimate<00:05:03.150> question<00:05:03.390> then<00:05:03.900> is

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
all so the ultimate question then is

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.860 
all so the ultimate question then is
releasing<00:05:05.250> these<00:05:05.730> you<00:05:06.030> know<00:05:06.150> thirteen

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
releasing these you know thirteen

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870 
releasing these you know thirteen
thousand<00:05:07.440> or<00:05:07.560> so<00:05:07.770> hatchlings<00:05:08.340> into<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
thousand or so hatchlings into the

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.910 
thousand or so hatchlings into the
atlantic<00:05:09.690> as<00:05:10.020> opposed<00:05:10.410> to<00:05:10.500> in<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.650> gulf<00:05:10.860> of

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 
atlantic as opposed to in the gulf of

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.310 
atlantic as opposed to in the gulf of
mexico<00:05:11.480> what<00:05:12.480> did<00:05:12.570> that<00:05:12.600> do<00:05:12.960> to<00:05:12.990> the

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
mexico what did that do to the

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.100 
mexico what did that do to the
population<00:05:13.860> was<00:05:14.100> it<00:05:14.220> harmful<00:05:14.820> are<00:05:15.720> they<00:05:15.930> gonna

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
population was it harmful are they gonna

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.710 
population was it harmful are they gonna
grow<00:05:16.770> up<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.370> return<00:05:17.850> and<00:05:18.090> nest<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.450> the<00:05:18.540> gulf

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
grow up and return and nest in the gulf

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.650 
grow up and return and nest in the gulf
of<00:05:18.810> mexico<00:05:18.870> or<00:05:19.640> return<00:05:20.640> to<00:05:20.790> the<00:05:20.820> east<00:05:20.970> coast<00:05:21.090> we

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
of mexico or return to the east coast we

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.080 
of mexico or return to the east coast we
don't<00:05:21.840> know<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.110> answer<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.530> that<00:05:22.820> all<00:05:23.820> we

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
don't know the answer to that all we

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.660 
don't know the answer to that all we
know<00:05:24.300> is<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:25.020> those<00:05:25.590> hatchlings<00:05:26.220> that<00:05:26.460> were

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
know is that those hatchlings that were

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.060 
know is that those hatchlings that were
saved<00:05:27.030> and<00:05:27.360> released<00:05:28.020> in<00:05:28.200> the<00:05:28.590> atlantic

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
saved and released in the atlantic

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.430 
saved and released in the atlantic
during<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.610> early<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.960> know<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.140> first<00:05:31.320> half

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
during the early you know the first half

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.240 
during the early you know the first half
of<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.980> nesting<00:05:32.310> season<00:05:32.390> those<00:05:33.390> hatchlings

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.250 
of the nesting season those hatchlings

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.490 
of the nesting season those hatchlings
by<00:05:35.250> all<00:05:35.460> accounts<00:05:35.640> would<00:05:36.360> have<00:05:36.600> met<00:05:37.320> their

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
by all accounts would have met their

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.050 
by all accounts would have met their
doom<00:05:37.740> if<00:05:38.070> they<00:05:38.190> had<00:05:38.310> been<00:05:38.430> allowed<00:05:38.610> to<00:05:38.669> swim

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
doom if they had been allowed to swim

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.450 
doom if they had been allowed to swim
into<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.270> Gulf<00:05:39.480> of<00:05:39.570> Mexico<00:05:39.740> so<00:05:40.740> it<00:05:41.190> was<00:05:41.370> the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
into the Gulf of Mexico so it was the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.340 
into the Gulf of Mexico so it was the
right<00:05:41.700> thing<00:05:41.970> to<00:05:42.000> do<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.630> move<00:05:42.780> them<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:43.260> at

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
right thing to do to move them to at

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.890 
right thing to do to move them to at
least<00:05:43.470> give<00:05:43.710> them<00:05:43.860> a<00:05:43.950> chance<00:05:44.250> at<00:05:44.550> survival

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
least give them a chance at survival

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.140 
least give them a chance at survival
I<00:05:45.930> personally<00:05:46.770> think<00:05:47.220> that<00:05:47.850> they<00:05:48.030> will

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
I personally think that they will

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.210 
I personally think that they will
probably<00:05:48.450> grow<00:05:48.930> up<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.440> return<00:05:49.770> to<00:05:49.919> the<00:05:50.040> Gulf

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
probably grow up and return to the Gulf

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.120 
probably grow up and return to the Gulf
of<00:05:50.310> Mexico<00:05:50.790> where<00:05:51.510> they<00:05:51.690> were<00:05:52.130> deposited

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
of Mexico where they were deposited

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.510 
of Mexico where they were deposited
where<00:05:53.520> your<00:05:53.760> their<00:05:53.910> natal<00:05:54.300> beach
