00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello dear viewers with you 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 joker game today I will tell you how 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.710
 make a super mega explosion somehow so him 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.560
 call minecraft 1 7 2 without any there 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 either mods you see minecraft 1 7 2 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:22.619
 proof Well create the world you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:27.349
 for example there from the creative rise 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:34.610
 flat means delete earth patterns 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:36.079
 here for example so let's get ready well and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:47.460
 create a new world 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:51.500
 same while generated you generated 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.149
 he can see flat without any 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.210
 take it so now we type what we 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.180
 need we take transport 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.739
 we take energy rails we take ordinary rails 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.180
 and activating rails then later to us 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 still need a lot of take out 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.850
 trolleys with dynamite but as you see it 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.750
 you canâ€™t show you Stach later 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 now take the redstone comparator 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 any kind of block out there like everything else 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.869
 Distributor should be that's all so start 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.979
 then we build first 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.979
 I 'll show you the menu now 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:47.189
 so here are four four blocks 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:51.119
 5 for tasks with regards to the sensor spend here 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:55.100
 see but here's another like the lever 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.020
 what I forgot we turn on see does not change 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.649
 ok the comparator should have turned on 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:09.390
 sure now now now now 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:15.269
 what exactly do we need here for the old 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.750
 the blocks around it now choose energy 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:17.760
 rails 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.200
 energy here even may this god 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:29.250
 we direct push apparently so it is possible and so 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:32.959
 here we see then here we put 2 rails here 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:40.100
 and somewhere here at that distance 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:45.049
 activating I activate now 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.049
 prescribe gigo 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.739
 407 like Stah forgot them here 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.890
 here's a trolley with dynamite 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:08.760
 it was given to us 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.220
 once again only twenty pieces somewhere 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.770
 here everything is now here we push the great-grandson 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:21.940
 muscles we load we turn on the mechanism here 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:29.680
 Apparently he is typed and it is necessary 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:35.040
 activate exactly what we spend so 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:40.090
 We look while there is still a little here 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:44.650
 also now remove the block and set sharply 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:50.620
 energy rails see a lot of it 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:56.840
 activated believes we 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:59.319
 we see that a very big explosion and you 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.319
 flew out 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:13.900
 we see that in general it is very big 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:19.740
 the blast and I even had things minekruvt 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:22.660
 although here are my requirements 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:24.910
 yes it is a very big bang well you can 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.590
 take there just one hundred try 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.610
 I do not promise well here and can try 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:37.830
 everyone can not jury can less 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.830
 All with you was gay until new meetings 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.830
 until
