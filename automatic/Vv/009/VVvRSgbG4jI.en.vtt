solution on your fingertips and you need

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
solution on your fingertips and you need
to<00:01:20.909> peel<00:01:21.090> those<00:01:21.270> pieces<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.409> very

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
to peel those pieces off very

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.660 
to peel those pieces off very
straightforward<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> only<00:01:26.310> other<00:01:26.369> two

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
straightforward the only other two

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
straightforward the only other two
pieces<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> pack<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.590> squeegee

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
pieces of the pack are the squeegee

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.969 
pieces of the pack are the squeegee
which<00:01:29.790> is<00:01:30.000> very<00:01:30.119> solid<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.900> helps<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.350> with

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
which is very solid and helps out with

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.190 
which is very solid and helps out with
the<00:01:32.159> install<00:01:32.549> process<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.390> major<00:01:33.600> way<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
the install process in a major way and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.160 
the install process in a major way and
the<00:01:35.100> liquid<00:01:35.280> solution<00:01:36.060> which<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.990> see

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the liquid solution which as you can see

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.539 
the liquid solution which as you can see
here<00:01:37.530> is<00:01:37.740> filled<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> top<00:01:38.880> so<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.310> can't<00:01:41.310> see

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
here is filled to the top so I can't see

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.980 
here is filled to the top so I can't see
any<00:01:41.790> way<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.299> would<00:01:42.479> need<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.869> you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
any way that you would need that you

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.249 
any way that you would need that you
would<00:01:43.140> use<00:01:43.380> all<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> solution<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.259> that's

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
would use all the solution and that's

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.380 
would use all the solution and that's
that's<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.590> very<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:47.070> thing<00:01:47.399> because<00:01:47.640> I've

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's a very good thing because I've

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
that's a very good thing because I've
used<00:01:48.659> several<00:01:48.930> shells<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.590> past<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.159> they

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
used several shells in the past and they

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.670 
used several shells in the past and they
never<00:01:50.850> included<00:01:51.450> enough<00:01:51.689> solution<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.530> get

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
never included enough solution to get

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.359 
never included enough solution to get
the<00:01:52.829> install<00:01:53.130> done<00:01:54.229> so<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:55.560> this<00:01:55.890> company<00:01:56.280> was

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
the install done so as this company was

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
the install done so as this company was
nice<00:01:56.610> enough<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> send<00:01:57.119> me<00:01:57.210> L<00:01:57.450> several<00:01:58.170> of

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
nice enough to send me L several of

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200 
nice enough to send me L several of
their<00:01:58.380> products<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> already<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.909> another

I'm<00:02:45.480> interested<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:46.159> the<00:02:47.159> first<00:02:47.489> would<00:02:47.730> be<00:02:47.760> the

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
I'm interested in the first would be the

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.050 
I'm interested in the first would be the
appearance<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.769> second<00:02:50.280> would<00:02:50.400> be<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.730> feel

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
appearance the second would be the feel

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.210 
appearance the second would be the feel
and<00:02:51.329> the<00:02:51.419> third<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.590> final<00:02:52.769> will<00:02:53.010> be<00:02:53.069> the

and the third and final will be the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.059 
and the third and final will be the
scratch<00:02:53.519> protection<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:55.019> let's<00:02:55.859> talk<00:02:56.010> about

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
scratch protection so let's talk about

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.879 
scratch protection so let's talk about
appearance<00:02:56.730> first<00:02:57.120> which<00:02:57.450> I've<00:02:57.599> already<00:02:57.889> semi

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
appearance first which I've already semi

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.159 
appearance first which I've already semi
covered<00:02:59.689> it's<00:03:00.689> very<00:03:00.870> clear<00:03:01.909> it's<00:03:02.909> actually

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:03.169 
covered it's very clear it's actually

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:07.309 
covered it's very clear it's actually
without<00:03:04.169> exaggerating<00:03:05.180> this<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.599> the

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
without exaggerating this is the the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.679 
without exaggerating this is the the
only<00:03:07.560> shield<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.489> I've<00:03:08.639> ever<00:03:08.669> used<00:03:09.209> that

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
only shield that I've ever used that

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.349 
only shield that I've ever used that
basically<00:03:10.560> gives<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:11.069> same<00:03:11.459> appearance<00:03:11.970> as

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
basically gives that same appearance as

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.289 
basically gives that same appearance as
a<00:03:12.530> device<00:03:13.530> with<00:03:13.739> no<00:03:13.919> shield<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:14.489> we're<00:03:15.030> just

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
a device with no shield on it we're just

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.530

looking at the glass you don't have that

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.009 
looking at the glass you don't have that
orange<00:03:18.989> peel<00:03:19.229> look<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.889> it's<00:03:20.129> very<00:03:20.310> smooth

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.220 
this is just I'm going to do another
part<00:06:15.890> to<00:06:16.010> this<00:06:16.040> review<00:06:16.280> next<00:06:16.670> week<00:06:17.140> where<00:06:18.140> I'll

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:18.230 
part to this review next week where I'll

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.900 
part to this review next week where I'll
get<00:06:18.380> more<00:06:18.590> into<00:06:18.650> detail<00:06:18.950> on<00:06:19.220> how<00:06:19.430> it's<00:06:19.610> held<00:06:19.790> up

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
get more into detail on how it's held up

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.080 
get more into detail on how it's held up
over<00:06:20.090> a<00:06:20.270> week<00:06:20.570> you<00:06:20.870> know<00:06:20.900> a<00:06:21.320> lot<00:06:22.070> of<00:06:22.100> times<00:06:22.400> it

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
over a week you know a lot of times it

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.790 
over a week you know a lot of times it
looks<00:06:23.330> perfect<00:06:23.540> the<00:06:23.840> first<00:06:23.870> day<00:06:24.320> but<00:06:24.380> they're

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
looks perfect the first day but they're

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.920 
looks perfect the first day but they're
not<00:06:24.980> to<00:06:25.190> use<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.580> for<00:06:25.610> a<00:06:25.790> few<00:06:26.000> days<00:06:26.210> the<00:06:26.510> edges

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
not to use it for a few days the edges

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.690 
not to use it for a few days the edges
start<00:06:27.140> to<00:06:27.260> peel<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:28.100> everything<00:06:28.490> like<00:06:28.640> that

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
start to peel and everything like that

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.120 
start to peel and everything like that
so<00:06:28.940> that's<00:06:29.420> why<00:06:29.660> I'm<00:06:30.440> going<00:06:30.620> to<00:06:30.680> do<00:06:30.800> an<00:06:30.890> update

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
so that's why I'm going to do an update

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.310 
so that's why I'm going to do an update
on<00:06:31.190> this<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.760> see<00:06:31.940> how<00:06:31.970> it<00:06:32.180> holds<00:06:32.360> up<00:06:32.690> but

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
on this and see how it holds up but

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.230 
on this and see how it holds up but
right<00:06:33.470> now<00:06:33.530> again<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.490> website<00:06:34.850> is<00:06:34.970> clear

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240 
right now again the website is clear

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.830 
right now again the website is clear

getting back into the field how I
mentioned<00:06:48.830> the<00:06:49.460> device<00:06:49.760> is<00:06:49.940> very<00:06:50.000> smooth<00:06:50.600> I

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
mentioned the device is very smooth I

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.830 
mentioned the device is very smooth I
want<00:06:52.130> to<00:06:52.190> not<00:06:52.820> the<00:06:52.910> device<00:06:53.180> that<00:06:53.479> the<00:06:53.600> shield

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 
want to not the device that the shield

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.570 
want to not the device that the shield
is<00:06:53.990> very<00:06:54.199> smooth<00:06:54.530> I<00:06:54.830> want<00:06:55.160> to<00:06:55.220> say<00:06:55.340> that<00:06:55.460> that

is very smooth I want to say that that

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.330 
is very smooth I want to say that that
did<00:06:56.139> assist<00:06:57.139> in<00:06:57.350> making<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.770> installation

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
did assist in making the installation

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.030 
did assist in making the installation
process<00:06:58.370> go<00:06:58.910> very<00:06:59.120> smooth<00:06:59.419> as<00:06:59.600> well<00:06:59.810> because<00:07:00.740> a

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:01.040 
process go very smooth as well because a

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.700 
process go very smooth as well because a
lot<00:07:01.610> of<00:07:01.639> times<00:07:02.000> and<00:07:02.479> I<00:07:02.810> just<00:07:03.050> use<00:07:03.169> AG<00:07:03.440> for

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
lot of times and I just use AG for

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.590 
lot of times and I just use AG for
example<00:07:04.190> I<00:07:04.449> had<00:07:05.449> their<00:07:06.080> shield<00:07:07.240> prior<00:07:08.240> and

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
example I had their shield prior and

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.390 
example I had their shield prior and
that<00:07:09.169> is<00:07:09.290> in<00:07:09.410> one<00:07:09.560> of<00:07:09.590> my<00:07:09.710> videos<00:07:09.740> and

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
that is in one of my videos and

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.180 
that is in one of my videos and
basically<00:07:11.360> what<00:07:12.169> happened<00:07:12.530> is<00:07:12.590> once<00:07:12.889> you<00:07:13.040> get

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.190 
basically what happened is once you get

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.830 
basically what happened is once you get
the<00:07:13.340> solution<00:07:13.820> applied<00:07:14.120> to<00:07:14.419> the<00:07:14.510> back<00:07:14.660> of<00:07:14.690> the

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 
the solution applied to the back of the

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.629 
the solution applied to the back of the
show<00:07:15.080> then<00:07:15.350> you<00:07:15.440> line<00:07:15.650> it<00:07:15.680> on<00:07:15.889> your<00:07:16.010> device<00:07:16.310> if

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 
show then you line it on your device if

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.460 
show then you line it on your device if
you<00:07:16.910> want<00:07:17.120> to<00:07:17.240> move<00:07:17.389> it<00:07:17.570> around<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:17.990> place<00:07:18.200> it

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
you want to move it around and place it

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.590 
you want to move it around and place it
replace<00:07:19.130> it<00:07:19.370> you<00:07:19.970> have<00:07:20.060> to<00:07:20.150> pretty<00:07:20.330> much<00:07:20.540> take

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:20.600 
replace it you have to pretty much take

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.530 
replace it you have to pretty much take
the<00:07:21.020> shield<00:07:21.260> off<00:07:21.530> again<00:07:22.130> and<00:07:22.430> then<00:07:22.880> reposition

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:23.540 
the shield off again and then reposition

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:26.890 
the shield off again and then reposition
it<00:07:23.690> with<00:07:24.620> this<00:07:24.830> shield<00:07:25.400> here<00:07:25.880> once<00:07:26.570> I<00:07:26.630> got<00:07:26.750> the

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:26.900 
it with this shield here once I got the

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.659 
it with this shield here once I got the
solution<00:07:27.050> and<00:07:27.470> applied<00:07:27.710> it<00:07:27.740> to<00:07:27.860> my<00:07:28.039> device<00:07:28.400> I

00:07:28.659 --> 00:07:28.669 
solution and applied it to my device I

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:32.740 
solution and applied it to my device I
was<00:07:29.360> able<00:07:29.570> to<00:07:30.580> slide<00:07:31.580> it<00:07:31.760> around<00:07:31.850> to<00:07:32.450> get<00:07:32.630> it

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:32.750 
was able to slide it around to get it

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.810 
was able to slide it around to get it
positioned<00:07:32.870> perfectly<00:07:33.530> and<00:07:34.130> then<00:07:34.580> use<00:07:34.789> that

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:34.820 
positioned perfectly and then use that

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.029 
positioned perfectly and then use that
same<00:07:35.240> squeegee<00:07:35.870> get<00:07:36.320> on<00:07:36.440> all<00:07:36.590> those<00:07:36.800> bubbles

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 
same squeegee get on all those bubbles

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:40.240 
same squeegee get on all those bubbles
so<00:07:38.139> you<00:07:39.139> know<00:07:39.229> this<00:07:39.320> is<00:07:39.380> this<00:07:39.560> is<00:07:39.710> very<00:07:39.919> high

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 
so you know this is this is very high

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.690 
so you know this is this is very high
quality<00:07:41.229> material<00:07:42.229> here<00:07:42.500> gives<00:07:43.190> that<00:07:43.370> best

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:43.700 
quality material here gives that best

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.400 
quality material here gives that best
impression<00:07:44.389> to<00:07:45.380> a<00:07:45.800> device<00:07:46.789> with<00:07:47.030> nola<00:07:47.539> shield

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:48.410 
impression to a device with nola shield

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.650 
impression to a device with nola shield
