00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.540
 had a lot of success so that's fine 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.090

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.790
 videos so today you're going you 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.480
 know more about the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.340
 block commands 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.720
 in any case I hope we wish you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.050
 a good view thanks to this command 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.550
 you can live a stick 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.149
 to destroy all life on the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.649
 planet minecraft yen with this 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.160
 command you can you live your 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.899
 head 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.940
 you just have to have minecraft 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.179
 premium and mark your nickname just 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.179
 right here 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.610
 thanks to this command you can 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.610
 mark any word 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.360
 however before ch cei we can see 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.159
 that there is an @ between two brackets that 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.979
 means it's the block commander 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.619
 who sends this message and he has a 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.119
 command in the how of blocks that 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.820
 can do that we do not see this 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.430
 order so it's sla châtellerault 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.659
 so here we can do this cowardly she 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.250
 re @ to hi and so we do not see anymore 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.240
 @ more than the slash such role it is 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.909
 that we can put the texts in 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
 color with clickable links so 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.360
 for example here it's benoit my channel 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.160
 youtube and the link that the top is my 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.170
 youtube channel so for example if we 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.410
 do that and click on it 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.270
 Well, we 'll see that minecraft valves 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.920
 or redirected on the internet click 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.399
 on yes it will put the page of my 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.399
 Youtube channel 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.119
 often people use plugins 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.220
 to make spawners appear but 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.170
 there is a command not very known who 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.700
 lets do exactly the same thing 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.860
 so a little long I would put a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 description and it allows to do 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.399
 to appear any type of stoner it takes 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.929
 just changed the mode name thanks to 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.369
 block commands one can make appear 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.369
 a crystal under 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.430
 and even stronger we can do this 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.269
 pony 1 are bi giant by typing this 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.709
 command in the command look on 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.480
 gigantic thanks to this command 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.540
 often people make sla choose 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.520
 clear in the hand but it's a lot 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:40.350
 easier to blister and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:41.970
 let the customers whizzer turn through 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.310
 at this command you will have no more 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 problems with the creepers because their 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.240
 explosion will not do either of them on 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.360
 blocks because there will be files 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.980
 so this is to activate it and if you 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.910
 put hole it means that the creeper 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.910
 will be able to break blocks 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.240

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.430
 command is going to benefit you so 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.230
 it's the command that allows you to hide 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.930
 the other orders so you have 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.080
 just to put falls activate it and that's it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.030

 can make gigantic pixel-art 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.530
 by linking lots of blog posts like 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.240

 but thanks to this command the fire does not 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.030
 will spread more of which you just have to 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:42.630

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.800
 so you put falls you activate it and 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.800
