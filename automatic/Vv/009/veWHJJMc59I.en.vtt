00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200

the top left hand corner and pretty sure

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.620 
the top left hand corner and pretty sure
on<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.480> LG<00:00:18.900> g3<00:00:19.880> it<00:00:20.880> tells<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.270> when<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.510> have
