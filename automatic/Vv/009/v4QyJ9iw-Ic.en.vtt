00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.160
Something like that!

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.800
Okay Meriyem...

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
You must go... ehm...

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.800

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.440
Meriyem? I would be great if you could drive up around the corner really fast

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.980
No, we agreed on not driving this thing, so we're not going to do that...

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.160
Nope.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.160
And this black and white.... Well that has been done huh?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.600
Oh, but this is a black and white series so...

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.860
Yeah, but I put this fuchsia scarf on for this shoot because it really looks good on my face

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.180
So I want to shoot in colour. Yes?

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.520
And another thing... Did you typecast me as the bitch?

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.320
Oh uhm... They already are here.... watching.... the viewers...

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.700
the film is running...

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.540
Is it cold dear?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.040
Yes.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.540
Yes?

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.600
Otherwise you just come inside. Nice...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.260
Come and sit down. Nice and comfy

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.760
Okay...

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.100
Yes

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.840
Come

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.740
yeah...

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.940
Good!

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560
Can you drive... a little?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.400
Yeah...

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.840
Perhaps it nice that you drive then?

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:42.574
Yeah

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.480
Yes?

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.360
Yeah!

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.160
So then...

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.200

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.960
Then we exchange seats

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.780
Yeah cool!

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.880
Awesome!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.760
Something like that!

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.720
and then you are out of that black and white clutter

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.640
that's dumb anyway

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.920
Am I going to drive?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.020
Why?

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.920
I don't see the point to that

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.280
more views?

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.400
a speeding Porsche is still...

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.300
yeah you think that thing runs on water?

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.240
who is going to pay for that?

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.260
YouTube?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.360
All right, now after to the first 100,000 views we're go for a drive

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.040
and then I let you film it too
