00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.890
 hi friends today with another 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.990
 bicycle accessories 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 if so you can say here should be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:28.969
 pump pump with pressure sensor viz . 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.460
 manometer that's such a bag 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:36.829
 As usual, the price and a reference to the seller 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.829
 will be under the video in the description 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:51.980
 the seller as I understand appreciated 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:57.329
 7 dollars and weight 170 grams before written 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:08.869
 air pump to the piece let's open 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:08.869
 and see here is such a pump 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:36.649
 where fasteners ie fixing 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:40.460
 prove and see how these bolts 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.460
 attach the pump to the frame 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.759
 hotels velcro velcro shoulder interesting 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 indicated that made in taiwan model 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.380
 here we are 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.140
 see look for some more 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:15.220
 telescopic models of the device itself 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.220
 valve shown 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.140
 I understood why I need this here and the beam 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.720
 look first screwed here 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.190
 this is the sepepa wing mount using here 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.880
 these here 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.690
 reaching a set of bolts then here 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:44.750
 there is such a ledge on the handle mount 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.780
 the pump has a hole 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.160
 should get here in this ledge well 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:56.360
 this way the pump is held in order not to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:03:05.420
 dangled then the plant itself part then when 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:07.430
 the help of this sticky we fix there 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.060
 pump mounting so that the pump during 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.329
 ride is not lost 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.459
 This is how everything is fixed 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:20.989
 the pump will not get lost very well 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:24.639
 thought up let's take a look here 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.560
 the hole is closing like this 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:30.019
 rubber plug 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.030
 also show how this pump 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.579
 pumped up the wheel well it will be at the end 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.480
 Now let's take a closer look. 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.480
 the pump itself 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:57.980
 metallic metal again 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:04:01.760
 piston inside and plastic principle 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.540
 this plastic part go installed 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.540
 cue rubber ring 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.220
 we have a pressure gauge here 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.530
 Probably at this all we now turn to 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.600
 pumping the word wheel don't forget that on 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.300
 each tire manufacturer indicates 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.979
 maximum and minimum pressure in 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.690
 In this case, only maximum 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:39.949
 pressure pressure is usually indicated in 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.660
 two units pis and in bars and since 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:43.720
 do we need to determine the pressure 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.130
 in general for different types of bicycles 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.360
 pressure can be pretty strong 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.020
 differ it depends on conditions 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.960
 exploiting the bike laugh the season and 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.949
 also from the weight of the cyclist let's 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.990
 take only and less 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:04.370
 common example weight 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:08.240
 cyclist 75 80 kilogram in this 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:16.160
 case but the pressure is 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:18.880
 approximately 40 thousand a and either 2728 bars and so 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:24.500
 let's try to pump up the wheel 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:26.919
 up to about 47 wheel you lowered 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.919
 you see 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.600
 he 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.460
 101 kachalina 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.889
 then you need pressure on the touch tire 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.230
 almost not lost 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.430
 so on this our review review is complete if 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.260
