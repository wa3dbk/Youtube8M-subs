00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.469
 and 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.580
 profitability and performance of your 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.900
 contextual advertising 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.599
 that's about it we'll talk 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.270
 Today, other indicators do not have 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.369
 such a key value is payback 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.619
 and productive for you accordingly 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.239
 let's see things like that 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.550
 specific changes in advertising 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.460
 companies can increase its effectiveness 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.140
 it's about marketing and Maria Kravchuk themselves in 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.390
 first of all pay attention to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.489
 the quality of your advertisements after all 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.440
 they create the most important 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:48.070
 indicators as your clickability 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.540
 ads 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.149
 as well as the effectiveness of advertising 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.340
 campaign user sees cysts which 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.590
 placed in the ad itself and this 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.180
 the main thing that attracts his attention 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.010
 accordingly to increase 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.289
 advertising campaigns performance 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.210
 key case of qualitative change 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.020
 texts you can improve efficiency 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.890
 even more than if you increase the budget 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.200
 accordingly let's work on 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.060
 text ad in more detail to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.220
 let's optimize ad text 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.050
 let's start with the most important thing first 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.780
 post as much information as possible 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.030
 about promotions or unique conditions 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.649
 who are you offering to sell your 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.200
 product or your services 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.390
 the second is attract maximum 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 the amount of attention is repeating itself 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.440
 key request the selected text will be 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.630
 look more advantageous in the background 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.490
 ordinary font second course 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.340
 add a call to action such as 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.750
 click and order go to us in 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.550
 In this case, these words will be 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.229
 encourage the user to 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.209
 go to your ad and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.099
 clickable ads will increase 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.289
 Please consider your ads 

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.179
 must match the text which 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.310
 user it goes on the page itself 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.319
 otherwise you will attract no target 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 visitor performance and advertising 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.119
 campaigns will be reduced accordingly 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.009
 your key . measurement is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.200
 Roe Investment Returns 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.849
 or profitability of an advertising campaign 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.560
 so how can you boost it 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.780
 clickability number of transitions to 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.940
 your site but in any case it will not give 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.099
 effect if the visitor is not 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.440
 the one that you need and ate will not come 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.540
 before conversion accordingly 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.340
 your landing page and quality 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.080
 advertisements in the aggregate 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.280
 will lead to a company performance 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.530
 the second stage of the optimization of advertising comp 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.170
 is not the core optimization key 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.910
 Your task is to analyze what 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.860
 specifically keywords leads 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.750
 conversions as often 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.760
 reaction of words can be effective 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.680
 in terms of clicks but absolutely not 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.110
 conversion efficiency point of view for 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.640
 this you have two main tools 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.340
 let's talk about them in more detail 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.200
 first is conversion tracking she 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.090
 will allow you to determine which specifically 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.830
 keywords lead conversion 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.410
 respectively keywords for which 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.420
 no conversion it makes sense to turn off 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.459
 as they form for you clicks and 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.070
 advertising budget spending but not 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.720
 brings profit 2 then google analytics with 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.700
 using it you can more deeply 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.350
 analyze the return on investment and 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.200
 also the cost of each attracted 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.300
 client this tool is more 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.040
 complex but more efficient 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.569
 statistics analysis is the main way 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.120
 improve contextual efficiency 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.800
 advertising keywords for which are not from 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.200
 conversions you just delete and not 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.420
 use in case of high percentage 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.459
 Keyword conversion is 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.680
 effective raise rates and place 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.480
 your ads as high as possible 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.700
 In this case, you will get more clicks 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.709
 keeping the percentage of conversion in the results 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.959
 return on investment from your advertising 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.030
 campaigns will also increase let's get more 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.459
 talk in detail about the landing page 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.260
 if the user enters a key request 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.030
 wide character then you can 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.829
 Landing page to determine 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.040
 product category or group 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.630
 certain services that you sell 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.090
 If the request is detailed and concerns 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.070
 specific model of a particular service or 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.200
 of what you can highlight on your 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.180
 site in more detail on a specific 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.640
 page then determine the landing 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.380
 page as close as possible and place 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.940
 necessarily answer her question 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.220
 which the user specified 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.019
 accordingly as few clicks as possible 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.090
 he must do before he finds 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.930
 answer in case the answer is right on 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.910
 this page 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.070
 it will be the best option if the conversion 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.660
 for a keyword low something is 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.450
 effective lower advertising 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.160
 the ad is reduced but the click in this 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.410
 case you can free part 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.860
 budget for more conversion key 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.380
 the words 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.450
 as well as getting a cheap clip and cheap 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.430
 visitor by placing your 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.200
 ads in the guarantee is 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.300
 budget allocation will allow you 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.689
 increase efficiency by optimizing 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.489
 advertising budget and its expenses 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.229
 to get more conversion by 

00:04:39.489 --> 00:04:42.939
 it is not the goal that will decrease 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.439
 use a tool like 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.569
 conversion optimization 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.549
 let's talk more about him 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:50.079
 use to use 

00:04:48.549 --> 00:04:51.939
 possibility of automatic optimization 

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:54.399
 you need to have 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:56.679
 Already recruited stats first 

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:58.949

 top menu go to the tab 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:05.860

 google we see an increase in traffic 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:22.419
 cost balance and volume 

00:05:19.269 --> 00:05:24.099

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.499
 advertising ways to set up targeting

 or reduce the budget with a minimum 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:03.069
 loss of clicks 

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:05.050
 increasing options for increasing budget and 

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:07.119
 predicted clicks 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.469
 or increase traffic using

 optimal cost per click 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:13.029
 proposed by the google system, please note that 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.939
 in your advertising campaign may be

 not all options are active you can already 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.050
 use the optimal budget or 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.269
 maximum word coverage however for 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.979
 first months of the campaign in 

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:26.349
 google is recommended at least once 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:29.309
 week to monitor proposed 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:29.309
 system options 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.210
 don't be afraid to experiment with 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.460
 betting but always keep track 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.410
 the effectiveness of changes make them 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.780
 smoothly and gradually to 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:46.640
 track changes in dynamics if 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.890
 advertising budget you are not limited but 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:51.410
 nevertheless the ad campaign itself 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.930
 ineffective then consider that the increase 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.430
 budget will not increase 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.470
 performance is a direct call for 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.840
 what needs to be optimized already 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.300
 existing advertisements if in 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.220
 advertising budget you are limited to this 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.590
 case will effectively disable not 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.530
 conversion words and forward this 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:10.400
 budget for more conversion 

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.150
 the redistribution of the budget is the most 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.190
 effective way 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:15.230
 optimization of similar advertising campaigns 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.300
 for several years contextual advertising 

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:19.360
 shows tremendous growth and 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.530
 the next two years it will continue 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.870
 accordingly fight advertising 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:26.180
 budgets among themselves competitor will be 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.580
 very difficult in this case more 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.620
 quality will be an important factor and rather 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.780
 of all the main struggle will lie in 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.850
 hands of specialists who work on 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.380
 these advertising budgets are advertising 

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.960
 campaigns have not been measured for a long time 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.200
 transitions clicks price pasting or 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.820
 What is the most important price for this price ? 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.220
 of course return on investment for 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.560
 advertiser exactly these figures 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.680
 important and they need 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.990
 concentrate 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:55.030
 Thank you for your attention. Good luck and work.
