00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.620
 could I promise you that it is not 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.090
 It seems that Chile has invited 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 baked magnesia the immortal party 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.059
 It is worth it if it is what it seems or the lagoon was 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 I can explain what you leave 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.540
 I have come expressly as our 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.250
 giants to be able to surprise you 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.129
 at the party and a lot I find you 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 living with another monster half better 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.000
 I'm going 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.610

 nor immortal who lives and is now but 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.170
 there were a thousand plagues 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.660
 the lagoon I have only invited lorna to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.340
 the party as a friend your boyfriend has 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.640
 left with her and needed someone 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.790
 to lift the spirit you know 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.190
 it is very considerate I am sorry to have ridden 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.380
 that scandal is just that I had 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.780
 imagined in my head what this would be like 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.119
 night surprising you running towards 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 your arms we saw the worst immortal 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.170
 blooming finally 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.340
 I prefer to be here with you 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.290

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.700
 tosomeone 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.390

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.000
 welcome to monster high you are the 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.510
 guest of honor that you sell amanita 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.240

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.130

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.630

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:51.240
 tombs literally centuries ago is a 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.790
 long story poor kernel I see you're still 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:58.100

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:04.240
 party because my train is a hymn and hate 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.130
