is this you know everything's going as
it<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:21.290> so<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:23.390> got<00:01:24.390> other<00:01:24.540> problems<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:26.060> got

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it is so I got other problems like I got

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.929 
it is so I got other problems like I got
myself<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.450> Jeep<00:01:27.630> Cherokee<00:01:28.520> at<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.850> about

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
myself a Jeep Cherokee at it for about

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.410 
myself a Jeep Cherokee at it for about
two<00:01:30.210> years<00:01:30.540> uh<00:01:31.880> something<00:01:32.880> wrong<00:01:33.030> with<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> uh

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
two years uh something wrong with it uh

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.370 
two years uh something wrong with it uh
I<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.840> safety<00:01:36.840> neutral<00:01:37.170> switch

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I think it's the safety neutral switch

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.100 
I think it's the safety neutral switch
but<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.520> inside<00:01:38.759> transmission<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.479> I'm

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
but that's inside transmission so I'm

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.109 
but that's inside transmission so I'm
not<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> fold<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.979> um<00:01:41.250> i'm<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:41.939> gonna

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
not going to fold that um i'm just gonna

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.109 
not going to fold that um i'm just gonna
bypass<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> know<00:01:44.280> because<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:44.939> feel

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
bypass it you know because I don't feel

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.780 
bypass it you know because I don't feel
like<00:01:45.299> spending<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.780> 300<00:01:46.170> bucks<00:01:46.790> or
