00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.950
 welcome well latinamerica hands tv 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.440
 my name is daniela bruno and in this 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.600
 moment we are going through hard times 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.610
 winter times and more times 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.640
 difficult even for all those who 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.650
 we are bicycle lovers that's why 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.750
 that we made some time and we went to 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.340
 her offices and hands justly 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.540
 to tell us all the news 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.879
 and the advances in 2014 products that 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.260
 they were already presented in this way 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.260
 begins today's program 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.150
 this time the offices of 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.940
 shimano Mr. Robert is going to 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.130
 comment on new applications for the 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.080
 of iu 2 these applications that until the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.040
 moment at least I did not know and I 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.840
 can download directly and good and 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.510
 apply them counted a little roberto 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 how is the system this the application of 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.740
 de vido works to work with 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.250
 all the components that equip this 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.300
 technology as you can see is a 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.290
 simple application and which can be 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.020
 used either for bicycles 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.370
 mountain bike routes or comfort already in this 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.470
 opportunity let's see what it is to 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.720
 fine of 11 speeds with the application 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.030
 from day 2 us the first thing we can 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.610
 do is check the connections that 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.880
 all connections are in shape and 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.430
 as we can see here shows what is 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 a battery of gone internal is not the case 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.230
 which equips this bike now what 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.680
 What I do is tell the computer 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:15.909
 what units I have connected 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 and this one will recognize them in the case of 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:19.780
 that there is no good connection or there is 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.329
 some problem at the beginning and what 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.340
 detects and informs me aja fantastic 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:27.819
 with also what things you can go 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.599
 regulating through this program the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:35.859
 program helps us to customize the 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.260
 product to detect any failure or 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:40.090
 problem that is giving us as a sample 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.120
 the image if there is the option to 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.540
 customize in this function we 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.150
 we can exchange the use of the chip ter 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.560
 and this is the part that we say that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.349
 we have clear changes 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.359
 we can use one to upload the other 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.219
 to lower changes or vice versa since a 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.250
 one is more comfortable to the taste of 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:59.250
 user 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.209
 asks us at this time if the 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.769
 indicator is on if we the 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.439
 others besides, yes because here we see the 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.760
 indicator this indicator asks if in 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:14.040
 this moment is off 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 this indicator when read is in 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.620
 operation that is marking us the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.019
 speed of the change in which it is in 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:26.099
 this moment as you see these 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.319
 checking 11 each change each march 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.080
 that is done with negation correctly 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.280
 within the mass here and we 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.280
 it takes art 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.189
 eleven 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.260
 and we find that all the 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:47.689
 connected components do not have any 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.590
 problem therefore the bicycle in 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:53.659
 program topics is 100% we count 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.870
 especially for people who still do not 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.359
 knows or has doubts about 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.040
 incorporate it not the virtues of iu 2 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.939
 or I had the chance to try it and it's 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.769
 a wonder is something else and above all 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:09.469
 the people who are doing the 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.540
 bicycle a competing sport is 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.400
 totally different what we had 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.900
 seen in previous versions was that of 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.780
 injured who works for bicycles 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.489
 route 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.080
 the application or the concept is carried in 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.540
 this case what are the bicycles of 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.970
 walk looking for simplicity like 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.190
 can see a clean handlebar a shifter 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.440
 simple on the handlebar 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.930
 and the tact that can be done on each 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.100
 One of the changes that have been 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.610
 as we can see besides that also 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:46.600
 the bicycle is designed in a concept 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:48.370
 technology integral play 2 what happens 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.960
 with the operation is totally 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.340
 normal or you have to have a kind of 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.509
 careful not to put the bicycle 1 a 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.070
 of the biggest apprehensions that 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:58.960
 had the users regarding the 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.660
 life will be the theme of water the subject of 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.690
 Battery life also slowly 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:06.039
 over time and this has been happening 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.810
 to know more there are more users 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.440
 using therefore they have been able 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.660
 realize that the water issue does not give 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.759
 problems to the system in terms of that 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.979
 being all the connections that in 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:20.229
 made this is made waterproof 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:23.250
 sealed the system the same thing 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.250
 happens with the battery 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.800
 the battery is sealed and the same 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.560
 way to us 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.389
 have to perform some kind of toilet 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.400
 on the bicycle once again 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.560
 we recommend reviewing 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.970
 connections and that the battery is also 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.620
 on its sixth site and connected 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.050
 correctly and duration has the 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:50.470
 20 battery and 2 catalog battery 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.870
 this is 1000 kilometers long 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.879
 it means that the user has 1000 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.310
 kilometers of autonomy to return to 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.099
 recharge the battery and which is 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.930
 quite and even more so when in a 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.210
 ride bicycle what we usually 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.610
 use is transportation within the 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.430
 city et cetera as is the ignition of 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.409
 of iu 2 once one starts to roll 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.520
 it automatically turns on because you 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:13.690
 he was telling me that the meter of the 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.479
 battery has to do with mileage 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:18.460
 I value all this opera and it's for 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:21.729
 distension valid as two weeks ago 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.409
 we do not use any gear the 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:25.659
 finger is not working technically 

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:28.270
 be every time we do click 

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:31.180
 about the d2 joke he is already working 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:33.849
 much has and even more or in this case of 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.500
 internal changes of the mass we have 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:38.110
 possibility of passing changes in 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:40.660
 movement or even being 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.850
 static good good to the people that what 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:44.860
 I tried already all those who have it 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:47.140
 we remind you that this program does not 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:50.440
 have updated can download 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.170
 Internet quietly 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.930
 youtube project you can download the 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:57.670
 program and in this way be able to perform 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.990
 the complete application good roberto 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.700
 thank you very much for all this 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.170
 explanation you have given us all 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.090
 those people who want to try the 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:06.400
 of iu 2 can do it and for those 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.320
 that you already have it remember you must keep 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.630
 the updated program to check the 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.580
 connections and you know what to put 

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:14.890
 any service afternoons and fire manu 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.240
 They are located in several bicycle shops 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.240
 of Buenos Aires also the chronicles 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.380
 let's hope you enjoyed the 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.570
 today's program remember that the 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.520
 next week there's going to be a lot more of 

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:30.890
 the privacy of the backstage of the 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:33.860
 shimano offices and so we will be 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:36.020
 we already have a date for the great 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:40.190
 event that is coming for your air ' 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:43.340
 we are talking about the shimano fest 2013

 go we all look forward to all those 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.760
 that want to approach an event 

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.520
 international because figures come from 

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:55.220
 everywhere just to live what is 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.770
 the party of the bicycle with his hands 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:00.080
 of course we wait for you in October in 

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.700

 to suffer 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.680
 with its lack
