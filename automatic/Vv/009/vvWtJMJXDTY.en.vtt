 next in the stadium but you wait he is 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.950
 There I will cut the video again that I 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.350
 like you for you because it takes 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:36.180
 long only for that very long way. 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.900

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.030
