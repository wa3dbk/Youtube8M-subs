00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello I was back at dm have 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.420
 These two sweet little hats here and wanted 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.690
 show you what the contents of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.250
 is the first child number from what 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.620
 should I start so this time he is 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.730
 a lot of decorative cosmetics and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.199
 I would say we catch that too 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.810
 directly at times I've heard of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.810
 Essens bought this ascari that is the 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.269
 money at clashes volume mascara in word 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.430
 to prove and yes this brushing would be here 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.439
 me on twitter and instagram follows the 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.000
 Why do I know just this little bit 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.740
 stressed because I massage this 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.149
 she had already bought her 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.710
 have done it and a bit 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.630
 because that's where I come from 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 picture posted on twitter and instagram 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.329
 up and I show you is there 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.950
 was a pity 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.899
 In any case, I'm the mascara 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.550
 exchanged that was gone 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.469
 no problem the dm saleswoman was 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.360
 very nice and yes then I just have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 just brought the same but with one 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.270
 Sausages and I'm very happy that now 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.559
 I have and I have them today 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.670
 I am complete today 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.860
 make-up somehow with the things 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.129
 did not buy up and the first 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.750
 impression is really very positive so that 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.120
 still positive right now since 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 two hours about the eyelashes 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.860
 they just look really great 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.960
 and are thus separated black 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.310
 and somehow load and I like that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.390
 very good at the mascara and especially 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.369
 the swing keeps it nice too 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170
 that's why I like the love that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.570
 The next time I bought this is this 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.549
 is of espresso couple that own shampoo 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.200
 against yellowing as many as write 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.530
 always too judy tossell yellowish in the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.600
 hague 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.070
 I still think that's easy 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 from the camera comes and through mine 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 light editing but i thought so 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.509
 Yes, yes, at silver schabo 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.009
 Maybe I have a try 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.509
 really a yellow cast in the near 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.990
 even if I personally do not like that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.670
 see 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 and even if such a little orange me 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.799
 Intended in my hair 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.360
 is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.619
 but I wanted to try anyway 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 and I have sometimes even 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.920
 I have already tried twice 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.039
 so that my hair washed and people 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.149
 I have something to tell you the thing here 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.100
 has me in an embarrassing situation 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.850
 and that is what I have with it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.469
 hair washed 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.340
 if then out of the normal school 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:01.009
 and what was my whole or blue one's 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.719
 Embarrassing because somehow no idea that 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.399
 shampoo brightness and then rehearsed 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.319
 it came to my ears and then became 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.939
 my ears just blue because I then 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.410
 did not play and then I had 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.789
 blue ears and everyone asked because 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.080
 I did with my ears and 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.700
 I did not know what was first 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.349
 but otherwise I like it very much 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.120
 if you buy that, please always 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.720
 thoroughly ears again afterwards 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.920
 rinse 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.629
 then it continues with this 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
 Lipstick I've got me and 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.829
 Although it is the color 13 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.569
 love me I bought the lipstick 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.010
 even know the color is 13 and because 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.620
 I really liked the color that 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.209
 it already as a rosÃ© so I already like 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.950
 Of course, I love to wear them too 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.690
 just on my lips and I like that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.239
 also likes the consistency very much 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.560
 well so everything is fine with the further 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.239
 then it goes with this chic part 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.560
 here what I bought and what pink 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.390
 that's from klischko harry 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.549
 Personal criticism express he wrote 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.370
 There are quite a lot of games of that kind 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.200
 from blizz and i have already 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.370
 another and had before that one 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.780
 others and I just wanted to 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.609
 The buys because the packaging 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.349
 and I really liked it 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.000
 I always think it's very good 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.380
 in my hair if I'm anywhere 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.970
 she has problems combing through that 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.560
 If somehow I call it the day before 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.389
 not properly combed or 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.590
 if somehow I was in the pool 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:10.790
 then, of course , never so good 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.900
 fought over then I always give that 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.910
 in the hair then it all works 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.959
 a lot easier and sometimes I give that 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.430
 so easy in the hair because it's good 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.870
 Smells the next thing I bought 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.090
 I've got this and that looks good 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.530
 a bit worn out because I'm up 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.599
 has been using every day since then 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.319
 it's off of Manhattan's that 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:28.669
 soft compact power in transparent and 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.200
 that looks just as it still has one 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.549
 small sweet sponge and me 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.079
 necessarily have a transparent 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.760
 used powder because I fix yes 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.620
 otherwise my concealer or something with me 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.030
 Baby powder because that's transparent too 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.120
 is and i like transparent brother 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.260
 rather than colored powder but that with 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.090
 The baby powder was too complicated for me 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.950
 because of the packaging because you have to do so 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.450
 rausholen funny or and then just 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.010
 somehow have something for the handbag 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.930
 but if I'm completely honest I found 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.489
 the baby powder from the finish on the skin 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.230
 more beautiful than this but I use it 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.699
 this still always because it is 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.190
 But it is more practical for him here 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.800
 me a ticket and that's one 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.910
 a little bit that 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.770
 plans because I have with it but how 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.060
 I like to use it anyway 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.950
 By the way, I still have a little prizes 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.840
 get and the bibi cream of two 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.910
 Manhattan animal face 9 in 1 against pimples 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.620
 and everything else had the bi bpm 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.550
 Do you have experience with me? 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.780
 interest 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.910
 the next thing I bought myself 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.260
 I have been here for a long time 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.640
 somehow I snuck around it 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.950
 but did not want to buy anything anymore or 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.250
 and not even care whether the case 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.140
 that of the chain chloe of p 2 1 bronze 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.690
 from the looks like that has such a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.820
 little glitter particle in it 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.170
 but does not notice on the skin 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.780
 and I always like that personally 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.040
 like when industry also have a bit 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.740
 It shimmers because it is not quite like that 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.840
 toth and matt looks in any case 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.060
 that is just from this edis of the p2 the 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.440
 All summer long there and I wanted 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.030
 buy it all the time but there 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.220
 I was never so sure and then 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.360
 I did not want to have it there 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.060
 I took it with me now because she 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.200
 not soon there and have there 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.700
 I give her but before I regret I get 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.650
 now always with him that's why I have 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.150
 now have him from another corner 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.790
 I took this with me and that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.570
 That's from the Essen Speed ââCruiser 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.410
 sally or why a leaf and that 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.390
 color 0 1 a mallet break and me 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.190
 have seen this industry and have 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.810
 thought orders looks so nice that that 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.010
 has such a lost then I have 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.140
 thought that I must necessarily have 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:20.370
 because i will never find a book again 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.720
 has a course and I thought 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.390
 I do not even have that kind of stuff 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.130
 Home thought something wrong because I am so 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.930
 which one already has and the two 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.210
 see completely similar and that is the 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.220
 here the essence blanche sheet spoke 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.350
 I also sv no idea 200 or so 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.330
 bought and yes it is now something 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.070
 Needless to have both but I do not care 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.930
 wear them very much and have here 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.490
 Of course, I will do it today, too 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.130
 then I discovered another product 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.930
 and that here where with me but one 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.790
 small accident happened so 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.250
 i might need your help i 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.270
 explain it to you and I need it 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.860
 another highlight 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.880
 I have only a liquid highlighter 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.410
 because I still have a baked 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.730
 highlight but that is a bit pink 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.900
 and I wanted something more 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.740
 In any case, I have then 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.500
 found out 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.350
 that is from essens the 01 o'clock are off 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.640
 highlighter and there was one too 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.020
 nice packaging but on the 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.009
 packaging was a stain and take you 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.930
 make off 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.449
 I remove and now I have the 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.800
 complete outer packaging smeared 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.960
 and unfortunately I do not remember anymore 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.490
 water to parts that is but I am me 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.509
 Sure you can do that 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.710
 you me it like in the comments 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.629
 write
