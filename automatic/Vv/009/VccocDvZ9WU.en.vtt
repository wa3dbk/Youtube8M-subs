and for me it's about hiding and um kind

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.570 
and for me it's about hiding and um kind
of<00:01:05.670> about<00:01:05.909> dual<00:01:06.390> identities<00:01:07.400> kind<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of about dual identities kind of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.030 
of about dual identities kind of the
identity<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.390> all<00:01:09.540> hide<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.680> kind<00:01:10.979> of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
identity that we all hide this kind of

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
identity that we all hide this kind of
secret<00:01:11.400> private<00:01:11.939> identity<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.689> then<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
secret private identity and then this

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.149 
secret private identity and then this
second<00:01:14.010> identity<00:01:14.340> where<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.720> people

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
second identity where you know people

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.469 
second identity where you know people
put<00:01:17.159> on<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> mask<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> show<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> public

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
put on a mask and show to the public

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.700 
put on a mask and show to the public
into<00:01:19.140> each<00:01:19.290> other<00:01:19.820> well<00:01:20.820> my<00:01:21.000> technique<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.710> a

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
into each other well my technique is a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.910 
into each other well my technique is a
colored<00:01:23.220> pencil<00:01:23.549> on<00:01:23.670> paper<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.600> it's<00:01:24.920> it's

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
colored pencil on paper so it's it's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.850 
colored pencil on paper so it's it's
very<00:01:26.189> much<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.720> this<00:01:27.720> layering<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.619> kind

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
very much about this layering this kind

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.510 
very much about this layering this kind
of<00:01:28.920> obsessive<00:01:29.460> layering<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.720> color<00:01:31.560> over

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
of obsessive layering of of color over

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.490 
of obsessive layering of of color over
and<00:01:32.670> over<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.880> over<00:01:33.000> again<00:01:33.210> which<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.810> very

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
and over and over again which is very

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
and over and over again which is very
similar<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.939> painter<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:37.470> still

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
similar to that of a painter and I still

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.980 
similar to that of a painter and I still
very<00:01:38.159> much<00:01:38.280> consider<00:01:38.759> myself<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.240> painter<00:01:39.570> even

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
very much consider myself a painter even

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.969 
very much consider myself a painter even
though<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.560> draw<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.840> i<00:01:42.840> think<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> line

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
though I draw and i think that the line

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.429 
though I draw and i think that the line
is<00:01:44.159> blurred<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.700> bit<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
is blurred a bit and I like to kind of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:54.530 
is blurred a bit and I like to kind of
play<00:01:46.619> with<00:01:46.710> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.780

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
there's the prestige that comes along

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.510 
there's the prestige that comes along
with<00:01:57.939> with<00:01:58.540> that<00:01:58.570> award<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.770> feel<00:02:00.369> as
