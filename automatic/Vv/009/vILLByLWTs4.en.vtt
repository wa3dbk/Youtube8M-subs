drawing in my sketchbook and I've made a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.960 
drawing in my sketchbook and I've made a
sketchbook<00:00:24.510> video<00:00:24.869> before<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.550> said

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
sketchbook video before and in it I said

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.670 
sketchbook video before and in it I said
that<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.420> treat<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:27.930> sketchbook<00:00:28.470> like<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that I treat my sketchbook like a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.679 
that I treat my sketchbook like a
playground<00:00:29.310> meaning<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.300> don't<00:00:30.510> really

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
playground meaning that I don't really

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.749 
playground meaning that I don't really
take<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> too<00:00:31.260> seriously<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.550> place

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
take it too seriously it's just a place

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.209 
take it too seriously it's just a place
where<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:33.030> can<00:00:33.329> just<00:00:33.600> scribble<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> doodle<00:00:34.710> and

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
where I can just scribble and doodle and

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.310 
where I can just scribble and doodle and
jot<00:00:35.430> down<00:00:35.460> ideas<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.600> be<00:00:36.750> too<00:00:36.899> harsh<00:00:37.140> or

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
jot down ideas and not be too harsh or

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.410 
jot down ideas and not be too harsh or
critical<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> myself<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> so<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
critical of myself and so for the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.630 
critical of myself and so for the
sketches<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.050> video<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.410> also<00:00:40.710> set<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.340> mini

sketches in this video I also set a mini
challenge<00:00:42.090> for<00:00:42.270> myself<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.809> finish<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.290> in

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
challenge for myself to finish them in

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
under 10 minutes so the first sketch I'm

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
under 10 minutes so the first sketch I'm
using<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.489> 8b<00:00:47.820> pencil<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.809> shading<00:00:49.140> on

using an 8b pencil and the shading on
this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.829> loose<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.730> messy<00:00:51.090> but

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
this is very loose and kind of messy but

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.850 
this is very loose and kind of messy but

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
experiment with water and you'll notice

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
well I actually want to try painting

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
well I actually want to try painting
water<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.550> differently<00:01:03.019> sort<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.229> a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
water a bit differently sort of in a

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.980 
water a bit differently sort of in a
more<00:01:04.320> free<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.909> vibrant<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:06.240> little<00:01:06.869> bit

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
more free and vibrant a little bit

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.830 
more free and vibrant a little bit
abstract<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:08.100> opposed<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.700> very<00:01:09.090> realistic

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
abstract as opposed to very realistic

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
abstract as opposed to very realistic
and<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.250> know<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.580> I'm<00:01:11.729> even<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.210> to

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
and I don't know if I'm even going to

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
and I don't know if I'm even going to
like<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> idea<00:01:13.049> when<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.380> actually<00:01:13.619> turn<00:01:14.100> it

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
like the idea when I actually turn it

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.100 
like the idea when I actually turn it
into<00:01:14.310> paint<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.880> might<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.930> I'll

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
into paint I might not like it and I'll

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
into paint I might not like it and I'll
just<00:01:16.140> move<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> something<00:01:16.920> else<00:01:17.130> but<00:01:17.430> who

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
just move on to something else but who

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
just move on to something else but who
knows<00:01:18.150> we'll<00:01:18.450> just<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.780> wait<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.530> see

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
knows we'll just have to wait and see

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.410 
knows we'll just have to wait and see
so<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.189> sketch<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.090> creeping<00:01:21.360> me

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so this sketch was kind of creeping me

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
so this sketch was kind of creeping me
out<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> while<00:01:22.080> especially<00:01:22.619> before<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
out for a while especially before I

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.219 
out for a while especially before I
started<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> draw<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.000> body<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.110> was

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
started to draw the body because it was

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
started to draw the body because it was
just<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.590> creepy<00:01:26.250> floating<00:01:26.790> deformed<00:01:27.420> face

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just this creepy floating deformed face

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.920 
just this creepy floating deformed face
and<00:01:28.220> it<00:01:29.220> still<00:01:29.549> didn't<00:01:29.820> quite<00:01:29.909> turn<00:01:30.240> out<00:01:30.420> how<00:01:30.600> I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
and it still didn't quite turn out how I

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
and it still didn't quite turn out how I
envisioned<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.890> hey<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> freaking

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
envisioned it but hey this is a freaking

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
envisioned it but hey this is a freaking
playground<00:01:33.900> okay<00:01:34.409> I'm<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.920> gonna<00:01:35.100> chill<00:01:35.430> out

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.300 
probably already concluded that I love
the<00:01:41.909> look<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.240> fabric<00:01:42.750> or<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> draped<00:01:43.560> cloth<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
the look of fabric or a draped cloth I

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.969 
the look of fabric or a draped cloth I
always<00:01:44.880> associate<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.720> with<00:01:45.750> softness<00:01:46.710> and

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
always associate it with softness and

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.190 
always associate it with softness and
comfort<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> reminds<00:01:48.810> me<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.990> some

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
comfort and it just reminds me of some

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.109 
comfort and it just reminds me of some
classical<00:01:49.680> paintings<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.189> sculptures<00:01:50.670> also

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
classical paintings and sculptures also

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.420 
classical paintings and sculptures also
you<00:01:51.869> know<00:01:51.990> ones<00:01:52.259> with<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> lot<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.829> emphasis<00:01:52.979> on

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
you know ones with a lot of emphasis on

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.730 
you know ones with a lot of emphasis on
drapes<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.090> folds<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.590> definitely

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
drapes and folds so this is definitely

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.319 
drapes and folds so this is definitely
not<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.369> first<00:01:56.399> time<00:01:56.820> I'm<00:01:56.969> incorporating

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
not the first time I'm incorporating

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.300 
not the first time I'm incorporating
them<00:01:57.719> into<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:58.020> art<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.469> definitely<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
them into my art and definitely not the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.490 
them into my art and definitely not the
last

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
last

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.870 
last
for<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> third<00:02:01.799> sketch<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.369> drew<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.790> in

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
for the third sketch I drew it in

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.850 
for the third sketch I drew it in
charcoal<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.869> think<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> see<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.530> huge

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
charcoal and I think you can see a huge

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.289 
charcoal and I think you can see a huge
difference<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.670> smoothness<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
difference in the smoothness of the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.070 
difference in the smoothness of the
shadow

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
shadow

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.990 
shadow
when<00:02:07.440> compared<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> other<00:02:08.220> two<00:02:08.550> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
when compared to the other two it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.300 
when compared to the other two it
definitely<00:02:09.300> has<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> much<00:02:09.780> softer<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.770> I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
definitely has a much softer look and I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.190 
definitely has a much softer look and I
will<00:02:11.640> admit<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.970> got<00:02:12.150> carried<00:02:12.540> away<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.080> took

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
will admit I got carried away and took

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.430 
will admit I got carried away and took
longer<00:02:13.860> than<00:02:14.100> 10<00:02:14.280> minutes<00:02:14.490> but<00:02:14.940> oh<00:02:15.180> wow<00:02:15.750> out<00:02:16.290> of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
longer than 10 minutes but oh wow out of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.080 
longer than 10 minutes but oh wow out of
the<00:02:16.590> three<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:16.890> think<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.430> like<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.819> one<00:02:17.970> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the three I think I like this one the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.540 
the three I think I like this one the
most<00:02:18.120> also<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.140> made<00:02:19.500> some<00:02:19.709> of<00:02:19.740> my<00:02:19.830> early<00:02:20.280> water

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
most also I made some of my early water

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.850 
most also I made some of my early water
series<00:02:20.940> paintings<00:02:21.360> into<00:02:21.630> art<00:02:21.810> stickers<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
series paintings into art stickers and I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.500 
series paintings into art stickers and I
stuck<00:02:23.130> them<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> my<00:02:23.520> sketchbook<00:02:24.090> which

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
stuck them on to my sketchbook which

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.970 
stuck them on to my sketchbook which
makes<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.870> look<00:02:24.989> way<00:02:25.260> more<00:02:25.440> interesting<00:02:25.830> now

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
makes it look way more interesting now

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.290 
makes it look way more interesting now
and<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.370> think<00:02:26.550> I'll<00:02:26.640> be<00:02:26.760> doing<00:02:26.790> this<00:02:27.090> for

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
and I think I'll be doing this for

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.780 
and I think I'll be doing this for
future<00:02:27.510> sketchbooks<00:02:28.050> too<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.280> yeah<00:02:29.520> I<00:02:29.550> hope
