leg on the back definitely is armored up
when<00:06:03.789> you<00:06:03.939> put<00:06:04.089> the<00:06:04.209> shield<00:06:04.449> on<00:06:04.629> the<00:06:04.659> back

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009 
when you put the shield on the back

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.329 
when you put the shield on the back
better<00:06:06.009> than<00:06:06.159> rockers<00:06:07.529> because<00:06:08.529> rockers

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339 
better than rockers because rockers

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:12.509 
better than rockers because rockers
sticks<00:06:09.610> out<00:06:09.819> really<00:06:10.539> far<00:06:11.199> and<00:06:11.559> it<00:06:12.189> doesn't

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:12.519 
sticks out really far and it doesn't

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:13.949 
sticks out really far and it doesn't
look<00:06:12.610> that<00:06:12.669> armored<00:06:13.239> up<00:06:13.300> when<00:06:13.479> he's<00:06:13.599> got<00:06:13.779> it<00:06:13.869> on

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:13.959 
look that armored up when he's got it on

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:18.540 
look that armored up when he's got it on
his<00:06:14.739> shield<00:06:15.099> maybe<00:06:15.879> to<00:06:16.449> make<00:06:16.569> it<00:06:16.809> more<00:06:17.139> like<00:06:18.129> so

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
his shield maybe to make it more like so

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.949 
his shield maybe to make it more like so
she's<00:06:18.759> alright<00:06:18.999> up<00:06:19.149> on<00:06:19.269> both<00:06:19.449> sides<00:06:19.479> maybe

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:19.959 
she's alright up on both sides maybe

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:22.859 
she's alright up on both sides maybe
added<00:06:20.469> another<00:06:20.739> one<00:06:20.949> of<00:06:21.069> these<00:06:21.249> and<00:06:21.669> put<00:06:21.749> it<00:06:22.749> on

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:22.869 
added another one of these and put it on

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:24.359 
added another one of these and put it on
there<00:06:23.050> because<00:06:23.379> then<00:06:23.559> it<00:06:23.709> would<00:06:23.829> look

00:06:24.359 --> 00:06:24.369 
there because then it would look

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:27.449 
there because then it would look
definitely<00:06:25.149> more<00:06:26.110> finished<00:06:26.559> and<00:06:26.829> then<00:06:27.159> on<00:06:27.339> the

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:27.459 
definitely more finished and then on the

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:31.319 
definitely more finished and then on the
visor<00:06:28.079> lift<00:06:29.079> it<00:06:29.259> up<00:06:29.519> then<00:06:30.519> you've<00:06:30.729> got<00:06:30.879> breezes

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:31.329 
visor lift it up then you've got breezes

00:06:31.329 --> 00:06:34.259 
visor lift it up then you've got breezes
silver<00:06:31.689> face<00:06:32.610> definitely<00:06:33.610> works<00:06:33.819> well<00:06:34.119> the

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:34.269 
silver face definitely works well the

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:36.659 
silver face definitely works well the
green<00:06:34.539> visor<00:06:34.899> and<00:06:35.289> the<00:06:35.349> silver<00:06:36.309> definitely

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
green visor and the silver definitely

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.819

works<00:06:36.849> well<00:06:37.089> with<00:06:37.239> breeze<00:06:37.509> then<00:06:38.499> we've<00:06:38.649> got

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:38.829 
works well with breeze then we've got

00:06:38.829 --> 00:06:42.059 
works well with breeze then we've got
our<00:06:38.919> core<00:06:39.279> locking<00:06:39.699> clamps<00:06:40.389> here<00:06:40.779> we<00:06:41.589> can<00:06:41.860> open

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:42.069

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:49.829 
them up and close them but also the hero
cord<00:06:45.459> goes<00:06:46.119> there<00:06:46.679> the<00:06:47.679> green<00:06:48.179> clamps<00:06:49.179> do<00:06:49.599> work

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:49.839 
cord goes there the green clamps do work

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:53.519 
cord goes there the green clamps do work
well<00:06:50.169> with<00:06:50.439> the<00:06:50.559> set<00:06:50.889> and<00:06:51.719> lower<00:06:52.719> arms<00:06:53.289> are

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:53.529 
well with the set and lower arms are

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:57.809 
well with the set and lower arms are
short<00:06:54.089> no<00:06:55.089> bore<00:06:55.839> attachment<00:06:56.319> there<00:06:56.759> so<00:06:57.759> you

00:06:57.809 --> 00:06:57.819 
short no bore attachment there so you

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.340 
short no bore attachment there so you
can't<00:06:58.179> really<00:06:58.389> stick

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.350 
can't really stick

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.910 
can't really stick
in<00:06:59.410> Iran<00:06:59.560> Iran<00:06:59.710> but<00:07:00.670> the<00:07:00.970> lover<00:07:01.180> likes<00:07:01.920> they

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:02.920 
in Iran Iran but the lover likes they

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.280 
in Iran Iran but the lover likes they
are<00:07:03.190> using<00:07:03.640> a<00:07:03.730> longer<00:07:03.970> version<00:07:04.180> so<00:07:04.570> maybe<00:07:04.930> it

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.290 
are using a longer version so maybe it

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:06.870 
are using a longer version so maybe it
longer<00:07:05.830> on<00:07:06.010> the<00:07:06.160> piece<00:07:06.370> would<00:07:06.580> have<00:07:06.700> worked

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 
longer on the piece would have worked

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.550 
longer on the piece would have worked
well<00:07:07.150> but<00:07:07.420> still<00:07:07.660> this<00:07:08.050> other<00:07:08.290> piece

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
well but still this other piece

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.460 
well but still this other piece
definitely<00:07:09.070> does<00:07:09.250> look<00:07:09.460> good<00:07:09.670> on<00:07:09.820> it<00:07:10.140> but<00:07:11.140> it's

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470 
definitely does look good on it but it's

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.870 
definitely does look good on it but it's
just<00:07:11.650> when<00:07:11.800> you<00:07:11.950> look<00:07:12.040> at<00:07:12.190> it<00:07:12.370> from<00:07:12.550> the<00:07:12.730> back

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:12.880 
just when you look at it from the back

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.470 
just when you look at it from the back
not<00:07:13.390> really<00:07:13.630> that<00:07:13.750> much<00:07:13.960> armored<00:07:14.380> up<00:07:14.670> but<00:07:15.670> yeah

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:16.480 
not really that much armored up but yeah

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.660 
not really that much armored up but yeah
let's<00:07:17.020> now<00:07:17.140> go<00:07:17.440> on<00:07:17.560> to<00:07:17.680> the<00:07:17.710> ratings<00:07:18.100> for<00:07:18.520> the

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:18.670 
let's now go on to the ratings for the

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.020 
let's now go on to the ratings for the
set<00:07:19.230> ratings<00:07:20.230> of<00:07:20.440> the<00:07:20.560> set<00:07:20.800> overall<00:07:21.370> this<00:07:21.760> set

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
set ratings of the set overall this set

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.820 
set ratings of the set overall this set
gets<00:07:22.210> a<00:07:22.440> 9.5<00:07:24.030> simply<00:07:25.030> because<00:07:25.660> I<00:07:25.900> think<00:07:26.200> maybe

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 
gets a 9.5 simply because I think maybe

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.500 
gets a 9.5 simply because I think maybe
if<00:07:27.070> they're<00:07:27.250> divided<00:07:27.670> another<00:07:28.060> one<00:07:28.210> of<00:07:28.330> those

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510 
if they're divided another one of those

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.960 
if they're divided another one of those
there<00:07:28.930> it<00:07:29.560> would<00:07:29.710> definitely<00:07:30.310> bring<00:07:30.790> the
