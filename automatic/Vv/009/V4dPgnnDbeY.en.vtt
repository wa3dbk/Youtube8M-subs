00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.599> about<00:00:00.810> having<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.260> last<00:00:01.530> fault

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
driveway in the north is it we don't get

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.280 
driveway in the north is it we don't get
the<00:00:04.470> kind<00:00:04.650> of<00:00:04.799> heat<00:00:05.009> you<00:00:05.190> get<00:00:05.370> down<00:00:05.580> south<00:00:06.140> if<00:00:07.140> I

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the kind of heat you get down south if I

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.290 
the kind of heat you get down south if I
want<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.770> to<00:00:07.950> I<00:00:08.250> believe<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.849> could<00:00:09.030> bring<00:00:09.240> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300

Jackie's<00:00:12.450> tires<00:00:12.750> up<00:00:12.990> continuing<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.769> time

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
Jackie's tires up continuing to the time

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.060 
Jackie's tires up continuing to the time
with<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.929> down<00:00:15.929> south<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> gets<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> hot<00:00:16.920> if

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
with it down south that gets the hot if

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.740 
with it down south that gets the hot if
you<00:00:17.160> park<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> bicycle<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.210> piece<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.630> asphalt

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
in the summertime the kickstand will

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.460 
in the summertime the kickstand will
sink<00:00:21.090> into<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.390> asphalt<00:00:21.990> because<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> gets

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
sink into the asphalt because it gets

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.779 
sink into the asphalt because it gets
hot<00:00:22.680> enough<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.949> melt<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.460> stuff<00:00:26.359> jump<00:00:27.359> north

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's almost like the exact opposite if

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.819 
it's almost like the exact opposite if
