00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
next we have Wolfsburg and this is a

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.969 
next we have Wolfsburg and this is a
leaked<00:01:23.610> shirt<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.270> don't<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
leaked shirt I don't think that is the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.890 
leaked shirt I don't think that is the
same<00:01:26.189> as<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.729> last<00:01:26.880> season<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.479> was<00:01:27.509> kind<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
same as the last season it was kind of

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.080 
same as the last season it was kind of
similar<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.860> have<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.040> really<00:01:29.549> crappy

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
similar but they have a really crappy

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.330 
similar but they have a really crappy
brand<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.750> kappa<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.710> just<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.220> bad

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
brand it's kappa it's just a really bad

and I did looks by far and wide for the
home<00:01:44.670> shirt<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:46.110> was<00:01:46.560> reading<00:01:46.920> on<00:01:47.070> some

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
home shirt and I was reading on some

home shirt and I was reading on some
bits<00:01:47.549> about<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.390> apparently<00:01:49.009> they<00:01:50.009> skip

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
bits about it and apparently they skip

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.969 
bits about it and apparently they skip
it<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.360> go<00:01:51.509> home<00:01:51.810> shirt<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.829> next

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it so they go home shirt then the next

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.889 
it so they go home shirt then the next
thing<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.670> away<00:01:53.880> shirt<00:01:54.299> then<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
thing they do the away shirt then the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
thing they do the away shirt then the
home<00:01:55.049> shirt<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:55.920> where<00:01:56.460> they've

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
home shirt and then see where they've

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.490 
home shirt and then see where they've
just<00:01:56.880> released<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.390> home<00:01:57.570> shirt<00:01:57.960> they're

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
just released the home shirt they're

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
just released the home shirt they're
going<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> be<00:01:58.890> releasing<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> away<00:01:59.700> show

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
going to be releasing the away show

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389 
going to be releasing the away show
which<00:02:00.180> could<00:02:00.540> possibly<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.409> one<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
which could possibly be this one and I

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.249 
which could possibly be this one and I
think<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> honest<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.570> yeah<00:02:03.780> they

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
think it is to be honest but yeah they

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.010 
think it is to be honest but yeah they
score<00:02:04.799> rather<00:02:05.490> do<00:02:05.850> two<00:02:06.180> kits<00:02:06.540> at<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.780> same

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
score rather do two kits at the same

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
score rather do two kits at the same
season<00:02:07.619> they<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.950> didn't<00:02:08.220> mix<00:02:08.340> around<00:02:08.550> them

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
season they just didn't mix around them

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.270 
season they just didn't mix around them
I'm<00:02:09.179> assume<00:02:09.569> it's<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.080> say<00:02:10.259> fans<00:02:10.619> buying<00:02:11.009> new

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I'm assume it's to say fans buying new

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
I'm assume it's to say fans buying new
kits<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.849> season<00:02:12.209> even<00:02:12.420> though<00:02:12.840> they

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
kits of your season even though they

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.970 
kits of your season even though they
would<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
would but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.680 
would but
that<00:02:14.099> spend<00:02:14.430> as<00:02:14.580> much<00:02:14.700> money<00:02:14.760> for<00:02:15.209> not<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> mean

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
that spend as much money for not I mean

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.570 
that spend as much money for not I mean
and<00:02:16.170> then<00:02:16.290> last<00:02:16.530> but<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.980> least<00:02:17.040> we<00:02:17.550> have

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
and then last but not least we have

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.880 
and then last but not least we have
probably<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.720> second<00:02:19.080> favorite<00:02:19.440> shirt<00:02:19.709> I've

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
probably the second favorite shirt I've

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.640 
probably the second favorite shirt I've
seen<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.430> it's<00:02:20.940> by<00:02:21.180> leverkusen<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.200> I'm<00:02:22.590> a
