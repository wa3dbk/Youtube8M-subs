00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.110

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.880
 a park and it measures almost three hectares a 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.890

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.500
 the opinions of the people 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.500

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.500

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.440

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.700

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.720
 they saw the opinion of the people who 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.490

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.200
 park is one of the most beautiful and 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.240
 most visited of the city is good to 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.190
 the state capital and it was built 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.350
 mainly to preserve a bit of 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.940
 the native fauna speaks is considered 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.410
 like fog forest and good them 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.360
 I commented that the name of the tecajetes 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.450
 comes from the Nahuatl voice that means 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.119
 acajete de piedra this park is full 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
 of natural springs from sources that 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.009
 well they are mine there are how they are decorated 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.810
 but they are natural and this is all 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.030
 inspired by the cultures 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.580
 I tell you that the prehispanic 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.130
 spring that is born in this park was the 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.830
 first to provide the drinking water network to the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.750
