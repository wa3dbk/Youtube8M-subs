00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:13.500
 Yes this time we will show you how to model soccer balls easily 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:17.730
 First of all , start the tulle to create a sphere with primitives 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.560
 Divide the mode of q into 4 into 4 levels 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.180
 Make polygon type face 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.180
 Click Apply button 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:37.390
 Then select all the vertices that make up this mesh in focus mode 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.800
 Start bevel B-ro with the shortcut b key 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:45.370
 Click the blue handle to construct a soccer ball 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:49.680
 To be pentagonal and hexagonal topology 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 To adjust the value of the level of e-set 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.940
 It's about this 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.940
 It is about this 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:10.040
 Then switch to the etch mode and all edges are selected. 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.640
 Make a selection set so it is easy to reselect later 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.950
 From selection menu 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.510
 Edit the laundry set Click here for the appropriate name 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.070
 This time is etch select 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:32.070
 Create a name like this and press the ok button 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:35.310
 Then Opening the selection of the edge and try over again split as much as 3 times 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:41.370
 With the shortcut d key 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.250
 We have finely the first floor second floor third floor this about mesh 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:51.870
 I think that has been visible g somehow the place looks like a soccer ball, but look closely and 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:58.230
 This mesh itself is not a beautiful sphere 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:00.210
 From here , use the constraint function as a background of snapping and change to a clean sphere 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.080
 Will 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:09.530
 At first we make a beautiful sphere to become a guide 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:15.530
 Click the sphere tool while holding down the shift key 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:19.130
 Create one sphere and do two more splits 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.820
 Let's divide it into a thin messi 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:26.360
 Activate the soccer ball you mentioned earlier 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.270
 Once the guide sphere is set to be the background 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:34.600
 Snapping yesterday turn this on 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:38.640
 Launch scale tool and snapping properties 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:45.240
 From here on straight mode background 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.550
 Turn on the two-sided option and also use the scale tool with the shape now straight vector 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:51.890
 to watch 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:54.370
 To the mesh of the soccer ball so that it fits perfectly to the sphere for which it is intended to be small 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.470
 Can be scaled 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:04.819
 Now it's a clean sphere, so you don't need the mesh that you intended 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:10.770
 You may delete it and keep it hidden this time 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:14.730
 Let's select the edge that was previously set in the selection set 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.030
 H in the state tab open this 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:23.780
 Selection by selection set 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.319
 Edge select in this Select the edge select that has been saved as far as the destination 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.700
 is there 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:33.160
 Click the + button here 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.130
 Then only those with hSelect will be selected. 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.410
 Was 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:42.660
 When h is selected, use the shortcut key b to bevel the edge 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.780
 start up 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:52.950
 Click the viewport and pull the blue handle 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:56.940
 Make a polygon that will be a groove for a soccer ball 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:03.420
 Please keep round the shape of Aichi 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:07.710
 When the polygon of the part that hits the groove is created with the appropriate size, release the middle level. 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:13.770
 Change selected state to polygon 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:19.560
 When you press the Alt key, this button changes to the conversion button in the component mode. 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:26.310
 Click the Convert to polygon button as it will be changed 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:30.090
 Since this video uses modana nam 1 sp 4 directly from this h 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:36.150
 I was able to convert to this polygon 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:39.550
 Modes Do multi-sp 3 such in order to specification that it is an earlier version is different 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.030
 You may not be able to select polygons 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:50.600
 In such a case this h choice 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:54.860
 From this state , I went to the point while holding down the ortho key as well . 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:59.720
 If you convert to a polygon while holding down the ortho key 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.460
 I think it is possible to select only the part of the polygon that you look at, so try it 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:08.360
 Please give me 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:12.550
 Now, if you can select a polygon, this time again the polygon level tutorial shortcut 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.480
 Start the bell tool in the key of b of the key 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:21.690
 Click the viewport with the blue handle 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.690
 Please push the groove inwards 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:31.320
 If you push it to a suitable depth 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:35.990
 To release the passage washing also released 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.990
 Press tab key to convert to subdivision 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:40.270
 This is the end of the soccer ball
