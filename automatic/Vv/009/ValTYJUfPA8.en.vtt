this car now you might be asking
why<00:02:59.050> why<00:03:00.050> would<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> reading<00:03:00.650> be<00:03:01.220> off<00:03:01.370> all<00:03:01.640> it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
why why would the reading be off all it

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.940 
why why would the reading be off all it
causes<00:03:02.120> it<00:03:02.240> to<00:03:02.270> be<00:03:02.950> too<00:03:03.950> low<00:03:04.130> or<00:03:04.370> too<00:03:04.460> high<00:03:04.610> well

in<00:03:06.950> order<00:03:07.160> to<00:03:07.280> explain<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.760> I'd<00:03:07.940> have<00:03:08.120> to

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
in order to explain that I'd have to

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.610 
in order to explain that I'd have to
quickly<00:03:09.740> explain<00:03:10.070> how<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> fuel<00:03:10.640> ejector<00:03:11.030> works

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
quickly explain how a fuel ejector works

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.940 
quickly explain how a fuel ejector works
basically<00:03:12.620> its<00:03:14.170> fuel<00:03:15.170> injectors<00:03:15.500> an<00:03:15.620> electric

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
basically its fuel injectors an electric

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.000 
basically its fuel injectors an electric
solenoid<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:17.720> uses<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:19.360> thin<00:03:20.470> long<00:03:21.470> coil<00:03:21.860> of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
solenoid it uses a thin long coil of

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.890 
solenoid it uses a thin long coil of
wire<00:03:23.140> inside<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.500> when<00:03:25.400> energized<00:03:25.940> creates

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
wire inside that when energized creates

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.710 
wire inside that when energized creates
a<00:03:26.990> magnetic<00:03:27.140> field<00:03:27.910> which<00:03:28.910> is<00:03:28.940> pulsed<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.570> and

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
a magnetic field which is pulsed on and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.870 
a magnetic field which is pulsed on and
off<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.410> open<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.890> injector<00:03:31.840> now<00:03:32.840> if<00:03:32.960> you<00:03:33.110> have

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
off to open the injector now if you have

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.180 
off to open the injector now if you have
resistance<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.150> too<00:03:35.300> low<00:03:35.890> it<00:03:36.890> usually

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
resistance that is too low it usually

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.000 
resistance that is too low it usually
means<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.490> a<00:03:38.230> part<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.290> that<00:03:39.410> coil<00:03:39.650> of<00:03:39.830> wire

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
means that a part of that coil of wire

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.350 
means that a part of that coil of wire
has<00:03:40.790> broken<00:03:41.150> off<00:03:41.440> somewhere<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.940> strand

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
has broken off somewhere and that strand

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.860 
has broken off somewhere and that strand
and<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:45.650> now<00:03:45.770> connecting<00:03:46.460> lower<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.630> coil

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
and is now connecting lower in the coil

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.950 
and is now connecting lower in the coil
somewhere<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:49.270> that's<00:03:50.270> basically<00:03:50.630> what<00:03:50.870> you

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:50.960 
somewhere and that's basically what you

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.590 
somewhere and that's basically what you
would<00:03:51.080> call<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.530> short<00:03:52.160> and<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:53.330> would<00:03:53.450> give

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
would call a short and that would give

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.280 
would call a short and that would give
you<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.990> lower<00:03:54.650> than<00:03:54.860> normal<00:03:54.980> resistance<00:03:55.430> and

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
you a lower than normal resistance and

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.310 
you a lower than normal resistance and
would<00:03:57.290> cause<00:03:57.530> your<00:03:58.570> injector<00:03:59.570> not<00:04:00.050> to<00:04:00.170> fire

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
would cause your injector not to fire

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.140 
would cause your injector not to fire
properly<00:04:03.280> now<00:04:04.280> if<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.430> had<00:04:04.550> a<00:04:04.580> higher<00:04:04.880> in<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
properly now if you had a higher in the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.870 
properly now if you had a higher in the
normal<00:04:05.480> resistance<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:07.370> could<00:04:07.550> be<00:04:07.640> caused

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
normal resistance that could be caused

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.960 
normal resistance that could be caused
by<00:04:09.610> corrosion<00:04:10.610> on<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.820> terminals<00:04:12.910> may<00:04:13.910> be

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
by corrosion on the terminals may be

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.520 
by corrosion on the terminals may be
some<00:04:14.150> type<00:04:14.330> of<00:04:14.360> corrosion<00:04:14.690> inside<00:04:15.170> the<00:04:15.290> coil

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
some type of corrosion inside the coil

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.300 
some type of corrosion inside the coil
wire<00:04:16.870> basically<00:04:17.870> either<00:04:18.290> way<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:19.010> don't<00:04:19.160> want

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
wire basically either way you don't want

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.830 
wire basically either way you don't want
to<00:04:19.370> have<00:04:19.520> too<00:04:19.820> low<00:04:19.940> resistance<00:04:20.450> or<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:20.690> higher

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
to have too low resistance or to higher

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.580 
to have too low resistance or to higher
resistance<00:04:21.430> fuel<00:04:22.430> injectors<00:04:22.820> are<00:04:22.970> pretty

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
resistance fuel injectors are pretty

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.200 
resistance fuel injectors are pretty
pretty

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.680 

what<00:04:27.720> I<00:04:27.960> want<00:04:28.259> to<00:04:28.319> say<00:04:28.440> pretty<00:04:28.970> sensitive<00:04:29.970> to

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
what I want to say pretty sensitive to

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.540 
what I want to say pretty sensitive to
resistances<00:04:31.229> so<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:32.190> want<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.400> have<00:04:32.490> them

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
resistances so you want to have them

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.850 
resistances so you want to have them
close<00:04:32.699> to<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.030> inspect<00:04:33.419> and<00:04:33.600> all<00:04:34.470> your<00:04:34.650> fuel

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
close to and inspect and all your fuel

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.370 
close to and inspect and all your fuel
injectors<00:04:35.270> generally<00:04:36.270> be<00:04:36.449> within<00:04:36.630> 2<00:04:37.080> ohms<00:04:37.259> of

injectors generally be within 2 ohms of
each<00:04:37.530> other<00:04:37.880> and<00:04:39.919> this<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:40.979> a<00:04:41.099> good<00:04:41.310> check<00:04:41.550> on

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
each other and this is a good check on

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.260 
each other and this is a good check on
f-body<00:04:42.569> cars<00:04:42.870> because<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.979> GM<00:04:44.370> multi

f-body cars because the GM multi

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.240 
f-body cars because the GM multi
injectors<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.349> came<00:04:46.500> with<00:04:46.620> these<00:04:46.740> cars<00:04:46.979> are

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
injectors that came with these cars are

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.450 
injectors that came with these cars are
known<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.699> fail<00:04:48.199> so<00:04:49.199> that's<00:04:49.770> how<00:04:50.190> you<00:04:50.250> do<00:04:50.430> it

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
known to fail so that's how you do it

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.060 
known to fail so that's how you do it
pretty<00:04:50.970> easy
