well<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.440> has<00:00:16.560> about<00:00:16.740> 900<00:00:17.070> years<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:17.820> i<00:00:18.060> think

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
well it has about 900 years now i think

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.349 
well it has about 900 years now i think
either<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.590> thousand<00:00:20.039> or<00:00:20.100> 900<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:21.210> is

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
either one thousand or 900 which is

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.960 
either one thousand or 900 which is
really<00:00:21.600> really<00:00:21.750> good<00:00:22.080> um<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.580> thought<00:00:23.820> I'd

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
do a vending machine as you guys can see

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
do a vending machine as you guys can see
right<00:00:27.330> here<00:00:27.769> daddy<00:00:28.769> worked<00:00:29.039> out<00:00:29.220> really<00:00:29.400> well

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

because I was pressing in there was just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
because I was pressing in there was just
a<00:00:31.260> time<00:00:31.289> delay<00:00:31.850> so<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.910> decided<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> roller

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a time delay so I decided to do a roller

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.510 
a time delay so I decided to do a roller
coaster<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.860> i'll<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.040> show<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.309> the

coaster so i'll just show you the
preview<00:00:35.760> of<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:38.059> ok<00:00:39.059> oh

then<00:01:40.289> you<00:01:40.950> really<00:01:41.190> don't<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.490> how<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.610> play

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
then you really don't know how to play

then you really don't know how to play
Minecraft<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.039> one<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Minecraft at all because it is one of

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.389 
Minecraft at all because it is one of
the<00:01:44.369> simplest<00:01:44.850> things<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.750> do<00:01:45.899> but<00:01:46.890> also<00:01:47.039> teach

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the simplest things to do but also teach

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.580 
the simplest things to do but also teach
it<00:01:47.580> anyways<00:01:47.909> all<00:01:48.720> right<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:49.319> see<00:01:49.470> these

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it anyways all right you see these

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
it anyways all right you see these
powered<00:01:49.979> rails<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:51.030> use<00:01:51.240> these<00:01:51.450> little

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
powered rails you use these little

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
powered rails you use these little
 to<00:01:52.710> generate<00:01:53.100> speed<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.789> when

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
 to generate speed so when

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.719 
 to generate speed so when
you're<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.210> uphill<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:55.080> this<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:56.640> an

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
you're going uphill like this for an

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.969 
you're going uphill like this for an
example<00:01:57.030> let<00:01:57.630> me<00:01:57.750> show<00:01:57.990> you<00:02:00.619> they<00:02:01.619> generate

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
example let me show you they generate

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.520 
example let me show you they generate
speed<00:02:02.310> right<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.299> then<00:02:03.990> when<00:02:04.440> you're

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
speed right there and then when you're

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.380 
speed right there and then when you're
going<00:02:04.679> downhill<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.759> need<00:02:05.909> these<00:02:06.119> little

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
going downhill you need these little

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.260 
going downhill you need these little
faster<00:02:06.959> than<00:02:06.990> normal<00:02:07.259> rails<00:02:07.910> and<00:02:08.910> that's

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
faster than normal rails and that's

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.790 
faster than normal rails and that's
about<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> that's<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
about it that's really all there is to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.530 
about it that's really all there is to
it<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.009> gonna<00:02:11.160> have<00:02:11.340> some<00:02:11.640> redstone<00:02:11.970> torches

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it you gonna have some redstone torches

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.890 
it you gonna have some redstone torches
and<00:02:12.980> um<00:02:14.090> generate<00:02:15.090> generate<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.720> roller

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
and um generate generate the roller

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.890 
and um generate generate the roller
coaster<00:02:16.410> like<00:02:16.709> map<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.580> out<00:02:17.730> like<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.540> did<00:02:18.569> right

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
coaster like map it out like I did right

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.259 
coaster like map it out like I did right

think I shouldn't have done this doesn't
sound<00:02:26.730> much<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.030> much<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.569> tutorial

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
sound much like much of a tutorial

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.380 
sound much like much of a tutorial
because<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.769> so<00:02:28.890> simple<00:02:29.209> but<00:02:30.209> that's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
because it's so simple but that's

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.820 
because it's so simple but that's
basically<00:02:30.569> all<00:02:30.870> there<00:02:30.989> is<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> hear<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.680> need

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
basically all there is to hear you need

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.210 
basically all there is to hear you need
some<00:02:32.129> rails<00:02:32.400> some<00:02:32.910> Reds<00:02:33.120> awesome<00:02:33.660> power<00:02:33.870> rails

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
some rails some Reds awesome power rails

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.220 
some rails some Reds awesome power rails
some<00:02:35.220> redstone<00:02:35.400> torches<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.330> some<00:02:36.870> stone

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
some redstone torches and some stone

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.790 
some redstone torches and some stone
dirt<00:02:37.830> or<00:02:38.190> whatever<00:02:38.849> else<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.239> can<00:02:39.530> build<00:02:40.530> with

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
dirt or whatever else you can build with

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.030 
dirt or whatever else you can build with
and<00:02:41.180> that's<00:02:42.180> about<00:02:42.300> all<00:02:42.599> there<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.019> to<00:02:43.440> it<00:02:43.470> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
and that's about all there is to it so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.839 
and that's about all there is to it so
I'm<00:02:44.099> gonna<00:02:44.190> show<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.670> more<00:02:44.849> time<00:02:46.849> all

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
I'm gonna show it one more time all

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.330 
I'm gonna show it one more time all
right<00:02:47.940> give<00:02:48.269> it<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.420> little<00:02:48.599> push<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.220> here<00:02:50.220> it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
right give it a little push and here it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.880 
right give it a little push and here it
is<00:02:50.400> underground<00:02:50.909> I<00:02:51.239> have<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.450> dig<00:02:51.690> all<00:02:52.290> around

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
is underground I have to dig all around

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.430 
is underground I have to dig all around
here<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.519> as<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:54.780> I'm<00:02:55.019> going<00:02:55.319> uphill

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
here and as you can see I'm going uphill

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.369 
here and as you can see I'm going uphill
I'm<00:02:55.739> using<00:02:55.920> some<00:02:56.159> powered<00:02:56.519> rails<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:58.019> generate

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
I'm using some powered rails to generate

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.259 
I'm using some powered rails to generate
speed<00:03:00.980> still<00:03:01.980> using<00:03:02.250> power<00:03:02.430> drills<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.000> I'm

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
speed still using power drills and I'm

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.000 
speed still using power drills and I'm
just<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.540> normal<00:03:04.080> and<00:03:04.290> then<00:03:04.709> you<00:03:04.769> see<00:03:04.890> when

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
just going normal and then you see when

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.470 
just going normal and then you see when
you<00:03:05.129> zigzag<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.819> don't<00:03:05.940> need<00:03:06.030> power<00:03:06.300> wheels

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you zigzag you don't need power wheels

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.270 
you zigzag you don't need power wheels
you<00:03:06.599> can<00:03:06.629> use<00:03:06.900> normal<00:03:07.349> rails<00:03:07.590> cuz<00:03:07.890> it's<00:03:08.129> just

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
you can use normal rails cuz it's just

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.289 
you can use normal rails cuz it's just
generating<00:03:08.760> speed<00:03:09.090> by<00:03:09.269> itself<00:03:09.629> um<00:03:11.269> exactly<00:03:12.269> i

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
generating speed by itself um exactly i

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.780 
generating speed by itself um exactly i
said<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:12.989> it's<00:03:13.349> not<00:03:13.439> much<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.829> tutorial<00:03:14.129> so

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
said it it's not much of a tutorial so

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
said it it's not much of a tutorial so
simple<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
simple and you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.559 
simple and you
can<00:03:17.129> see<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> dropped<00:03:17.730> right<00:03:18.000> there<00:03:18.239> it<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.540> a

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
can see I dropped right there it was a

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.809 
can see I dropped right there it was a
downhill<00:03:18.870> drop<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.129> was<00:03:20.250> still<00:03:20.489> going<00:03:20.640> down

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
downhill drop so it was still going down

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.550 
downhill drop so it was still going down
with<00:03:21.720> no<00:03:21.840> powered<00:03:22.170> rails<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:24.140> again<00:03:25.140> the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
with no powered rails and again the

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.320 
with no powered rails and again the
power<00:03:25.800> it's<00:03:26.099> all<00:03:26.250> about<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.610> power<00:03:26.760> drill<00:03:27.090> so

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
power it's all about the power drill so

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.490 
power it's all about the power drill so
if<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.480> don't<00:03:27.569> have<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> power<00:03:28.019> rails<00:03:28.319> you

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
if you don't have the power rails you

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.650 
if you don't have the power rails you
can't<00:03:28.739> make<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.920> roller<00:03:29.190> coaster<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.480> don't

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
can't make a roller coaster if you don't

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.089 
can't make a roller coaster if you don't
have<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.900> redstone<00:03:31.260> torches<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.800> can't<00:03:32.010> make

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
have the redstone torches you can't make

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.479 
have the redstone torches you can't make
a<00:03:32.160> roller<00:03:32.430> coaster<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.180> every<00:03:33.390> 15<00:03:33.750> blocks<00:03:34.050> or

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.009 
a roller coaster see every 15 blocks or
less<00:03:35.489> than<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.880> there's<00:03:36.660> some<00:03:36.870> redstone

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
less than that there's some redstone

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.100 
less than that there's some redstone
