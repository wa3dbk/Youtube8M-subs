00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.420
 good morning I'm luca wanting a naturopath 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.760
 today I will explain to you how to eat 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 carbohydrates without getting fat on those who have it 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.750
 said that to lose weight and keep a 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.850
 good weight control we must 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.430
 eliminate carbohydrates as they suggest 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.260
 Diets too fashion and involving 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.449
 to reduce drastically or even 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.130
 to cut them completely eat must be 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.960
 still a pleasure 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.320
 the first advice is to choose i 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.960
 just carbohydrates replaced cereals 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.050
 refined or white carbohydrates with i 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.850
 their integral bread dough 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.579
 flour and all baked goods 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.739
 eat refined carbohydrates indeed 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.540
 causes a sharp rise in the 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.760
 blood sugar or sugars in the 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.829
 blood and the equally rapid intervention 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 of a hormone the insulin that there 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.120
 stores in the form of fat 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.250
 vice versa, whole grains thanks 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.469
 to the fibers they contain slow down 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.659
 sugar absorption causes 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.880
 lower blood sugar elevations e 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.389
 give you a more lasting sense of 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.249
 satiety 

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:11.529
 the second piece of advice is to eat 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:13.359
 carbohydrates at the right time moment 

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:15.520
 best to eat carbohydrates and 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:17.950
 then in the first part of the day 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.240
 breakfast and lunch from three to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.520
 four in the afternoon 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.289
 give up carbohydrates because why 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.779
 in the first part of the day they are 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.670
 the hormones linked to are high 

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:29.619
 consumption those that make you use i 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.569
 carbohydrates as an energy source 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.609
 vice versa in the second part of the 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.009
 day especially in the evening and even more 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:38.590
 at night our body is oriented 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.999
 to care what it means that if 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.249
 we eat a plate of pasta a 

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:43.899
 noon we use it to the maximum 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:47.169
 as a source of energy as fuel 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.239
 in the evening we will inevitably meet again 

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:51.160
 with those carbohydrates that will end up below 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:54.530
 form of fat on thighs 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.470
 third last fundamental advice not 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.140
 eat carbohydrates alone so no 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 to snack the crackers or a small pizza with 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.460
 the focaccia in a better way to eat 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.770
 carbohydrates without getting hurt and 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.340
 match them to an equivalent source 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.580
 protein pasta with meat, rice and fish 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.980
 eggs and bread and so on in proportions 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.410
 visually equivalent consumption of 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.080
 proteins along with low carbohydrates 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.840
 glycemic index of the latter or 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.730
 the speed with which the nasdaq nice mia e 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.280
 also promotes the secretion of a 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.040
 insulin antagonist hormone yes 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.720
 call glucagon the result will be more 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.430
 simple for the body to use i 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.650
 carbohydrates as an energy source 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.010
 instead of accumulating them very well i 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.010
 bearings
