 keep tears that you can do that yes 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.849

 a thick line across the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.730
 task sheet and write down only 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.820
 God alone knows the answer to this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.079
 it could be 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:15.880
 what is that a sponge 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.090
 human was okay take your hand 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.670
 Out on Marie feels a swam out 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 a sponge in reality it is one 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.000
 stone 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.409
 ann-marie likes to grow windows or 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.110
 you sometimes need the window 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.720
 pursue 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:47.180
 That's why anyone can become a teacher 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.770
 you drove a taxi, that's you 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.510
 you can deal with people you will 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.040
 to take 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.140
 you do not know what you live with yours 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.030
 you should start zero bock on 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.720
 not great the students you too 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.810
 Teacher and you can not sit still 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.930

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.869
 sports teacher and if and when yours 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:11.090
 political career falters if that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:18.080
 you can always live evil to you 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:19.910
 even school leaders will towels pink 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.200
 Towels remind me a bit 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.650
 my biology in Fraham they had 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.430
 came dearest old rose worn 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.980
 probably someone had said that 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.709
 makes her younger 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.239
 her name was actually woman but then came 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.810
 she married you there 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.549
 So you at home and always hung like that 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:47.540
 so had to hang on the neck so fold 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:50.120
 down kennedy so decided and 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.489
 so rather good reason why 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.620
 we always called when they were 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.920
 from afar things respect the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.920
 Turkey 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.050

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.560
 so dear student today is the day of 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.560

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.320
 I could have learned quite relaxed 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.340
 recline 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:32.270
 all others will be a fair 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270
 punishment 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:43.260
 Since 1973 there are German schools 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:45.410
 no more spanking and that's good 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.890
 so 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.720
 also children have rights 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.700

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.700
