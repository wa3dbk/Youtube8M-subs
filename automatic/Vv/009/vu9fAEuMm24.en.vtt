00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.710
 good girls as you can see is a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:11.120
 Well, hacker , look like 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 even spoil din here 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.760
 and I'm going to turn it all into one 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.359
 dresser and we'll take it off 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 well here you want to see this one here and this 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.410
 part that brings only one piece that goes 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.970
 leave only this part up here as 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.890
 if it was a drawer 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.380
 So you're going to take this match here because 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.320
 this right here just by taking up space 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.200
 then we will modify it all and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 then we'll take this part and 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.590
 Paint there then I 'll show you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.059
 You girls and you became rock 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.690
 after the change we made 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.700
 in her 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.610
 we took it as I told you it is 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.449
 this is the table that is on the 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.219
 side from here we get it from here 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.070
 and then here because I had a little 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.960
 space and ink you will use will 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.840
 be the one that belongs to wood and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.460
 water drag mix in the middle and so 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.760
 Let's finish painting, I'll be right back. 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 with the girl with you and the first hand of 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.909
 ink girls stayed so look you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.640
 have to pass the ink all over yet 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.619
 expect to dry this paint and then 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
 two hours back with another ink hand 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.270
 You see, that way she was spoiled. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 Look at these little booze here. 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 enough ink in this area here and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.020
 then I'm going to the second hand and back 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.970
 for you to see how you're going to stay with 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.920
 second hand girls ink stayed 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 so look how you can kiss everything 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.360
 White is it looks you see it did not have 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.090
 need to paint but only how 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.850
 she was my whole road like that 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 A few bucks I decided to paint. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.420
 because in addition it will save more goes 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.860
 make it what it is with the most 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.560
 also refuses to leave the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.540
 works that I can leave but I'll 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.009
 that the dry ink has to leave with 36 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.920
 hours and kanu 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.739
 I'll pass the pink contact paper 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.680
 it all just might not answer that 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:17.290
 not because I'm going to leave him white 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.640
 girls are staying like this and then in 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.579
 time to start with paper contact 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.340
 Lunch for you, it's a girl, we'll go. 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.079
 use this compact paper here it is pink 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.390
 you can choose how you 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.629
 want to stay preferential and we will 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.639
 cover all hockey or our 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:37.420
 dresser with this sheet of paper 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:39.909
 contact here we are already here 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.319
 taking measurements from the paper and the rack 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.329
 It's all like that and we 're takin ' away. 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.489
 straight gives love 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:51.700
 There I was going to take the measure we are 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.530
 seeing we marked it that way we see 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.870
 right now we're cutting 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:01.209
 thus overcoming barriers 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.040
 the materials we are using are 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.959
 a ruler to measure the scissors 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.030
 cut the paper this is a pencil 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.889
 White eye, we're cutting to 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.959
 people make the measurements are getting 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.969
 So look how you see that you have a 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.900
 finish here as rounded was fine 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.829
 It's difficult to do the one that went well. 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:20.109
 work and getting people look and 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.530
 team in the first half and we will 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:27.099
 however, and then at the time you have 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.629
 finalized I'll show you here - 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.669
 How's it going? We've already gone. 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.720
 contact with a draw in this part is 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:35.769
 Yes 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.859
 and here I got here and we're going 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:41.799

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.720
 Look, I 'm just filming for you. 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.060

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.239

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.310
 even shoot and help him so I go 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:57.180
 to show you slowly the sea of 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.180
 mother's day 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.710
 the Queen 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:22.019
 Almost ready, just a little bit 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:29.760

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:34.430
 People there are just beautiful a little bit 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.430
 osman hdg plate 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.150
 firecrackers after it all finished 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.250
 result of it is that I left that 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.120
 white background does not look like it has a background 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.770
 nor but here is her background 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.630
 and stayed so remember that spoiling 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.770
 dinho that had to look with low to 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:00.410
 People are a little guy, look at that neighbor. 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.470
 the turn of suit or zhao had on top of 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.770
 silk wood by her looks very good 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.480
 cool was it look you see above us 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.410
 He did everything dinho even though here 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:16.190
 result of it exactly the way it 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:19.190
 I wanted to and was was not working with 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.480
 I wished for clothes and I was only very 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.820
 satisfied with the result 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.520
 and I was the pressure explained power because 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.630
 Look but I'll still see right because 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.310
 They think it is very expensive and that was it - 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.230
 so I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.820
 Tip of how to transform an old furniture 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.380
 used on a dressing table without 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.310
 spend a lot because I honestly do not 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.350
 I spent a lot 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.090
 I used only four meters and 60 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.420
 five meters of paper with 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:51.980
 And the ink because I painted it for 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.750
 look for more furniture because he was 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.290
 everything loses goals and you all spoiled 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.850
 underneath then, old lady with the 

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.920
 dye will keep the wood going 

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.750
 keep the furniture and it will last a long time. 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.430
 time and paper contact experience 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.750
 It started one day too, John, I can. 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.340
 to exchange then I ended up optional as well and it is 

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.840
 I hope you have 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.500
 I like to like my 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:19.120
 dresser now I'm going to smoke weed and 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.120
 shawn until the next video
