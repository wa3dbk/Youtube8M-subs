properly and also give you a little
background<00:00:10.440> information<00:00:10.860> on<00:00:11.190> tire<00:00:11.460> pressure

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
background information on tire pressure

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.850 
background information on tire pressure
monitoring<00:00:12.240> system<00:00:12.360> now<00:00:12.960> let's<00:00:13.170> get<00:00:13.320> started

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
monitoring system now let's get started

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.589 
monitoring system now let's get started
now<00:00:14.070> for<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.429> Ford<00:00:14.700> Fiesta<00:00:15.240> we're<00:00:15.420> going<00:00:15.540> to

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
now for this Ford Fiesta we're going to

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.420 
now for this Ford Fiesta we're going to
find<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.929> tire<00:00:16.109> pressures<00:00:16.560> right<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
find the tire pressures right in the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.599 
find the tire pressures right in the
door<00:00:17.609> jamb<00:00:18.890> you<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.279> gives<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
door jamb you can see it gives you the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
door jamb you can see it gives you the
front<00:00:20.910> rear<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.449> spare<00:00:21.779> tire<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.680> spare<00:00:22.949> tire

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
front rear and spare tire the spare tire

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.290 
front rear and spare tire the spare tire
isn't<00:00:23.369> connected<00:00:23.820> at<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> low<00:00:24.119> pressure

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
isn't connected at a low pressure

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.210 
isn't connected at a low pressure
monitoring<00:00:24.840> system<00:00:25.230> so<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.070> need<00:00:26.160> to

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
monitoring system so we just need to

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.589 
monitoring system so we just need to
look<00:00:26.310> at<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.550> front<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:26.939> rear<00:00:27.060> tires<00:00:27.269> and

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
look at the front and rear tires and

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.349 
look at the front and rear tires and
they<00:00:27.689> should<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.930> 32<00:00:28.470> psi<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:29.939> makes<00:00:30.179> and

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
they should be 32 psi for some makes and

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.790 
they should be 32 psi for some makes and
models<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.929> nice<00:00:31.140> setup<00:00:31.439> where<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
models you have a nice setup where you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.440 
models you have a nice setup where you
can<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> tire<00:00:32.369> pressure<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.940> each<00:00:33.090> tire

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
can see the tire pressure for each tire

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
can see the tire pressure for each tire
on<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> display<00:00:34.260> if<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.710> don't<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
on a display if you don't have a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.470 
on a display if you don't have a
displace<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.670> make<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.030> models<00:00:36.300> actually

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
displace some make some models actually

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.510 
displace some make some models actually
just<00:00:36.809> tell<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.140> which<00:00:37.320> tire<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.770> low<00:00:38.010> but<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
just tell you which tire is low but in

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
just tell you which tire is low but in
my<00:00:38.670> case<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.329> many<00:00:39.510> cases<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.200> just

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
my case and in many cases it's just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.450 
my case and in many cases it's just
going<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> let<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.860> one<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
going to let you know that one of the

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to let you know that one of the
tires<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> have<00:00:42.149> has<00:00:42.450> low<00:00:42.750> tire

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
tires that you have has low tire

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.360 
tires that you have has low tire
pressure<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.950> figure<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> out

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
pressure so you have to figure it out

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.920 
pressure so you have to figure it out
for<00:00:44.430> yourself<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.360> want<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> check<00:00:45.750> your

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
for yourself so you want to check your

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
for yourself so you want to check your
owner's<00:00:46.200> manual<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.309> solid

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
owner's manual and see what the solid

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
owner's manual and see what the solid
light<00:00:47.940> means<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.510> most<00:00:48.989> situations<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.800> solid

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
light means in most situations the solid

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.410 
light means in most situations the solid
light<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.550> mean<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.879> your<00:00:51.030> tires<00:00:51.239> are

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
light will mean that your tires are

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
light will mean that your tires are
under-inflated<00:00:51.890> now<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.280> light<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
under-inflated now if your light is

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.790 
under-inflated now if your light is
flashing<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.960> could<00:00:55.170> mean<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.320> you're<00:00:55.590> using

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
flashing it could mean that you're using

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.889 
flashing it could mean that you're using
your<00:00:56.039> spare<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.640> there's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.149> malfunction<00:00:57.300> in

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
your spare or there's a malfunction in

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.869 
your spare or there's a malfunction in
the<00:00:58.109> tire<00:00:58.289> pressure<00:00:58.559> monitoring<00:00:59.010> system<00:00:59.129> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the tire pressure monitoring system so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.459 
the tire pressure monitoring system so
the<00:01:00.000> lights<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.480> go<00:01:00.570> off<00:01:00.750> when<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> tire

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the lights going to go off when the tire

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.729 
the lights going to go off when the tire
pressure<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> 25%<00:01:02.969> low<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.290> 1<00:01:04.500> or<00:01:04.619> 2

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pressure is 25% low so if you're 1 or 2

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.100 
pressure is 25% low so if you're 1 or 2
psi<00:01:05.129> below<00:01:05.489> your<00:01:05.700> level<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.210> might<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.750> go<00:01:06.900> off

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
psi below your level it might not go off

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.289 
psi below your level it might not go off
but<00:01:07.439> once<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:07.680> go<00:01:07.799> around<00:01:07.830> five<00:01:08.369> or<00:01:08.400> more<00:01:08.880> psi

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but once you go around five or more psi

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.240 
but once you go around five or more psi
below<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.140> recommended<00:01:10.680> pressure<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.159> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
below the recommended pressure of your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
below the recommended pressure of your
tires<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.030> lights<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> go<00:01:12.570> off

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
tires the lights going to go off

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.260 
tires the lights going to go off
definitely<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> neat<00:01:13.860> safety<00:01:14.250> feature<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
definitely a neat safety feature so the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
definitely a neat safety feature so the
first<00:01:15.479> thing<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> do<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.350> you

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
first thing you're going to do is you

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.960 
first thing you're going to do is you
can<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.799> visually<00:01:17.100> inspect<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> tires<00:01:17.759> to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
can just visually inspect the tires to

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.640 
can just visually inspect the tires to
see<00:01:18.119> if<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.330> any<00:01:18.509> obviously<00:01:19.170> low<00:01:19.350> tires

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
see if there's any obviously low tires

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
see if there's any obviously low tires
so<00:01:20.130> there's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> front<00:01:20.580> one<00:01:20.820> can't<00:01:21.240> really

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so there's the front one can't really

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.200 
so there's the front one can't really
tell<00:01:21.659> there's<00:01:21.900> nothing<00:01:22.259> evident<00:01:23.040> there<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:24.090> go

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
tell there's nothing evident there we go

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.399 
tell there's nothing evident there we go
to<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.450> rear<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:25.549> can't<00:01:26.549> really<00:01:26.729> tell<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
to the rear here can't really tell here

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.069 
to the rear here can't really tell here
and<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.470> cross<00:01:28.710> over<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> back<00:01:29.840> that<00:01:30.840> rear

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
and we cross over to the back that rear

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.180 
and we cross over to the back that rear
tire<00:01:31.170> doesn't<00:01:31.560> look<00:01:31.799> bad

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.330 

and<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.910> one<00:01:36.090> looks<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.480> bit<00:01:36.960> low<00:01:37.340> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and that one looks a little bit low so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.710 
and that one looks a little bit low so
yesterday<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.970> temperature<00:01:39.300> was<00:01:39.420> 80<00:01:39.600> degrees

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
yesterday the temperature was 80 degrees

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.500 
yesterday the temperature was 80 degrees
today<00:01:40.350> it's<00:01:40.800> 60<00:01:41.310> degrees<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.910> at<00:01:42.060> night<00:01:42.300> it

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
today it's 60 degrees and at night it

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.020 
today it's 60 degrees and at night it
could<00:01:42.630> get<00:01:42.810> low<00:01:43.080> into<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.470> 40s<00:01:43.980> so<00:01:44.700> right<00:01:44.880> now

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
could get low into the 40s so right now

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.150 
could get low into the 40s so right now
in<00:01:45.120> a<00:01:45.150> fall<00:01:45.360> season<00:01:45.750> where<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> am<00:01:46.590> could<00:01:46.950> get<00:01:47.070> up

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
in a fall season where I am could get up

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.310 
in a fall season where I am could get up
to<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.310> 40<00:01:47.670> degree<00:01:47.760> temperature<00:01:48.330> swing<00:01:48.600> every

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
to a 40 degree temperature swing every

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.080 
to a 40 degree temperature swing every
10<00:01:49.530> degrees<00:01:49.800> Fahrenheit<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.400> could<00:01:50.550> get<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> 1

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
10 degrees Fahrenheit you could get a 1

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 
10 degrees Fahrenheit you could get a 1
psi<00:01:51.630> increase<00:01:52.380> or<00:01:52.560> decrease<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.310> if<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
psi increase or decrease so if the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.490 
psi increase or decrease so if the
temperature<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.970> increasing<00:01:54.390> 10<00:01:54.870> degrees<00:01:55.200> you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
temperature is increasing 10 degrees you

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.140 
temperature is increasing 10 degrees you
could<00:01:55.650> get<00:01:55.800> an<00:01:55.890> increase<00:01:56.310> in<00:01:56.460> pressure<00:01:56.640> by<00:01:56.940> 1

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
could get an increase in pressure by 1

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.240 
could get an increase in pressure by 1
psi<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.320> there's<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.590> decrease<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:58.980> 10

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
psi and if there's a decrease in 10

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.320 
psi and if there's a decrease in 10
degrees<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.640> get<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.850> pressure<00:02:00.090> that's

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
degrees you get a pressure that's

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.420 
degrees you get a pressure that's
lowered<00:02:00.690> by<00:02:00.810> 1<00:02:01.020> psi<00:02:01.410> we<00:02:02.010> want<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.220> use<00:02:02.310> an

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
lowered by 1 psi we want to use an

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.370 
lowered by 1 psi we want to use an
accurate<00:02:02.850> pressure<00:02:03.060> reader<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.900> that<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.140> get

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
accurate pressure reader so that we get

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.140 
accurate pressure reader so that we get
a<00:02:04.440> good<00:02:04.530> reading<00:02:04.950> on<00:02:05.190> this<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.760> car<00:02:05.970> has<00:02:06.060> been

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
a good reading on this the car has been

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.520 
a good reading on this the car has been
sitting<00:02:06.330> for<00:02:06.480> about<00:02:06.810> an<00:02:06.900> hour<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.410> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
sitting for about an hour so the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.780 
sitting for about an hour so the
temperature<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:07.980> the<00:02:08.070> tire<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.429> around<00:02:08.670> the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
temperature of the tire is around the

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.639 
temperature of the tire is around the
ambient<00:02:09.210> temperature<00:02:09.330> if<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.200> do<00:02:10.320> this<00:02:10.470> when

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
ambient temperature if you do this when

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.320 
ambient temperature if you do this when
the<00:02:10.740> tire<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.070> warm<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.820> might<00:02:12.000> have<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> little

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
the tire is warm you might have a little

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.940 
the tire is warm you might have a little
bit<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.600> an<00:02:12.690> increase<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.170> pressure<00:02:13.380> because

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
bit of an increase in pressure because

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.320 
bit of an increase in pressure because
as<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.280> drive<00:02:14.490> there's<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> rotational

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
as you drive there's a rotational

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.730 
as you drive there's a rotational
friction<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.810> all<00:02:15.900> that<00:02:16.020> stuff<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.500> brakes

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
friction and all that stuff the brakes

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.260 
friction and all that stuff the brakes
are<00:02:16.920> hot<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.610> could<00:02:17.700> actually<00:02:17.730> increase

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
are hot and it could actually increase

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.270 
are hot and it could actually increase
the<00:02:18.420> temperature<00:02:18.660> right<00:02:19.500> now<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.710> let<00:02:19.950> it<00:02:20.100> sit

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
the temperature right now we let it sit

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.920 
the temperature right now we let it sit
for<00:02:20.310> an<00:02:20.520> hour<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.270> now<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.450> could<00:02:21.630> get<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> really

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
for an hour so now we could get a really

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.400 
for an hour so now we could get a really
good<00:02:22.110> reading<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:25.190> there's<00:02:26.190> our<00:02:26.460> beds<00:02:26.940> are<00:02:27.410> 27

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
good reading and there's our beds are 27

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.920 
good reading and there's our beds are 27
psi<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.580> needs<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.820> be<00:02:29.910> cranked<00:02:30.210> up<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.360> 32

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
psi so this needs to be cranked up to 32

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
psi so this needs to be cranked up to 32
for<00:02:31.650> good<00:02:31.830> measure<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.430> worth<00:02:32.610> it<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.880> check

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
for good measure it's worth it to check

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.430 
for good measure it's worth it to check
the<00:02:33.210> other<00:02:33.390> tires<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.020> only<00:02:34.140> takes<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.410> few

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the other tires and only takes a few

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.750 
the other tires and only takes a few
seconds<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.010> already<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> tire<00:02:35.580> gauge

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
seconds you already have the tire gauge

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.620 
seconds you already have the tire gauge
out<00:02:36.030> might<00:02:36.300> as<00:02:36.450> well<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:39.180> good<00:02:39.360> thing<00:02:39.510> we

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
out might as well so good thing we

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.880 
out might as well so good thing we
checked<00:02:39.900> although<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.290> doesn't<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.650> at<00:02:40.770> this

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
checked although it doesn't look at this

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.310 
checked although it doesn't look at this
is<00:02:41.040> 27<00:02:41.580> psi<00:02:41.910> as<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.810> driver's<00:02:43.170> side

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
is 27 psi as well with the driver's side

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.100 
is 27 psi as well with the driver's side
rear<00:02:43.560> tire<00:02:43.830> see<00:02:44.520> what<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.790> one's<00:02:45.030> up<00:02:48.110> this

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
rear tire see what this one's up this

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.860 
rear tire see what this one's up this
one<00:02:49.350> we're<00:02:49.530> at<00:02:49.680> 26<00:02:50.040> psi<00:02:50.640> so<00:02:51.120> again<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.660> can't

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
one we're at 26 psi so again you can't

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.510 
one we're at 26 psi so again you can't
even<00:02:52.020> tell<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.800> actually<00:02:53.070> needs<00:02:53.220> air

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
even tell but it actually needs air

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.400 
even tell but it actually needs air
remember<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.330> screw<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.690> your<00:02:54.720> caps<00:02:55.050> just<00:02:55.320> a

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
remember to screw on your caps just a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.720 
remember to screw on your caps just a
little<00:02:55.650> bit<00:02:55.770> so<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.010> lose<00:02:56.280> them<00:02:56.310> that's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
little bit so you don't lose them that's

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.090 
little bit so you don't lose them that's
a<00:02:56.850> good<00:02:57.030> little<00:02:57.270> tip<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.530> last<00:02:58.739> tire<00:02:58.980> is

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
a good little tip and the last tire is

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.150 
a good little tip and the last tire is
the<00:02:59.130> driver's<00:02:59.580> side<00:02:59.730> front<00:03:00.030> tire<00:03:03.440> 27<00:03:04.440> psi<00:03:04.830> so

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
the driver's side front tire 27 psi so

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.310 
the driver's side front tire 27 psi so
all<00:03:05.400> four<00:03:05.820> tires<00:03:06.090> need<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.750> get<00:03:06.900> pumped<00:03:07.110> up

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
all four tires need to get pumped up

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.320 
all four tires need to get pumped up
good<00:03:07.800> thing<00:03:07.980> we<00:03:08.070> checked<00:03:08.310> all<00:03:08.459> four<00:03:08.730> so

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
good thing we checked all four so

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.970 
good thing we checked all four so
luckily<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.690> own<00:03:09.900> my<00:03:10.080> own<00:03:10.110> compressor<00:03:10.530> so<00:03:10.950> I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
luckily I own my own compressor so I

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.380 
luckily I own my own compressor so I
have<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.280> adapter<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.880> will<00:03:12.000> connect<00:03:12.300> to

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
have this adapter that will connect to

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:21.310 
have this adapter that will connect to
the<00:03:12.480> tires

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.510 

after<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.410> give<00:03:22.590> it<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.770> few<00:03:22.950> pumps<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.340> air

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
after you give it a few pumps of air

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.390 
after you give it a few pumps of air
just<00:03:23.790> check<00:03:24.360> your<00:03:24.510> tire<00:03:24.660> pressure<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.280> we<00:03:26.370> can

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
just check your tire pressure and we can

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.610 
just check your tire pressure and we can
see<00:03:26.730> we're<00:03:26.970> at<00:03:27.060> thirty<00:03:27.390> four<00:03:27.810> point<00:03:28.110> five<00:03:28.290> it

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
see we're at thirty four point five it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.610 
see we're at thirty four point five it
has<00:03:28.710> to<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:28.950> 32<00:03:29.460> so<00:03:30.210> then<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.450> could<00:03:30.540> just<00:03:30.620> let

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
has to be 32 so then you could just let

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.770 
has to be 32 so then you could just let
some<00:03:31.800> air<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.450> check<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.570> tire<00:03:33.750> pressure

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
some air out check the tire pressure

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.820 
some air out check the tire pressure
again<00:03:35.720> 33<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.870> half<00:03:36.900> we're<00:03:37.530> gonna<00:03:37.650> have<00:03:37.770> a

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
again 33 and a half we're gonna have a

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.300 
again 33 and a half we're gonna have a
little<00:03:38.010> little<00:03:38.130> more<00:03:38.340> out<00:03:39.980> check<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.070> one<00:03:41.190> more

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
little little more out check it one more

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.060 
little little more out check it one more
time<00:03:42.260> I'm<00:03:43.260> going<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.470> keep<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.650> at<00:03:43.710> thirty<00:03:43.890> two

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
time I'm going to keep it at thirty two

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.350 
time I'm going to keep it at thirty two
point<00:03:44.250> five<00:03:44.430> because<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.790> are<00:03:44.910> dropping<00:03:45.180> in

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
point five because we are dropping in

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.470 
point five because we are dropping in
temperature<00:03:45.810> decent<00:03:46.290> amount<00:03:46.530> every<00:03:46.800> day<00:03:47.010> and

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
temperature decent amount every day and

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.000 
temperature decent amount every day and
that<00:03:48.480> should<00:03:48.630> be<00:03:48.690> perfect<00:03:48.870> now<00:03:49.740> I<00:03:49.770> don't<00:03:49.860> need

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
that should be perfect now I don't need

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.890 
that should be perfect now I don't need
to<00:03:50.100> show<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:50.310> how<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.490> inflate<00:03:51.000> each<00:03:51.210> tire<00:03:51.510> so

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
to show you how to inflate each tire so

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.420 
to show you how to inflate each tire so
I'll<00:03:52.230> go<00:03:52.500> and<00:03:52.590> flate<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.890> tires<00:03:53.100> and<00:03:53.280> it'll

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
I'll go and flate the tires and it'll

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.220 
I'll go and flate the tires and it'll
check<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:53.730> see<00:03:53.880> if<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.060> shuts<00:03:54.330> off<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.750> check

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
check to see if that shuts off the check

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.650 
check to see if that shuts off the check
tire<00:03:55.410> pressure<00:03:55.440> light<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:56.940> all<00:03:57.120> four<00:03:57.360> tires

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
tire pressure light with all four tires

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.360 
tire pressure light with all four tires
inflated<00:03:58.080> let's<00:03:58.560> see<00:03:58.710> if<00:03:58.770> that<00:03:58.920> tire<00:03:59.160> light

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
inflated let's see if that tire light

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.520 
inflated let's see if that tire light
goes<00:03:59.610> off<00:03:59.870> here's<00:04:00.870> what<00:04:01.050> we<00:04:01.140> want<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.410> know

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
goes off here's what we want to know

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.260 
goes off here's what we want to know
right<00:04:01.920> before<00:04:02.040> we<00:04:02.340> go<00:04:02.430> for<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.700> test<00:04:02.910> drive<00:04:02.970> to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
right before we go for a test drive to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.730 
right before we go for a test drive to
make<00:04:03.360> sure<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> lights<00:04:03.810> off<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:04.230> says<00:04:04.680> you

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:04.740 
make sure the lights off it says you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.560 
make sure the lights off it says you
have<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.890> drive<00:04:05.160> for<00:04:05.370> two<00:04:05.520> minutes<00:04:05.880> over<00:04:06.030> 20

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
have to drive for two minutes over 20

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.030 
have to drive for two minutes over 20
miles<00:04:06.750> per<00:04:06.840> hour<00:04:06.960> and<00:04:07.380> that's<00:04:07.620> how<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.860> tire

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
miles per hour and that's how the tire

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.770 
miles per hour and that's how the tire
pressure<00:04:08.280> monitoring<00:04:08.670> system<00:04:08.760> knows<00:04:09.240> that<00:04:09.270> it

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
pressure monitoring system knows that it

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.210 
pressure monitoring system knows that it
has<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.080> correct<00:04:10.200> pressure<00:04:10.620> in<00:04:10.830> there<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.130> the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
has the correct pressure in there so the

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.980 
has the correct pressure in there so the
light<00:04:11.400> won't<00:04:11.640> go<00:04:11.790> off<00:04:12.000> until<00:04:12.420> you're<00:04:12.540> going<00:04:12.720> 20

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
light won't go off until you're going 20

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.020 
light won't go off until you're going 20
miles<00:04:13.140> per<00:04:13.230> hour<00:04:13.440> or<00:04:13.710> faster<00:04:14.460> for<00:04:14.820> at<00:04:14.910> least

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
miles per hour or faster for at least

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.430 
miles per hour or faster for at least
two<00:04:15.270> minutes<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.930> gives<00:04:16.140> it<00:04:16.260> time<00:04:16.380> to

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
two minutes that gives it time to

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.930 
two minutes that gives it time to
calibrate<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> check<00:04:17.250> for<00:04:17.280> false<00:04:17.640> pressure

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
calibrate and check for false pressure

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.130 
calibrate and check for false pressure
readings<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.510> all<00:04:18.570> that<00:04:18.720> stuff

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
readings and all that stuff

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.440 
readings and all that stuff
so<00:04:19.560> let's<00:04:19.739> go<00:04:19.859> for<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.160> ride<00:04:20.630> and<00:04:23.450> actually

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
so let's go for that ride and actually

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.520 
so let's go for that ride and actually
we<00:04:24.540> don't<00:04:24.660> even<00:04:24.780> need<00:04:24.900> to<00:04:24.990> go<00:04:25.080> for<00:04:25.290> the<00:04:25.320> ride

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
we don't even need to go for the ride

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.320 
we don't even need to go for the ride
the<00:04:26.430> tire<00:04:26.640> pressure<00:04:26.850> monitoring<00:04:27.240> system

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
the tire pressure monitoring system

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.150 
the tire pressure monitoring system
actually<00:04:27.810> shut<00:04:28.200> off<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.470> my<00:04:28.560> vehicle<00:04:28.950> I<00:04:29.040> don't

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
actually shut off of my vehicle I don't

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250 
actually shut off of my vehicle I don't
even<00:04:29.250> have<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> go<00:04:29.610> for<00:04:29.760> a<00:04:29.790> ride<00:04:30.000> just<00:04:30.270> to

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
even have to go for a ride just to

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.250 
even have to go for a ride just to
double-check<00:04:31.650> let's<00:04:32.070> go<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> systems<00:04:32.790> check

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
double-check let's go to systems check

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.070 
double-check let's go to systems check
and<00:04:34.260> all<00:04:35.070> systems<00:04:35.460> are<00:04:35.669> normal<00:04:36.030> so<00:04:36.810> there<00:04:36.960> you

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
and all systems are normal so there you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.050 
and all systems are normal so there you
go<00:04:37.230> although<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.250> seems<00:04:38.400> like<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.640> simple

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
go although this seems like a simple

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.580 
go although this seems like a simple
thing<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.480> lot<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.810> people<00:04:39.930> don't<00:04:40.260> know<00:04:40.380> how<00:04:40.560> to

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
thing a lot of people don't know how to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.500 
thing a lot of people don't know how to
fill<00:04:40.860> up<00:04:40.980> the<00:04:41.100> tire<00:04:41.310> correctly<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.030> also<00:04:42.390> how

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
fill up the tire correctly and also how
