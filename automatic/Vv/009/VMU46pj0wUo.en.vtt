sugar so if I eat one cookie le2 if I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.110 
sugar so if I eat one cookie le2 if I
eat<00:02:56.900> too<00:02:57.049> only<00:02:57.170> for<00:02:57.560> me<00:02:57.769> for<00:02:58.069> only<00:02:58.190> 88<00:02:58.940> all

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.509 
eat too only for me for only 88 all
these<00:02:59.239> 16<00:02:59.660> we<00:03:00.349> know<00:03:00.470> how<00:03:00.590> we<00:03:00.650> can<00:03:00.799> pick<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.310> if

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
these 16 we know how we can pick and if

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.039 
these 16 we know how we can pick and if
you<00:03:01.610> stand<00:03:01.790> by<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.000> table<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.630> you're

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
you stand by the table and you're

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.860 
you stand by the table and you're
picking<00:03:03.410> you'll<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:04.040> picking<00:03:04.280> all<00:03:04.400> day<00:03:04.519> long

picking you'll be picking all day long
so<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:05.900> would<00:03:06.110> also<00:03:06.230> suggest<00:03:06.500> moving<00:03:07.340> away<00:03:07.610> from

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
so I would also suggest moving away from

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.250 
so I would also suggest moving away from
the<00:03:07.880> dessert<00:03:08.209> table<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.720> go<00:03:08.810> take<00:03:08.930> a<00:03:08.989> seat

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
the dessert table and go take a seat

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.690 
the dessert table and go take a seat
take<00:03:09.920> what<00:03:10.069> you're<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.489> on<00:03:10.610> a

take what you're going to have on a

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.910 
take what you're going to have on a
plate<00:03:10.940> limit<00:03:11.810> to<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.959> if<00:03:12.319> you<00:03:12.470> stand<00:03:12.709> as<00:03:12.830> a
