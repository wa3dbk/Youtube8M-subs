onto a thinner much more sensitive part
of<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:59.080> tongue<00:00:59.350> so<00:01:00.159> we've<00:01:00.339> looked<00:01:00.549> at<00:01:00.820> this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
of the tongue so we've looked at this

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.310 
of the tongue so we've looked at this
and<00:01:01.559> we've<00:01:02.559> arrived<00:01:02.949> at<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:04.030> Demi<00:01:04.239> Anki<00:01:04.780> which

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and we've arrived at the Demi Anki which

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.280 
and we've arrived at the Demi Anki which
is<00:01:05.500> a<00:01:05.530> much<00:01:05.890> much<00:01:06.159> more<00:01:06.460> comfortable<00:01:07.290> snaffle

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
is a much much more comfortable snaffle

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.280 
is a much much more comfortable snaffle
it<00:01:09.250> will<00:01:09.549> give<00:01:09.790> you<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.030> uplift<00:01:10.479> from<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
it will give you the uplift from the

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.560 
it will give you the uplift from the
shoulder<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.280> traditional<00:01:12.880> Nutcracker

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
shoulder that the traditional Nutcracker

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.800 
shoulder that the traditional Nutcracker
action<00:01:14.080> does<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:15.369> it<00:01:15.790> won't<00:01:16.210> travel<00:01:16.630> too<00:01:16.780> far

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
action does but it won't travel too far

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.709 
action does but it won't travel too far
forwards<00:01:17.650> it<00:01:18.310> will<00:01:18.549> sit<00:01:18.820> further<00:01:19.060> back<00:01:19.479> in<00:01:19.689> the

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719 
forwards it will sit further back in the

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.740 
forwards it will sit further back in the
mouth<00:01:19.859> over<00:01:20.859> a<00:01:21.009> thicker<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.549> sensitive<00:01:22.210> part<00:01:22.479> of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
mouth over a thicker a sensitive part of

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.399 
mouth over a thicker a sensitive part of
the<00:01:22.899> tongue

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:23.409 
the tongue

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.639 
the tongue
it<00:01:23.890> will<00:01:24.219> help<00:01:24.579> with<00:01:25.030> turning<00:01:25.600> because<00:01:26.530> it

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
it will help with turning because it

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:28.200 
it will help with turning because it
does<00:01:26.799> encompass<00:01:27.219> the<00:01:27.640> tongue<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.119> it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
does encompass the tongue and it

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.480 
does encompass the tongue and it
connects<00:01:28.570> with<00:01:29.109> areas<00:01:29.590> within<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:30.039> mouth<00:01:30.219> in

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
connects with areas within the mouth in

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.300 
connects with areas within the mouth in
order<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.759> achieve<00:01:31.270> that<00:01:31.299> and<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.740> also<00:01:32.890> very

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
order to achieve that and it's also very

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.630 
order to achieve that and it's also very
clever<00:01:33.640> because<00:01:34.509> it<00:01:34.840> curls<00:01:35.229> away<00:01:35.710> ever<00:01:36.159> so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
clever because it curls away ever so

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.090 
clever because it curls away ever so
slightly<00:01:36.909> from<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.929> corner<00:01:38.380> of<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.649> lid<00:01:38.829> so

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
slightly from the corner of the lid so

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.510 
slightly from the corner of the lid so
if<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.119> have<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> horse<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:41.189> has<00:01:42.189> suffered
