00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
long range which can be snapped off

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.560 
long range which can be snapped off
perfectly<00:00:57.059> with<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> plenty<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.620> open<00:00:58.980> space

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570

though<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.600> highly<00:01:00.960> doubt<00:01:01.109> that<00:01:01.170> will<00:01:01.680> be

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
though I highly doubt that will be

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.179 
though I highly doubt that will be
plausible<00:01:02.340> or<00:01:02.609> will<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.870> yeah<00:01:04.680> sucks

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189

the third poison spice makes sense and

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.210 
the third poison spice makes sense and
looks<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.090> there's<00:05:02.270> another<00:05:02.419> trap<00:05:03.020> here<00:05:03.470> but

looks like there's another trap here but

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.300 
looks like there's another trap here but
I<00:05:04.250> missed<00:05:04.580> it<00:05:04.730> because<00:05:04.970> of<00:05:05.180> my<00:05:05.540> perk<00:05:06.280> so<00:05:07.280> I

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
I missed it because of my perk so I

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.980 
I missed it because of my perk so I
guess<00:05:07.520> that's<00:05:07.820> good<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:10.060> yeah<00:05:11.060> I'll<00:05:11.750> see<00:05:11.930> you
