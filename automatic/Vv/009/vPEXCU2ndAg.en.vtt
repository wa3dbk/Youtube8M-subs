00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's because it has the G and the F and

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.729 
it's because it has the G and the F and
it's<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.819> mixolydian<00:01:33.300> meredith's<00:01:33.989> G<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.500> half

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:34.739 
it's a mixolydian meredith's G and half

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:38.700 
it's a mixolydian meredith's G and half
so<00:01:35.069> it<00:01:35.130> has

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.399 

like<00:01:39.710> the<00:01:39.830> B<00:01:39.979> part<00:01:40.250> is<00:01:40.580> G<00:01:41.140> because<00:01:42.140> we<00:01:42.380> have<00:01:44.409> so

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
like the B part is G because we have so

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.890 
like the B part is G because we have so
there's<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.650> lot<00:01:45.830> of<00:01:45.860> evidence<00:01:46.490> in<00:01:46.909> it<00:01:47.119> it's<00:01:47.750> a

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
there's a lot of evidence in it it's a

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.350 
there's a lot of evidence in it it's a
mixolydian<00:01:48.470> mode<00:01:48.850> what<00:01:49.850> I'm<00:01:49.909> going<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.090> do<00:01:50.270> is

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
mixolydian mode what I'm going to do is

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.410 
mixolydian mode what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:50.479> going<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.659> play<00:01:50.869> through<00:01:51.190> briefly<00:01:52.420> some
