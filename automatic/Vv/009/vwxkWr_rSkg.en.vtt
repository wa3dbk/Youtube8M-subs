00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
 chance against the performance of rs6 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.590
 basis the m6 gran coupe 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.020
 four-seat luxury racer with 560 hp 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.080
 Of course, too little for the performance 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.390
 doted by g-power a titan 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.390
 exhaust system and an optimized 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.849
 engine electronics pizzas 150 ps more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.300
 the 4 4 liter twin turbo engine of the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.300
 bmw 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.960
 710 ps is said to be the four-door m6 supposedly 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.750
 Afford 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.460
 We measure how much power is sent 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.820
 the tuned bmw really to the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.820
 hinterachse 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.040
 the m6 is over 30 ps stronger than that 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:56.040
 official statement 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 there 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.870
 in less than four seconds, the bmw 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.670
 on pace 100 just under 1000 newton meters 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.670
 fall downright on the rear axle 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.920
 that's a real power shot 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:28.920
 quite to nickis taste 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.310
 the difference is from the four-wheel and 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.220
 two-wheeler 200 karstadt he already one 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.110
 Do a little more on show but the 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.979
 Speed really comes with it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.620
 Faster happens with the expectations 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.410
 because it goes accordingly the 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.630
 pressure through the Bavarian meets 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.520
 machine with over 40 ps more power 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.520
 beat the audi slalom 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.480
 Of course it's easy 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.560
 there is a time to strike 103 94 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.210
 I now just wanted to I have to 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.850
 Now that's ours 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.620
 staked course again see if one 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.030
 small rear-wheel drive from g-power das 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.740
 So 67 141 ps can be the actual one 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.270
 middle madness bavaria just only 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.210
 rear-wheel drive that would be a whole 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.370
 difficult thing but yes it is then 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.970
 but fast or go and then come 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.140
 the power bit to carry 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.880
 also sprinkle upwards but also 30 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.890
 ps planted more than given young 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.320
 and that's why I think will be real 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.030
 difficult, however , he had six 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.740
 of course, unbelievable traction advantage 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.390
 the car is very good 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.510
 it will probably be very close 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.940
 what time can the rear wheel drive 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.930
 from g-power to the tuned rs6 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.170
 oppose 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.170
