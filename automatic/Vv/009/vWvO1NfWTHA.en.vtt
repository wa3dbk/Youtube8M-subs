00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.189
 Greetings today on October 12 , 2014 and 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.830
 to have a report on the tropics and what 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.600
 we see waiting for our next day the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 Atlantic released quite active 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.310
 during the past days in comparison 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.780
 with the rest of the season here towards 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.280
 the north is the bermuda we have what 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.500
 which is the hurricane state that was 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.440
 affecting the island of the world during the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.760
 yesterday and today this system is now 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.490
 moves towards open waters of the Atlantic 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.710
 and is not expected to affect other areas 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.900
 of earth on the other hand we are treading 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.640
 very closely what is recently was 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.640
 declared the tropical storm 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.260
 gonzalo this is represents the system 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.940
 number 6 of the season 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.410
 we are looking at this system very 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.699
 near the Caribbean area because 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.949
 it has a movement to the west and 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.329
 must be approaching some of 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.089
 the islands of the Caribbean during 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.920
 next days first this system 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.229
 will be accepting some antilles 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.860
 minor is why the service 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.750
 national hurricane has issued a 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.519
 tropical storm warning for all 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.470
 these islands including the islands 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.729
 virgins and puerto rico this means 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.950
 that storm conditions are expected 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.110
 tropical for the next 36 hours 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.909
 apart from that , a 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.640
 hurricane watch for the islands 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.840
 virgins and Puerto Rico because 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.130
 there is a possibility that this 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.649
 system as it moves towards the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.009
 West-northwest is strengthening and 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.560
 even reaching an intensification near 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.450
 of hurricane as you can notice the image 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.799
 visible from satellites this system luce 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.960
 much healthier than what we saw 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.299
 during the past days practically 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.909
 in 24 hours this system managed to be of 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.399
 a simple tropical band to a storm 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.720
 tropical that is getting stronger 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.000
 currently has winds of 45 miles 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.540
 per hour and moves at a ratio of 10 to 15 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.640
 miles per hour to 9 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.890
 however it is expected that then during 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 tomorrow begins to take a 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.670
 I turn more towards the west-northwest and it's 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.590
 why national service of 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.110
 meteorology has issued surveillance and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.790
 warning for this whole region of the Caribbean 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.340
 this system is currently being 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.840
 affected by dry air this dry air 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.240
 comes from a high pressure that we have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.920
 in this area is the high pressure that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.590
 is keeping that trajectory towards 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.830
 the west 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.510
 it's high pressure brings dry air of this 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.000
 Atlantic region so all this 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.610
 air moves and goes into the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.769
 circles and in this system that's why it's 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.239
 that the system is not strengthening 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.459
 quickly and as you can see in this 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.620
 visible image you can see all this area 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.180
 without thunder and without rain that is air 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.250
 dry because it's affecting is 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.379
 interfering with the development of this 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.970
 system however if we denote the 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.370
 latest images that the little system to 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.349
 little manages to produce more areas of 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.860
 thundering which is why he is struggling 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:44.049
 pretty good is there looking at the image 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.569
 of infrared we can notice that the area 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.670
 of thunder is not very impressive without 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.860
 However, if we start to see this kind of 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.560
 bands in the south of the circulation that 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.549
 tell us why the system 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.010
 definitely it is little by little 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:59.350
 organized and strengthened according to 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.270
 moves west-northwest 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.310
 talking about trajectories as you can see 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.960
 the models are in quite agreement 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.610
 loving needy moving towards the 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.550
 west during the next then now 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.260
 then I turn west-northwest to 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.300
 pass it very close or over puerto rico 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.890
 for that Tuesday morning 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.120
 how can you notice most of the 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.310
 models indicate what must be happening 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.050
 about 50 miles northeast of puerto rico 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.520
 however the national service tura 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.830
 can indicates that this system may be 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.700
 going a little closer to about 10 to 25 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.680
 miles northeast 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.920
 and obviously we are under 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.420
 be as uncertain as I said the 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.370
 models indicate what must be happening 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.720
 to the northeast the national service of 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.069
 hurricanes put him a little more towards the 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.720
 south 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.360
 skimming past the east coast of 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.730
 Puerto Rico and as clearly as should 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.260
 to know then all systems are a bit 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.170
 difficult to predict in terms of 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.370
 trajectory for which basically we 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.470
 we place inside that with a 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.849
 uncertainty regardless of 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.269
 where does this system happen as we can 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.200
 anticipate rain for the whole island the 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.540
 models indicate that they should be 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.459
 falling down from 4 to 8 inches in the 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.650
 region is back rich 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.000
 the winds if this system goes to 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.380
 northeast of puerto rico with the winds 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.660
 they should not be very strong, 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:13.010
 probably of forgiveness strength 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.780
 probably from storm force 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.820
 tropical for the eastern port region 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.959
 However, I ask you that you are very 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.479
 attentive because any 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.010
 deviation towards the south because it would bring us 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.110
 the most active part of the system on the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.389
 island 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.039
 in my opinion in terms of intensity 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.960
 I think that the national service of 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.520
 hurricanes is having a forecast 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.530
 quite aggressive with the intensification 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.409
 this system placing it as a hurricane 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.150
 near rich sport I think that this 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.379
 dry air is going to be preventing 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.479
 we need this to strengthen us 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:42.099
 quickly clear this they are the 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.229
 experts they know more about the subject 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.300
 so your rations should be afraid but 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.969
 it does not convince me that this 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.770
 system what will be done to that 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:52.539
 rhythm as indicated by the national service 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.530
 ture independently 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.479
 conditions are going to be similar 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.129
 enough rain for the whole island 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.050
 especially for the eastern region of 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.840
 puerto rico and probably some 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.490
 Storm intensity bursts 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.080
 tropical as long as this system 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.479
 it stays on that path towards the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.039
 north of river to arise some change and 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.159
 move south by then 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.080
 we would receive a little stronger impact 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.900
 about puerto rico why we should 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.490
 be attentive as I said we have a notice 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.319
 of hurricane a tropical storm warning 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.439
 for puerto rico and a surveillance of 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.669
 hurricane for the island and the system 

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:26.620
 is happening at its closest point 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.540
 for that on Tuesday morning 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300
 but to begin to feel its effect 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.830
 tomorrow at night with the shovel we are going to 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.860
 quickly see a new model we have 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.710
 the IEV is that 10 is showing a 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.169
 quite weak system clearly this 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.729
 model because it is wrong because already 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:45.340
 we have a tropical storm but 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.970
 we can have that trajectory 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.949
 basically the city the west-northwest 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:52.590
 happening as I said happening to about 50 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:54.280
 miles northeast of puerto rico 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.660
 approximately run to the new 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.940
 run we will be pending sometimes 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.830
 if any change happens here we have a 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.260
 European model shows a storm 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 moderate tropical also passing to some 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.840
 25 to 50 miles northeast of Puerto Rico 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:11.630
 and on the other hand we have the model f10 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:14.210
 Diego is a little 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.710
 This model is specialized in these 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.090
 systems and tells us that the 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.830
 system projects a trajectory over 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.410
 puerto rico dance a little more 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.970
 similar to what the service tells me 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.350
 national hurricane however what 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:27.040
 keeps quite weak as we can 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.140
 notice in esteem we also have the 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.420
 works this model looks a lot like 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.770
 physical guide the European model that indicates 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.720
 that the system may be going 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.730
 25 or 50 miles northeast of port 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.670
 rich and like most of the 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:43.310
 models by a constant system of this 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:44.660
 one of the reasons why I do not 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.790
 I think that this system will reach 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.740
 hurricane when they pass very close to port 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:51.560
 rich however if you expect a storm 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.760
 of 60 65 miles per hour according to 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.380
 we need moves towards the 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.680
 west-northwest and passes very close or over 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.000
 puerto rico for that Tuesday 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.380
 remember that regardless of 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.760
 my opinion 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.050
 we must be very attentive to what 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.820
 indicates the national service of 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.350
 as metrology service 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:08.810
 national hurricane 

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.340
 and the official forecast that is to which 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.600
 we must pay attention indicates 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.730
 that this system based a storm 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.440
 tropical strong or hurricane when it 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.880
 located very close to or on the coast of 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.590
