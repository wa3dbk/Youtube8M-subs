00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.540 

and<00:02:19.230> if<00:02:19.350> you<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.620> to<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.010> know<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.370> dip

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
and if you have to you know you can dip

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.300 
and if you have to you know you can dip
it<00:02:20.670> in<00:02:20.850> some<00:02:20.880> more<00:02:21.060> water<00:02:22.640> but<00:02:25.070> like<00:02:26.070> I<00:02:26.160> said

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
it in some more water but like I said

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.990 
it in some more water but like I said
just<00:02:26.370> make<00:02:26.610> sure<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.880> don't<00:02:27.120> over<00:02:28.940> do<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
just make sure you don't over do the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.900 
just make sure you don't over do the
water<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.900> make<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.230> really<00:02:34.680> nice<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
water and just make it really nice it

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.410 
water and just make it really nice it
goes<00:02:36.060> on<00:02:36.210> nice<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.600> smooth<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:39.180> think

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
goes on nice and smooth and I think

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.480 
goes on nice and smooth and I think
pigments<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.170> best<00:02:40.470> used<00:02:40.920> when<00:02:41.070> wet

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
pigments are just best used when wet

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.820 
pigments are just best used when wet
they<00:02:41.850> just<00:02:42.060> really<00:02:42.390> are<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:43.320> makes<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
they just really are it makes the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.810 
they just really are it makes the
process<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.810> whole<00:02:46.190> lot<00:02:47.190> easier<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:50.220> now<00:02:50.520> that<00:02:50.790> i

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
process a whole lot easier so now that i

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.250 
process a whole lot easier so now that i

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220

your eye and I'm going to take my brush

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.290 
your eye and I'm going to take my brush
my<00:04:10.870> precise<00:04:11.200> brush<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.740> used<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.070> put<00:04:12.250> on

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
my precise brush that I used to put on

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.690 
my precise brush that I used to put on
the<00:04:13.300> helium<00:04:13.750> and<00:04:13.960> the<00:04:14.050> pink<00:04:14.260> bra<00:04:14.470> and<00:04:15.340> I'm<00:04:15.460> just

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
the helium and the pink bra and I'm just

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.190 
the helium and the pink bra and I'm just
going<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.000> go<00:04:16.269> over<00:04:17.940> that<00:04:18.940> Center<00:04:19.390> Park<00:04:19.660> where

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
going to go over that Center Park where

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.400 
going to go over that Center Park where
it<00:04:20.380> was<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.769> harsh<00:04:21.100> line<00:04:21.960> to<00:04:22.960> blend<00:04:23.260> those

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
it was a harsh line to blend those

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.810 
it was a harsh line to blend those
colors<00:04:24.280> in<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:26.680> I<00:04:26.770> put<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.100> gold<00:04:27.370> over<00:04:27.730> it

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
colors in and I put the gold over it

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.460 
colors in and I put the gold over it
because<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.150> gold<00:04:28.390> helps<00:04:28.870> to<00:04:29.050> blend<00:04:29.320> the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
because the gold helps to blend the

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.100 
because the gold helps to blend the
colors<00:04:29.740> in<00:04:29.890> better<00:04:30.510> because<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.750> the<00:04:31.870> pink

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
colors in better because of the pink

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:33.600
