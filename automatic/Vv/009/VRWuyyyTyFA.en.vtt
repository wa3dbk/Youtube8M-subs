00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
side and Bob side you probably have a

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.709

much<00:03:40.680> easier<00:03:40.709> time<00:03:41.069> ski<00:03:41.519> because<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.599> to

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:42.719

all<00:03:42.810> although

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
all although

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.979 
all although
so<00:03:45.680> normally<00:03:46.489> injector<00:03:47.000> yet<00:03:47.180> beavers<00:03:47.750> but

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
so normally injector yet beavers but

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.420 
so normally injector yet beavers but
let's<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.379> mr.<00:03:48.709> clear<00:03:48.950> pasta

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
I think this would be patched really say

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.070 
I think this would be patched really say
might<00:03:57.670> even<00:03:57.850> be

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:15.900 

surprise

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910
