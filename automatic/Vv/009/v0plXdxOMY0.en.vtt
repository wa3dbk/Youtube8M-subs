00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.890
 wondering exactly Do not push the slide is one hundred 

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:09.139
 percent as for the rest 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.169
 possibly variants and here are some more 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:16.100
 my other alexa butane for which 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:18.770
 among other things besides the name of the marina 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.300
 Zueva and Oleg Einstein who is now 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.710
 work in close bond also bronze 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.470
 Moscow World Cup is it 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.160
 highest achievement brother and sister and 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.029
 shibutani and later similar success with them 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.029
 did not have 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.680
 and 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:51.270
 Now many will be surprised 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.810
 I liked it this is completely different then 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.069
 what 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.020
 and probably need from brother and sister 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.620
 famous incendiary melodies favorite 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:04.560
 world public michael jackson 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:08.009
 good skating beautiful clean elements 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.340
 and chic twizzle and but fall in the beginning 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:15.240
 but I understand that the fall was 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:18.449
 counted before any of 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.789
 Alex elements and therefore, the gums and the 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:23.160
 it threatens american athletes it 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.900
 removing one point directly for 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.870
 the fall itself everything else was 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.759
 performed very cool and we go 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.520
 no doubt who is coming out now 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.889
 leaders anyway here this from 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.360
 Shibutani wanted to see throughout 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.849
 last few years 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.099
 games they already matured they already 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.530
 gradually get out of that and jurassic 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.630
 skates that were cleaned by so many 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:46.319
 specialists during the previous pair 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.039
 seasons 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:51.900
 well and here is the absence of a love story in 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.419
 the performance of brother and sister is absolutely 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.389
 correct move if you are japanese avi 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:06:00.320
 understand nothing is impossible due to the fact that 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:03.790
 they are asians by default 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.200
 can not be understood by us as residents 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.600
 Central European Flush in our country 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.520
 who or almost can not be understood 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.110
 when they don't roll the classics could not 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.220
 roll in especially something your 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.290
 Japanese then 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.080
 I do not know that perhaps the brightest 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.280
 Shibutani's performance since they 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.920
 come and delay 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.340
 level in adult but again by 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.340
 my opinion 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.920
 caught myself thinking carefully 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.970
 studying their diagonal steps 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.630
 look 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:41.210
 if any mistakes are misunderstood and understood 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:45.800
 that marina zueva how gorgeous 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:48.680
 specialist she tried all the shortcomings 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.620
 all here are these subtleties that can be 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.920
 judges and can detect hide 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.800
 veil and managed by and large 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.740
 very nice impression made seams 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.960
 Tanya so rolled well, naturally they 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.720
 first by a small margin but they 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.590
 ahead of rivals even with 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:12.740
 this one 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:14.930
 points for grandmother for the fall of Alex and 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.060
 first place goes may persons shibutani 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:20.750
 thus providing yourself like 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:25.570
 at least third position at the end of the stage 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.570
 grants they win from rivals and
