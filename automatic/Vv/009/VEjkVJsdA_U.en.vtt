00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.259 
back-end to harness as much power as
possible<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.649> FBR<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.220> really<00:00:57.820> sporty

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
possible the FBR is a really sporty

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.350 
possible the FBR is a really sporty
hybrid<00:00:58.930> so<00:00:59.530> this<00:00:59.710> excels<00:01:00.579> on<00:01:00.820> kind<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.059> weekend

on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:11.080> FBR<00:01:11.380> also<00:01:11.740> makes<00:01:11.890> a<00:01:11.979> great<00:01:12.130> option<00:01:12.550> for

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
on the FBR also makes a great option for

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.090 
on the FBR also makes a great option for
grand<00:01:13.179> fondos<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.899> charity<00:01:14.259> rides<00:01:14.470> its

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
grand fondos and charity rides its

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.690 
grand fondos and charity rides its
aggressive<00:01:15.700> geometry<00:01:16.360> yet<00:01:16.720> stable

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
aggressive geometry yet stable

aggressive geometry yet stable
positioning<00:01:18.700> really<00:01:19.240> lends<00:01:19.450> itself<00:01:19.750> well<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
positioning really lends itself well to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.859 
positioning really lends itself well to
a<00:01:20.229> variety<00:01:20.800> of<00:01:20.830> different<00:01:20.979> riders<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:25.420> FBR<00:01:25.690> is

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
a variety of different riders the FBR is

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.960 
a variety of different riders the FBR is
really<00:01:26.320> fun<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.710> ride<00:01:26.950> because<00:01:27.340> you<00:01:27.460> can<00:01:27.610> push

really fun to ride because you can push

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.639 
really fun to ride because you can push
the<00:01:28.330> boundaries<00:01:28.690> of<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.050> you<00:01:29.140> can<00:01:29.259> actually<00:01:29.380> go

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
the boundaries of it you can actually go

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.830 
the boundaries of it you can actually go
really<00:01:30.130> quite<00:01:30.369> quick<00:01:30.670> it's<00:01:30.880> lightweight<00:01:31.270> it's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
really quite quick it's lightweight it's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.040 
really quite quick it's lightweight it's
efficient<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.830> it's<00:01:33.280> got<00:01:33.460> pretty<00:01:34.240> aggressive

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
efficient and it's got pretty aggressive

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.870 
efficient and it's got pretty aggressive
angles<00:01:35.440> and<00:01:35.619> geometry<00:01:35.679> for<00:01:36.310> slop<00:01:36.520> our<00:01:36.729> road

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
angles and geometry for slop our road

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.730

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
can really harness a lot of power from

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.680 
can really harness a lot of power from
yourself<00:01:41.289> and<00:01:41.770> also<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.209> really<00:01:43.509> take<00:01:43.660> a

yourself and also you can really take a
lot<00:01:43.899> extra<00:01:44.140> speed<00:01:44.500> into<00:01:44.770> corners<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:46.300> really

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
lot extra speed into corners and really

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.210 
lot extra speed into corners and really
push<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:46.989> limits<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.440> yourself<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.069> of<00:01:48.190> your

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220
