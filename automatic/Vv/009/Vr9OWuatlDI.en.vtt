00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.880
 welcome to a dotcom teacher today 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.050
 let's find out what are the phases 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.140
 of the cell cycle 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.060
 any cell has a life cycle 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.449
 and in that life cycle we find 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.710
 different stages each of them is 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.710
 responsible for making a function 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.380
 As you can see there are some stages that are 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.410
 the so-called stages that are called stages 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:42.350
 g of English grow that means 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.570
 growth and how can you imagine this 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.700
 means that the cell in those stages 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 what he is going to do is grow 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 and grow in number of organelles 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 and prepare for when the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.750
 moment to divide with which is going to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.440
 need 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.690
 transcribe and translate to get 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.390
 proteins 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.790
 they are very rich stages in synthesis of 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.030
 proteins that are the pieces that then 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.190
 will form these organelles and in second 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.500
 place has to grow by increasing its 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.330
 volume because if not from a cell like that 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.240
 I would get two more cells 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.130
 little girls imagine what would happen in the 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.680
 successive divisions that would go 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.340
 reducing its size until disappearing 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.890
 then in these stages g above all 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.310
 there protein synthesis and increase of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.310
 volume 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.950
 stage 1 goes to the next stage which is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.680
 the stage of synthesis or stage s when 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.280
 everything is ready for the DNA to be 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.280
 duplicate 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:54.820
 that duplication of DNA along with their 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.140
 associated proteins is the specific of 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.360
 the synthesis phase 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.360
 and the name synthesis of DNA 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.030
 from the synthesis phase we went to a 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.920
 second phase of growth phase g 2 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.760
 in this phase the cell continues to increase 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.900
 of volume and synthesizes a few 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.780
 more proteins 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.319
 If everything is correct and the cell is 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.879
 point to divide from step g1 to 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:30.930
 that trip 2 jump to the stage of mitosis or 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.930
 phase m 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.730
 this phase of mitosis is the most 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.640
 short of cell life 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.970
 if you will imagine the life of the cell 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.440
 like a 24-hour clock a clock 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.130
 any of those who measure our 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.370
 hours of the day 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.390
 the mitosis phase would only last half 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.960
 the rest of the hours are spent in the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.960
 other phases 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.610
 phase m is the phase of cell division 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.520
 although here you see mitosis you can also 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.510
 being meiosis depends on the type of cells 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.909
 that we are 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.680
 in any case the m will always be 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:17.540
 division and the rest the g and the feces 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.390
 are what is known in the cycle as 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.909
 the phases interfaces in which the 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.460
 cell is not in division and what is 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.550
 doing is preparing 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.090
 Finally there is a phase that not all 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:36.110
 cells go through it is the known 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:38.690
 that 0 phase 0 is a phase that is a 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.030
 phase that is called stationary because 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:46.880
 the cells that are in g1 do not follow 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.570
 go ahead with the DNA synthesis and continue 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:54.500
 increasing its size with phase g 2 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.410
 but they go to g 0 and they stay there 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:01.590
 way they do not get to divide 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.230
 of these cells are our neurons 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.480
 the vast majority of our neurons a 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.170
 once they have developed they are no longer divided 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.129
 because they have entered this phase 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.800
 Fortunately, the rest of the cells 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:16.650
 our body if they do it because if not 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.070
 they did it every time a fabric 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:24.199
 damaged those cells we would lose them and we 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.199
 We would be left damaged and with holes 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:28.430
 It has been everything I hope it has been very 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.350
 useful and you can find some 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.940
 exercises on the same website for 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.630
 ensure that you have understood 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.630
 happy study
