around trying to get really creative

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.920 
around trying to get really creative
with<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:16.920> locs<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:18.390> after<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.720> did<00:00:18.779> that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
with my locs and so after I did that

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.859

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
hairspray is really constantly in color

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.859 
hairspray is really constantly in color
and<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:23.160> decided<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.330> highlights<00:00:25.250> now<00:00:26.869> my

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and I decided to get highlights now my

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.390 
and I decided to get highlights now my
highlights<00:00:28.230> right<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.740> purple<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> that

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
highlights right now are purple and that

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
highlights right now are purple and that
is<00:00:29.970> because<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> process<00:00:30.929> that<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.199> went

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
is because the process that I went

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.639 
is because the process that I went
through<00:00:31.790> lifted<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:32.969> hair<00:00:33.210> up<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.260> made<00:00:34.500> it

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
through lifted my hair up so made it

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.069 
through lifted my hair up so made it
like<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> blond<00:00:35.280> color<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.600> put<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
like a blond color and then we put a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.990 
like a blond color and then we put a
purple<00:00:37.649> rinse<00:00:38.280> overtop<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.610> experience<00:00:41.610> was

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
purple rinse overtop the experience was

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.790 
purple rinse overtop the experience was
oh<00:00:44.030> it<00:00:45.030> was<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> Ventris<00:00:45.660> because<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.530> were<00:00:46.649> not

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800
