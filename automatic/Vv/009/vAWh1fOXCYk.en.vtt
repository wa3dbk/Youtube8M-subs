00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
some cornstarch now I'm going to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.650 
some cornstarch now I'm going to
Ambridge<00:01:12.659> these<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.380> pearl<00:01:13.710> airbrush<00:01:14.280> color

Ambridge these with pearl airbrush color
you<00:01:15.660> want<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.899> make<00:01:16.020> sure<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.289> you<00:01:16.500> don't

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
overdo it with the airflow because these

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.340 
overdo it with the airflow because these
are<00:01:19.470> really<00:01:19.619> small<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.100> they're<00:01:20.280> gonna<00:01:20.550> flip

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
are really small and they're gonna flip

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
are really small and they're gonna flip
if<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.979> are<00:01:23.220> using<00:01:23.460> too<00:01:23.940> much<00:01:24.119> air<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.780> then

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
if you are using too much air and then

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.749 
if you are using too much air and then
while<00:01:25.440> the<00:01:25.649> airbrush<00:01:25.950> color<00:01:26.190> is<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.520> them

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
while the airbrush color is still them

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.210 
while the airbrush color is still them
you<00:01:27.149> can<00:01:27.360> dust<00:01:27.600> them<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:27.869> rainbow<00:01:28.830> disco

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
you can dust them with rainbow disco

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.779 
you can dust them with rainbow disco
dust<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.640> give<00:01:29.789> them<00:01:29.910> a<00:01:30.030> nice<00:01:30.240> Sparkle<00:01:34.789> after

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
dust to give them a nice Sparkle after

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.880 
dust to give them a nice Sparkle after
one<00:01:36.000> side<00:01:36.330> is<00:01:36.600> dry<00:01:36.750> you're<00:01:37.320> going<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.560> flip<00:01:37.830> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
one side is dry you're going to flip it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.639 
one side is dry you're going to flip it
and<00:01:38.270> repeat<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.420> same<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.619> other

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
and repeat the same thing on the other

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:51.230 
and repeat the same thing on the other
side

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320 

now<00:01:52.240> for<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.720> rings<00:01:52.930> I'm<00:01:53.320> using<00:01:54.060> silver<00:01:55.060> a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
now for the rings I'm using silver a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.180 
now for the rings I'm using silver a
brush<00:01:55.570> color<00:01:55.870> you<00:01:56.080> can<00:01:56.230> also<00:01:56.380> use<00:01:56.620> combination

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
brush color you can also use combination

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.960 
brush color you can also use combination
silver<00:01:57.730> and<00:01:57.910> pearl<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.330> once<00:02:02.400> one<00:02:03.400> side<00:02:03.670> is

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
silver and pearl and once one side is

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.360 
silver and pearl and once one side is
dried<00:02:04.300> we<00:02:04.330> can<00:02:04.810> flip<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.260> and<00:02:05.410> repeat<00:02:06.070> on<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
dried we can flip it and repeat on the

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.770 
dried we can flip it and repeat on the
other<00:02:06.520> side<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.580> now<00:02:09.729> that<00:02:09.790> we<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.149> both<00:02:10.270> both

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
other side so now that we have both both

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.410 
other side so now that we have both both
parts<00:02:11.260> ready<00:02:11.530> airbrushed<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.850> can<00:02:13.060> put<00:02:13.300> them

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
parts ready airbrushed we can put them

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.260 
parts ready airbrushed we can put them
together<00:02:13.600> simply<00:02:14.380> gluing<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.340> gem<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:15.880> top<00:02:16.090> of

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
together simply gluing the gem on top of

together simply gluing the gem on top of
the<00:02:16.390> Ring<00:02:16.600> using<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> little<00:02:17.290> bit<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.500> royal

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
icing so once they are dry you can use

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.690
