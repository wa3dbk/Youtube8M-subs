you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.170> going<00:01:31.350> through<00:01:31.590> its

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you can see there it's going through its

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.240 
you can see there it's going through its
patent<00:01:32.189> now<00:01:32.250> that's<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.390> fast<00:01:33.720> flash<00:01:34.250> and

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
patent now that's the fast flash and

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.840 
patent now that's the fast flash and
then<00:01:36.150> after<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> fast<00:01:37.530> flashes<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> goes<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
then after a fast flashes it goes to the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.899 
then after a fast flashes it goes to the
slow<00:01:39.659> rainbow<00:01:40.200> she<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:40.979> changing<00:01:41.579> colors

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
slow rainbow she always changing colors

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.950 
slow rainbow she always changing colors
slow<00:01:43.909> then<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.030> will<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.149> back<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.720> fast

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
slow then it will go back to the fast

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.840 
slow then it will go back to the fast
flash<00:01:47.360> so<00:01:48.360> that's<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> fast<00:01:49.020> flash<00:01:49.850> rainbow

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
flash so that's the fast flash rainbow

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.170 
flash so that's the fast flash rainbow
LED<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> slow<00:01:53.000> rainbow<00:01:54.000> LED<00:01:56.180> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
LED and this is the slow rainbow LED you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.850 
LED and this is the slow rainbow LED you
can<00:01:57.360> see<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> difference<00:01:58.079> between<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.680> two

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
can see the difference between the two
