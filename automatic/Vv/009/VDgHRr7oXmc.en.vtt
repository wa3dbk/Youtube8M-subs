00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.560 

non-photosynthetic<00:00:02.639> corals<00:00:03.240> are<00:00:03.330> some<00:00:03.480> of

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
non-photosynthetic corals are some of

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.420 
non-photosynthetic corals are some of
the<00:00:03.629> most<00:00:03.780> beautiful<00:00:04.049> corals<00:00:04.620> out<00:00:04.799> there<00:00:05.100> but

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
the most beautiful corals out there but

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860 
the most beautiful corals out there but
they're<00:00:05.549> very<00:00:05.790> high<00:00:06.060> maintenance<00:00:06.299> and<00:00:06.720> that

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
they're very high maintenance and that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.580 
they're very high maintenance and that
they<00:00:07.049> require<00:00:07.440> regular<00:00:08.130> daily<00:00:08.160> feeding<00:00:08.790> I

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
they require regular daily feeding I

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.959 
they require regular daily feeding I
like<00:00:10.590> to<00:00:10.710> break<00:00:10.920> up<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> feeding<00:00:11.580> into<00:00:11.790> two

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
like to break up the feeding into two

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.299 
like to break up the feeding into two
steps<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.900> initial<00:00:13.290> feed<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:13.980> enough<00:00:14.190> to

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
steps the initial feed is just enough to

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.070 
steps the initial feed is just enough to
trigger<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.670> corals<00:00:15.089> feeding<00:00:15.420> response

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
trigger the corals feeding response

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.410 
trigger the corals feeding response
it<00:00:16.500> takes<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.279> non-photosynthetic<00:00:17.789> corals

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
it takes the non-photosynthetic corals

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.880 
it takes the non-photosynthetic corals
like<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> Sun<00:00:18.960> Corps<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.410> example<00:00:19.800> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
like the Sun Corps for example of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.120 
like the Sun Corps for example of
several<00:00:20.310> minutes<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.760> really<00:00:20.970> open<00:00:22.130> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
several minutes to really open the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
several minutes to really open the
polyps<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.609> start<00:00:23.970> out<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.359> open<00:00:24.720> slowly

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
polyps that start out more open slowly

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
polyps that start out more open slowly
eat<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.500> food<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.430> other<00:00:26.609> nearby<00:00:26.910> polyps<00:00:27.449> can

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
eat the food the other nearby polyps can

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.269 
eat the food the other nearby polyps can
detect<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.590> follow<00:00:28.830> suit<00:00:29.130> by

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
detect this and they follow suit by

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:42.639 
detect this and they follow suit by
opening<00:00:29.640> up<00:00:29.730> themselves

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.020 

now<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.920> coral<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.309> almost<00:00:44.550> completely

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
now that the coral is almost completely

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.029 
now that the coral is almost completely
open<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.690> administer<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> second<00:00:46.680> heavier

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
open I administer a second heavier

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.150 
open I administer a second heavier
feeding<00:00:48.500> personally<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> use<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
feeding personally I like to use a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.010 
feeding personally I like to use a
turkey<00:00:50.340> baster<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.000> target<00:00:51.390> feed<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> corals

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
turkey baster to target feed the corals

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.860 
turkey baster to target feed the corals
but<00:00:52.260> there's<00:00:52.410> many<00:00:52.590> other<00:00:52.739> ways<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> feed<00:00:53.550> them

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
but there's many other ways to feed them

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
but there's many other ways to feed them
some<00:00:54.870> properties<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.530> feeding<00:00:55.860> container

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
some properties of feeding container

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
some properties of feeding container
that<00:00:56.399> both<00:00:56.579> keeps<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.059> food<00:00:57.420> near<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> corals

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that both keeps the food near the corals

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.700 
that both keeps the food near the corals
and<00:00:58.590> keeps<00:00:59.219> fish<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.670> inverts<00:01:00.000> away<00:01:00.469> now<00:01:01.469> some

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and keeps fish and inverts away now some

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.139 
and keeps fish and inverts away now some
aquarius<00:01:02.129> have<00:01:02.280> even<00:01:02.520> gone<00:01:02.640> as<00:01:02.820> far<00:01:03.000> as

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
aquarius have even gone as far as

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
aquarius have even gone as far as
creating<00:01:03.510> constant<00:01:04.170> feeding<00:01:04.409> systems<00:01:04.920> that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
creating constant feeding systems that

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
creating constant feeding systems that
slowly<00:01:05.430> administer<00:01:06.119> food<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> course

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
slowly administer food over the course

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.390 
slowly administer food over the course
of<00:01:07.229> several<00:01:07.439> hours<00:01:09.770> although<00:01:10.770> we're<00:01:11.159> really

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
of several hours although we're really

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.160 
of several hours although we're really
focusing<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.600> feeding<00:01:13.110> of

been looking at there's several other

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.690 
been looking at there's several other
types<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.689> large<00:01:31.140> polyp<00:01:31.829> non-photosynthetic

corals<00:01:33.299> likes<00:01:33.570> plan<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
corals likes plan of

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.240 
corals likes plan of
and<00:01:35.600> there's<00:01:35.870> also<00:01:36.050> very<00:01:36.380> similar<00:01:36.740> coral

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
and there's also very similar coral

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.440 
and there's also very similar coral
called<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.610> dentro<00:01:38.030> philia<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:41.270> only

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
called a dentro philia the only

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.090 
called a dentro philia the only
precaution<00:01:41.660> that<00:01:42.170> I<00:01:42.200> would<00:01:42.440> take<00:01:42.590> is<00:01:42.770> to<00:01:42.920> not

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
precaution that I would take is to not

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.340 
precaution that I would take is to not
over<00:01:43.460> feed<00:01:43.670> the<00:01:43.760> tanks<00:01:44.120> you<00:01:44.630> really<00:01:44.960> want<00:01:45.200> to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
over feed the tanks you really want to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.800 
over feed the tanks you really want to
make<00:01:45.530> sure<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:46.100> most<00:01:46.820> of<00:01:47.180> the<00:01:47.360> food<00:01:47.510> actually

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
make sure that most of the food actually

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.780 
make sure that most of the food actually
makes<00:01:48.260> it<00:01:48.410> into<00:01:48.710> the<00:01:48.740> coral<00:01:49.160> and<00:01:49.400> so<00:01:49.670> it

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
makes it into the coral and so it

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.000 
makes it into the coral and so it
doesn't<00:01:50.090> end<00:01:50.240> up<00:01:50.360> just<00:01:50.600> being<00:01:50.860> pollutants<00:01:51.860> for

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
doesn't end up just being pollutants for

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.170 
doesn't end up just being pollutants for
the<00:01:52.130> tank<00:01:54.190> well<00:01:55.190> I<00:01:55.220> hope<00:01:55.490> you<00:01:55.610> enjoy<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.940> video

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
the tank well I hope you enjoy the video

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.750 
the tank well I hope you enjoy the video
and<00:01:56.450> good<00:01:57.140> luck<00:01:57.170> with<00:01:57.470> your<00:01:57.530> non<00:01:57.800> photos<00:01:58.190> take
