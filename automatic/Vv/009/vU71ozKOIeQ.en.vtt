electricity reducing the demand on the

totally<00:06:06.160> out<00:06:06.310> the<00:06:06.700> beauty<00:06:07.030> about<00:06:07.150> this<00:06:07.330> bottle

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
totally out the beauty about this bottle

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840 
totally out the beauty about this bottle
is<00:06:08.170> that<00:06:08.200> it<00:06:08.500> can<00:06:08.650> still<00:06:08.890> tap<00:06:09.100> into<00:06:09.460> in<00:06:09.580> source

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
is that it can still tap into in source

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.870 
is that it can still tap into in source
of<00:06:09.970> energy<00:06:10.210> nearby<00:06:11.200> so<00:06:11.650> if<00:06:11.830> a<00:06:12.010> neighbor<00:06:12.340> is<00:06:12.700> in

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
of energy nearby so if a neighbor is in

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.030 
of energy nearby so if a neighbor is in
the<00:06:13.030> dark<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:13.480> another<00:06:14.200> one<00:06:14.410> has<00:06:14.590> some<00:06:14.830> light

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
the dark and another one has some light

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.710 
the dark and another one has some light
like<00:06:15.550> that<00:06:15.580> one<00:06:16.000> over<00:06:16.150> there

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 
like that one over there

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.440 
like that one over there
these<00:06:17.260> can<00:06:17.650> tap<00:06:17.860> into<00:06:18.250> that<00:06:18.430> lights<00:06:18.940> and

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
these can tap into that lights and

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.090 
these can tap into that lights and
they'll<00:06:19.690> still<00:06:19.900> get<00:06:20.080> some<00:06:20.260> lights<00:06:20.470> it's<00:06:20.980> one

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:21.100 
they'll still get some lights it's one

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.410 
they'll still get some lights it's one
of<00:06:21.220> those<00:06:21.310> projects<00:06:21.880> they<00:06:21.970> really<00:06:22.180> have<00:06:22.300> to

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
of those projects they really have to

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.030 
of those projects they really have to
see<00:06:22.570> it<00:06:22.600> to<00:06:22.750> believe<00:06:22.960> it<00:06:23.140> we<00:06:23.440> always<00:06:23.650> install

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040 
see it to believe it we always install

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.500 
see it to believe it we always install
kind<00:06:24.280> of<00:06:24.340> in<00:06:24.430> clusters<00:06:24.880> you<00:06:25.120> know<00:06:25.210> one

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
kind of in clusters you know one

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.910 
kind of in clusters you know one
neighbor<00:06:25.750> will<00:06:25.960> install<00:06:26.320> and<00:06:26.530> then<00:06:26.620> all<00:06:26.770> the

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:26.920 
neighbor will install and then all the

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.350 
neighbor will install and then all the
other<00:06:27.040> neighbors<00:06:27.370> over<00:06:27.520> time<00:06:27.790> will<00:06:28.060> want<00:06:28.240> it

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
other neighbors over time will want it

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.120 
other neighbors over time will want it
because<00:06:28.540> it's<00:06:29.440> not<00:06:29.590> one<00:06:29.740> of<00:06:29.770> those<00:06:29.890> things

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
because it's not one of those things

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.320 
because it's not one of those things
that<00:06:30.250> you<00:06:30.400> can<00:06:30.520> just<00:06:30.550> you<00:06:30.910> don't<00:06:31.060> look<00:06:31.150> at<00:06:31.300> a

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
that you can just you don't look at a

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.610 
that you can just you don't look at a
plastic<00:06:31.750> light<00:06:31.900> so<00:06:32.080> do<00:06:32.230> you<00:06:32.320> think<00:06:32.470> you<00:06:32.530> can
