00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.240
 Hello friends, literally five minutes 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.429
 I was asked back by one of my 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.210
 subscribers about what they write 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:15.150
 browser games the fact is that this 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 man he wants to write browser 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:23.100
 the game and how would you think that having studied si plus 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.890
 plus he can do it well at the very 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.400
 to create a browser game or 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.689
 generally any web services need 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.440
 use other languages 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:39.390
 programming in particular is a language 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.890
 php hyper markup language had a mail and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.460
 java script language all these three languages ​​will be 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 interact with each other as if 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 on your website on your in your 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.800
 computer browser game let's 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.059
 we will understand how it will be easiest to learn 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 you create browser games for what 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.710
 This needs to be done first. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.939
 you will need to study out of any 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.420
 programming language any simple language 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.369
 programming any of these 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
 Four languages ​​are great for 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.210
 these goals and you do not need to 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 go deep into the study 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.880
 any of these languages ​​you will need 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.470
 understand only the basics of programming 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.610
 so that later there were no problems with 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.970
 learning programming languages 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.619
 associated with VEB connected to the Internet 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.990
 because in language they are 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.200
 Well, they are a little more zamorochennye than 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.909
 standard therefore happens to people 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.729
 happens well how would they experience some 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.509
 difficulties and so after you 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.579
 study 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.950
 at least superficially one of these 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.409
 languages then you start learning 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.640
 process creation process 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:05.790
 creating the simplest web page 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.409
 they are all created using such 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.409
 technology like html 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.350
 Here and you will have to study thoroughly 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.740
 Well, do not really scare 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.620
 technology well relatively simple 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.760
 as it is much easier than all the others 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.620
 programming languages 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.410
 the fact that in essence this mail is not a language 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.320
 programming is just a language which 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.160
 explains that where on the web page should 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:40.390
 usually be of any difficulty 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.740
 with him no one also feels for 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.770
 this in order to study 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.770
 had a mail there are many different courses 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.170
 on creating websites just sometimes 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.850
 these two concepts are combined into one 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.480
 whole i.e site creation is by 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.060
 Essentially there are studies that mail is more 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.340
 after you learn html you 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.510
 need to learn language 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.370
 php programming actually 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.370
 at this stage there may be 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.270
 some other language in 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.050
 programming but most often 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.710
 use php this language of course already 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.230
 much harder than the language this is the mail 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:26.380
 optional if you still want your 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.330
 your browser game or your browser 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.880
 some kind of web service looked very 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.990
 decent and very beautiful 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:37.660
 neatly you will know well 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.060
 java-script like this 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.630
 sequence well the last step in 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.150
 principle, he is not necessarily well now 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.300
 I think you disassembled your little 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.730
 head how to approach such a complex 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.580
 doing business like creating a browser game or 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.840
 creating someone a browser 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.040
 application i say goodbye to you was 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.040
 Artem Koshevar see you soon
