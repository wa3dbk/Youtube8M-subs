00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.700
 Talk to you, how are you? 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 It's been a while since we've been there. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.040
 today I decided to post a video there one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.889
 simple things like this 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:19.560
 removing a keyboard for maintenance 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.910
 for cleaning a dell inspiron 15 45 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.460
 that equipment equipment of a 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 our customer that we meet 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.320
 It 's some time already got in touch. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.500
 with us saying that the keyboard was 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 searching and with some keys editing 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.670
 without it without it requesting normally 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.750
 that's the way it is, the staff is gone 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.610
 eating things over the keyboard 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 using the equipment on top of the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.670
 I'll do my meals and finish 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 and even the use of the same 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.570
 side of the keyboard that ends up falling 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.270
 things usually a cleaning already 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.629
 resolves ultimately dedicated playing 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.460
 keyboard mouse and keyboard on keyboard 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.750
 granted untouched Portuguese Portuguese 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 Brazilian, right? 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.990
 is easy to find in any 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.990
 supplier here in the process you in 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.710
 you have already exchanged with 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.240
 maintenance goes there and I already left everything 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.189
 dismounted right now 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.140
 although Maria Braga it will show you how 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.790
 makes the food but in the end everything is already 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:28.070
 Ready, I already ate, but let's go. 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.070
 first the battery 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:39.100
 because it has two very 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.770
 important always has a good tool 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:46.270
 tool is a tool with a screw 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.790
 with mari and ax philips né 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:54.100
 can see that it sticks everything easier 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:57.220
 for to do maintenance are two 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:02.520
 screws first according to the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.520
 screw for the afternoon playing right 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.700
 We'll go ahead later. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.830
 the joint screwdriver I 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:24.190
 I bought a good one too, huh? 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.459
 the tool you are going to start this 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:31.390
 I sing here as I'm showing it right 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.680
 it is already connected to a tumble on the screen 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.670
 they do not want any chicken 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.709
 here that piece she is already a little 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.290
 dirty is it to enjoy making a 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:56.049
 then has two other screws 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:03:00.150
 here and here it will take the né 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.150
 I would say that the keyboard is already starting to rise 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:15.489
 I know what to say in my hand already 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:17.530
 screw me here in our 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.799
 always good box also has some 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.120
 place because you put the screws 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.060
 because otherwise you end up losing the 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.629
 bolts are small easy to lose 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.000
 fall to the ground if you do not think so and there you are 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.439
 street just happened 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.170
 It's always good that you have a place to 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:37.150
 save what ends up so you do not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:42.579
 occur here you lose to the spindle 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:46.299
 then it never ends up working well 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:52.680
 well come on, he left here 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.680
 There you will pull it here very calmly. 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.989
 doing here 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:14.019
 Quiet beauty , you 'll leave it there. 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:16.630
 Right here, throw that one up. 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.769
 you can see that fred realizes that he 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:22.840
 It is quite dirty even also in the hair 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.870
 this may appear on the keys 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.510
 Here we go, a little something that we 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:34.270
 ends up using so close and if 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:40.590
 they know not showing 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:44.979
 I was interested again and ready 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:50.680
 left keyboard beauty takes advantage of 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:54.340
 Olympiad here in the regulated environment 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.210
 Makes Everything Work 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:04.449
 if it works or it does not work and it will pick up 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.199
 the customer a good budget value is 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.400
 clear 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.610

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.610
