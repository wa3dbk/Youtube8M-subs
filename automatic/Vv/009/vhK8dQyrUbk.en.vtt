00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.010
 new additional speed round 100 tickets 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.290
 tdm then surgery spins exactly 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.210
 that's what it looks like and I'll take it because 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 someone has also suggested the ak 12 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 in the comments and seeing weapon the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.210
 since the beta actually not so 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.880
 more is played for everyone's snout 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.369
 because they are so full of it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.590
 debate was and we play with 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.199
 now and look what the now 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.939
 here still on it has 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.380
 and yes the server feels again 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.910
 slowly because I was always up to the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.460
 a round is over that I because the 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.140
 next from the beginning can play 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.190
 and there are always very many 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.820
 out and I have always the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.629
 apprehension 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:47.390
 a little laser pointer okay that 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 laser pointer somewhere here is one 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.390
 laser pointer through the turn up there 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.129
 are okay now I run times as long 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.129
 and then I sort of got it 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.940
 Hello 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.120
 good that looks like packs now 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 lie down fuck fuck fuck 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.810
 ok, if there are no grenades from him 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 I also do not know then says 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.740
 let's start from here before here 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.540
 it was just a bit running now 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.220
 clearly that arrives 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.470
 because I'm here on the in there 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.430
 Okay, that came from here 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.070
 or the showdown 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.170
 there was quickly away 120er ex tiger main 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.330
 I believe that it will work well the good 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.820
 the last 10 ok ok with the 160 years 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.680
 really cool weapon for a long time 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.940
 no longer played by the way before the 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.550
 choice but now I really believe 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.960
 He did not take me away quickly 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.580
 hardly the shooting came in there that 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.800
 somewhere on the one we'll get 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.410
 and we also get us instant 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.530
 The service is there in a pick 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.660
 us too and that on one we pick 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.119
 us not but there is still the tiger one 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.320
 I think like the tiger mendes good there 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.790
 Do you ever know to shoot somewhere? 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.800
 that a sniper we do not get 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.930
 revive the special very briefly 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.350
 here from wherever the shot down 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.390
 has been 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.330
 I 'll take care of the opponents over there 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.120
 take care of the star well 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.470
 I do not know if I'm out there now 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.800
 run because they're all here on the left 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.800
 just 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.280
 islam brought him is cool because again 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.950
 came out of the sound of 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.530
 Booster down from the outside from the left 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.180
 I choose rightly and gladly I live really 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.879
 like to hammer again and so on 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.519
 if opponents are funny if allied 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.959
 funny positions are where I am 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.280
 now do not know from where from her 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.920
 be completed or if they are too 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.329
 open are then arbitrarily sometimes 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.610
 not again sometimes I have 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:50.200
 just go and see them often 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.900
 it is then just also so because times 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.400
 let the sniper lie on the belly 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.599
 but cool as you can be very clear 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.519
 shoot through even if they are there too 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.090
 Super quite money back through shoot 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.760
 can 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.840
 driveway facto my god the song who 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.940
 Hilfswerke 73 or kill aid 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.739
 we are here a bit and we have 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.650
 also equal to no more poor one speaks 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:16.170
 from provider as providers need 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:20.519
 Ammunition needs ammunition 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.970
 yes yes yes yes yes yes yes 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.560
 hammergeil okay, all are there in front 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.109
 that means that cross-country skiing is always here 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.690
 that's a bit like that now 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.609
 probably there again that look 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.629
 we'll shoot through if that's because 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.859
 which can hold only a result 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.690
 shoot when you're there a bit 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.040
 shoots early then that works quite well 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.879
 we throw again he down there are 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:47.040
 but which one do I want now ? 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:50.049
 like pure velvet oh hello you're here 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.560
 not a bit to a bit myself 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.560
 flashed 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.990
 margot over there back there back there 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:02.480
 Back away, that was close and away 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:05.570
 all died ok computer away director 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.100
 thomas jetzke out in reverse gear 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.360
 pay attention and when outside and I drive 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.720
 Now everyone is back on the other 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.440
 but as long as there spawn what you 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.060
 still do because we hindu behind us 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.220
 because we do not block the spawn yet 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.910
 comes shortly after nine short under right 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.150
 also a god oh god oh god who is 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:32.620
 Okay, okay, there we go 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.850
 have caught up but nice and then 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.510
 we are now equal to spawn 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.030
 To block 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.550
 we go the sniper I do not bock or 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.620
 where do you come from, what are you doing? 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:45.530
 also a lot of opponents 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:48.110
 Not many not many not many 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.120
 enemy rides were that many and what 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.200
 I wanted to say again because that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 right now this looks like and here 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.010
 not so often loud every round 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.510
 run up by these speed 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.030
 it is not that 30 now 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.290
 gameplays try to record 30 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.870
 gameplay games and then it is better 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.950
 take speed round 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.960
 anyway, anyway 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:10.610
 actually, always every gameplay 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.169
 but also at speed and that's all 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.700
 when it did not so I first leg on 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.100
 a good gameplay and the games in 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:19.250
 Munich is completely relaxed here 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:21.320
 any weapon and afterwards 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.669
 me that too high so no matter how shit 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.680
 I'm here no matter how good I am 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:32.180
 Now I'm loading it all up 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:34.100
 I also really horny because may 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:38.110
 one halo so you can stop 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.730
 hello you have internet group direct okay 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.980
 15 I think actually quite cool 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.510
 because then you also see bad times 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.680
 was round and so does anyway at 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.190
 a distress and so on and worldwide 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.170
 then I also invite each round the next 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.890
 weapon is cool the weapon is cool me 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.530
 Again, he comes on me briefly 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.540
 because I do not think that I am here like this 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.150
 Long play hammergeil gameplay 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.840
 Do you like that we have the tiger ? 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.480
 Long time no see 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.430
 there is again today must say 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:10.150
 I did not know anything like that 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.890
 little important because it can be too 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.420
 that many think that I'm 30 somehow 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.610
 gameplay game and take a best 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.020
 that's not how they are 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.740
 normal just like me just now 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.300
 games 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.820
 I find actually quite cool 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.380
 so that you can see it goes like this 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.580
 but it can work that way though 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.800
 it always occupies quite well 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.970
 I have to run in the speed race 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.210
 just do not say so now 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:33.370
 mega premium hammer horny but already quite 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:37.780
 Okay so it was not over now 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.180
 a mouse is not bad because it is not 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.680
 things that hamas was was too 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.990
 No stuff that we did was good 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:52.710
 okay sniper no the flash because of the 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.710
 death comes here 

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:58.230
 that's how we're made and have nice people too 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.230
 and there I have last two kills 

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:02.310

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:03.060

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:05.430
 normal round 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.890
 as I said I would say 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.690
 say goodbye to this video of 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.640
 this short spd writes in the 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.140

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.060
 then which one I say goodbye 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.650
 if you liked it last in the 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.780
 rating up by that would be awesome 

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.350

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.280

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.210
