agro-ecosystem approach to agriculture
one<00:00:09.990> is<00:00:10.260> that<00:00:10.920> we<00:00:11.070> use<00:00:11.400> far<00:00:12.210> less<00:00:12.240> labour<00:00:12.960> we've

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
one is that we use far less labour we've

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.519 
one is that we use far less labour we've
stopped<00:00:13.980> weeding<00:00:14.809> we<00:00:15.809> don't<00:00:15.990> spray<00:00:16.289> for

fertilizer<00:00:20.600> so<00:00:21.600> we've<00:00:21.869> decreased<00:00:22.410> labour

significantly<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.289> think<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> this

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
significantly we like to think of this

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.450 
significantly we like to think of this

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
managing the system in place so we can

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.750

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
having to use as much labour so we're

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.450

the amount of labour that we have to use

the amount of labour that we have to use
so<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> summarize<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.960> idea<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.850> ecosystem
