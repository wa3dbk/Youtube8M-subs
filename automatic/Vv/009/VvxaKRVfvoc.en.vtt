and<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.640> cockpit<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.179> plane<00:00:30.420> which

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and this is the cockpit the plane which

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.020 
and this is the cockpit the plane which
could<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.109> or<00:00:31.380> modern<00:00:31.679> warfare<00:00:31.859> 2<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.850> we'll

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
could go in or modern warfare 2 so we'll

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.790 
could go in or modern warfare 2 so we'll
go<00:00:33.180> for<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.420> next<00:00:33.660> image<00:00:33.870> now<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.680> is

go for the next image now and this is

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.100 
go for the next image now and this is
the<00:00:34.920> MSR<00:00:35.309> next<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.850> white<00:00:36.090> vehicle<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
the MSR next to this white vehicle the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.380 
the MSR next to this white vehicle the
police<00:00:37.469> car<00:00:37.770> which<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.399> black<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.059> modern

police car which was black on modern
warfare<00:00:39.540> 2<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.559> more<00:00:40.680> today<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.610> can

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
warfare 2 so it's more today and I can

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.119 
warfare 2 so it's more today and I can
see<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> top<00:00:42.270> left<00:00:42.510> corner<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.410> bomb

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
see in the top left corner the bomb

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.979 
see in the top left corner the bomb
science<00:00:44.520> will<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> same<00:00:45.539> place<00:00:45.719> as<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
science will be in the same place as you

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.350 
science will be in the same place as you
go<00:00:46.200> last<00:00:46.410> time<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.250> plane<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
go last time in the plane and in the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.860 
go last time in the plane and in the
corner<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.649> inside<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.399> terminal<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.539> we'll

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
corner the inside of terminal so we'll

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.900 
corner the inside of terminal so we'll
go<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> next<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.730> the

go to the next one now and this is the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
go to the next one now and this is the
logon<00:00:54.239> screen<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.649> obviously<00:00:55.890> won't

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
logon screen now this is obviously won't

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.010 
logon screen now this is obviously won't
look<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> Lord<00:00:57.210> again<00:00:57.480> it's<00:00:57.899> not

of tells them it's the airplane lots
more<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.820> today<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.750> vehicle<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.290> also

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
more up today and the vehicle is also

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.440 
more up today and the vehicle is also
white<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.010> said<00:01:08.220> before<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:09.000> was<00:01:09.030> black

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
white like I said before which was black

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.020 
white like I said before which was black
on<00:01:09.659> modern<00:01:09.900> warfare<00:01:10.049> 2<00:01:10.409> now<00:01:11.220> worm<00:01:11.520> here's<00:01:11.850> what

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
on modern warfare 2 now worm here's what

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.060 
on modern warfare 2 now worm here's what
it<00:01:12.119> look<00:01:12.240> like<00:01:12.270> in<00:01:12.540> private<00:01:12.960> match<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.860> we've

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
it look like in private match so we've

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.620 
it look like in private match so we've
used<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> choose<00:01:14.640> mark<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.090> private<00:01:15.420> market

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
used to choose mark and private market

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.800 
used to choose mark and private market
is<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.140> look<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.810> that's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
is what would look like and that's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
is what would look like and that's
nothing<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.530> see<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.340> there's

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
nothing to see in this one but there's

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.660 
nothing to see in this one but there's
is<00:01:21.119> more<00:01:21.330> proof<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> we've<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:22.860> got<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.310> PP

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
is more proof and we've also got the PP

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.350 
is more proof and we've also got the PP
90<00:01:24.090> m<00:01:24.299> one<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.960> right<00:01:25.590> looking<00:01:25.979> at<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
90 m one in right looking at the

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.359 
90 m one in right looking at the
airplane<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> another<00:01:28.710> image<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
airplane and this is another image and

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
airplane and this is another image and
that's<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.670> he<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.000> peeping<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.540> Ian<00:01:30.720> one

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
that's because he is peeping at Ian one

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
that's because he is peeping at Ian one
this<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> not<00:01:31.740> modern<00:01:32.100> warfare<00:01:32.250> 2<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
this is not modern warfare 2 this is

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.850 
this is not modern warfare 2 this is
actually<00:01:33.150> modern<00:01:33.450> warfare<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.740> isn't

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
actually modern warfare now there isn't

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.100 
actually modern warfare now there isn't
much<00:01:35.159> difference<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.390> is<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.540> slight

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
much difference but there is a slight

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.770 
much difference but there is a slight
