you and the only criticism that I might
have<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.460> lip<00:01:53.820> lipstick<00:01:54.689> is<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.140> some

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
have on this lip lipstick is that some

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.280 
have on this lip lipstick is that some
people<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.920> found<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.399> breaks<00:01:56.759> very<00:01:57.060> easily

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
people have found it breaks very easily

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.810 
people have found it breaks very easily
because<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.500> formulation<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.579> cream

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because the formulation of the cream

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.260 
because the formulation of the cream
team<00:02:00.119> lipsticks<00:02:00.869> they<00:02:01.710> tend<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.340> break<00:02:02.909> or

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
team lipsticks they tend to break or

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.620 
team lipsticks they tend to break or
melt<00:02:03.689> in<00:02:04.020> cars<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:04.710> easily<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> I'd<00:02:06.329> suggest

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
melt in cars very easily so I'd suggest

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.420 
melt in cars very easily so I'd suggest
when<00:02:07.259> applying<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.789> pop<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.270> down<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
when applying it just pop it down to the

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.640 
when applying it just pop it down to the
minimal<00:02:11.430> amount<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.970> lipstick

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
minimal amount of lipstick

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.429 
minimal amount of lipstick
you<00:02:12.890> need<00:02:13.069> in<00:02:13.250> your<00:02:13.420> popping<00:02:14.420> out<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.840> be<00:02:15.379> able

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:15.439 
you need in your popping out to be able

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:17.229

to<00:02:15.590> apply<00:02:15.860> your<00:02:16.129> lipstick<00:02:16.549> so<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.849> doesn't

to apply your lipstick so it doesn't

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.449 
to apply your lipstick so it doesn't
break<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.290> I've<00:02:18.379> actually<00:02:18.470> seen<00:02:18.920> one<00:02:19.129> that<00:02:19.159> has

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
break so I've actually seen one that has

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.850 
break so I've actually seen one that has
broken<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.299> Mac<00:02:20.510> store<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:21.200> visit<00:02:21.680> and

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
broken in the Mac store that I visit and

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.259 
broken in the Mac store that I visit and
they've<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.040> kind<00:02:22.459> of<00:02:22.519> switched<00:02:22.939> it<00:02:23.150> on

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
they've just kind of switched it on

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.420 
they've just kind of switched it on
again<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.900> obviously<00:02:24.530> apply<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.920> using<00:02:25.159> a

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
again and obviously apply it using a

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.140 
again and obviously apply it using a
brush<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:27.140> lip<00:02:27.680> gloss<00:02:28.189> that<00:02:28.220> can<00:02:28.670> go<00:02:28.819> really

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
brush and a lip gloss that can go really

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.929 
brush and a lip gloss that can go really
well<00:02:29.510> over<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.109> top<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.620> know<00:02:31.189> quite<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.549> lot<00:02:31.640> of

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:31.939 
well over the top I know quite a lot of

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.300 
well over the top I know quite a lot of
people<00:02:32.299> like<00:02:32.480> under<00:02:32.989> age<00:02:33.140> to<00:02:33.500> go<00:02:33.650> with<00:02:33.799> angel

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
people like under age to go with angel

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.099 
people like under age to go with angel
and<00:02:34.579> under<00:02:35.239> age<00:02:35.329> would<00:02:35.510> look<00:02:35.659> really<00:02:35.870> good

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
and under age would look really good

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.679 
and under age would look really good
with<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.500> lipstick<00:02:36.920> T<00:02:37.189> I<00:02:37.430> prefer<00:02:38.269> using<00:02:38.450> a

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:38.689 
with this lipstick T I prefer using a

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.920 
with this lipstick T I prefer using a
plush<00:02:38.989> glass<00:02:39.409> and<00:02:39.799> it's<00:02:40.430> called<00:02:40.700> ample<00:02:41.239> pink<00:02:41.599> I

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
plush glass and it's called ample pink I

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.849 
plush glass and it's called ample pink I
think<00:02:42.349> these<00:02:42.680> two<00:02:42.980> colors<00:02:43.489> are<00:02:43.760> very<00:02:44.299> similar

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
think these two colors are very similar

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.899 
think these two colors are very similar
although<00:02:45.859> ample<00:02:46.400> pink<00:02:46.670> is<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:46.879> little<00:02:47.269> warmer

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
although ample pink is a little warmer

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.879 
although ample pink is a little warmer
more<00:02:49.909> raspberry<00:02:50.569> almost<00:02:50.959> more<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.650> pet

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889 
more raspberry almost more of a pet

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.550 
more raspberry almost more of a pet
limiting<00:02:52.549> and<00:02:52.819> so<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.810> think<00:02:53.930> they<00:02:54.139> go<00:02:54.290> really

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
limiting and so I think they go really

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.289 
limiting and so I think they go really
really<00:02:55.069> loud<00:02:55.280> together<00:02:55.700> so<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.000> you've<00:02:56.150> got

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
really loud together so if you've got

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:59.589 
really loud together so if you've got
something<00:02:56.569> like<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.139> it<00:02:57.859> would<00:02:58.099> be<00:02:58.489> ok<00:02:59.000> if

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
something like this it would be ok if

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.330 
something like this it would be ok if
not<00:02:59.629> if<00:02:59.989> you've<00:03:00.109> got<00:03:00.290> underage<00:03:00.709> already<00:03:01.129> you

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
not if you've got underage already you

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
not if you've got underage already you
may<00:03:01.489> put<00:03:01.760> that<00:03:01.939> one<00:03:02.120> or<00:03:02.720> any<00:03:02.959> color<00:03:03.290> really

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
may put that one or any color really

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.179 
may put that one or any color really
show<00:03:04.970> you<00:03:05.060> what<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.299> looks<00:03:05.450> like

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:09.189 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.530 

brush<00:03:10.189> glasses<00:03:10.639> are<00:03:10.760> supposed<00:03:11.090> to<00:03:11.239> make<00:03:11.389> your

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
brush glasses are supposed to make your

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.539 
brush glasses are supposed to make your
lips<00:03:11.780> feel<00:03:11.870> fuller<00:03:12.409> and<00:03:12.530> look<00:03:12.859> a<00:03:12.889> bit<00:03:13.250> fuller

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
lips feel fuller and look a bit fuller

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.449 
lips feel fuller and look a bit fuller
it<00:03:14.090> gives<00:03:14.329> you<00:03:14.389> a<00:03:14.450> slight<00:03:14.720> tingle<00:03:15.290> well<00:03:16.280> that's

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
it gives you a slight tingle well that's

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.699 
it gives you a slight tingle well that's
how<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.669> county<00:03:17.239> lady<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.810> described<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.680> to

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
how the county lady and described it to

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.379 
how the county lady and described it to
me<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.099> don't<00:03:19.310> find<00:03:19.549> it<00:03:19.790> actually<00:03:20.239> does

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
me but I don't find it actually does

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:21.939 
me but I don't find it actually does
anything<00:03:20.569> to<00:03:20.840> my<00:03:20.989> lips<00:03:21.199> I<00:03:21.379> just<00:03:21.560> think<00:03:21.769> it's

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
anything to my lips I just think it's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.369 
anything to my lips I just think it's
really<00:03:22.280> soft<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:22.790> smooth<00:03:23.090> and<00:03:23.329> it's<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.139> really

00:03:24.369 --> 00:03:24.379 
really soft and smooth and it's a really

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.379 
really soft and smooth and it's a really
nice<00:03:24.470> formula<00:03:24.859> so<00:03:25.190> I'd<00:03:25.250> recommend<00:03:25.400> getting

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
nice formula so I'd recommend getting

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.890 
nice formula so I'd recommend getting
something<00:03:27.379> like<00:03:27.709> that<00:03:28.069> so<00:03:28.370> as<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:29.510> can<00:03:29.690> see

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
something like that so as you can see

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.339 
something like that so as you can see
I've<00:03:30.049> got<00:03:30.340> cream<00:03:31.340> Cup<00:03:31.579> on<00:03:31.819> my<00:03:32.060> lips<00:03:32.269> with<00:03:32.540> ample

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
I've got cream Cup on my lips with ample

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.229 
I've got cream Cup on my lips with ample
pink<00:03:33.620> blush<00:03:33.859> glass<00:03:34.129> over<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.760> top<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.209> think

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
pink blush glass over the top I think

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.569 
pink blush glass over the top I think
that<00:03:35.599> just<00:03:36.199> adds<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.620> little<00:03:36.739> bit<00:03:36.889> more<00:03:37.069> shimmer

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
that just adds a little bit more shimmer

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.960 
that just adds a little bit more shimmer
a<00:03:37.730> little<00:03:38.060> bit<00:03:38.180> more<00:03:38.449> gloss<00:03:38.870> and<00:03:39.699> warms<00:03:40.699> up<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
a little bit more gloss and warms up the

a little bit more gloss and warms up the
color<00:03:41.180> a<00:03:41.299> little<00:03:41.389> bit<00:03:41.930> obviously<00:03:42.379> wear<00:03:42.650> it<00:03:42.799> on
