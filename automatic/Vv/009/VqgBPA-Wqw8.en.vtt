00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that's a potentially dangerous mindset

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.139 
that's a potentially dangerous mindset
to<00:00:34.050> be<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.320> if<00:00:34.620> you're<00:00:34.950> too<00:00:35.190> proud<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> realize

to be in if you're too proud to realize
that<00:00:36.360> I<00:00:36.630> knew<00:00:36.809> it<00:00:36.930> was<00:00:37.079> only<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.380> matter<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.829> time

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
that I knew it was only a matter of time

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.880 
that I knew it was only a matter of time
before<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.820> saw<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:40.110> like<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.500> but

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
before we saw that I don't like it but

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.979 
before we saw that I don't like it but
as<00:00:41.040> long<00:00:41.309> as<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.550> winds<00:00:41.730> matches<00:00:42.210> it's<00:00:42.420> going

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
as long as it winds matches it's going

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.040 
as long as it winds matches it's going
to<00:00:43.079> keep<00:00:43.350> happening<00:00:43.879> that's<00:00:44.879> what<00:00:45.239> matters<00:00:45.840> if

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to keep happening that's what matters if

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
to keep happening that's what matters if
you're<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.410> doing<00:00:46.680> everything<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.430> can<00:00:47.460> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
you're not doing everything you can to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.500 
you're not doing everything you can to
win<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> wrong<00:00:49.020> business

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.110 

now<00:00:56.109> that's<00:00:56.469> the<00:00:56.679> way<00:00:56.980> to<00:00:57.039> do<00:00:57.309> it<00:00:57.519> let<00:00:57.850> your

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
now that's the way to do it let your

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.869 
now that's the way to do it let your
opponent<00:00:58.269> know<00:00:58.899> who's<00:00:59.320> boss<00:00:59.739> where<00:01:00.579> you<00:01:00.730> can

just keep posturing and give your

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.510 
just keep posturing and give your
opponent<00:01:02.649> time<00:01:03.039> to<00:01:03.159> recover

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.990 

this<00:02:22.990> has<00:02:23.260> been<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.440> great<00:02:23.740> match<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.400> far<00:02:24.430> but

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
this has been a great match so far but

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.940 
this has been a great match so far but
that<00:02:25.030> isn't<00:02:25.720> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.990> make<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.200> proper<00:02:26.920> but

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
that isn't going to make you proper but

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.790 
that isn't going to make you proper but
you<00:02:27.310> gotta<00:02:27.580> do<00:02:27.910> whatever<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.569> takes<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:29.080> win<00:02:29.230> I

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
you gotta do whatever it takes to win I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
you gotta do whatever it takes to win I
just<00:02:30.490> think<00:02:30.730> it's<00:02:30.880> unfortunate<00:02:31.240> whenever<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
just think it's unfortunate whenever a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.230 
just think it's unfortunate whenever a
superstar<00:02:32.440> decides<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.040> cheat<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.310> win<00:02:33.490> rather

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
superstar decides to cheat to win rather

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.660 
superstar decides to cheat to win rather
