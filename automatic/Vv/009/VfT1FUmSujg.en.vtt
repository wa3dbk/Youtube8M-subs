00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.180
 Continue to be second day for you today 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.100
 even the breath of 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.700
 In addition, a round also occurs 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.700
 the campsite 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.660
 another 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.080
 most important thing we rush with 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:08.799
 have two weeks the first one is this 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.549
 value consistent what just contender 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:11.549
 the lock 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:32.410
 The exterior of the piano and the band of the 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.870
 plates to the mega well chosen as 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.210
 you know something from the black nation 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.050
 location better had to walk a lot 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.180
 that sucks 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.979
 but the band single the box playground 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 matching conclusion pÃ¶rner new karl 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:54.729
 force kicked was cool but I think 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:58.000
 but much more than the most important thing in the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.509
 mito to maine comfort ticket i am 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.400
 a tent at tent does not take itself 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.640
 and therefore punish in comfort 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.520
 least important 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.630
 the unimportant very clear that antibes 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:18.570
 be time you could have so 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.370
 like parasites and they are from south tyrol 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:26.920
 what must necessarily with luggage 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:29.410
 if you weigh that we clearly here 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.360
 can you drink so you get up and drink 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.510
 you can sleep and beer is easy 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.280
 Always the most important contract I make 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.320
 have the principle with me 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:43.420
 it fits in well it will be fun 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.290
 vanilla smells of vanilla 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 the fee 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 sorry 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.380
 only one role only plays a role for me 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.950
 do not go packing that often 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.709
 No, but I'm not there anymore 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.100
 unimportant what you meter there I am 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:13.860
 of course prepared for this question 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:16.110
 beware of the year 2011 for 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.880
 to pay attention to nostalgic moments 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.420
 a good mood always you were always the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.420
 best mood 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.840
 is 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840
 Yes 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.160
 6 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:58.010
 Do you know what I mean? 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.010
 already dead
