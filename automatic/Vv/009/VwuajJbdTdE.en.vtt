00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
key there something seemed to just get

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.230 
key there something seemed to just get
stuck<00:00:19.949> in<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> ignition<00:00:24.390> tumbler

the it would not get flat and on YouTube

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.119 
the it would not get flat and on YouTube
I<00:00:49.140> found<00:00:49.739> some<00:00:49.980> other<00:00:50.129> videos<00:00:52.129> recommending

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
I found some other videos recommending

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.150 
I found some other videos recommending
in<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.090> problems<00:00:55.820> use<00:00:57.530> some<00:00:58.530> pin

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
in these kind of problems use some pin

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
in these kind of problems use some pin
like<00:00:59.760> this<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.859> align<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.219> small<00:01:03.170> pinhole

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
like this and align this small pinhole

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.340 
like this and align this small pinhole
over<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> tumbler<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
getting the key into ignition position

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.390 
getting the key into ignition position
and<00:01:11.330> I<00:01:12.330> would<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.930> able<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.979> tumbler

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and I would be able to get this tumbler

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.060 
and I would be able to get this tumbler
out<00:01:15.049> this<00:01:16.049> barrel<00:01:16.640> for<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> key<00:01:17.909> but<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:19.590> this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
out this barrel for the key but in this

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
out this barrel for the key but in this
case<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.689> case<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:23.520> problem<00:01:23.880> was

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
case it was not the case the problem was

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.219 
case it was not the case the problem was
I<00:01:24.360> was<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.320> able<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.830> turn<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.759> key<00:01:27.229> forward

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
I was not able to turn the key forward

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.460 
I was not able to turn the key forward
direction<00:01:28.950> like<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.700> would<00:01:29.909> start<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.299> car<00:01:30.540> but

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
direction like I would start the car but

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.300 
direction like I would start the car but
I<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:32.100> able<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.600> infinitely<00:01:33.920> turn<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> key

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I was able to infinitely turn the key

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
I was able to infinitely turn the key
backwards<00:01:35.850> like<00:01:36.890> counterclockwise<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
backwards like counterclockwise and the

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.190 
backwards like counterclockwise and the
whole<00:01:40.829> problem<00:01:41.100> can<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:42.000> solved<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.990> easy

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
whole problem can be solved really easy

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:52.399 
whole problem can be solved really easy
you<00:01:44.189> just<00:01:44.700> just<00:01:45.509> have<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.790> take<00:01:47.840> take<00:01:48.840> off<00:01:51.409> this

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
you just just have to take take off this

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.980 
you just just have to take take off this
ignition<00:01:52.950> switch<00:01:53.399> from<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.600> side

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
ignition switch from the other side

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.359 
ignition switch from the other side
where<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.680> lays<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.759> this<00:01:56.969> here<00:01:58.369> first

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
where it lays like this here first

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.170 
where it lays like this here first
disconnecting<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.619> big<00:02:02.490> plug<00:02:02.729> from<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
disconnecting the big plug from it and

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.760 
disconnecting the big plug from it and
after<00:02:06.180> then<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:08.690> screw<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.899> these

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
after then you have to screw out these

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.400 
after then you have to screw out these
two<00:02:11.610> Torx<00:02:12.150> screws

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
two Torx screws

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.120 
two Torx screws
see<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.070> maybe<00:02:15.830> so

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
see here maybe so

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.560 
see here maybe so
this<00:02:18.000> one<00:02:18.290> here<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.320> one<00:02:19.590> big<00:02:20.550> screw<00:02:20.880> with

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
this one here is one big screw with

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:28.150 
this one here is one big screw with
torques<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:24.470> another<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.880> right<00:02:26.880> over<00:02:26.910> here

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
torques and another one right over here

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.820 
torques and another one right over here
so<00:02:29.160> after<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.730> take<00:02:30.030> them<00:02:30.210> out<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:31.470> are<00:02:31.620> able

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
so after you take them out you are able

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.680 
so after you take them out you are able
to<00:02:32.130> move<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:33.920> plastic<00:02:34.920> assembly<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.640> bit<00:02:36.120> away

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
to move this plastic assembly a bit away

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.340 
to move this plastic assembly a bit away
from<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.050> steering<00:02:37.290> column<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:39.110> after<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
from the steering column and after that

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.100 
from the steering column and after that
there<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:40.920> two<00:02:41.130> small<00:02:43.160> screws<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:45.750> can<00:02:45.930> see

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
there are two small screws you can see

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.640 
there are two small screws you can see
here<00:02:47.690> one<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:49.050> them<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.850> I<00:02:51.480> will<00:02:52.140> try<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.410> get

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
here one of them and I will try to get

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.630 
here one of them and I will try to get
the<00:02:53.160> other<00:02:53.240> one<00:02:54.240> also<00:02:55.040> in<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.160> picture<00:02:56.990> it<00:02:57.990> was

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
the other one also in the picture it was

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.440 
the other one also in the picture it was
this<00:02:59.640> one<00:02:59.880> here<00:03:00.590> at<00:03:01.590> first<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.640> you<00:03:03.180> may

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
this one here at first you can you may

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.380 
this one here at first you can you may
you<00:03:03.870> might<00:03:04.140> miss<00:03:04.500> them<00:03:04.890> because<00:03:05.370> they<00:03:06.120> have

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
you might miss them because they have

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.090 
you might miss them because they have
some<00:03:06.660> kind<00:03:06.690> of<00:03:07.020> red<00:03:07.980> paint<00:03:09.260> cover<00:03:10.260> over<00:03:10.860> them

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
some kind of red paint cover over them

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.960 
some kind of red paint cover over them
so<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.700> might<00:03:12.560> not<00:03:13.560> recognize<00:03:13.770> vemma<00:03:14.490> screws

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so you might not recognize vemma screws

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.830 
so you might not recognize vemma screws
but<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:15.990> put<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.560> screwdriver<00:03:16.830> in<00:03:17.840> rub

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
but you just put the screwdriver in rub

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.270 
but you just put the screwdriver in rub
it<00:03:18.959> a<00:03:19.050> bit<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.540> color<00:03:21.540> gets<00:03:21.840> loose<00:03:22.080> and

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.570 

after<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.520> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.270> see<00:03:27.450> there<00:03:28.370> these<00:03:29.370> two

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
after that you can see there these two

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.340 
after that you can see there these two
screws<00:03:29.880> here<00:03:31.280> when<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.430> an<00:03:32.610> tighten<00:03:33.030> them<00:03:33.350> you

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
after I moved it from not with the key

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.219 
after I moved it from not with the key
from<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:40.500> other<00:04:40.710> side<00:04:41.039> but<00:04:41.750> using<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.870> pillars

here and moving a bit forward and
backward

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
backward

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.990

now it's walking again like it should
and<00:04:52.250> here's<00:04:53.250> the<00:04:53.460> key<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:56.630> you<00:04:57.630> can<00:04:57.840> see<00:04:59.060> it's

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.850 
and here's the key and you can see it's
normal<00:05:00.750> operation<00:05:01.259> again<00:05:02.120> it<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.330> be<00:05:03.479> turned

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
normal operation again it can be turned

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.379 
normal operation again it can be turned
and<00:05:05.030> it<00:05:06.030> just<00:05:06.300> was<00:05:06.539> and<00:05:06.870> it<00:05:07.620> was<00:05:07.919> stuck

and it just was and it was stuck
somewhere<00:05:09.470> in<00:05:10.470> a<00:05:10.620> position<00:05:10.919> like<00:05:12.590> deeper

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
somewhere in a position like deeper

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.559 
somewhere in a position like deeper
inside<00:05:13.979> and<00:05:14.729> so<00:05:15.509> I<00:05:16.580> was<00:05:17.580> not<00:05:17.610> able<00:05:17.940> to<00:05:18.120> change

the ignition switch position with the

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.460 
the ignition switch position with the
key<00:05:22.770> so<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:23.909> hope<00:05:24.210> this<00:05:24.419> helps<00:05:24.900> for<00:05:25.110> someone
