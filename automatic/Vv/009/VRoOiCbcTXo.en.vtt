grade too many of the question may very
well<00:00:07.740> seem<00:00:08.010> inconsequential<00:00:08.400> but<00:00:09.090> for<00:00:09.240> a

what<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> my<00:00:16.139> favorite<00:00:16.470> number<00:00:16.590> at<00:00:17.300> first<00:00:18.300> I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
what is my favorite number at first I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.640 
what is my favorite number at first I
thought<00:00:18.539> about<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.869> for<00:00:19.140> something<00:00:19.439> kooky

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
thought about going for something kooky

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.349 
thought about going for something kooky
like<00:00:19.980> PI<00:00:20.189> or<00:00:20.490> E<00:00:20.730> but<00:00:20.910> then<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.150> thought

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
like PI or E but then I just thought

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.810 
like PI or E but then I just thought
that<00:00:21.660> sounded<00:00:21.960> irrational<00:00:22.590> then<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.609> thought

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
that sounded irrational then I thought

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.800 
that sounded irrational then I thought
about<00:00:23.850> choosing<00:00:24.390> something<00:00:24.570> utilitarian

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
about choosing something utilitarian

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.839 
about choosing something utilitarian
like<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.740> or<00:00:25.949> maybe<00:00:26.070> I'd<00:00:26.250> go<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:26.519> something

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
like one or maybe I'd go with something

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
like one or maybe I'd go with something
with<00:00:26.880> some<00:00:27.180> symmetry<00:00:27.630> like<00:00:27.779> 22<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.439> with

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with some symmetry like 22 or with

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
with some symmetry like 22 or with
something<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.340> felt<00:00:29.580> right<00:00:29.699> like<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
something that just felt right like the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
something that just felt right like the
number<00:00:30.269> 63<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.500> after<00:00:31.740> many<00:00:31.890> years<00:00:31.980> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
number 63 but after many years of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.860 
number 63 but after many years of
mulling<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.640> over<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.030> my<00:00:33.059> head<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.390> finally

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
mulling it over in my head I finally

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.760 
mulling it over in my head I finally
come<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> decision

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
come to a decision

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.200 
come to a decision
a<00:00:34.800> decision<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.460> could<00:00:35.670> Rock<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.880> very

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
a decision that could Rock the very

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.400 
a decision that could Rock the very
foundation<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:36.960> career<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
foundation of my career as a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.170 
foundation of my career as a
mathematician<00:00:37.790> my<00:00:38.790> favorite<00:00:39.149> number<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> 9

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
mathematician my favorite number is 9

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
mathematician my favorite number is 9
now<00:00:42.180> given<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.540> interest<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.989> magic<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.379> guess

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
now given my interest in magic I guess

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.660 
now given my interest in magic I guess
my<00:00:43.710> decision<00:00:44.100> shouldn't<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.520> all<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
my decision shouldn't be all that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.580 
my decision shouldn't be all that
surprising<00:00:45.329> after<00:00:45.450> all<00:00:46.020> 9<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.350> widely

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
surprising after all 9 is widely

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
surprising after all 9 is widely
considered<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> most<00:00:47.579> magical<00:00:47.820> number

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
considered to be the most magical number

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.209 
considered to be the most magical number
perhaps<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.260> because<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.590> shows<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> so

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
perhaps it's because it shows up in so

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.040 
perhaps it's because it shows up in so

its dimensions are three by three by

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
three which makes 27 again if we add up

the two and seven we get nine

coincidence<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.240> not<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.049> turns<00:01:10.799> out

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
coincidence I think not it turns out

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
coincidence I think not it turns out

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
that all of the multiples of nine seem

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.219

previous numbers and if we add up each
of<00:01:29.610> these<00:01:29.700> pairs<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.180> find<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> sum<00:01:30.960> of

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
of these pairs we find that the sum of

of these pairs we find that the sum of

each of them is 99 it seems as if nines

this<00:01:57.750> seems<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.110> violate<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.500> previous

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
this seems to violate our previous

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.380 
this seems to violate our previous
pattern<00:01:59.250> until<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> realize<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.180> add

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
pattern until you realize that if we add

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.969 
pattern until you realize that if we add
up<00:02:00.509> these<00:02:00.659> two<00:02:00.719> digits<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.380> again<00:02:01.619> return<00:02:01.950> to

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
up these two digits we again return to

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.429 
up these two digits we again return to
nine<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.360> turns<00:02:03.570> out<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.750> even<00:02:04.020> numbers

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
nine and it turns out that even numbers

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.959 
nine and it turns out that even numbers
that<00:02:04.560> aren't<00:02:04.770> multiples<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.340> nine<00:02:05.549> still<00:02:05.820> have

that aren't multiples of nine still have

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.730 
that aren't multiples of nine still have
a<00:02:06.000> strange<00:02:06.299> relationship<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.930> nine<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
a strange relationship with nine for

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.199 
a strange relationship with nine for
example<00:02:08.220> if<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.399> take<00:02:08.550> 83

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
example if I take 83

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.510 
example if I take 83
mix<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.810> digits<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.200> subtract<00:02:10.679> I<00:02:10.860> get<00:02:11.220> 45

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
mix up the digits and subtract I get 45

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.190 
mix up the digits and subtract I get 45
which<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.270> know<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.599> multiple<00:02:12.930> of<00:02:12.959> nine

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
which I know is a multiple of nine

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.820 
which I know is a multiple of nine
because<00:02:13.530> four

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
because four

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.530 
because four
plus<00:02:13.980> five<00:02:14.190> equals<00:02:14.400> nine<00:02:14.850> interestingly

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
plus five equals nine interestingly

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.360 
plus five equals nine interestingly
enough<00:02:16.050> mathematicians<00:02:16.800> actually<00:02:17.220> have<00:02:17.340> a

enough mathematicians actually have a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.890 
enough mathematicians actually have a
name<00:02:17.580> for<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.910> idea<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.330> summing<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.750> the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
digits of a number they call it a

digits of a number they call it a
digital<00:02:20.970> root<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.750> 76<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.890> seven<00:02:23.160> plus

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
digital root so 76 is just seven plus

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.520 
digital root so 76 is just seven plus
six<00:02:23.640> which<00:02:23.760> equals<00:02:24.120> thirteen<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:25.080> add<00:02:25.260> up<00:02:25.410> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
six which equals thirteen we add up the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.620 
six which equals thirteen we add up the
one<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> three<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.190> we<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.550> four<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.270> four<00:02:27.600> is

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
one and three and we get four so four is

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.350 
one and three and we get four so four is
the<00:02:27.930> digital<00:02:28.260> root<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.560> 76<00:02:29.150> surprisingly<00:02:30.150> this

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the digital root of 76 surprisingly this

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.330 
the digital root of 76 surprisingly this
digital<00:02:30.780> root<00:02:30.930> tells<00:02:31.200> us<00:02:31.290> something<00:02:31.500> about<00:02:31.680> 76

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
digital root tells us something about 76

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870

must be 9 I know I need 6 more to reach
9<00:04:04.709> which<00:04:05.160> means<00:04:05.190> I<00:04:05.610> know<00:04:05.670> with<00:04:05.910> 100%<00:04:06.120> certainty

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.820 
so why is 9 so magical well it's because
it's<00:04:12.360> the<00:04:12.600> last<00:04:12.870> digit<00:04:13.200> in<00:04:13.290> our<00:04:13.410> base<00:04:13.590> 10
