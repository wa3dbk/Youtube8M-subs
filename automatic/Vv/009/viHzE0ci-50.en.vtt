 we're sorry that heretics have 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 not wanting to introduce the new 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.859
 emission so true but this is 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.410
 no matter the forum pearls are meyer 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.720

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.560
 first pearl and we find once 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.119
 moreover someone who uses our good 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.660
 old rapper words for purposes 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.790
 comic 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.739
 he must be the best known moderator 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 on the forum to force is to have 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.420
 posts completely dedicated to him filled 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.320
 troll begging to be dany 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.820

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.910

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 always spoken of speaker words he 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.309
 ends up not showing any more of all 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.840
 would have said they do it on purpose nothing 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.050
 than to land in this show 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.449
 let's go to pair number 2 so far 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.160
 there is nothing wrong with players 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.690
 who sign to the so-called good car 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.789
 secure and we try to lead 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.470
 multiplied during the night then to their 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.150
 does it happen that fans who make fun they have 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.770
 so much of him because the player in 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.530
 question did not know he received 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.240
 this reward thanks or terminator 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.220

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.890
 elements you feel interested reward 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.320

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.420
 of this player if it was really a bug 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.939
 I did not tell anyone easy 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.100
 Users packages fail too lol 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.770
 death that kills and move on to the pair the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.570
 number 3 here we find a player 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.549
 who expresses his rage against a class 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.650
 unidentified who apparently makes him 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.840
 to rage like a pig in parcel I'm 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.229
 asks which class is in question 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.659
 launch bets 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.240
 I bet it's at noam oda and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.369
 times jean kévin it's obvious that the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 class in question is a sacred it's 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 a fucking class abused my case my 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.189
 does not stop valuing after each 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.520
 update but well let's move on to the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.720
 fourth pair 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.830
 remember in an old issue 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.690
 winter said forum 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.190
 he already had a pearl of a person 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.150
 who was afraid that these living things 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 handle these items 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.220
 here we have a similar case except that 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 he is downright scared and his object 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.710
 alive kills him if your living object you 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.880
 also sends death threats cuilhé 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.800
 I would have liked to be one of the objects 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.760
 living terrethique I would have made him 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.490
 impossible life 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.890
 although this is already the case let's move on to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.130
 the last pair got the best for the 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 end 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.880
 a person who makes an attempt to 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.890
 corruption to recover his 14 from 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.250
 yves company 200 euros it's not 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.050
 a lot 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.940
 I wonder if developers have 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.680
 taken seriously if he had put a price 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.160
 higher in any case it was good 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.470
 tried 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 in any case if he seeks in a way 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.020
 original of this ban of the forum he has 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.840
 well found 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.670
 here we come to the end of the video 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.800
