00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
is a beautiful white PlayStation 3

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.250 
is a beautiful white PlayStation 3
controller<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.670> DualShock<00:03:03.300> 3<00:03:03.330> so<00:03:03.990> it<00:03:04.080> has

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
controller to the DualShock 3 so it has

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.970 
controller to the DualShock 3 so it has
that<00:03:04.530> Rumble<00:03:06.020> looks<00:03:07.020> really<00:03:07.440> good<00:03:09.800> for<00:03:10.800> some

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that Rumble looks really good for some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.170 
that Rumble looks really good for some
reason<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.370> looks<00:03:11.550> a<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.730> different<00:03:11.940> than

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
reason it looks a little different than

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.600 
reason it looks a little different than
my<00:03:12.450> dual<00:03:12.750> shot<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.380> don't<00:03:13.560> know<00:03:13.800> maybe<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.490> don't

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
my dual shot I don't know maybe I don't

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.140 
my dual shot I don't know maybe I don't
have<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.970> dual<00:03:15.210> shock<00:03:15.450> 3<00:03:15.480> but<00:03:15.900> this<00:03:16.050> looks<00:03:16.290> good

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
have a dual shock 3 but this looks good

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.150 
have a dual shock 3 but this looks good
and<00:03:18.150> then<00:03:18.300> we<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:18.660> some<00:03:18.930> good<00:03:19.170> old<00:03:19.200> cords

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and then we have some good old cords

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.890 
and then we have some good old cords
here<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.940> guess<00:03:21.630> this<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.170> power<00:03:22.470> cable<00:03:22.590> and

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
here I guess this is the power cable and

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.190 
here I guess this is the power cable and
right<00:03:24.900> here<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.440> USB<00:03:26.690> cable<00:03:27.690> so<00:03:28.020> that

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
right here you have USB cable so that

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.400 
right here you have USB cable so that
you<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.650> charge<00:03:28.920> up<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.780> controller<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
you can charge up your controller and

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.610 
you can charge up your controller and
your<00:03:32.010> headset<00:03:32.820> or<00:03:32.850> whatever<00:03:33.620> other

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
your headset or whatever other

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.660 
your headset or whatever other
accessories<00:03:35.400> you<00:03:35.580> may<00:03:35.760> have<00:03:36.030> and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
accessories you may have and

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.310 
accessories you may have and
unfortunately<00:03:39.020> we<00:03:40.020> have<00:03:40.170> composite<00:03:41.010> cables

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
unfortunately we have composite cables

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.870 
unfortunately we have composite cables
you<00:03:43.320> know<00:03:43.440> you<00:03:43.500> would<00:03:43.800> think<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.160> Sony<00:03:44.610> would

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
you know you would think that Sony would

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.210 
you know you would think that Sony would
box<00:03:45.120> in<00:03:45.360> at<00:03:45.480> least<00:03:45.660> component<00:03:46.410> cables<00:03:46.860> so<00:03:47.100> we

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
box in at least component cables so we

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.180 
box in at least component cables so we
could<00:03:47.370> play<00:03:47.580> in<00:03:47.700> HD<00:03:47.880> but<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.830> guess<00:03:49.830> that's<00:03:50.040> up

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
could play in HD but I guess that's up

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.840 
could play in HD but I guess that's up
to<00:03:50.370> us

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
to us

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.910 
to us
actually<00:03:51.240> I<00:03:51.270> think<00:03:51.390> I<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.810> an<00:03:51.930> extra<00:03:52.230> HDMI

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
actually I think I have an extra HDMI

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.370 
actually I think I have an extra HDMI
cable<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.610> I'm<00:03:53.940> gonna<00:03:54.420> be<00:03:54.570> playing<00:03:54.840> in<00:03:55.050> HD

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
cable so I'm gonna be playing in HD

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.080 
cable so I'm gonna be playing in HD
regardless<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:57.090> now<00:03:57.570> we'll<00:03:58.380> get<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.090> good

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
regardless and now we'll get to the good

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.900 
regardless and now we'll get to the good
stuff<00:04:00.560> this<00:04:01.560> won't<00:04:01.890> be<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.430> is<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.730> guess

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
stuff this won't be it this is I guess

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.949 
stuff this won't be it this is I guess
it's<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.150> some<00:04:03.420> pamphlets<00:04:04.260> or<00:04:04.680> whatever

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
it's just some pamphlets or whatever

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
all the same stuff that we've seen on

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.080 
all the same stuff that we've seen on
the<00:05:27.599> PlayStation<00:05:28.169> 3<00:05:28.200> before<00:05:28.560> I<00:05:29.010> guess<00:05:29.940> the

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
the PlayStation 3 before I guess the

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.690 
the PlayStation 3 before I guess the
only<00:05:30.240> difference<00:05:30.840> let's<00:05:31.650> take<00:05:31.889> this<00:05:32.070> tape<00:05:32.400> off

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
only difference let's take this tape off

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.760 
only difference let's take this tape off
here<00:05:33.560> would<00:05:34.560> be<00:05:34.740> the<00:05:34.919> fact<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:36.500> this<00:05:37.500> thing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
here would be the fact that this thing

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.330 
here would be the fact that this thing
is<00:05:37.919> no<00:05:38.099> longer<00:05:38.340> motorized<00:05:39.919> you<00:05:40.919> basically

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
is no longer motorized you basically

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.870 
is no longer motorized you basically
slide<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:42.389> out<00:05:42.539> like<00:05:42.780> that<00:05:43.340> to<00:05:44.340> put<00:05:44.490> your<00:05:44.699> game

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
slide it out like that to put your game

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.950 
slide it out like that to put your game
in<00:05:45.860> then<00:05:46.860> you<00:05:47.039> can<00:05:47.669> do<00:05:47.849> that<00:05:48.030> to<00:05:48.180> close<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:48.599> up

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
in then you can do that to close it up

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.659 
in then you can do that to close it up
I<00:05:48.990> think<00:05:49.650> there's<00:05:49.830> yeah<00:05:50.039> there's<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.340> button

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
I think there's yeah there's a button

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.870 
I think there's yeah there's a button
here<00:05:50.789> as<00:05:51.150> well<00:05:51.560> that<00:05:52.560> does<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:53.099> so<00:05:53.550> don't<00:05:53.760> do<00:05:53.849> it

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
here as well that does it so don't do it

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:58.189 
here as well that does it so don't do it
automatically<00:05:56.000> but<00:05:57.000> you<00:05:57.599> also<00:05:57.720> have<00:05:58.050> that

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
automatically but you also have that

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:00.950 
automatically but you also have that
option<00:05:58.440> of<00:05:58.740> doing<00:05:58.889> it<00:05:59.160> manually<00:05:59.780> it's<00:06:00.780> pretty

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
option of doing it manually it's pretty

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.810 
option of doing it manually it's pretty
good<00:06:01.139> so<00:06:01.500> if<00:06:01.620> this<00:06:01.770> thing<00:06:01.830> craps<00:06:02.340> out<00:06:02.550> I<00:06:02.610> don't

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
good so if this thing craps out I don't

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.390 
good so if this thing craps out I don't
have<00:06:02.940> to<00:06:03.060> worry<00:06:03.330> about<00:06:03.510> a<00:06:03.930> disk<00:06:04.530> being<00:06:04.949> stuck

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400
