00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.600
 why is this palm so special 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.470
 look closer you'll see it's 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.570
 a palm 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.900
 to oil its fruits certainly to produce 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.900
 Palm oil 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.270
 palm oil this may seem 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.190
 exotic but actually told us he 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.230
 they have every day this is one of 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.360
 ingredients of chocolate margarine 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.950
 of laundry lipsticks of 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.660
 creams shampoos pastries 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.970
 baby food sweets or 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.739
 Deodorants in Africa and Asia 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.400
 palm oil is used for the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.110
 cooked 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.970
 we actually eat a lot of oil 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 palm 12 million hectares of 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.330
 lands are already covered with plantations 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.710
 of oil palms essentially in 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.930
 malaysia and indonesia 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.250
 that's about a third of the 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.750
 territory of germany 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.550
 palm oil was at the origin of the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.820
 destruction of huge forest areas 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.980
 particularly between 1980 and 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.910
 2000 the precious habitat for wildlife 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.620
 and the flora were destroyed 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.390
 it is not necessary to kill 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.560
 trees to produce oil from 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.480
 webbed 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.830
 how to break this link between oil from 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.660
 palm and deforestation 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.710
 what does wwf do since 2002 wwf 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.360
 negotiated with all parties 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.250
 stakeholders involved in production 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.170
 palm oil large companies 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.450
 as small farmers producing and 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.060
 merchants maker of shampoo and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.440
 chocolate supermarket banks 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.750
 investors and other organizations 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.370
 nongovernmental activist for the 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.620
 nature conservation and rights 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.170
 humans the goal is to find a 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.090
 solution together we know that no 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.520
 organization has all the answers and 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.200
 that's why the wwf invited the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.409
 stakeholders to come together for the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.479
 first time a great start 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.829
 this resulted in the creation of the 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.979
 round table for a palm oil 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.960
 sustainable rsp or a ngo booming 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.729
 with more than 500 members 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.429
 work together to make the oil 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.109
 palm more durable to all its members 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.549
 account for almost half of the 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.590
 global production of palm oil 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.090
 find solutions and compromises 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.799
 is long and difficult 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.759
 each party puts forward its own 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.590
 prospects the wwf militates well for the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.390
 preservation of nature and for that 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.860
 palm oil benefits the little ones 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.870
 farmers and communities 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.299
 the majority of decisions are made by 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.620
 consensus among the numbers it does not matter 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.049
 not to put anyone in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.030
 minority the council is composed of sixteen 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:25.740
 seats including four reserved for ngos 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.900
 one of the great successes of this 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.850
 round table is the creation of a system 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.600
 certification for a palm oil 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.850
 durable 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.319
 this certification system contribute to 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.319
 protect nature and men 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.930
 guaranteed to workers conditions 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:42.250
 working and just salary 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.650
 and it ensures that the populations 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.950
 local authorities can not be deprived of their 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.560
 land 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.510
 Another success of deforestation 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.670
 precious natural rainforests is 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.590
 forbids areas rich in 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.150
 biodiversity and threatened species 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.150
 are under strict protection 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.220
 and who controls that the certifiers 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 independent and qualified inspect 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.920
 each plantation to ensure 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.870
 that they meet these criteria 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.560
 their reports can be viewed 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.750
 on the site ww outdoor sp at the point 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.819
 org and anyone who thinks there is 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.739
 had had violation of the rules of the rsp 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.840
 we are entitled to lodge a complaint 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.489
 at the round table 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.200
 what are the achievements of the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.640
 round table so far 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.129
 more than 10% of world production 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.840
 of palm oil are certified according to 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.730
 the standards of the round table 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.319
 more than one million hectares of land 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.349
 have been certified by experts 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.849
 independent and approved so far 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.060
 still a long way to go 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.110
 for the majority of producers the rsp 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.000
 au is not perfect 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.069
 alone she will not be able to stem the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.510
 deforestation of tropical forests but 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.050
 this round table is a part of the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.269
 solution 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.010
 other measures are to be taken 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.410
 areas really protect better 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.940
 plan land use engage 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.099
 companies to stock up as soon as 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.330
 present no lasting palm do the 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.819
 promoting sustainable palm oil 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.040
 in international law or again 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.700
 help consumers to make 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.579
 informed choices 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.579
 it is the work of the wwf
