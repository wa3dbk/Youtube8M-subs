eight<00:01:01.500> month<00:01:01.740> old<00:01:01.920> dog<00:01:02.310> is<00:01:02.580> a<00:01:02.640> lot<00:01:03.030> easier<00:01:03.330> to

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
eight month old dog is a lot easier to

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.479 
eight month old dog is a lot easier to
force<00:01:03.870> fetch<00:01:04.140> than<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> nine<00:01:04.739> ten<00:01:05.100> eleven

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
force fetch than the nine ten eleven

twelve<00:01:05.519> month<00:01:06.359> or<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> little<00:01:07.140> over<00:01:07.259> a<00:01:07.409> year<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
twelve month or a little over a year the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800 
twelve month or a little over a year the
reason<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:08.789> the<00:01:09.030> older<00:01:09.270> they<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.600> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
reason is because the older they are the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.419 
reason is because the older they are the
stronger<00:01:10.079> they're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.469> to<00:01:10.560> be<00:01:10.679> bigger<00:01:11.100> dogs

00:01:11.419 --> 00:01:11.429 
stronger they're going to be bigger dogs

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.539 
stronger they're going to be bigger dogs
are<00:01:11.700> going<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.149> be<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.450> harder<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> handle

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
are going to be a lot harder to handle

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.050 
are going to be a lot harder to handle
manually<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:15.590> tank

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
manually now tank

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
manually now tank

got<00:01:34.619> our<00:01:34.920> hand<00:01:35.159> underneath<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.329> know<00:01:36.450> it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
got our hand underneath you know it's

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.419 
got our hand underneath you know it's
going<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.749> be<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.899> lot<00:01:37.049> harder<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.590> him<00:01:37.859> to<00:01:38.189> drop

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
going to be a lot harder for him to drop

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.209 
going to be a lot harder for him to drop
that<00:01:38.670> bumper<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.569> we're<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.679> to<00:01:40.740> also<00:01:40.890> have

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
that bumper now we're going to also have

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.910 
that bumper now we're going to also have
other<00:01:41.520> hand<00:01:41.819> on<00:01:41.939> top<00:01:42.329> but<00:01:43.079> as<00:01:43.259> he<00:01:43.560> gets<00:01:43.710> better

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
other hand on top but as he gets better

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.260 
other hand on top but as he gets better
and<00:01:44.130> better<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.520> we're<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:44.969> start

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and better and better we're gonna start

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.599 
and better and better we're gonna start
moving<00:01:45.840> those<00:01:46.139> hands<00:01:46.409> away<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.399> may

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
moving those hands away from it it may

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:49.489 
moving those hands away from it it may
be<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.969> second<00:01:48.359> date<00:01:48.509> maybe<00:01:48.780> third<00:01:49.109> day<00:01:49.289> may

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
be the second date maybe third day may

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:50.870 
be the second date maybe third day may
be<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> fourth<00:01:49.950> day<00:01:50.069> this<00:01:50.280> might<00:01:50.520> take<00:01:50.759> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
be the fourth day this might take you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
be the fourth day this might take you
five<00:01:50.909> days<00:01:51.389> right<00:01:52.139> now<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.619> not<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.920> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
five days right now we're not going to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.529 
five days right now we're not going to
apply<00:01:53.520> any<00:01:53.880> pressure

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
apply any pressure

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.649 
apply any pressure
other<00:01:54.780> than<00:01:55.189> attrition<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.369> attrition<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.179> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
other than attrition in attrition is the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.230 
other than attrition in attrition is the
fact<00:01:57.929> that<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.880> continually<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
fact that just continually doing the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
fact that just continually doing the
same<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.780> over<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.380> over<00:02:01.679> and<00:02:01.770> over<00:02:01.859> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
same thing over and over and over and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.649 
same thing over and over and over and
over<00:02:02.159> until<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.799> effect<00:02:05.159> you<00:02:05.249> want

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
over until you get the effect you want

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.870 
over until you get the effect you want
when<00:02:06.659> we<00:02:06.869> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.649> get<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:07.859> real<00:02:08.340> good<00:02:08.550> hold

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
when we kind of get a real good hold

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.550 
when we kind of get a real good hold
then<00:02:09.330> we're<00:02:09.539> going<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.720> start<00:02:09.930> using<00:02:10.080> pressure

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
then we're going to start using pressure

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.190 
then we're going to start using pressure
pressure<00:02:10.979> in<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.370> means<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.360> ear<00:02:12.810> pinch

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
pressure in the means of that ear pinch

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.870 
pressure in the means of that ear pinch
to<00:02:13.680> get<00:02:13.920> what<00:02:14.340> we<00:02:14.490> want

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to get what we want

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.320 
to get what we want
and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.690 
and
that's<00:02:15.420> when<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.930> actual<00:02:16.350> force<00:02:16.770> fetch<00:02:17.310> will

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
that's when the actual force fetch will

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550 
that's when the actual force fetch will
start<00:02:18.000> now<00:02:18.390> we'll<00:02:18.630> only<00:02:18.840> use<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.110> command

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
start now we'll only use the command

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.040 
start now we'll only use the command
hold<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.160> will<00:02:20.190> not<00:02:20.550> use<00:02:20.760> fetch<00:02:21.120> until<00:02:21.900> we

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
hold we will not use fetch until we

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.650 
hold we will not use fetch until we
start<00:02:22.320> the<00:02:22.470> pressure<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:23.100> know<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.240> think<00:02:24.480> it's

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
start the pressure I know you think it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.540 
start the pressure I know you think it's
a<00:02:24.720> bumper<00:02:26.300> hold<00:02:28.370> hold

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
