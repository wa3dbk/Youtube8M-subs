00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.210
 that no 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.900
 as long as fashion is important enough 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.640
 she gives the trends give the 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.970
 pace from there you can really 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.100
 access or follow it you stay a little 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.940
 little offbeat I think it's good 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.350
 to have a little bit of benchmarks and the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.980
 mad gives us the benchmarks we will say 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.980
 interview m 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 I try to stay alert anyway 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.369
 to have a little bit to know what 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 which is done from there I'm going 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.080
 really worked with the heart so 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.020
 even if we are at the military's time and 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.430
 that and that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.500
 I am not at all military and well 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.530
 I will definitely completely put 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.320
 something else and on the other hand when it 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.969
 please I do not hesitate to go for it if it's a 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.469
 panthers touch if it's a touch or 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.469
 there it speaks to me more ok 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.000
 fashion addict yes I believe that I 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.730
 am a little bit 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 without being addicted them 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.820
 but that's not what defines me we're going 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.910
 to say I can come out a little bit 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.950
 that's true but I recognize that 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.560
 I love fashion still here 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.940
 but it does not solve my life I'm coming 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.260
 still not to be other ok then there 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.610
 I present you my favorite of the 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.540
 moment 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.460
 I just bought it 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.980
 I'm waiting for the right moment to be able to 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.080
 to wear is a bib overall 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.640
 Givenchy 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.530
 so we get the impression that this is a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.090
 skirt and a jacket but in fact it's 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.910
 really all in one she is 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.900
 extremely well cut the jacket very 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.900
 near the body 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.840
 next door you're going to have a 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.800
 beautiful dress from john galliano so 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.660
 dress the story I find that everything is 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.040
 in the cup 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.390
 she is very sober but at the same time 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.800
 we have a real sewing detail so a 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.250
 once worn she is just sublime 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.050
 for me to be well dressed or in any 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.500
 case to feel beautiful is really a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.790
 true happiness a pure pleasure 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 I try to always work in 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.000
 according to my mood and be well 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.450
 dressed is 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.680
 that's part of it we're going to say tools the 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.520
 little touch that allows me to be 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.590
 happy all the time in my dressing room 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.390
 I'm going to have some skirts of 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.220
 dresses a lot of jeans because that's 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.050
 very easy things a little bit more 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.840
 dressed as long dresses jackets 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.490
 and jogging also because for 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.920
 go to sport it's practical I'm 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.510
 very eclectic to go to the casting 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.300
 I usually liked things they 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.970
 have rather comfortable but it takes 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.740
 still still have things on 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.670
 sees the body so that for the customer this 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.800
 be easier 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.440
 a lot of leggings because it's very 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.760
 easy and we always stay sexy 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.070
 high heels a pair of ballerinas 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.290
 flat in the bag as soon as one has one is 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.660
 come out of casting to be able to 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.489
 flat and comfort a little top where we see 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.750
 arms because because that's it 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.890
 always showed a little bit of skin 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.440
 still without being too much naked 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.450
 I'm my clothes so 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.280
 quickly it depends on the weather if it does 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.500
 beautiful I will go or create from May and 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.900

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.269
 very beautiful and well it will be rather dark 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.269
 this is not very difficult 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.600
 so I wanted to introduce you to a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.970
 quite heavy so we can really 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.320

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.980

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.830

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.290
 up to 50000 euros not very little for 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:11.080
 me the price actually I find that 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.860
 when it's justified 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:17.150
 we have a lot of work to do 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.800
 a piece of quality 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.650
 we will say in any case in all that 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.350
 is a great designer so there are a lot of 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.620
 little hands and people who 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:29.450
 pass to realize we'll say a bag 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.760
 like this one we are really in the 

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.220
 leather finish at the level of 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.380
 the quality of leather at the level of choice 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.820
 materials and 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.100
 so that the accessories can 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.130
 really lasted a lot longer 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:47.990
 the quality is paid from the moment 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:50.900
 where we have a quality product and an I 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:55.460
 think you have to put it too 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.710
 the price my first beauty gesture it's 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.240
 first to clean his face without a 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.480
 beautiful skin and well there is no 

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.280
 beauty 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.050
 so it's really the base always 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.970
 very very very well clean his face 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.730
 to be able to start after a 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.710
 clean makeup is impeccable 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.960
 usually we start with a base of 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.000
 dyed after we will be small 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.830
 I do not usually use a little bit 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.080
 all I do favoritism we will say 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.720
 with mac because that's what's wrong with 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.450
 anyway the best now 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.860
 that's the lipstick I wear 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:26.900
 currently that I like a lot 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.150
 ac pattern of pink for days 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.950
 because I believe that all girls 

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:33.230
 we like it all that is an arm 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.190
 eyelids and gave himself a little bit of 

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:37.860
 light 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:40.440
 in the face so there I wear this 

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:44.010
