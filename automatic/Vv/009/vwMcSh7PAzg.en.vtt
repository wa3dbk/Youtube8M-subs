00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
now to the nitty-gritty I guess

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.750 
now to the nitty-gritty I guess
basically<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.260> Samsung<00:00:22.740> devices<00:00:23.070> affected

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
are the samsung galaxy s the galaxy s2

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.310 
are the samsung galaxy s the galaxy s2
so<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.859> yet<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.490> s3<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.720> mesmerised

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320

at<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> galaxy<00:00:40.980> tab<00:00:41.190> into<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.579> tab<00:00:41.790> 10.1<00:00:43.760> now

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
at the galaxy tab into the tab 10.1 now

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
at the galaxy tab into the tab 10.1 now
it's<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:45.660> known<00:00:45.989> what's<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.710> happen<00:00:47.010> to

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
it's not known what's going to happen to

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.680 
it's not known what's going to happen to
these<00:00:47.250> devices<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.000> those<00:00:48.210> are<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.360> devices

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
these devices but those are the devices

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
these devices but those are the devices
that<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.289> been<00:00:49.530> affected<00:00:49.620> so<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.370> could

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
that have been affected so one could

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
that have been affected so one could
assume<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.940> these<00:00:51.239> devices<00:00:51.600> will<00:00:51.960> no<00:00:52.140> longer

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
assume that these devices will no longer

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.889 
assume that these devices will no longer
be<00:00:52.649> for<00:00:52.890> sale<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.180> only<00:00:54.360> time<00:00:54.690> would

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
be for sale but you know only time would

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.930 
be for sale but you know only time would
could<00:00:55.199> tell<00:00:55.469> right<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:56.699> being<00:00:56.940> said<00:00:57.800> each

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
could tell right that being said each

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.610 
could tell right that being said each
jury<00:00:59.940> member<00:01:00.329> which<00:01:00.510> i<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.899> tia<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.410> was

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
jury member which i think the tia it was

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.740 
jury member which i think the tia it was
considerable<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.370> nine<00:01:02.579> people<00:01:02.969> so

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
considerable like nine people so

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
considerable like nine people so
basically<00:01:04.140> these<00:01:04.199> jury<00:01:04.500> members<00:01:04.890> received<00:01:05.280> a

the<00:01:25.439> verdict<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.850> if<00:01:26.909> there<00:01:27.119> were<00:01:27.270> any

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
the verdict to see if there were any

inconsistencies to the judge agreed on I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.749 
inconsistencies to the judge agreed on I
would<00:01:31.950> assume<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.520> were<00:01:32.610> no

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
would assume that there were no

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.789 
would assume that there were no
inconsistencies<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.170> unfortunate

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
inconsistencies but this is unfortunate

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.069

billion<00:01:46.409> dollars<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.890> this<00:01:47.040> tough<00:01:47.310> market<00:01:47.579> is

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
billion dollars in this tough market is

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.990 
billion dollars in this tough market is
pretty<00:01:48.360> significant<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.770> guess<00:01:50.610> Apple<00:01:50.790> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
pretty significant I guess Apple is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.310 
pretty significant I guess Apple is
going<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.149> be<00:01:51.270> 1<00:01:51.420> billion<00:01:51.750> dollars<00:01:51.990> Richard

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
going to be 1 billion dollars Richard

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.469 
going to be 1 billion dollars Richard
but<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.590> not<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:52.829> they<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> they

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
but it's not like they need that they

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.420 
but it's not like they need that they
make<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.840> in<00:01:55.110> like<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> day<00:01:55.649> than<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.310> know

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
make more in like a day than you know

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789 
make more in like a day than you know
that<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.020> unfortunate<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.560> see

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
that so you know it's unfortunate to see

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.969 
that so you know it's unfortunate to see
