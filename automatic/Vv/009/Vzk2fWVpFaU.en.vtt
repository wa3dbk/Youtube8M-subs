really probably understanding of the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.089 
really probably understanding of the
game<00:03:39.060> getting<00:03:39.480> us<00:03:39.659> into<00:03:39.870> rhythm<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.680> know<00:03:40.799> we

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
on either end I mean it was bad defense

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.209

too<00:03:46.409> so<00:03:48.109> it's<00:03:49.109> disappointing<00:03:49.230> because<00:03:49.889> we're

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:50.219 
too so it's disappointing because we're

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:51.890

know<00:05:53.190> plane<00:05:53.610> execute<00:05:54.180> down<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.480> stretch<00:05:54.780> and

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
know plane execute down the stretch and

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.830 
know plane execute down the stretch and
it<00:05:55.410> seemed<00:05:55.680> like<00:05:55.710> today<00:05:56.130> we<00:05:56.400> and<00:05:57.090> we<00:05:57.210> have<00:05:57.240> very

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
it seemed like today we and we have very

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.150 
it seemed like today we and we have very
little<00:05:57.930> margin<00:05:58.350> for<00:05:58.590> error<00:05:58.710> we<00:05:58.800> have<00:05:58.890> left

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
little margin for error we have left

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.740 
little margin for error we have left
margin<00:05:59.610> of<00:05:59.700> error<00:05:59.880> for<00:06:00.090> this<00:06:00.210> team<00:06:00.450> than<00:06:00.630> any

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
margin of error for this team than any

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.510 
margin of error for this team than any
team<00:06:00.930> I've<00:06:01.080> had<00:06:01.230> since<00:06:01.380> I've<00:06:01.530> been<00:06:01.560> here<00:06:01.890> and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
team I've had since I've been here and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.810 
team I've had since I've been here and
and<00:06:03.530> when<00:06:04.530> you're<00:06:04.710> off<00:06:04.860> just<00:06:05.130> a<00:06:05.220> little<00:06:05.250> bit<00:06:05.490> we

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
and when you're off just a little bit we

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.250 
and when you're off just a little bit we
were<00:06:05.940> off<00:06:06.090> today

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
were off today

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260 
were off today
then<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.950> think<00:06:08.280> it's<00:06:08.400> hard<00:06:08.670> just<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:09.000> turn<00:06:09.180> it

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
then I think it's hard just to turn it

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.000 
then I think it's hard just to turn it
on<00:06:09.390> and<00:06:09.450> turn<00:06:09.600> it<00:06:09.720> off<00:06:09.900> I<00:06:10.290> think<00:06:10.560> I<00:06:10.710> think<00:06:10.920> as

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
on and turn it off I think I think as

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.350 
on and turn it off I think I think as
much<00:06:11.130> as<00:06:11.190> anything<00:06:11.370> it's<00:06:11.760> a<00:06:11.820> middle<00:06:12.120> approach

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
much as anything it's a middle approach

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.390 
much as anything it's a middle approach
as<00:06:12.570> it<00:06:12.600> is<00:06:12.810> anything<00:06:13.080> else<00:06:13.350> but<00:06:13.740> we're<00:06:14.220> not<00:06:14.370> a

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
as it is anything else but we're not a

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.670 
as it is anything else but we're not a
physically<00:06:15.060> strong<00:06:15.240> team<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.260> mean<00:06:16.290> we're<00:06:16.650> not

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
physically strong team I mean we're not

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.530 
physically strong team I mean we're not
physically<00:06:17.130> strong<00:06:17.220> today<00:06:17.910> it<00:06:17.970> shows<00:06:18.240> I<00:06:18.510> mean

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
physically strong today it shows I mean

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.820 
physically strong today it shows I mean
they<00:06:18.780> think<00:06:18.960> they<00:06:19.200> would<00:06:19.410> just<00:06:19.590> from<00:06:19.770> a

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
they think they would just from a

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.600 
they think they would just from a
strength<00:06:20.070> standpoint<00:06:24.800> sure<00:06:25.800> they're<00:06:26.520> totally

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
strength standpoint sure they're totally

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.950 
strength standpoint sure they're totally
phases<00:06:27.270> where<00:06:27.420> the<00:06:27.480> team<00:06:27.690> plays<00:06:27.930> soft<00:06:29.810> but<00:06:30.810> hey

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
phases where the team plays soft but hey

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.790 
phases where the team plays soft but hey
you<00:06:31.500> know<00:06:31.620> offensive<00:06:32.580> rebound<00:06:33.470> off<00:06:34.470> free

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
you know offensive rebound off free

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.689 
you know offensive rebound off free
throws<00:06:35.070> that's<00:06:35.640> a<00:06:35.760> sign<00:06:35.970> of<00:06:36.000> a<00:06:36.180> softie

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:40.699 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:44.649

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
we're never gonna be a physically tough

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:53.800 
we're never gonna be a physically tough
team<00:06:50.689> we<00:06:51.289> can<00:06:51.439> be<00:06:51.590> a<00:06:52.120> middle<00:06:53.120> e<00:06:53.210> tough<00:06:53.419> team<00:06:53.629> and

played<00:06:54.620> no<00:06:54.800> physical<00:06:55.279> but<00:06:55.849> but<00:06:56.120> you<00:06:56.240> know<00:06:56.360> when

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479

you're 180th the four and 220 of the

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.439 
you're 180th the four and 220 of the
five<00:06:59.659> that's<00:06:59.960> not<00:07:00.199> exactly<00:07:00.560> a<00:07:01.120> lot<00:07:02.120> of<00:07:02.270> beat

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:02.449 
five that's not exactly a lot of beat

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:04.330 
five that's not exactly a lot of beat
Fionna<00:07:02.840> and<00:07:02.960> then<00:07:03.259> ain't<00:07:03.409> thomas<00:07:03.889> of<00:07:03.979> twins

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:04.340 
Fionna and then ain't thomas of twins

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.850 
Fionna and then ain't thomas of twins
out<00:07:04.639> there<00:07:05.300> so<00:07:05.539> we<00:07:05.840> got<00:07:06.110> to<00:07:06.199> find<00:07:06.319> some<00:07:06.770> other

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
out there so we got to find some other

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.649 
out there so we got to find some other
ways<00:07:07.129> to<00:07:07.310> do<00:07:07.460> it<00:07:07.490> and<00:07:07.819> you<00:07:07.999> just<00:07:08.029> can't<00:07:08.330> be<00:07:08.509> off

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:08.659 
ways to do it and you just can't be off

00:07:08.659 --> 00:07:10.300 
ways to do it and you just can't be off
a<00:07:08.689> little<00:07:08.870> bit<00:07:09.169> and<00:07:09.409> that's<00:07:09.889> what<00:07:10.039> we<00:07:10.129> were

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:10.310 
a little bit and that's what we were

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:18.369 
a little bit and that's what we were
today<00:07:10.460> I<00:07:16.569> think<00:07:17.569> I<00:07:17.810> think<00:07:18.020> it's<00:07:18.110> a<00:07:18.169> combination

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:18.379 
today I think I think it's a combination

00:07:18.379 --> 00:07:21.519 
today I think I think it's a combination
of<00:07:18.740> both<00:07:18.889> I<00:07:19.189> do<00:07:19.789> I<00:07:19.909> think<00:07:20.270> it's<00:07:20.389> uh<00:07:20.539> I<00:07:20.779> think<00:07:21.199> we

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:21.529 
of both I do I think it's uh I think we

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:24.730 
of both I do I think it's uh I think we
got<00:07:21.560> to<00:07:21.710> manage<00:07:22.009> it<00:07:22.250> in<00:07:22.400> certain<00:07:22.759> ways<00:07:23.590> but<00:07:24.590> we

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:24.740 
got to manage it in certain ways but we

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.769 
got to manage it in certain ways but we
also<00:07:24.949> can<00:07:25.669> play<00:07:25.819> a<00:07:25.909> lot<00:07:26.150> better<00:07:26.180> there's<00:07:26.629> no

00:07:26.769 --> 00:07:26.779 
also can play a lot better there's no

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.869 
also can play a lot better there's no
question<00:07:27.229> I<00:07:27.409> mean<00:07:27.590> we<00:07:27.800> can<00:07:28.129> improve<00:07:28.430> from<00:07:28.669> that

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:28.879 
question I mean we can improve from that

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:32.200 
question I mean we can improve from that
but<00:07:29.090> but<00:07:29.689> certainly<00:07:30.279> you<00:07:31.279> know<00:07:31.400> it's<00:07:31.819> okay<00:07:32.180> to

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210 
but but certainly you know it's okay to

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.439 
but but certainly you know it's okay to
not<00:07:32.930> have<00:07:32.990> good<00:07:33.409> games<00:07:33.680> and<00:07:34.180> that<00:07:35.180> kind<00:07:35.419> of

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:35.449 
not have good games and that kind of

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:38.529 
not have good games and that kind of
stuff<00:07:35.919> from<00:07:36.919> a<00:07:36.949> basketball<00:07:37.460> i.q<00:07:37.789> standpoint

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:38.539 
stuff from a basketball i.q standpoint

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:39.909 
stuff from a basketball i.q standpoint
there<00:07:38.689> were<00:07:38.779> some<00:07:38.960> place<00:07:39.169> made<00:07:39.439> there<00:07:39.680> late

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 
there were some place made there late

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:41.350 
there were some place made there late
that<00:07:40.189> you<00:07:40.310> just<00:07:40.490> scratch<00:07:40.759> your<00:07:40.939> head<00:07:41.120> and<00:07:41.270> say

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 
that you just scratch your head and say

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.649 
that you just scratch your head and say
wow<00:07:42.520> and<00:07:43.520> those<00:07:43.699> are<00:07:43.849> the<00:07:43.939> things<00:07:44.060> we<00:07:44.270> got<00:07:44.449> we

00:07:44.649 --> 00:07:44.659 
wow and those are the things we got we

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:45.999 
wow and those are the things we got we
could<00:07:44.779> we<00:07:44.900> got<00:07:44.930> we<00:07:45.259> gotta<00:07:45.439> tighten<00:07:45.770> those

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:46.009 
could we got we gotta tighten those

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:48.219 
could we got we gotta tighten those
things<00:07:46.310> up<00:07:46.550> and<00:07:47.029> I<00:07:47.389> think<00:07:47.449> that<00:07:47.779> we<00:07:47.900> can<00:07:48.080> do

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:48.229 
things up and I think that we can do

00:07:48.229 --> 00:07:49.779 
things up and I think that we can do
that<00:07:48.439> and<00:07:48.650> hopefully<00:07:48.860> we<00:07:49.009> can<00:07:49.129> and<00:07:49.520> will<00:07:49.639> do<00:07:49.729> a

00:07:49.779 --> 00:07:49.789 
that and hopefully we can and will do a

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:51.939 
that and hopefully we can and will do a
better<00:07:49.939> job<00:07:50.060> coach<00:07:50.449> than<00:07:50.659> my<00:07:50.750> whole<00:07:50.960> but<00:07:51.229> we

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:51.949 
better job coach than my whole but we

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:55.300 
better job coach than my whole but we
will<00:07:52.430> take<00:07:53.000> this<00:07:53.210> loss<00:07:53.779> and<00:07:54.169> hopefully<00:07:54.860> kind

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:55.310 
will take this loss and hopefully kind

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:57.490 
will take this loss and hopefully kind
of<00:07:55.400> get<00:07:55.520> refocused<00:07:55.879> and<00:07:56.330> be<00:07:57.199> better<00:07:57.439> going

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:57.500 
of get refocused and be better going

00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.770 
of get refocused and be better going
