00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.160
 hello it's djibi scene site 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.590
 android and you I do a little 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.560
 presentation of the heart of the mobile is a 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.490
 smartphone developed by acer then one 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
 go for a quick tour of 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:30.289
 owner then the phone has 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:34.670
 a 4.3-inch screen of a 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.640
 resolution of 1280 by 720 pixels which 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.829
 actually makes the screen a resolution 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.590
 higher than the screen retina during 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:46.340
 of the iphone then on the front facade 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.930
 we will find a camera hd in the east 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.120
 on the back cover we will find a 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.120
 8 megapixel apn with a flash led 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.300
 so also be aware that acer has 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.670
 developed a software overlay for 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.890
 his mobile overlay is rather 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.340
 light compared to that of samsung or 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.960
 from those of htc 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.560
 so you also have to know that for 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.140
 the home screen 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 you can devour her actually in the running 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.030
 in simple to slip and there will be 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.960
 actually four apps down that 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.290
 are customizable 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.630
 so you can also want you 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.829
 launch the camera app there 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.060
 you just have to click on it 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.340
 and slide 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.680
 this is the application is launched then 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.040
 know all too that ac has developed 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.399
 several automotive applications 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.470
 will find a music app that 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.079
 worth what it's worth 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.219
 personally I do not use them at 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.250
 less the merit of existing 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.990
 if not a hd chanel application that 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.420
 regroups pratt which gathers in fact all 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 just the hd videos that we can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:02:00.159
 have on youtube otherwise there is 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.159
 the application acer doc 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.060
 I actually syncing everything 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.890
 simply your documents that you liked 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.310
 on your pc on your mobile you 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.420
 can modify them from your mobile 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.360
 I want to know that in fact the application 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.650
 enough deeds for pc windows is in 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.520
 party is compatible only from 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.340
 windows seven 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.500
 so if you have a lower version 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.760
 at windows 7 you could not everything 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.650
 simply do not download the application 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 is also if you have a version 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.650
 windows 8 and arte you can not 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.240
 also install the application 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.230
 here is to see those if not know 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.490
 that the mobile runs under android 4.0 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.530
 normally he should have a 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.600
 day under android 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.130
 4.1 may be an update its 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.440
 Batch 4.2 but it is not sure yet 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.160
 at present if not at the level of 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.720
 processor we have a snapdragon processor 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.040
 s4 French launched 5 giga hertz 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.360
 here you have to actually turn the 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.040
 most big games against you 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.180
 will not have access to the yellow dgrad this 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.820
 which is a bit normal you 're not going 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.590
 an nvidia chip but that does not 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.709
 will not prevent me from turning park 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.180
 projects like ted trigger or a bad 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.470
 So here it is all thank you 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.739

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.739
