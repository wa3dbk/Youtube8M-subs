00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.440 

this<00:00:15.970> is<00:00:16.120> a<00:00:16.150> demonstration<00:00:16.540> how<00:00:17.380> I<00:00:17.740> used<00:00:18.640> evapo

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
this is a demonstration how I used evapo

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.640 
this is a demonstration how I used evapo
rust<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.860> clean<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.340> gas<00:00:21.550> tank<00:00:21.930> from<00:00:22.930> my<00:00:23.170> Honda

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
rust to clean the gas tank from my Honda

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:34.110 
rust to clean the gas tank from my Honda
CL<00:00:24.490> 350<00:00:30.390> here's<00:00:31.390> what<00:00:31.540> it<00:00:31.660> looked<00:00:31.869> like<00:00:33.120> to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
CL 350 here's what it looked like to

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:43.529 
CL 350 here's what it looked like to
start<00:00:34.450> with

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.220 

I<00:00:44.460> have<00:00:45.460> already<00:00:45.789> drained<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:46.329> gas<00:00:46.480> tank<00:00:46.870> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.840 

hair<00:00:50.230> dried<00:00:50.589> it<00:00:50.829> to<00:00:51.100> make<00:00:51.280> sure<00:00:51.429> there<00:00:51.609> was<00:00:51.699> no

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
hair dried it to make sure there was no

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.709 
hair dried it to make sure there was no
gasoline<00:00:52.269> left<00:00:52.570> in<00:00:52.839> there<00:00:53.079> I<00:00:54.390> have<00:00:55.390> made<00:00:55.690> a

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
gasoline left in there I have made a

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.889 
gasoline left in there I have made a
plug<00:00:56.140> to<00:00:58.530> seal<00:00:59.530> where<00:00:59.860> the<00:01:00.070> petcock<00:01:00.489> fits

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
plug to seal where the petcock fits

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.940 
plug to seal where the petcock fits
although<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:03.100> is<00:01:03.339> not<00:01:03.369> really<00:01:03.909> necessary

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:04.950 
although this is not really necessary

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:10.969 
although this is not really necessary
because<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:08.080> evapo<00:01:08.440> rust<00:01:08.700> does<00:01:09.700> not<00:01:10.000> harm

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
because the evapo rust does not harm

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.020 
because the evapo rust does not harm
plastic<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:14.320> makes<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:14.740> easier<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:15.610> get

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
plastic but it makes it easier to get

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.249 
plastic but it makes it easier to get
the<00:01:16.149> evaporate<00:01:16.750> out<00:01:17.369> afterwards<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.720> now<00:01:19.929> I'm

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
the evaporate out afterwards so now I'm

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:28.710 
the evaporate out afterwards so now I'm
going<00:01:20.440> to<00:01:20.500> add<00:01:20.649> I'll<00:01:20.920> get<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.920> gallons<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:28.390> the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
going to add I'll get two gallons of the

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.109 
going to add I'll get two gallons of the
evaporates

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
evaporates

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.730 
evaporates
this<00:01:31.119> has<00:01:31.299> been<00:01:31.479> previously<00:01:32.049> used<00:01:32.140> but<00:01:32.590> they

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
this has been previously used but they

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.880 
this has been previously used but they
say<00:01:32.979> you<00:01:33.009> can<00:01:33.340> keep<00:01:33.520> using<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.500> I'm<00:01:35.649> going

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
say you can keep using it so I'm going

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:49.760 
say you can keep using it so I'm going
to<00:01:36.390> dump<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.569> in

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.020 

I<00:02:52.380> ended<00:02:53.380> up<00:02:53.470> leaving<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.980> evapo<00:02:54.430> rust<00:02:54.640> in

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
I ended up leaving the evapo rust in

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.480 
I ended up leaving the evapo rust in
overnight<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.980> now<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:58.240> see<00:02:59.490> the
