00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.059
 I started because we had 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.910
 appreciated but my sister 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.100
 the malaise in the pool where to stow one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.170
 After weeks of each other for staying 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 stay at home so we do school 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.530
 professional tasks and then we went to the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.330
 passion known when in the lagers but what if 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.490
 I wanted to switch to a competitive level and 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.270
 then do the four times a week 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.190
 I'm gymnastics and I've decided that instead 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.410
 it goes more than its neighbor to the other 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.920
 close to devote myself completely to the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.160
 gymnastics and I started at age six 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.109
 no base let's say and then immediately to 7 the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 maximum level 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.739
 what has changed in your life since 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 you're in milan in short, you don't already live anymore 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.100
 with your parents so this is already 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.940
 a big change no well all that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.230
 lifestyle because 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.170
 to do morning and afternoon training 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.780
 that private school 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.960
 in the afternoon point from the inter while 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.860
 dementia and sustain mixing quote 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:16.330
 billions which in any case is a heavy thing 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.619
 and then I moved alone because 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.619
 my parents my brothers were 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.990
 Catania stayed here as it was 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.659
 difficult to break away from them and mine 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.090
 usual habits of friends school and then 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.369
 it's an afternoon workout we are 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.800
 at the technical center 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.620
 we live 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.470
 and let 's go to the gym in the morning 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.150
 together and we train to eat the 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.690
 china we love them as we do at school e 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:46.060
 then the shooting of mtv has changed 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.070
 something else 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.520
 someone says it hurt you a little 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.710
 the results of the latest world togas 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.810
 in short, the Olympics could have been 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.170
 best 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.180
 well i don't answer 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.730
 there is to this criticism we say why 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.100
 do you think the results we talk about because 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.979
 both what qualification is lacking 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.159
 was there with 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.599
 them at the qualification test event 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:17.319
 Team but also my time 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:19.900
 then bark at the Olympics we have 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.220
 qualified the team in the final a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.049
 teams that is the first in history 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.940
 so we have Italian gymnastics 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.160
 marked a piece of history that does not think 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.340
 both recently and my first Olympics 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.069
 I made the final all around together 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.260
 to the champion vanessa ferrari for which 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.720
 I think this was his first 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.890
 Olympics this year in London 2012 which 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.290
 it was the excitement when they got you 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:45.220
 communicated that you were among the summoned 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.500
 let's say the team was decided yes 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:51.069
 and on the last, however, the first 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.920
 that is, I vanessa and recall already decided and 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.980
 qualified so we say yes 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.260
 the equation, however, was there a little bit 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.109
 I knew and this helped me again 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 more to prepare me precisely for not between 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.799
 quotes kept expectations for 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.470
 get ready for the race 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:13.150
 you have decided to switch between the athletes 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:15.579
 Army why was that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.780
 practically the gymnastics performed 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:21.420
 from the harbor this sports center e 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.490
 they asked me 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.550
 to enter this sports center 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:32.040
 so I welcomed with pleasure 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:35.459
 what will change you are not in these 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.630
 things no doubt a great opportunity 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:43.800
 which the army makes available 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.180
 and therefore I am happy to be there a 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.459
 all the girls you 've done 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.170
 get closer to gymnastics but not only 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.050
 who still admire this sport too 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.980
 thanks to you and your catanesitÃ  if 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:58.530
 we want what you want to tell him without 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.660
 I doubt not always say that if social 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.950
 network is all that if I am here it is also 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.130
 thanks to them because they give me strength e 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.350
 with 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.660
 of their yes of things make me 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.930
 return the smile so thank you always 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.800
 catania italian championship was 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.440
 fantastic 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.330
 there was a lot of people however it was a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.330
 home was beautiful 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.380
 the kitchen is missing, however, let's say 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.050
 that 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.450
 better to watch the line in 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.490
 this sport is just passers-by 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.670
 exaggerate so let's say he thinks 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.850
 first to the family and then now we are 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:43.680
 a ciro run is not if there is in it 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.680
 christelle the great agreements 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.110
 round
