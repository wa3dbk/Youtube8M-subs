00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.630
The car behind me isn’t a Passat, no, it’s
actually the smaller Jetta, although the two

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.290
do look very similar. In fact, the Jetta actually
has more in common with the Mk6 Golf, effectively

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.480
being the saloon version of that award-winning
hatchback.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.070
So, you get VW group looks, engines and a
large boot, but for less than the bigger Passat.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.840
But, the Mk6 it’s based on has now been
replaced, so is the Jetta feeling its age?

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.350
Let’s find out…
Well, if VW were going to base a car on anything,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.590
the Mk6 Golf was a good start. The materials
in this SE trim model are still perfectly

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.290
respectable, with a soft-touch finish, while
the switches are all sturdy and logically

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:05.470
laid out. Our main criticism is the seats,
which are very flat and lack lateral support.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.689
If you know your Volkswagen’s, it’s the
sat-nav which gives away its age, with a rather

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:17.990
small screen making it a bit fiddly to use,
despite it being a £525 optional extra. It

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.420
works well enough though, and has features
like digital radio as well as SD and Aux-in

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.200
connections. This Jetta is also fitted with
a handy reversing camera, costing an extra

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.789
£165.
Open the 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:40.399
surprisingly long rear door, being careful
not to snag yourself, and you’ll find the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.469
main difference between a Jetta and Golf.
There’s enough knee room and head room to

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:56.330
make you think you’ve got sat in a full-sized
saloon. There’s also a 12v socket for your

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.899
phone, armrest with cup holders and a ski-hatch.
The saloon boot doesn’t offer the same loading

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:17.390
room as a hatchback, but it has a fairly low
loading lip and it’s quite wide too. These

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.700
handles allow the seats to fold forward, although
you still need to walk around the car to finish

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:35.890
the job and they don’t quite sit flat.
Take to the road and the Jetta feels pleasant,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:42.470
relaxing even, but just not very exciting.
The suspension feels soft and the steering

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.010
needs quite a lot of twirling compared with
the hypersensitive systems found in recent

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:55.230
rivals. But, these traits also have some advantages,
and once you get into the Jetta’s groove,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.750
it’s a very stress-free way to travel. Enthusiastic
drivers need not apply though, even compared

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.890
with the Golf it feels a lot less sporty.
Engines range from a 1.4-litre petrol with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:20.079
123bhp or 148bhp, to a frugal 108bhp 1.6-litre
diesel, or this 2.0-litre TDI with 148bhp.

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:27.450
All come fitted with a manual gearbox as standard,
but this diesel and the most powerful petrol

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.739
can be specified with VW’s excellent DSG
automatic. You don’t get paddle shifters,

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:41.689
but to be honest, the auto mode does a good
job of choosing the right gear, so it’s

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:46.190
no great loss.
Getting from 0-62mph in 8.6 seconds, this

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:53.020
2.0 diesel is quick enough to surprise other
drivers and it makes the Jetta an excellent

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.739
motorway car, helped by impressive refinement
at higher speeds.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:07.870
It may be something of a wallflower, but the
Jetta is by no means a bad car. Yes, it’s

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:14.180
just starting to show its age inside, but
on the flipside its engines were updated in

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.329
late 2014.
With a huge boot and plenty of space for passengers,

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.340
it’s certainly has its place, but newer
models like the Skoda Octavia are probably

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.420
a better bet all around.
