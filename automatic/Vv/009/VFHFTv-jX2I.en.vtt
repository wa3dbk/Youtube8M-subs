00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.030
Alright today on Repairs101 � tips and tricks
for working in your garden in yet another

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:19.480
edition of my Life Hacks series.
One of the worst things you can do to your

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.000
tools is leave them outside in the elements
where rust sets in quickly and wooden handles

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.270
shrink and crack and end up giving you blisters
the next time you go to use them. Keep your

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:44.480
tools clean and dry, off the ground and under
cover if not indoors.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:59.539
You�ll be able to manage most any pruning
you need to do in your garden with some secateurs

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:09.899
or some loppers. Old axes and hatchets are
ideal for chores like stump removal.

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.450
And you know what? A Swede Saw will cut just
about anything you need to cut. I bought this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.729
saw more than thirty years ago when I was
in Scouts and I needed it for winter camping.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:39.549
I gotta say: nice work, Sweden. I really got
my money�s worth.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.079
You can level the top of your hedge like a
professional landscaper just by running a

00:01:43.079 --> 00:02:07.529
piece of string between a couple of posts.
Always cut branches so as to leave behind

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:13.540
the Branch Bark Collar. It�s a fairly obvious
collar at the joint between the two branches.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.819
The collar is the tree�s defence zone. Left
intact it will petrify and become indigestible

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:45.510
to decay rot organisms.
You can start fruit tree seeds in a fold of

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.900
wet paper towel inside of a sealed zip-lock
bag. Here I have some lemon seeds that have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:01.209
already developed their root-spurs.
Paper egg cartons make a great no-cost biodegradable

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:21.859
seed starting container for annuals.
Now most people reach for a small hand trowel

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.499
when they go to dig up a wild seedling � but
use a shovel and dig out an oversized ball

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:49.080
of dirt to collect as much of the tree�s
root as possible.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.209
Put your seedlings in a Cold Frame to protect
them from late frosts and to extend your growing

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:08.069
season.
For a lush green lawn that requires little

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.529
maintenance � set the wheels of your mower
to ride in the lowest holes � providing

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:20.180
the most clearance over rocks and sidewalks
and letting grass grow as long as possible.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.300
Use Sunlight dish soap and water in a spray
bottle for a biodegradable pesticide that

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:40.630
controls pests like mites and aphids.
Undiluted, ordinary white vinegar in a spray

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:51.370
bottle can also be used as a natural herbicide
to control weeds.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.250
Alright keep your lawn maintenance equipment
in top condition by not using corrosive chemical

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.800
pesticides and herbicides. That stuff tastes
terrible.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.280
