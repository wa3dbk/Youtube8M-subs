but you know it starts from your parents

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920 
but you know it starts from your parents
and<00:02:31.010> what<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.310> learn<00:02:31.400> from<00:02:31.459> home<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.000> by

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
and what you can learn from home but by

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.289 
and what you can learn from home but by
my<00:02:33.080> parents<00:02:33.500> sending<00:02:34.129> me<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.430> Notre<00:02:34.849> Dame<00:02:35.060> and

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
my parents sending me to Notre Dame and

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.970 
my parents sending me to Notre Dame and
able<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.510> learn<00:02:36.260> from<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:36.739> different

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
able to learn from all different

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.800 
able to learn from all different
teachers<00:02:37.519> at<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.819> school<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.450> probably<00:02:38.720> one

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
teachers at the school and probably one

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.850 
teachers at the school and probably one
of<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.959> biggest<00:02:39.200> things<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.620> think<00:02:39.709> you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
of the biggest things I think you

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.920 
of the biggest things I think you
learned<00:02:40.069> was<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.940> teacher-student

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
learned was the teacher-student

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.130 
learned was the teacher-student
relationship<00:02:42.890> wasn't<00:02:43.220> always<00:02:43.790> on<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.180> mr.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
relationship wasn't always on the mr.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.289 
relationship wasn't always on the mr.
this<00:02:45.349> and<00:02:45.590> a<00:02:45.650> mr.<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:47.150> could

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
this and a mr. that so you you could

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.640 
this and a mr. that so you you could
really<00:02:47.480> get<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:47.870> your<00:02:48.079> teachers<00:02:48.500> and

really get to know your teachers and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.589 
really get to know your teachers and

went to school at Notre Dame in Wilcox a

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.170 
went to school at Notre Dame in Wilcox a
sketch<00:03:00.200> one<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.650> a<00:03:00.709> Notre<00:03:01.280> Dame<00:03:01.340> hound<00:03:01.730> and<00:03:02.030> I

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
sketch one was a Notre Dame hound and I

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.550 
sketch one was a Notre Dame hound and I
took<00:03:02.450> some<00:03:02.629> things<00:03:02.660> from<00:03:02.900> Notre<00:03:03.110> Dame<00:03:03.319> at

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
took some things from Notre Dame at

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.400 
took some things from Notre Dame at
about<00:03:03.769> honesty<00:03:04.280> and<00:03:04.660> character<00:03:05.660> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
about honesty and character and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.619 
about honesty and character and
compassion<00:03:07.160> about<00:03:07.280> things<00:03:07.970> that<00:03:08.480> was<00:03:08.599> the

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
compassion about things that was the

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.000 
compassion about things that was the
biggest<00:03:08.870> aspect<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.500> think<00:03:09.530> they<00:03:09.739> took<00:03:09.890> from

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
biggest aspect I think they took from

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.309 
biggest aspect I think they took from
Notre<00:03:10.220> Dame<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.610> think<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:11.060> great<00:03:11.319> state

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
Notre Dame I think it's a great state

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.960 
Notre Dame I think it's a great state
school<00:03:12.739> for<00:03:12.769> kids<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.610> has<00:03:13.700> a<00:03:13.730> great

tradition than really working at things

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.960 
tradition than really working at things
a<00:03:17.989> Notre<00:03:18.379> Dame<00:03:18.470> helped<00:03:19.220> me<00:03:19.340> probably<00:03:19.609> develop

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
a Notre Dame helped me probably develop

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.640 
a Notre Dame helped me probably develop
a<00:03:20.090> lot<00:03:20.209> of<00:03:20.239> characteristics<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.139> my<00:03:21.260> coaching

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
a lot of characteristics and my coaching

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.640 
a lot of characteristics and my coaching
because<00:03:22.639> I<00:03:22.940> believe<00:03:23.540> highly<00:03:24.049> in<00:03:24.200> character

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
because I believe highly in character

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.890 
because I believe highly in character
and<00:03:24.859> I<00:03:24.920> I<00:03:25.280> take<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.850> character<00:03:26.209> player<00:03:26.569> over<00:03:26.870> a

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and I I take a character player over a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.020 
and I I take a character player over a
highly<00:03:27.590> skilled<00:03:28.340> player<00:03:28.609> who's<00:03:28.850> not

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
highly skilled player who's not

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.520 
highly skilled player who's not
motivator<00:03:29.510> doesn't<00:03:29.840> have<00:03:29.930> much

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.449 

because<00:03:35.530> there's<00:03:35.739> Notre<00:03:35.920> Dame<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.189> a<00:03:36.280> great

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
because there's Notre Dame is a great

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.030 
because there's Notre Dame is a great
college<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.420> great<00:03:37.629> school<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.230> get<00:03:38.890> the

college and great school we get the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.949 
college and great school we get the
athletes<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.519> go<00:03:39.700> there<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:39.970> play<00:03:40.180> so<00:03:40.239> they

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
athletes to go there to play so they

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.660 
athletes to go there to play so they
come<00:03:41.170> with<00:03:41.319> some<00:03:41.349> talent<00:03:41.650> but<00:03:42.220> what<00:03:42.340> makes<00:03:42.549> the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
come with some talent but what makes the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.819 
come with some talent but what makes the
talent<00:03:43.000> even<00:03:43.209> better<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.659> is<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.590> amount<00:03:44.709> of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
talent even better is is the amount of

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.500 
talent even better is is the amount of
ice<00:03:44.980> time<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.519> get<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:45.939> that's<00:03:46.090> at<00:03:46.360> any

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
ice time you can get and that's at any

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.770 
ice time you can get and that's at any
level<00:03:46.780> whether<00:03:47.140> you're<00:03:47.290> at<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.379> top<00:03:47.920> level<00:03:48.310> or

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
level whether you're at the top level or

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.630 
level whether you're at the top level or
trying<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.840> make<00:03:49.989> the<00:03:50.109> top<00:03:50.290> level<00:03:50.680> because

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
trying to make the top level because

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.220 
trying to make the top level because
there's<00:03:51.819> only<00:03:51.909> so<00:03:52.150> many<00:03:52.239> students<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.930> it's<00:03:53.079> a

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
there's only so many students and it's a

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.490 
there's only so many students and it's a
really<00:03:53.859> small<00:03:54.760> group<00:03:55.090> every<00:03:55.810> player<00:03:56.200> there

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
really small group every player there

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.740 
really small group every player there
gets<00:03:57.489> an<00:03:57.640> abundance<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.090> ice<00:03:58.269> time<00:03:58.480> if<00:03:58.629> you

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
gets an abundance of ice time if you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.390 
gets an abundance of ice time if you
don't<00:03:58.930> get<00:03:59.049> enough<00:03:59.290> ice<00:03:59.439> time<00:03:59.680> it's<00:03:59.980> tough<00:04:00.250> to

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
don't get enough ice time it's tough to

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.460 
don't get enough ice time it's tough to
progress<00:04:00.609> a<00:04:00.970> repetition<00:04:01.659> you<00:04:01.840> get<00:04:01.989> better<00:04:02.170> and

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
progress a repetition you get better and

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.220 
progress a repetition you get better and
there<00:04:03.370> you<00:04:03.519> get<00:04:03.639> abundance<00:04:04.599> of<00:04:04.690> repetition

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
there you get abundance of repetition

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.190 
there you get abundance of repetition
because<00:04:05.379> you're<00:04:05.500> on<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> ice<00:04:05.769> every<00:04:06.069> day<00:04:07.200> we

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
because you're on the ice every day we

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.559 
because you're on the ice every day we
seek<00:04:08.560> to<00:04:08.769> support<00:04:09.220> those<00:04:09.519> organizations<00:04:10.420> that

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
since then I haven't had and I've had a

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.310 
since then I haven't had and I've had a
lot<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.850> coaches<00:04:54.240> since<00:04:54.450> and<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.780> haven't<00:04:55.140> had

anybody<00:04:56.070> that's<00:04:56.400> taught<00:04:56.700> me<00:04:56.880> the<00:04:56.970> game<00:04:57.150> as

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
anybody that's taught me the game as

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
anybody that's taught me the game as
much<00:04:57.390> as<00:04:57.630> those<00:04:57.900> coaches

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
much as those coaches

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.470 
much as those coaches
I<00:05:00.410> guess<00:05:00.980> how<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.160> explained<00:05:01.670> notre-dame<00:05:02.270> and

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
I guess how I explained notre-dame and

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.530 
I guess how I explained notre-dame and
what<00:05:02.780> it's<00:05:02.930> like<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.800> is<00:05:04.310> a<00:05:04.370> just<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.360> real

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:05.540 
what it's like is is a just a real

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.540 
what it's like is is a just a real
growing<00:05:05.780> experience<00:05:06.050> for<00:05:06.290> for<00:05:06.680> kids<00:05:06.830> it's

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
growing experience for for kids it's

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.390 
growing experience for for kids it's
something<00:05:07.880> where<00:05:08.840> I<00:05:08.870> always<00:05:09.110> said<00:05:09.410> if<00:05:09.560> if<00:05:10.160> it

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
something where I always said if if it

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.950 
something where I always said if if it
came<00:05:10.580> along<00:05:10.850> to<00:05:11.030> that<00:05:11.180> point<00:05:11.420> where<00:05:11.570> my<00:05:11.720> kids

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
came along to that point where my kids

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.390 
came along to that point where my kids
were<00:05:12.020> gonna<00:05:12.170> go<00:05:12.320> -<00:05:12.380> I'd<00:05:12.680> be<00:05:12.890> more<00:05:12.920> than<00:05:13.160> happy

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
were gonna go - I'd be more than happy

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.350 
were gonna go - I'd be more than happy
to<00:05:13.520> send<00:05:13.730> them<00:05:13.880> there<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.030> think<00:05:14.180> that's

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
to send them there I think that's

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.900 
to send them there I think that's
probably<00:05:14.570> the<00:05:14.810> best<00:05:15.160> the<00:05:16.160> best<00:05:16.310> example<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:16.880> can

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
probably the best the best example I can

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.540 
probably the best the best example I can
give<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.240> if<00:05:17.510> I<00:05:17.630> would<00:05:17.840> return<00:05:18.830> send<00:05:19.190> my<00:05:19.310> kids

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
give is if I would return send my kids

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.430 
give is if I would return send my kids
back<00:05:19.760> there<00:05:20.030> and<00:05:20.180> that's<00:05:20.330> probably<00:05:21.080> the<00:05:21.290> most

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
back there and that's probably the most

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.550 
back there and that's probably the most
positive<00:05:21.710> thing<00:05:22.070> I<00:05:22.190> give

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560
