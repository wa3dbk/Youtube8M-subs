00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.340
 because I with my boundless 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.410
 experience my superior intellect 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:42.660
 I would like others to be in charge of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:45.379

 purchase price falls and this is this 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:06.610
 what is the planet of treasure 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.979

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.979
 loot of the thousand worlds you know what 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.290

 ship reach anyone who manages to 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.000
 recovering it will get a place forever 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.539
 at the top of the pantheon of explorers e 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.460
 will be able to savor what happened

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.259
 you absolutely forgot it 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.270
 all those stories were nothing else 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.920
 stories with that treasure we can 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.210
 rebuild the bamboo a hundred more times 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.580

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.530
 how to ridicule his idea an idea 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.869
 quite paradoxical to cross 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.950
 the whole galaxy alone finally a 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.430
 meaningful speech

 to forge the character of a journey 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.400
 in the space 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.549

 I keep so much from starting and it is 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.120
