and the Shocker baton is changing hands
it's<00:01:51.579> quite<00:01:51.759> common<00:01:52.060> that<00:01:52.329> is<00:01:52.659> also<00:01:52.899> seen<00:01:53.289> in

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
it's quite common that is also seen in

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.459 
it's quite common that is also seen in
sh<00:01:53.920> figuarts<00:01:54.159> and<00:01:54.759> it<00:01:55.240> feels<00:01:55.630> secure<00:01:55.899> and

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
shows no sign of breakin so let's check

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.410 
shows no sign of breakin so let's check
out<00:01:59.950> the<00:02:00.159> articulation<00:02:00.789> points<00:02:01.180> for<00:02:01.329> the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
out the articulation points for the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.039 
out the articulation points for the
figure<00:02:01.689> because<00:02:02.109> I'm<00:02:02.380> just<00:02:02.590> doing<00:02:02.799> one<00:02:03.310> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
figure because I'm just doing one and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.499 
figure because I'm just doing one and
they're<00:02:05.049> all<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.380> same<00:02:05.409> so<00:02:06.219> there<00:02:06.640> are<00:02:06.880> no

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
they're all the same so there are no

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.980 
they're all the same so there are no
differences<00:02:08.050> we<00:02:08.460> just<00:02:09.460> have<00:02:09.610> three<00:02:10.000> of<00:02:10.270> the

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
differences we just have three of the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.560 
differences we just have three of the
