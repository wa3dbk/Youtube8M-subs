00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.179 
and purple
now<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.619> thought<00:01:04.619> those<00:01:04.799> were<00:01:04.920> different

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
now I thought those were different

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.740 
now I thought those were different
countries<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:05.909> I'm<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.180> sure<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.540> there's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
countries but I'm not sure if there's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.980 
countries but I'm not sure if there's
any<00:01:06.960> pink<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.799> purple<00:01:08.220> flags<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.600> don't<00:01:09.840> know

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
any pink and purple flags I don't know

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.010 
any pink and purple flags I don't know
but<00:01:10.650> um<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.930> I<00:01:12.930> did<00:01:13.760> google<00:01:14.760> up<00:01:14.939> flags<00:01:15.720> with

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
but um I I did google up flags with

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.679 
but um I I did google up flags with
colors<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.040> did<00:01:17.280> see<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.210> African

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
colors and I did see that the African

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.859 
colors and I did see that the African
flag<00:01:18.869> had<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> majority<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.740> those<00:01:19.920> colors

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
flag had a majority of those colors

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
flag had a majority of those colors
they<00:01:21.869> had<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> red<00:01:22.350> white<00:01:22.560> blue<00:01:22.970> green<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
they had a red white blue green and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.700 
they had a red white blue green and
black<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.689> had<00:01:24.840> yellow<00:01:25.080> in<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.350> he<00:01:25.530> didn't

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
black but I had yellow in it he didn't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.800 
black but I had yellow in it he didn't
see<00:01:25.830> yellow<00:01:26.040> but<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:26.909> like<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> closest

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
see yellow but that's like the closest

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.039 
see yellow but that's like the closest
thing<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.320> it's<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.500> glare

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
thing that you can see it it's got glare

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.380 
thing that you can see it it's got glare
but<00:01:34.049> that's<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.369> came<00:01:35.490> up<00:01:35.790> with<00:01:35.970> I'm

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
but that's like what I came up with I'm

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.660 
but that's like what I came up with I'm
sure<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:36.930> not<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.470> but<00:01:37.740> that's<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
sure that's not it but that's the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.780 
sure that's not it but that's the
closest<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> colors<00:01:39.900> that<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.140> seen<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.790> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
closest of the colors that I seen but it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.580 
closest of the colors that I seen but it
could<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.150> different<00:01:42.600> countries<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.290> maybe

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
could be different countries like maybe

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.810 
could be different countries like maybe
three<00:01:43.860> different<00:01:43.979> countries<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.670> two

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
three different countries or two

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
three different countries or two
countries<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.329> don't<00:01:45.509> know<00:01:45.600> or<00:01:46.170> maybe<00:01:46.200> purple

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
countries I don't know or maybe purple

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
countries I don't know or maybe purple
and<00:01:47.310> green<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.299> outfit<00:01:48.720> somebody

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and green was like an outfit somebody

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.240 
and green was like an outfit somebody
was<00:01:49.259> wearing<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.799> something

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
was wearing or something

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.750 
was wearing or something
I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.180> don't<00:01:51.690> know<00:01:51.840> but<00:01:52.440> when<00:01:53.340> he<00:01:53.490> told<00:01:53.640> me

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
I think I don't know but when he told me

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.390 
I think I don't know but when he told me
this<00:01:53.850> dream<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.690> actually<00:01:55.590> immediately

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
this dream I I actually immediately

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.520 
this dream I I actually immediately
thought<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.300> Olympics<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.470> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
thought of the Olympics because of the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.320 
thought of the Olympics because of the
fact<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.920> he<00:01:59.340> said<00:01:59.550> he<00:01:59.640> saw<00:01:59.820> tons<00:02:00.120> of

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
fact that he said he saw tons of

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.230 
fact that he said he saw tons of
different<00:02:00.630> supports<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:01.700> I'm<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.940> big<00:02:03.120> on

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
different supports and I'm not big on

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
different supports and I'm not big on
the<00:02:03.420> Olympics<00:02:03.810> I've<00:02:04.020> never<00:02:04.410> watched<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
the Olympics I've never watched the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
the Olympics I've never watched the
