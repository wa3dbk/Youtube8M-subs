00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.919
 alone I am here to present you a new one 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.540
 video that guys a new squad bild 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 because it was from a mess of time that 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 he didn't make one made up of two 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 top players 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.150
 indeed, by his players, there is less freight 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 in fact this one will be squad builder 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.769
 or rather it will be alive in this video vi 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.900
 I will present a team made up of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.910
 only two man of the matches you play 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.980
 in the teams he let out what they will be 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.830
 obviously the first is in others 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 boys mistakes van persie that after having 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 made a hat- trick against Olympia 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.329
 what return of the italy jarosz league is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.040
 the state was created 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.530
 orange paper because it made a magic 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
 triplet so I said and we don't e 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 no aidaa but if you have a mason in you 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.800
 squad the new came out this new 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.870
 paper and I said but let's get stove 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.770
 builder and you guys wanted to ask you 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.360
 a little thing 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.730
 what is this little things practically 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.280
 I felt to buy it 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.410
 I had to stop more and then there 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 I wanted to ask who you prefer me 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.250
 make a cool movie or where 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.930
 make robin van persie less have to do it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.030
 know how to write in a nice comment and if 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.470
 you want the pd still worth leaving a 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.140
 nice I like is a little message 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.880
 subliminal ground mushrooms you have to leave 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.439
 one likes to comment by writing which one 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 player you would like to see more done 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.460
 however I would start at the vast no 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 first nizar I wanted to remind you of the father 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 had the context link you will find in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 prescription and then I wanted to say that in 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.130
 based on my writings I am rto rto 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.829
 born like a 5 or 6 you were talking about 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.600
 5 6 out of 11 thousand that are the funk 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.119
 off the extra pay they found 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.100
 lionel put in shape or vacant for free 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.689
 full of madonna call you what you have 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.909
 found write it in the comments 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.619
 and if you have found something good 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.060
 you made the video by recording vi 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.530
 precisely while found the package in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.509
 more because that player came back 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.610
 send apple tree because you were a mystery or a patch 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.079
 the pack opening reaction so if you have 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.640
 one of your nations, our beauty 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.290
 ration I get a package donated a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.299
 good player but loaded on youtube 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.100
 video did not avoid the link mandates 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.560
 however we can start it now 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.299
 cech reports that the boys are there 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.950
 club and already was already present in 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.440
 some grid array that I have to say i 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.230
 really, really, but I did 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.209
 an absurd duck but then it can be 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.220
 all taken, however, I tell you only what it is 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.110
 a beast but also of his maps 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.970
 rate a few times it does but if instead 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 defense then defenders are de il 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.819
 magical ne david luiz and then to that or even 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.700
 no crisis even without or because his is 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 however david he knows more and more guys 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.650
 strong and more matches with him 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.420
 the stronger it becomes, the more it becomes ai 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.910
 levels or better follow the treble 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:42.269
 dante levels and many of you 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.829
 they know what it means to 189 cm working 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.410
 so normal 3 st in health care 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:49.079
 transfers weak but still 79 of 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.879
 beta 80 as head at 77 in speed 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:53.489
 if you then add the card the tennis player 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:56.129
 still in life beloved then instead 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.349
 as another says use also because 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.849
 boy knows that first of all because he has a 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.859
 strabello haircut but 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.780
 secondly, because they told me 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.040
 no to the sides with layer to try it at 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.959
 guys I have to say I liked it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.340
 I would never have been so much 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.709
 strong because statistically speaking 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.690
 does not seem a little less in the statistics 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.310
 shoulders on paper we are not a player 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.989
 very good but guys i can 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.579
 ensure that you are really strong if you have 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.859
 the credits to buy it try it because 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.440
 this only 2,400 and then it will help you to 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.880
 give double understanding to this you tell us that 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.819
 one must be sincere in the second me is 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.709
 the best you tell us then is for sure 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.389
 one of me knows that the best tells us more 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.669
 paid for the whole game in addition to 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.829
 casemiro is therefore the second in fact I'm 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.599
 talking about iron that guys this 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.599
 boy is very strong 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.150
 188 cm high or other war kate than par 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:44.340
 cd there are the top 13 games and two goals 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.750
 then he is a very complete player look 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.849
 to finish statistics but also the feet 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.889
 always and the possibilities indeed presents 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.260
 four-star bed and breakfast or but 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.700
 three stars your skills in over 85 of 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.049
 header that really a lot 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.000
 especially for a midfielder 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.590
 defensive then look at some satin 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.629
 statistics there seemed to be a player 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.280
 complete and in addition is paid therefore 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.139
 imagine a complete player wandering 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.430
 instead we pass the left side of the 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.139
 team as left side 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.180
 well I can't say it 's ok too 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.910
 hybrid this team at times barnes 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.260
 premier league and liga bbva indeed or 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.389
 decides to use what he is narrating 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.500
 Yesterday's fear this team indeed 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.450
 as he says use 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.420
 the magic pepper as left exterior 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.400
 salt and how do you say mineral water 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.620
 no but then as cdc then ok 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.600
 he always the magical casemiro then i 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.820
 two that I think are the two 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.320
 central defensive midfielders more 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.580
 strong or better maybe even this game 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.310
 they are both present in this team 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.050
 and then ok as it uses a wing 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.480
 left because otherwise we are pac 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.730
 it becomes the sovereign cristiano ronaldo team 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.310
 of the year and kids if you don't believe 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.140
 to buy it, take denny I don't know 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.850
 if you saw my wager match of 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.890
 cool outlines tattered to their own 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.240
 split deretani then oh well they were 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:56.020
 in my opinion going strong players 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.760
 this game 85 games 68 goals 19 assists 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.919
 alas, he is not holding a real average 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 because type now has made 250 goals in 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.180
 240 games now don't remember well 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.580
 however viva cristiano ronaldo 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 instead we go to the department but first 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.510
 there is obviously a right to stay 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.700
 on the right I already anticipated the veil 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.830
 I use a right wing here too 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.390
 using samir nasri man of the match 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.190
 that I had sold and then bought back 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.419
 because you guys see this player 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.130
 really strong 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.570
 if I find a flaw is 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.220
 of physical strength in fact a does not know 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.850
 much of physical strength is expected a 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.530
 second 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.479
 I can also tell you but for the rest it is 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.550
 really complete has a lot 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.950
 finalizing to perfect dribbling 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.210
 a ball control but very geekissimo indeed 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.760
 anyway I 'm telling you about strength 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.440
 of physical strength presents only 67 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.870
 of physical strength which is a little bit in fact 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.540
 I prefer to use it with an exterior 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.250
 that as a wing because in the case where it 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.750
 you put it to him he would 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.300
 should have something to do with defenders 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.040
 with defenders here maybe it is 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.620
 fullbacks as well as midfielders who 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.390
 usually those players are a little bit 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.729
 stronger a little wider than shoulders 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.740
 therefore they risk dropping it often 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.270
 so it's a little tactical thing if so 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.919
 you have if you have it I recommend you 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.450
 use it as an external right hand 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.020
 instead to the offensive department 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.450
 then as you are looking for you can use or 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.100
 you can use de bruyne or 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.290
 you can also use oscar or better 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.180
 a player who by double agreement or a 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:17.020
 one of the two attackers or both o 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.610
 also on the cdc 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.870
 however I always use him because 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.419
 as you know it is one of mine 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.490
 favorite offensive midfielders 71 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.620
 matches 21 goals 17 assists 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.340
 okay I want you in my every team 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.260
 so don't d 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.360
 it's not even doing this mini review for you 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.389
 but let's go on the attack because from one 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:37.360
 paid part use robin van persie 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:39.880
 the beauty of one million 149,000 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.919
 credits two parties two goals and an assist 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.080
 the kids loved it a lot but 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.540
 you know what I especially liked the 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.330
 his ability to sort the game first 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:51.070
 I had tried it as an act but it had one 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.410
 sin is there or rather I do not like a 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.270
 player used as the 4 3 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:57.430
 3 false 9 so I said need 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.199
 change it the role we put it in 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:00.520
 a 3 5 2 flanked by a player 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:02.200
 fast because in fact what the only one 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.760
 sin of this player in my opinion is 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.220
 the speed in fact only presents 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.889
 78 of speed but if then placed side by side to the 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.260
 magical and you all become simpler 

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:13.419
 because it's your aces at speed than physical 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.040
 it does not have a good passage which it conceals 

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:17.020
 instead it is robin van persie then 

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.729
 roughly they are complementary and you can 

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.789
 obviously make a killing of these goals 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:23.710
 two players aged 61 matches 47 goals and 38 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:25.960
 assist and instead had two goals a year 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.610
 of two goals and an assist in two games 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.289
 so it doesn't seem bad to me at all 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.789
 guys said this i hope the 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.650
 team you both enjoyed amiri 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:34.570
 I kept to herself seven minutes and not less 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.210
 let me know how much yours would be 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:38.680
 ideal duration b1 squad miller and then 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.030
 guys, I wanted to remind you to pass 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:43.030
 from the end page on why I am going to 

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:45.940
 make the clown of naples port second 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.500
 how much I ended up for me I don't want 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.380
 gufare 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:52.690
 naples makes a nice 1 to 0 and then yes 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.099
 will enjoy the rigors but it is all to see and 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:55.720
 so guys I hope the video is there 

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:57.490

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.050
 like to comment to join if not 

00:07:57.490 --> 00:08:01.090

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:03.160
 important to write to me if you prefer to have 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:04.599
 the piles of orange robin van persie 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.240
 then man of the match 

00:08:04.599 --> 00:08:09.550
