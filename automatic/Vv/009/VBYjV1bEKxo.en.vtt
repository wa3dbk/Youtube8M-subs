00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
for it to come out and so I really want

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.530 
for it to come out and so I really want
to<00:02:52.190> tell<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.430> guys<00:02:52.519> about<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.880> it's<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:53.239> um

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
to tell you guys about it it's it's um

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.229 
to tell you guys about it it's it's um
so<00:02:54.200> it's<00:02:54.380> it's<00:02:54.590> like<00:02:54.890> a<00:02:54.920> five<00:02:55.550> part<00:02:56.000> I<00:02:56.209> think

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
so it's it's like a five part I think

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.360 
so it's it's like a five part I think
series<00:02:56.930> with<00:02:57.560> i<00:02:57.769> think<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.220> there's

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
series with i think that there's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:59.680 
series with i think that there's
crafting<00:02:58.880> right<00:02:59.000> in<00:02:59.120> the<00:02:59.209> trailer<00:02:59.480> if<00:02:59.600> you

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
crafting right in the trailer if you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.729 
crafting right in the trailer if you
watch<00:02:59.900> it<00:03:00.080> it<00:03:00.170> looks<00:03:00.319> like<00:03:00.350> there's<00:03:00.560> going<00:03:00.650> to

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
watch it it looks like there's going to

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.410 
watch it it looks like there's going to
be<00:03:00.769> some<00:03:01.130> kind<00:03:01.340> of<00:03:01.459> crafting<00:03:01.940> an<00:03:02.030> interactive

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
be some kind of crafting an interactive

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.090 
be some kind of crafting an interactive
crafting<00:03:02.810> in<00:03:02.930> there<00:03:03.080> like<00:03:03.590> I<00:03:03.680> think<00:03:03.860> they<00:03:03.920> make

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
crafting in there like I think they make

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.289 
crafting in there like I think they make
a<00:03:04.130> sword<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.670> looks<00:03:04.819> like<00:03:04.910> there's<00:03:05.060> gonna<00:03:05.150> be

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
a sword it looks like there's gonna be

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.120 
a sword it looks like there's gonna be
some<00:03:05.450> combat<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.989> some<00:03:06.170> sort<00:03:06.380> I<00:03:06.560> haven't

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130
