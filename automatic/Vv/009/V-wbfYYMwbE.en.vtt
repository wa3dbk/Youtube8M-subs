okay<00:00:00.690> part<00:00:01.020> two<00:00:01.290> today<00:00:02.280> we're<00:00:02.580> talking<00:00:02.760> about

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay part two today we're talking about

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay part two today we're talking about
muscle<00:00:03.899> fiber<00:00:04.319> type<00:00:04.759> adaptations<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.750> here's

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
muscle fiber type adaptations so here's

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.110 
muscle fiber type adaptations so here's
a<00:00:07.140> quick<00:00:07.410> overview<00:00:07.560> of<00:00:07.950> muscle<00:00:08.550> fiber<00:00:08.760> types

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
a quick overview of muscle fiber types

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.049 
a quick overview of muscle fiber types
there<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.019> spectrum<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.920> fiber<00:00:11.219> types<00:00:11.580> from

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
there is a spectrum of fiber types from

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.560 
there is a spectrum of fiber types from
Smotrich<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:13.139> fast<00:00:13.410> which<00:00:13.759> on<00:00:14.759> smoked<00:00:15.360> which

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
Smotrich to fast which on smoked which

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.220 
Smotrich to fast which on smoked which
end<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.230> fibers<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:16.980> small<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.270> week<00:00:18.480> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
end the fibers are small in a week that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.599 
end the fibers are small in a week that
generate<00:00:19.650> tension<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:20.130> little<00:00:20.250> bit<00:00:20.460> more

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
generate tension a little bit more

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.210 
generate tension a little bit more
slowly<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.300> they<00:00:21.869> are<00:00:22.020> energy<00:00:22.529> efficient

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
slowly and they are energy efficient

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.670 
slowly and they are energy efficient
these<00:00:23.939> fibers<00:00:24.390> are<00:00:24.600> good<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.199> endurance

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
these fibers are good for endurance

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.509 
these fibers are good for endurance
based<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> low<00:00:26.550> force<00:00:27.000> movements<00:00:27.660> on<00:00:28.349> the

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
based and low force movements on the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.370 
based and low force movements on the
fast<00:00:29.519> which<00:00:29.789> end<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.150> spectrum<00:00:30.390> muscle

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
fast which end of the spectrum muscle

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
fast which end of the spectrum muscle
fibers<00:00:31.740> are<00:00:31.890> bigger<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.340> stronger<00:00:32.700> they

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
fibers are bigger and stronger they

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.510 
fibers are bigger and stronger they
generate<00:00:33.840> tension<00:00:34.050> more<00:00:34.410> quickly<00:00:34.710> but<00:00:35.430> they

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
generate tension more quickly but they

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
generate tension more quickly but they
have<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.090> endurance<00:00:36.450> these<00:00:37.380> fibers

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
have very little endurance these fibers

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.410 
have very little endurance these fibers
are<00:00:37.950> good<00:00:38.129> for<00:00:38.399> high<00:00:38.700> speed<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.360> high

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
are good for high speed and high

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
are good for high speed and high
muscular<00:00:40.379> force<00:00:40.680> movements<00:00:41.190> things<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
muscular force movements things like

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.540 
muscular force movements things like
sprinting<00:00:42.660> jumping<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.320> weightlifting<00:00:43.680> so

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
sprinting jumping and weightlifting so

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.299 
sprinting jumping and weightlifting so
its<00:00:44.700> efficiency<00:00:44.989> versus<00:00:45.989> proficiency<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
its efficiency versus proficiency and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.470 
its efficiency versus proficiency and
you<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> whole<00:00:47.760> bunch<00:00:47.789> fibers<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.420> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you have a whole bunch fibers in the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.720 
you have a whole bunch fibers in the
middle<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.899> have<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> mix<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.730> okay

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
middle that have a mix of the two okay

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.810 
middle that have a mix of the two okay
so<00:00:50.930> everybody<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.140> muscle<00:00:52.500> fibers<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> all

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
so everybody has muscle fibers in all

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.160 
so everybody has muscle fibers in all
areas<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.539> spectrum<00:00:55.370> but<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.270> fiber<00:00:57.750> type

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
areas of the spectrum but the fiber type

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670 
areas of the spectrum but the fiber type
make<00:00:58.620> up<00:00:58.829> in<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.309> particular<00:00:59.850> muscle<00:01:00.320> adapts<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
make up in a particular muscle adapts to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.100 
make up in a particular muscle adapts to
activity<00:01:02.250> over<00:01:02.550> time<00:01:02.660> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.930> more

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
activity over time if you do more

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.200 
activity over time if you do more
endurance<00:01:04.650> based<00:01:04.949> stuff<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.670> more<00:01:05.939> slow

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
endurance based stuff you get more slow

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.969 
endurance based stuff you get more slow
twitch<00:01:06.479> fibers<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.080> do<00:01:07.229> more<00:01:07.409> high<00:01:07.650> for

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
twitch fibers if you do more high for

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
twitch fibers if you do more high for
stuff<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.580> get<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:08.909> fast<00:01:09.210> twitch<00:01:09.479> fibers<00:01:10.250> so

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
stuff you get more fast twitch fibers so

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.210 
stuff you get more fast twitch fibers so
let's<00:01:11.610> talk<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.000> strength<00:01:12.600> training

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
let's talk about strength training

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.980 
let's talk about strength training
strength<00:01:14.220> training<00:01:14.340> uses<00:01:15.060> maximum<00:01:15.750> muscle

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
strength training uses maximum muscle

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.100 
strength training uses maximum muscle
tension<00:01:16.530> so<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.490> very<00:01:17.759> much<00:01:18.030> fast<00:01:18.659> twitch

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
tension so it is very much fast twitch

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410 
tension so it is very much fast twitch
dominant<00:01:19.770> anyone<00:01:20.640> who<00:01:20.790> says<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> slow

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
dominant anyone who says that slow

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.260 
dominant anyone who says that slow
twitch<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.049> absolutely<00:01:22.740> wrong

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
twitch is absolutely wrong

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
twitch is absolutely wrong
however<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> muscle<00:01:24.869> contractions<00:01:25.470> during

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
however the muscle contractions during

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
however the muscle contractions during
straight<00:01:26.159> training<00:01:26.610> lasts<00:01:27.450> relatively<00:01:28.290> long

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
straight training lasts relatively long

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
straight training lasts relatively long
we're<00:01:29.340> talking<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> whole<00:01:30.210> second<00:01:30.720> or

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
we're talking about a whole second or

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
we're talking about a whole second or
maybe<00:01:31.049> even<00:01:31.259> two<00:01:31.710> or<00:01:31.890> three<00:01:32.159> seconds<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.820> max

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
maybe even two or three seconds of max

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.530 
maybe even two or three seconds of max
tension<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.079> heavy<00:01:34.320> reps<00:01:34.880> muscle<00:01:35.880> fibers<00:01:36.270> even

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
tension on heavy reps muscle fibers even

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.560 
tension on heavy reps muscle fibers even
the<00:01:37.140> slow<00:01:37.409> ones<00:01:37.680> reach<00:01:38.400> peak<00:01:38.729> tension<00:01:39.000> pretty

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the slow ones reach peak tension pretty

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
the slow ones reach peak tension pretty
much<00:01:39.720> instantaneously<00:01:40.619> generally<00:01:41.549> under

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
much instantaneously generally under

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.179 
much instantaneously generally under
tenth<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.390> second<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.040> you're

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
tenth of a second so when you're

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
tenth of a second so when you're
sustaining<00:01:44.820> tension<00:01:45.270> for<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> couple<00:01:45.990> seconds

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
sustaining tension for a couple seconds

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.460 
sustaining tension for a couple seconds
and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:47.250> doing<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.759> three<00:01:48.299> five<00:01:48.689> eight<00:01:49.170> ten

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and then doing that three five eight ten

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.100 
and then doing that three five eight ten
times<00:01:49.799> for<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> set<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.509> definitely<00:01:51.990> an

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
times for a set there is definitely an

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.620 
times for a set there is definitely an
endurance<00:01:52.500> component<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.460> as<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.090> result

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
endurance component to that as a result

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.889 
endurance component to that as a result
strength<00:01:55.530> training<00:01:55.829> does<00:01:56.310> pull<00:01:56.820> fibers<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
strength training does pull fibers to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.889 
strength training does pull fibers to
the<00:01:57.930> fast<00:01:58.320> which<00:01:58.680> side<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.579> spectrum<00:01:59.899> but

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
the fast which side of the spectrum but

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.190 
the fast which side of the spectrum but
not<00:02:01.110> all<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.829> fest<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.369> end

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
not all the way to the fest which end

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
not all the way to the fest which end
okay<00:02:04.200> so<00:02:04.259> here's<00:02:04.560> our<00:02:04.680> spectrum<00:02:05.219> understand

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
okay so here's our spectrum understand

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.480 
okay so here's our spectrum understand
there<00:02:06.420> are<00:02:06.509> not<00:02:06.659> just<00:02:06.869> two

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
there are not just two

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.330 
there are not just two
there's<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:07.939> progression<00:02:08.149> from<00:02:08.720> slow<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.080> fast

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
there's a progression from slow to fast

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.979 
there's a progression from slow to fast
and<00:02:10.340> muscle<00:02:10.670> fibers<00:02:11.030> don't<00:02:11.180> jump<00:02:11.599> from<00:02:11.780> one

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
and muscle fibers don't jump from one

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.809 
and muscle fibers don't jump from one
end<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.380> other<00:02:12.500> they<00:02:12.950> just<00:02:13.160> shift<00:02:13.430> up<00:02:13.700> or

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
end to the other they just shift up or

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.360 
end to the other they just shift up or
down<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.060> little<00:02:14.560> okay<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.590> strength<00:02:16.040> training

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
down a little okay so strength training

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
down a little okay so strength training
is<00:02:16.610> gonna<00:02:16.790> pull<00:02:17.090> most<00:02:17.540> buyers<00:02:17.840> to<00:02:18.319> somewhere

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
is gonna pull most buyers to somewhere

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.260 
is gonna pull most buyers to somewhere
on<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.860> fast<00:02:19.160> twitch<00:02:19.430> side<00:02:19.670> something<00:02:20.090> like

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
on the fast twitch side something like

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.979 
on the fast twitch side something like
right<00:02:20.480> here

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
right here

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.260 
right here
whereas<00:02:21.620> sprinting<00:02:22.400> jumping<00:02:22.610> and<00:02:23.239> throwing

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
whereas sprinting jumping and throwing

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.290 
whereas sprinting jumping and throwing
more<00:02:24.050> high<00:02:24.290> speed<00:02:24.680> things<00:02:24.980> pull<00:02:25.849> fibers

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
more high speed things pull fibers

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.500 
more high speed things pull fibers
closer<00:02:26.660> to<00:02:27.019> the<00:02:27.110> end<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> spectrum<00:02:28.510> okay

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
closer to the end of the spectrum okay

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.020 
closer to the end of the spectrum okay
so<00:02:29.569> here's<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.989> theoretical<00:02:30.590> scenario<00:02:31.040> let's

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
so here's a theoretical scenario let's

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.990 
so here's a theoretical scenario let's
say<00:02:32.180> you're<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.569> young<00:02:32.720> athlete<00:02:33.400> you're<00:02:34.400> active

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
say you're a young athlete you're active

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.050 
say you're a young athlete you're active
but<00:02:35.750> you're<00:02:35.900> untrained<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.980> strength<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
but you're untrained in strength and

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.199 
but you're untrained in strength and
explosiveness<00:02:39.100> your<00:02:40.100> fiber<00:02:40.430> tight<00:02:40.790> makeup

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
explosiveness your fiber tight makeup

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.930 
explosiveness your fiber tight makeup
might<00:02:42.110> look<00:02:42.260> something<00:02:42.620> like<00:02:42.680> this<00:02:43.010> this

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
might look something like this this

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.090 
might look something like this this
represents<00:02:44.630> an<00:02:44.750> even<00:02:45.170> distribution<00:02:45.350> from

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
represents an even distribution from

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.300 
represents an even distribution from
slow<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.549> fast<00:02:47.500> now<00:02:48.500> you<00:02:48.739> start<00:02:49.010> strength

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
slow to fast now you start strength

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.190 
slow to fast now you start strength
training<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:50.720> going<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:50.989> cause<00:02:51.170> some

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
training it's going to cause some

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.070 
training it's going to cause some
shifting<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.250> muscle<00:02:52.640> fibers<00:02:53.030> toward<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
shifting of muscle fibers toward that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.960 
shifting of muscle fibers toward that
strength<00:02:54.560> training<00:02:54.830> area<00:02:55.220> of<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> spectrum

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
strength training area of the spectrum

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.600 
strength training area of the spectrum
so<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:56.959> progress<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.739> something<00:02:58.190> like<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
so you progress to something like this

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.120 
so you progress to something like this
so<00:02:59.600> not<00:02:59.870> only<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.290> strength<00:03:00.590> training<00:03:00.890> make

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
so not only this strength training make

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.590 
so not only this strength training make
you<00:03:01.250> stronger<00:03:01.610> like<00:03:01.910> we<00:03:02.030> talked<00:03:02.269> about<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
you stronger like we talked about the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.900 
you stronger like we talked about the
part<00:03:02.810> one<00:03:03.019> but<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.130> also<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.700> to<00:03:04.760> make

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
part one but it's also going to make

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.660 
part one but it's also going to make
your<00:03:05.299> overall<00:03:05.810> fiber<00:03:06.349> type<00:03:06.680> distribution<00:03:07.010> a

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
your overall fiber type distribution a

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.210 
your overall fiber type distribution a
little<00:03:08.120> bit<00:03:08.239> more<00:03:08.480> fast<00:03:08.840> twitch<00:03:09.200> so<00:03:10.040> that's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
little bit more fast twitch so that's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.190 
little bit more fast twitch so that's
two<00:03:10.489> positive<00:03:11.030> adaptations<00:03:11.720> that's

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
two positive adaptations that's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.599 
two positive adaptations that's
fantastic<00:03:13.070> but<00:03:14.680> what<00:03:15.680> if<00:03:15.799> you're<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> highly

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:16.609 
fantastic but what if you're a highly

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.180 
fantastic but what if you're a highly
trained<00:03:17.000> advanced<00:03:17.690> athlete<00:03:18.230> you're<00:03:18.980> going<00:03:19.130> to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
trained advanced athlete you're going to

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.949 
trained advanced athlete you're going to
have<00:03:19.310> more<00:03:19.459> fibers<00:03:20.000> over<00:03:20.209> on<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.600> fast

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
have more fibers over on that fast

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.080 
have more fibers over on that fast
twitch<00:03:21.290> end<00:03:21.560> of<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.739> spectrum<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.430> your

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
twitch end of the spectrum so your

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.400 
twitch end of the spectrum so your
distribution<00:03:23.420> might<00:03:23.870> look<00:03:23.989> something<00:03:24.200> like

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
distribution might look something like

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.300 
distribution might look something like
this<00:03:25.720> then<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.930> strength<00:03:27.290> training<00:03:27.650> you

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
this then you strength training you

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.099 
this then you strength training you
shift<00:03:28.670> some<00:03:29.000> of<00:03:29.030> those<00:03:29.180> fibers<00:03:29.660> on<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:29.840> end

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
shift some of those fibers on the end

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.710 
shift some of those fibers on the end
down<00:03:30.769> a<00:03:30.799> little<00:03:31.190> bit<00:03:31.370> they're<00:03:32.090> still<00:03:32.420> fast

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
down a little bit they're still fast

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.370 
down a little bit they're still fast
twitch<00:03:33.079> but<00:03:33.739> not<00:03:33.920> quite<00:03:34.190> as<00:03:34.430> fast<00:03:35.290> so<00:03:36.290> you

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
twitch but not quite as fast so you

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.990 
twitch but not quite as fast so you
progress<00:03:36.560> toward<00:03:37.010> a<00:03:37.069> distribution<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.880> is

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
progress toward a distribution that is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.110 
progress toward a distribution that is
overall<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:38.720> little<00:03:38.959> bit<00:03:39.170> less<00:03:39.500> fast<00:03:39.829> which<00:03:40.160> for

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
overall a little bit less fast which for

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.940 
overall a little bit less fast which for
running<00:03:41.420> and<00:03:41.569> jumping<00:03:41.870> athletes<00:03:42.319> that's<00:03:42.769> a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
running and jumping athletes that's a

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.789 
running and jumping athletes that's a
negative<00:03:43.430> adaptation<00:03:44.239> so<00:03:45.019> for<00:03:45.319> more<00:03:45.530> advanced

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
negative adaptation so for more advanced

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.039 
negative adaptation so for more advanced
athletes<00:03:46.450> strength<00:03:47.450> training<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.959> still

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
athletes strength training is still

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.170 
athletes strength training is still
gonna<00:03:48.290> make<00:03:48.440> you<00:03:48.560> stronger<00:03:48.940> but<00:03:49.940> it<00:03:50.030> might

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
gonna make you stronger but it might

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.479 
gonna make you stronger but it might
also<00:03:50.389> slow<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.989> down<00:03:51.139> a<00:03:51.200> little<00:03:51.470> bit<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:52.010> this

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
also slow you down a little bit and this

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.789 
also slow you down a little bit and this
is<00:03:52.549> tough<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.000> deal<00:03:53.180> with<00:03:53.209> because<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:54.620> might

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
is tough to deal with because you might

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.340 
is tough to deal with because you might
think<00:03:55.069> that<00:03:55.310> if<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.940> keep<00:03:56.209> doing<00:03:56.450> my<00:03:56.750> explosive

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
think that if I keep doing my explosive

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.080 
think that if I keep doing my explosive
training<00:03:57.739> then<00:03:57.859> I'll<00:03:57.980> keep<00:03:58.160> my<00:03:58.370> fibers<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.060> the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
training then I'll keep my fibers on the

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.870 
training then I'll keep my fibers on the
fast<00:03:59.420> twitch<00:03:59.690> in<00:03:59.900> they're<00:04:00.489> probably<00:04:01.489> not

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 
fast twitch in they're probably not

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.129 
fast twitch in they're probably not
actually<00:04:02.120> because<00:04:02.630> there's<00:04:02.870> this<00:04:02.959> other

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
actually because there's this other

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:03.839 
actually because there's this other
component

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
component

component
of<00:04:03.939> the<00:04:04.689> total<00:04:04.930> amount<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.379> work<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.709> do

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
of the total amount of work you do

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.940 
of the total amount of work you do
basically<00:04:07.030> how<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.629> works<00:04:07.689> is<00:04:08.049> a<00:04:08.349> high

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
basically how it works is a high

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.190 
basically how it works is a high
activity<00:04:09.489> level<00:04:09.930> encourages<00:04:10.930> some

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
activity level encourages some

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.860 
activity level encourages some
efficiency<00:04:11.469> in<00:04:12.310> your<00:04:12.340> muscle<00:04:12.730> fibers<00:04:12.870> so

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
efficiency in your muscle fibers so

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.390 
efficiency in your muscle fibers so
doing<00:04:14.260> a<00:04:14.349> whole<00:04:14.530> bunch<00:04:14.680> of<00:04:14.769> explosive

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
doing a whole bunch of explosive

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.759 
doing a whole bunch of explosive
training<00:04:15.819> is<00:04:16.389> not<00:04:16.660> going<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.959> compensate<00:04:17.620> for

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
training is not going to compensate for

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.110 
training is not going to compensate for
the<00:04:17.889> strength<00:04:18.190> training<00:04:18.459> you're<00:04:18.699> still<00:04:18.970> going

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
the strength training you're still going

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.360 
the strength training you're still going
to<00:04:19.150> get<00:04:19.359> some<00:04:19.600> of<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.720> downward<00:04:20.530> shifting<00:04:21.250> of

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
to get some of that downward shifting of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.029 
to get some of that downward shifting of
those<00:04:21.489> muscle<00:04:21.880> fibers<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.740> there's<00:04:23.919> an

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
those muscle fibers so there's an

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.279 
those muscle fibers so there's an
article<00:04:24.370> on<00:04:24.430> my<00:04:24.520> site<00:04:24.759> it's<00:04:25.539> called<00:04:25.660> taking

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:26.289 
article on my site it's called taking

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.020 
article on my site it's called taking
time<00:04:26.500> off<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:26.949> the<00:04:27.370> article<00:04:27.729> I<00:04:27.789> talked<00:04:28.000> about

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
time off in the article I talked about

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.430 
time off in the article I talked about
something<00:04:28.419> called<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.810> overshoot

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
something called the overshoot

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.339 
something called the overshoot
phenomenon<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.789> has<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.180> do<00:04:31.360> with<00:04:31.690> muscle

00:04:32.339 --> 00:04:32.349 
phenomenon it has to do with muscle

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:34.950 
phenomenon it has to do with muscle
