00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:10.100
 but these things are not there 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.090
 I go out nothing 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.090
 then active 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.079
 ok i think she made it then me 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.399
 sorry to all because today 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:33.440
 I had to do the video from 3 to 4 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:36.290
 live chat that is, however, I have to put 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.989
 directly live and talk with 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.860
 you we are placed at the beginning with 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.339
 so much effort 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.470
 ok i managed to talk though 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:49.370
 only with David because I had gods 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.829
 very serious problems for very serious 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.850
 regarding the connection 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 so I apologize to all the audio 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.799
 he didn't feel he had a series of 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.659
 problems in short, I succeeded anyway 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.000
 to talk a bit with david though like 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:06.500
 I said I could go further for the 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.840
 suns we didn't talk that much 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.640
 where this problem here so I apologize 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.450
 with all those who were me 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.000
 looking for 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.280
 and at this point to avoid precisely 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.740
 all this series of problems maybe 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.799
 we organize something done in this 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.280
 so practically live here write me 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.170
 I answer you we do so because not 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.710
 I understood nothing then soon 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.750
 I'll do it directly 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.159
 let's analyze a video made in this 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.770
 live way 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.960
 I repeat, I apologize again but the connection 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.760
 match the audio could not be heard 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.270
 images were blurred there is no more 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.500
 anything 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.860
 gina even though it started like this e 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.630
 so no excuse there and then that's all 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.909
 in short, we can reason later on for 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:59.479
 doing a post thing is fine then 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:03.350
 I have to figure out how to close it in 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.130
 actually i don't know this the problem of 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.130
 this computer 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.959
 here's interesting so you're voting 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.410
 the cia the bike of the genre in practice 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.160
 register here and I automatically go to 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.870
 fix 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:26.380
 I do everything live on it 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:33.100
 correct you have a little focus 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:38.440
 let us also see the effect illuminates 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:45.489
 as if tobacconist color reflector 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.489
 wife andy white original meto 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:57.850
 slaughter but focused or crushed 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.850
 st effect but Beguine look at that wind 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:07.180
 werner hell we do not do 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:11.329
 look at what effect ugo is hiding 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:29.180
 look here I 'm more or less neither 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:34.030
 pocket in the long run a little and gina looks a 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.030
 little lannin like cats to see 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:44.880
 d1 their diamonds of everything is fine then 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.380
 I got it 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.480
 let's do something like that too 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.480
 because this I think I like best 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.520
 we do directly in a thing of the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.610
 sort order we organize a video in 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.360
 direct then you put yourself directly 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.910
 in chat talk to me while I'm in 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.590
 direct as we were because I think that 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.000
 this we understand more than that 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.350
 high because when I told you I got it 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.010
 entangled began to lose his head 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.650
 a slaughterhouse 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.930
 Oh well guys and I repeat excuse me 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.430
 another time and colors I said then there 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.239
 we organize differently vi 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:21.830
