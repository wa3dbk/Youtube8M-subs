00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:13.620
 campagnolo unit installation 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.039
 power b2 and ips with support 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.039
 elastic in this video 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will see how to install it 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.779
 of the power unit v2 using a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 elastic support inserted in the tumor 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.919
 gisella it is the solution 5 of 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.579
 installation we refer you to the video 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.120
 the power unit v2 eps for the others 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.990
 four mounting solutions are 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.340
 the following elastic supports are available 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:50.780
 for seat post tubes diameter 27.9 mm 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:56.700
 gray color for seat post tubes 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:01:00.300
 diameter 30.9 bar 31.6 mm color 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.240
 black in case of type of gisella tumor 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.850
 aerodynamic drip and choose the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.189
 most suitable elastic support version 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.409
 depending on the geometry and of the 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.710
 tube size so that e 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.080
 support has entered permanently 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.720
 remove the extinguishing magnet 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.600
 from the power unit and install a 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:25.080
 Soundproof ring is supplied with the unit of 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.259
 power in the lower area and a ring 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.000
 anti-noise in the upper quarry present 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.000
 in the power unit itself 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:45.470
 completely tighten the nut provided 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.710
 with the support on the threaded pin of the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.960
 same habitat support is the pivot on 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.630
 threaded seat at the end 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.890
 unit of power up to go into 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.890
 beat with the nut 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.420
 clean and degrease the inner surface 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.760
 of the seat post to increase 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.119
 the adherence between the tube itself and the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.850
 elastic support insert the support 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.950
 elastic in the seat post throughout 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.920
 its length and in case of cancer 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.200
 asymmetrical saddle defined the best 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:27.010
 mounting position of the support 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:29.500
 elastic rotate the power unit 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.380
 of the necessary angle by unscrewing the o 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:35.050
 inhabiting it on the pin to align it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.570
 seat tube and any obstructions 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.200
 present inside the frame ad 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.080
 example 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.950
 pay attention to the door rivets 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.010
 water bottle blocked the power unit 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.709
 in the defined position and tightening with 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.500
 a spanner nut 7 mm 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:58.480
 unbeaten on the power unit at 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.670
 expected torque alongside the pipe 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.160
 regis saddle to the seat tube in the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.980
 position of minimum insertion of the tube 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.680
 seat post check the length 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.090
 of the four cables of the power unit 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.470
 is sufficient as indicated below 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.280
 verify that the connector for the 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:20.049
 recharge of the power unit is possible 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.569
 place in the hole provided on the 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.849
 frame 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:27.510
 check that the three male connectors 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:32.040
 of the yellow derailleur gear cables 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.530
 green and red interface succeed in 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.959
 get out of the holes in the frame to be able to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.230
 be connected to the respective connectors 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.680
 female of the components to be connected in 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.250
 case of insufficient cable length 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.930
 provide yourself with suitable extensions yes 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.239
 keep in mind that in the case not 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.280
 They were used extensions a 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.650
 once the power unit is installed 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.139
 it may not be possible 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:02.879
 removing the seat post from the tube 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:05.430
 post to keep the four together 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.370
 power unit cables and facilitate 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.099
 the passage inside the frame 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.889
 mount the two spirals neither and using 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.609
 the cable management kit lets out the 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.410
 cables from the bottom bracket box 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.030
 subsequently removing the spirals nor 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.030
 holding the cables together 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.670
 fit the metal threaded insert 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.650
 on the charger connector 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.600
 installed and the knurled washer for 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:08.870
 prevent it from being tightened 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:11.570
 nut the cable rotate insert the cable 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.520
 long of low hollow magnet kits in 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.330
 hole from which the connector should exit 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:21.040
 of the charger and via the magnet 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.040
 connect it to the charger connector 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.660
 to exit and partially the connector 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.450
 from the hole provided in the frame e 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.490
 leave the cord with magnet so as to 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:43.450
 prevent the connector from returning 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:45.790
 inside the frame insert the 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:50.340
 washer and nut tightening to one 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.340
 torque of 1.5 newton meters 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.010
 remove the metal threaded insert 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.350
 and install the closing cap of the 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.790
 connector making sure it is 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:08.890
 properly screwed continue 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.260
 installation with the passage of the 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.540
 front derailleur gear cables e 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:16.570
 of the interface following the instructions 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:19.020
 of video and ps the editing of 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.020
