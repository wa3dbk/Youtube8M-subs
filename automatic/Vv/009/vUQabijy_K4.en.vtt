and<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.439> fact<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> pick<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.369> hair<00:01:14.790> from

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and the fact that you pick up hair from

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.160 
and the fact that you pick up hair from
the<00:01:15.150> bottom<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> twist<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the bottom and twist it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.969 
the bottom and twist it

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
but it's only using two so you grab the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.260 
but it's only using two so you grab the
front<00:01:20.790> part<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.990> here<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> divide<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:27.090> in

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
front part over here and divide that in

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.510 
front part over here and divide that in
half

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.080 

and<00:01:31.180> you<00:01:31.479> twist<00:01:31.750> it<00:01:32.310> pretty<00:01:33.310> simple<00:01:33.640> hi<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
and you twist it pretty simple hi to the

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.160 
and you twist it pretty simple hi to the
test<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.759> you<00:01:37.149> pick<00:01:37.360> up<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.689> little<00:01:37.869> bit<00:01:37.990> more

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
test then you pick up a little bit more

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:51.880 
test then you pick up a little bit more
hair<00:01:41.159> from<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.310> bottom<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:42.939> from<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.840> top
