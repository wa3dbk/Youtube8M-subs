has died had become anaerobic
decomposition<00:00:28.859> due<00:00:29.859> to<00:00:30.009> the<00:00:30.099> lack<00:00:30.279> of<00:00:30.310> oxygen

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.819 
decomposition due to the lack of oxygen
in<00:00:32.619> this<00:00:32.800> environment<00:00:34.199> it's<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.350> same<00:00:35.559> sort

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
in this environment it's the same sort

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.590 
in this environment it's the same sort
of<00:00:35.920> thing<00:00:36.070> that<00:00:36.100> happens<00:00:36.579> in<00:00:36.940> a<00:00:37.090> sand<00:00:37.390> bottom

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.079 
tank with no oxygen in the substrate at
this<00:00:41.800> point<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.190> would<00:00:42.280> be<00:00:42.339> very<00:00:42.610> harmful<00:00:42.879> for

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
this point it would be very harmful for

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.750 
this point it would be very harmful for
me<00:00:43.300> to<00:00:43.420> start<00:00:43.629> up<00:00:43.750> this<00:00:43.870> filter<00:00:44.760> without

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
me to start up this filter without

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.930 
me to start up this filter without
bleaching<00:00:46.360> it<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.960> rinsing<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.500> first<00:00:47.800> I<00:00:48.100> need

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
bleaching it and rinsing it first I need

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.509 
bleaching it and rinsing it first I need
to<00:00:49.030> sterilize<00:00:49.329> this<00:00:49.750> filter<00:00:50.280> before<00:00:51.280> I<00:00:51.309> can

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
to sterilize this filter before I can

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:54.840 
to sterilize this filter before I can
use<00:00:51.550> it<00:00:51.820> again<00:00:53.339> so<00:00:54.339> I'm<00:00:54.400> going<00:00:54.550> to<00:00:54.579> take<00:00:54.699> it

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
use it again so I'm going to take it

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.459 
use it again so I'm going to take it
over<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.210> sink<00:00:55.449> and<00:00:55.539> run<00:00:56.050> it<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:56.260> bleach

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
over to the sink and run it on bleach

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.670 
over to the sink and run it on bleach
water<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:57.039> mild<00:00:57.399> ten-to-one<00:00:57.850> solution<00:00:58.680> for

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
water a mild ten-to-one solution for

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.740 
water a mild ten-to-one solution for
about<00:00:59.890> 20<00:01:00.190> minutes<00:01:00.460> or<00:01:00.579> half<00:01:00.640> an<00:01:00.940> hour<00:01:01.059> and

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
about 20 minutes or half an hour and

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.039 
about 20 minutes or half an hour and
then<00:01:02.230> I<00:01:02.350> can<00:01:02.500> rinse<00:01:02.680> it<00:01:02.859> set<00:01:03.670> it<00:01:03.789> back<00:01:03.879> up

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
then I can rinse it set it back up

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.260 
then I can rinse it set it back up
one<00:01:05.620> thing<00:01:05.799> I<00:01:05.890> know<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.250> sure<00:01:06.310> is<00:01:06.909> that<00:01:06.970> if<00:01:07.180> I

one thing I know for sure is that if I

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.740 
one thing I know for sure is that if I
open<00:01:07.600> this<00:01:07.690> up<00:01:07.750> it's<00:01:08.650> gonna<00:01:08.799> stink<00:01:09.750> like

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
open this up it's gonna stink like

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.310 
open this up it's gonna stink like

gonna<00:01:17.500> run<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:17.830> on<00:01:17.920> bleach<00:01:18.190> before<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.670> even

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
gonna run it on bleach before I even

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.700 
gonna run it on bleach before I even
open<00:01:19.210> it<00:01:19.300> so<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.659> don't<00:01:19.780> get<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.140> smell<00:01:20.259> into<00:01:20.530> my

open it so I don't get the smell into my

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.190 
open it so I don't get the smell into my
apartment<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:28.119> sink<00:01:28.360> now<00:01:28.509> I'm<00:01:28.869> ready<00:01:29.080> to

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
apartment the sink now I'm ready to

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.950 
apartment the sink now I'm ready to
start<00:01:29.350> up<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.800> filter<00:01:30.300> I'm<00:01:31.300> gonna<00:01:31.509> add<00:01:31.750> the

start up the filter I'm gonna add the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.840 
start up the filter I'm gonna add the
bleach<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:34.630> the<00:01:34.750> container<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.310> start<00:01:36.640> it<00:01:36.759> up

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
bleach in the container and start it up

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.090 
bleach in the container and start it up
that's<00:01:37.810> gonna<00:01:37.990> keep<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.380> smell<00:01:38.590> from<00:01:38.830> getting

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.410 

so<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.070> gonna<00:01:59.189> run<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.520> filter<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.970> this<00:02:00.149> for

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so I'm gonna run the filter on this for

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.590 
so I'm gonna run the filter on this for
about<00:02:00.479> 20<00:02:00.720> minutes<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.229> half<00:02:01.290> an<00:02:01.710> hour

about 20 minutes or half an hour
should<00:02:04.230> be<00:02:04.380> noticeably<00:02:04.950> whiter<00:02:05.160> and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
should be noticeably whiter and then I'm

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.630 
should be noticeably whiter and then I'm
going<00:02:06.210> to<00:02:06.300> back<00:02:06.420> flush<00:02:06.660> it<00:02:07.430> neutralize<00:02:08.430> it

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
going to back flush it neutralize it

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.360 
going to back flush it neutralize it
with<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.790> chlorine<00:02:09.240> remover<00:02:09.930> called<00:02:10.229> prime<00:02:10.530> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
with a chlorine remover called prime and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:21.270 
with a chlorine remover called prime and
I'm<00:02:11.490> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.670> set<00:02:11.820> it<00:02:11.940> up<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> next

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.190 

okay<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:22.340> at<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:22.820> point<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.780> filter<00:02:24.140> has

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
okay so at this point the filter has

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.960 
okay so at this point the filter has
been<00:02:24.290> running<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> mild<00:02:25.130> bleach<00:02:25.370> solution

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
been running on the mild bleach solution

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.630 
been running on the mild bleach solution
and<00:02:26.330> you<00:02:26.450> can<00:02:26.630> see<00:02:26.840> all<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.100> black<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and you can see all of the black that

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.120 
and you can see all of the black that
was<00:02:28.790> there<00:02:29.030> before<00:02:29.450> it<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.260> now<00:02:30.470> turned

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
was there before it is now turned

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.300 
was there before it is now turned
colored<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> very<00:02:32.420> light<00:02:32.660> color<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:34.040> tells

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
colored is a very light color it tells

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.120 
colored is a very light color it tells
me<00:02:34.490> that<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.910> dead<00:02:35.420> bacteria<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.710> anaerobic

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
me that the dead bacteria the anaerobic

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.040 
me that the dead bacteria the anaerobic
decomposition<00:02:37.490> that<00:02:38.240> was<00:02:38.390> occurring<00:02:38.840> in<00:02:38.900> the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
decomposition that was occurring in the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.660 
decomposition that was occurring in the
stagnant<00:02:39.560> filter<00:02:39.910> has<00:02:40.910> been<00:02:41.210> sterilized<00:02:42.170> and

stagnant filter has been sterilized and

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.070 
stagnant filter has been sterilized and
I'm<00:02:43.670> reasonably<00:02:44.120> confident<00:02:44.690> at<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:44.960> point

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
I'm reasonably confident at this point

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.920 
I'm reasonably confident at this point
that

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.099 
that
I<00:02:46.989> can<00:02:47.379> Mac<00:02:47.560> flush<00:02:47.859> this<00:02:48.040> filter<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:49.870> get<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
I can Mac flush this filter to get the

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.500

into the tank and at this point I want
to<00:04:53.810> prime<00:04:54.080> the<00:04:54.290> filter<00:04:54.680> on<00:04:55.370> tank<00:04:55.790> water<00:04:56.030> I<00:04:56.240> want

to prime the filter on tank water I want

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.030 
to prime the filter on tank water I want
to<00:04:56.510> remove<00:04:56.720> the<00:04:56.900> top<00:04:57.080> water<00:04:57.350> from<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.710> filter

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
to remove the top water from the filter

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.430 
to remove the top water from the filter
and<00:04:58.490> replace<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:59.030> with<00:04:59.060> tank<00:04:59.360> water<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.380> I'm

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
and replace it with tank water so I'm

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.860 
and replace it with tank water so I'm
gonna<00:05:00.560> try<00:05:02.620> take<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.770> hose<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.510> put<00:05:05.510> it<00:05:05.750> at<00:05:05.840> a

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
gonna try take the hose and put it at a

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:14.300 
gonna try take the hose and put it at a
lower<00:05:06.110> level<00:05:06.520> then<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.670> might<00:05:07.880> start

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.610 

okay<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.030> let's<00:05:15.389> started<00:05:15.720> priming<00:05:16.170> on<00:05:16.290> itself

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
okay so let's started priming on itself

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:25.000 
okay so let's started priming on itself
it's<00:05:17.400> now<00:05:17.610> taking<00:05:17.670> a<00:05:18.030> tank<00:05:18.240> water<00:05:18.480> in

and<00:05:25.460> replacing<00:05:25.940> the<00:05:26.030> top<00:05:26.180> water<00:05:26.480> put<00:05:27.290> my

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
and replacing the top water put my

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.610 
and replacing the top water put my
finger<00:05:27.740> over<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:28.070> end<00:05:29.050> place<00:05:30.050> it<00:05:30.230> back<00:05:30.380> in<00:05:30.590> the

take my finger off the end and this

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.249 
take my finger off the end and this
filter<00:05:36.490> is<00:05:36.729> now<00:05:36.880> primed<00:05:37.240> on<00:05:37.389> tank<00:05:37.720> water<00:05:37.900> and

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
filter is now primed on tank water and

can now see that the filter is freshly
filled<00:07:45.290> with<00:07:45.530> the<00:07:45.650> powder

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:51.490 

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:59.990 

there's<00:07:52.000> the<00:07:52.210> diatom<00:07:52.720> powder<00:07:53.050> I'm<00:07:53.259> using

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.870 

being<00:08:00.600> taken<00:08:00.840> the<00:08:01.140> outlet<00:08:01.500> can<00:08:02.250> be<00:08:02.370> positioned

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 
being taken the outlet can be positioned

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.200 
being taken the outlet can be positioned
so<00:08:03.090> that<00:08:03.120> it<00:08:03.420> captures<00:08:04.550> and<00:08:05.550> pushes<00:08:05.940> the<00:08:06.060> dirt

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:06.210 
so that it captures and pushes the dirt

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.580 
so that it captures and pushes the dirt
around<00:08:07.280> stirs<00:08:08.280> it<00:08:08.460> up<00:08:08.550> off<00:08:08.760> the<00:08:08.940> bottom<00:08:09.090> and

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.590 
around stirs it up off the bottom and

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.610 
around stirs it up off the bottom and
directs<00:08:10.590> it<00:08:10.740> inside<00:08:11.100> the<00:08:11.280> intake
