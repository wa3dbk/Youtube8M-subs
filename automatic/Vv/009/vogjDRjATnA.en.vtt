 public and the vice-ministry of 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.580
 transport received the first 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.590
 landing of six units from 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.389
 from Brazil that will make their way through the

 in the capital 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.700

 with a commitment of country and without 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.820
 corruption you can can open the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.220
 floodgates to the future the six buses 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.800
 among them four articulated form 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.960
 part of a first batch of 37 units 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 each one has four doors in the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.650
 left side for up and down 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.629
 the passengers and two doors 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.170
 emergencies are trained to 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.570
 transport 56 seated passengers and 96 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.950
 in good standing from tomorrow and the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.289
 Monday we start the new 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.539
 to work with these buses that the 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.100
 people know that in first 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.350
 place they see that they are new buses that 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.659
 They are not of those who remain are 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.460
 dignifying the transport user 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.679
 public as the minister said we are 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.780
 in a public-private effort with the 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.390
 entrepreneurs building this in this 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.939
 I dream this project that has been a reality 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.250
 thanks to the agreement that we have 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.960
 driven as government these changes 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.270
 are the ones that should keep going are 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.069
 6 units how are you that from 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.860
 today they are available to the people 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.110
 Salvadoran next week is expected 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.360
 the disembarkation of 31 more units 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.280
 meanwhile the entrepreneurs said 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.170
 that something of them deserves a 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.299
 quality service and applauded the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.390
 acquisition of the fleet this is 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.970
 result of the agreements of the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.060
 national agreement raised by the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.700
 government of Mauricio Funes and the FMLN 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.220
 important of this is that we accept a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.310
 challenge and this result of understanding 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.470
 in democracy between a government and a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.600
 small and medium business that is made 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.610
 large the new units have a 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.250
 mechanism that reduces pollution 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.120
 for the emission of toxic gases 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.830
 contributing to the protection of the environment 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.140
 environment other security measures 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.910
 include a modern device that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.370
 detects when the biker has ingested 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.770
 alcohol and automatically stops the 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.900
 motor also the bus travel can 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.670
 followed by satellite and the interior of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.240
 the unit can monitor pse by 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.240
 closed circuit
