I'm<00:00:01.439> doing<00:00:01.860> an<00:00:01.949> experiment<00:00:02.700> and<00:00:02.970> plant<00:00:03.600> growth

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I'm doing an experiment and plant growth

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.400 
I'm doing an experiment and plant growth
I<00:00:04.520> tried<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.700> get<00:00:05.879> three<00:00:06.270> plants<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:07.109> are

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
I tried to get three plants that are

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.910 
I tried to get three plants that are
equal<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.389> same<00:00:09.780> type<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.440> three

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
equal of the same type in three

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.039 
equal of the same type in three
containers<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:11.969> equal<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> same

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
containers that are equal with the same

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.950 
containers that are equal with the same
soil<00:00:13.700> one<00:00:14.700> will<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.859> fertilizer<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.220> it

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960 
soil one will have fertilizer in it

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.429 
soil one will have fertilizer in it
this<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.350> control<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.869> this<00:00:21.869> one<00:00:22.170> has

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
this is the control and this one has

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.890 
this is the control and this one has
vitamins<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> minerals<00:00:23.670> like<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.779> have

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
vitamins and minerals like you have

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.830 

our<00:00:36.050> experiment<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.290> continuing<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.910> here

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
our experiment is continuing and here

00:00:39.840 --> 00:01:05.130 
our experiment is continuing and here
are<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.290> three<00:00:40.470> plants

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.190 

one<00:01:05.710> of<00:01:05.860> them<00:01:06.040> has<00:01:06.630> vitamins<00:01:08.220> human<00:01:09.220> vitamins

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
one of them has vitamins human vitamins

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.360 
one of them has vitamins human vitamins
multi<00:01:11.200> vitamins<00:01:11.680> minerals<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:14.710> has<00:01:15.040> just

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
multi vitamins minerals and one has just

plain water and one has fertilizer which

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:34.250 
plain water and one has fertilizer which
one<00:01:22.780> is<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:28.830> now<00:01:29.830> you<00:01:30.430> can<00:01:30.640> see<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.840> this<00:01:32.170> one

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
one is it now you can see that this one

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.230 
one is it now you can see that this one
as<00:01:35.260> just<00:01:36.160> water

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
as just water

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:47.580 
as just water
it's<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.660> control

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:02:00.520 

this<00:01:48.590> one<00:01:49.240> has<00:01:50.240> human<00:01:51.080> vitamins<00:01:58.480> this<00:01:59.480> one<00:01:59.750> has

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
this one has human vitamins this one has

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:16.080 
this one has human vitamins this one has
plant<00:02:01.010> fertilizer

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.270 

here's<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.390> conclusion<00:02:17.719> of<00:02:18.379> our<00:02:18.590> experiment

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
here's the conclusion of our experiment

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.920 
here's the conclusion of our experiment
one<00:02:22.280> had<00:02:23.170> fertilizer<00:02:24.849> one<00:02:25.849> had<00:02:26.090> human

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
one had fertilizer one had human

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.539 
one had fertilizer one had human
vitamins<00:02:27.469> and<00:02:27.680> minerals<00:02:28.060> tap<00:02:29.319> capsule

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
vitamins and minerals tap capsule

00:02:30.549 --> 00:03:03.790 
vitamins and minerals tap capsule
powdered<00:02:31.549> and<00:02:32.650> one<00:02:33.650> had<00:02:34.069> nothing<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:34.579> water

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.660 

now<00:03:04.800> we<00:03:05.490> can<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:05.910> which<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.330> switch<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:08.400> long

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
now we can see which you switch the long

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.990 
now we can see which you switch the long
scraggly<00:03:09.209> one<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.550> one<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:14.850> got<00:03:14.970> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
scraggly one is the one that got the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.290 
scraggly one is the one that got the
fertilizer<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:18.330> intermediate<00:03:19.140> one<00:03:22.130> is<00:03:23.300> the

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
fertilizer the intermediate one is the

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.540 
fertilizer the intermediate one is the
control<00:03:24.630> got<00:03:25.230> nothing<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:25.709> water<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:29.280> one

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
control got nothing but water this one

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.370 
control got nothing but water this one
with<00:03:30.650> beautiful<00:03:31.650> full<00:03:31.920> leaves<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.230> one

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
with beautiful full leaves is the one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
with beautiful full leaves is the one
that<00:03:34.560> got<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.950> human<00:03:35.190> vitamins<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.030> minerals
