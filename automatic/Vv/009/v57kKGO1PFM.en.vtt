I<00:02:45.720> think<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.590> settings<00:02:46.980> are<00:02:47.099> all<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> same<00:02:47.519> by

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
I think the settings are all the same by

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.789 
I think the settings are all the same by
the<00:02:47.819> digimon<00:02:48.269> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.569> get<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:48.900> much<00:02:49.379> more

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
the digimon you can get it's much more

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.839 
the digimon you can get it's much more
stronger<00:02:50.340> than<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.810> original<00:02:51.810> one

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
stronger than the original one
