00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.950
 we are 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.060
 we are 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.470
 and well where people are ultimate 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.030
 I hope you have the shape we are 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.080
 find today door rather so 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.970
 it's been a while since I had 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.230
 not do today's tutorial is going to 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.320
 really make you happy it's 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.300
 how to do real zain all on 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.460
 ps3 jailbreak is not on ps3 of aix 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.320
 of course it also works on petr 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.730
 of aix it makes sense but the whole does not 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.230
 works for the ps3 jailbreak that 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.580
 are not we aix so that's it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.930
 really happy because a lot 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 from among you, we break up the roger labrecque 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 who are not in Aix and do not know 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.540
 not how passion as soon as they have 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.890
 afraid of the brick and etc. 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.150
 so that's why it's m tutored 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.800
 less interesting than that pushes you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 really allows for those who do not have 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.800
 daix me anyway a psg the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.720
 break twice taken advantage of the real time 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.540
 so the only drawback is for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.280
 the instant luc seon he created it was 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.650
 a walk only for a single whole 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.540
 a little lonely all there to endure that for 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.800
 the moment it's the whole project very 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.540
 good so for me in the force ii which 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.000
 is 15 euros on the site of the fnt 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.220
 so this is the only tool that exists for 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.930
 the moment but should get there soon 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.130
 soon new ones 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.410
 in any case it's really a taste of 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.660
 great news it's really a good 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.429
 advancement in jailbreak of power 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.539
 see real time on penalties etc 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.310
 without it really being fun 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.750
 so how does it work but everything 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.820
 first you download the archived that 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.470
 I put you in descriptions so 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.259
 in it you make sure the application for 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.240
 the pc the pkg for the ps3 and the folder 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.410
 more who have more a small text file 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.390
 to explain a little how that 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.340
 it works you'll have the chootot 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 writing is no problem so we what 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.240
 we are interested we will take the case 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 of plugins and the pkg one you to them 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.720
 copy both wings and put it on 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.979
 this key role usb 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.770
 then the usb key you put it in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.420
 the usb port of your ps3 then you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.710
 go to salty dkg box normally as 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.290
 any beach and in any 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.640
 meaning and once the pkg is a 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.030
 famous you go the temarii all 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.040
 simply 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.830
 so once you start it and go 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 prove yourself to accept stuff you 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.640
 put yes louise everything that you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.819
 request and the ps3 will restart once 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.019
 that the ps3 restart it's over 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.549
 you will receive a small 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.950
 modification to tell you that the 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.719
 pkg is installed so if you want them 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.730
 salty it's very simple you are you 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.549
 just have to raise the pkg and will be 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.870
 uninstall so then you go on 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.849
 hainaut settings and you go 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.900
 in the internet connections and you 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.329
 go mark without a little paper 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.500
 the ip address of your ps3 once 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.459
 the ip address and mark are a small 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.569
 paper or other 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.790
 in fact when you do not leave this 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.590
 is not my concern you go on the pc 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.750
 you launch the winston application there 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.159
 that he created and once 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.200
 the application and launch you will see 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.659
 that in the parameter there are lines 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.219
 to connect your ps3 o'toole so 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.439
 simply mark you ip address 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.909
 that you just barely noticed you 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.230
 tap connect which will have marked 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.150
 connect if it's good sign has not had 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.669
 gold is then you go up to 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.590
 right cool off to cross for 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:17.480
 babe to update the data of 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.310
 the ps3 good if you go see that there is to 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.989
 your ps3 that appears unclear putting 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.430
 on which you are 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.189
 temperature of your processor your 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.439
 ps3 and so that's the big advantage too 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.549
 of this trick he created if you go 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.469
 see that you can change the 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.250
 consolidated your ps3 directly to 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.590
 from the 12 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.849
 so do not put the 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.889
 consolidate on your usb key 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.079
 go on pc patches there you can 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:41.180
 do it directly from that so 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.769
 that's it and once all this is p 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.030
 you have just started the project 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.949
 north starboard if you bought it well 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.979
 Sure it's worth 15 euros so it's the only one 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:50.329
 for now the only compatible so 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.650
 you launch project starboard you you 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.169
 connect with your account 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.060
 fnt to identify you and then is 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:58.370
 well true just to click on connect 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.079
 the menu not appear on the game there are 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 had six appliances no problem she 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.189
 would have worked the first time that's it 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.889
 I hope this little tutorial will have pleased you 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:08.989
 again a big thank you to enstone for the 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:10.729
