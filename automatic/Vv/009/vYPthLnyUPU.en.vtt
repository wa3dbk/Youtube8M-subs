00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.180
 another strange number alencar I do not know 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.009

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 gt x 960 coming on the market 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.689
 rolling up we already made galera novel 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.290
 to lose any video is more expensive her 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.329
 earns a gtx 760 even though it only 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 128 bit late bandwidth or 42 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.119
 frames I'm there I 'm with my eye on 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.770

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.780
 a drop of frames keep me 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.000
 informed we know that not falling from 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.110
 30 frames would be a perfect setting 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.599
 so to say né 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.750
 but obviously it 's 60 70 front and falls 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.820
 for 40 in portugal 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.370
 It is of 20 and 30 forward so abrupt and 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.950
 came back up and I felt that fluidity that 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.720
 if you lose a bit of fluency 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.460
 It's but we do not have any 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.050
 Problem with gt x 960, I'm alone. 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.760
 I will talk test in another test not map 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.380
 know what the guy load test on 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.170
 bottleneck where we'll make comparison 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.480
 this plate with another one is not going 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.040
 here in the northeast comparison no stop 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.990
 showing us her performance in my 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.360
 first impressions 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.580
 this tank he is he is he is 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.780
 type soup always giving the same gene 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.180
 last friend inside I think a friend 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 where nobody thinks there was nobody 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:03:00.250

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.060
 decade ago that will not go 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.330
 exploding is going to explode but I wanted to 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.680
 I think you're more responsive to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.100
 or kill someone on the knife that is 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.100

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.480
 How do these motherfuckers do this? 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.220

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:32.560
 the old boy is the stab of a country man 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.690
 stay right there in the good in the 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.130
 humility and does not kill why I 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.170
 I prefer the ethics vault in order to 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.250
 to throw up someone 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.610
 understood 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.500
 I'm already beloved of Ruy's beautiful parade and 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.730
 So cold is not my game does not like 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.530
 see the film I already spoke several provinces 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.120

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.800

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.330
 for the game, it's a fuck 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.190
 I can not say anything else to you. 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 running in a number of frames 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.370
 too loud then you can be fine 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.110

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.100
