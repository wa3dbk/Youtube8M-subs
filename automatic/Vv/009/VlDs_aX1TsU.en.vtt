00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.500
 of a paddle of orio super super 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.450
 richest more out this heat so 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.029
 I hope you like it and well we are going to 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:21.020
 start what we're going to use they're going to 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.690
 be cookies oreo milk evaporated milk 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.810
 entire 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:28.980
 and the condensed milk we are going to add 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.980
 a cup of evaporated milk 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.830
 then half a cup of whole milk and what 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.660
 let's sweeten with condensed milk yo 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.040
 I added approximately 2 tablespoons 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.040
 that is more to taste 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 now let's give our cookies 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.410
 airing 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.920
 and we're going to start adding them to 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:54.920
 our milk in pieces 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.140
 I think about five or 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.140
 seven but you can add more or less 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.090
 we stir them very well 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.990
 and now it is already ready to pour what 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.430
 to the recipients where we are going to 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.340
 freeze 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.430
 I added a cookie first and 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.140
 then I added all this that we did 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.659
 and so will do the same with the others 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 and then we closed them very well and now 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.200
 yes we take them to the freezer for 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200
 for 12 hours one noon 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.590
 since they are ready we are going to bring them closer 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.869
 and so that it goes much faster 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.140
 to put about 10 seconds in water 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.520
 hot and it's going to come out much faster and 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.979
 well, that's how we got from 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.780
