 Rwanda 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.400
 the sea 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.960
 it's not wanting to make lighter at the latest the country counts more and 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.439
 of history who wants that 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.989
 I do not choose by the stories according to two 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.940
 dell to do it earlier less funny more dramatic - in the city of nancy 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.140
 part is not at all 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.380
 mouallem and my criteria of choice the history cdc dicte that dictates 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.660
 classics in which girls are 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.300
 smoking people who seems to have seduced all of all who are more violent 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.300
 I do not play violence 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.910
 it's a much more psychological violence some physics at 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.880
 she 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.610
 it's the result of two 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.490
 2 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.230
 % 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.890
 there are tired bayonne a fed up of someone who acts for them 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.170
 what can it not happen to it 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.380
 to his legacy 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.190
 as to his current state and his life and solidity 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.480
 to be convinced of it it is necessary not to accept everything then why accept 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.480
 nonstop 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.750
 what can be said as agreed that a collision as said the opposite 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.260
 I am angry 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.680
 often used wrongly then diminish the immense bad faith 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.210
 but people who have been with me for years know it so 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.380
 time problem 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.070
 it is on the side of the emulators of always for cause always the maggie actress 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.070
 nothing more they know how fast I am 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.069
 rudy sincerely it's not 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.849
 in euros there are some swim as offensive 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.939
 you see what 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:19.510
 it is the approach of this man of 45 years 40 years 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.679
 what touched me% 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:24.799
 deeply 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.509
 and in europe 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:31.449
 but I had been able to sit there he had a talent in this movie afraid that things 

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:32.769
 escape me a little 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.479
 at the level of feelings in this dinner scene for example 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.329
 but you do not want that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.129
 I will not overflow I did not want it to make your quote the asc 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.360
 had to stop and if that could very well 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.169
 Earl had to go into the water on the other side 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.729
 but I stay on the a6 where the parts longer put aside or 

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:53.609
 the other 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.609
 so I wished I could have been a little more s-res 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.930
 little more worried for the future that's why we can be a little bit 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.569
 more stuck in the back in this film than in others n 

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:14.369
 she acts 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.229
