00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
think that a random drug test is fine

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.860 
think that a random drug test is fine
but<00:00:34.559> i<00:00:34.590> think<00:00:34.920> they're<00:00:35.100> 24<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:35.850> 48<00:00:36.090> hours<00:00:36.690> even

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.889 
but i think they're 24 or 48 hours even
72<00:00:37.590> hours<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> pushing<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.180> know
