00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:10.050
 Tell us guys, what are you guys talking about? 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.290
 here in mwc 2015 knowing the last one 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.150
 of the four presented by LG 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.330
 yesterday during his conference to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.279
 press this is the lg joy is the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.350
 incoming smartphone is the simplest 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 of all 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.720
 it has a 4 inch screen a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.380
 1.2 ghz dual core processor and comes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.000
 with android 4.4 kitkat because this 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.790
 operating system and lollipop 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 according to lg as hardware of this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.620
 device is a bit more modest 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.239
 it would work much better with this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.649
 android version 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
 This means that you will have a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.960
 device that works very well it is 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.300
 very fast responds very well to 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.800
 commands and will not give problem despite 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 to not have the update in question 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.320
 of specific resources for Brazil 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.860
 this model will also have versions with a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.290
 digital tv and like every other 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.159
 new line devices will also be dual 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 chip 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 the 1900 million versus 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.360
 be enough to handle a good 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.580
 time because if the device is 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.759
 relatively simple and simple 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.689
 consumes a lot of energy memory issue 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.150
 it has 4 GB of storage and 512 MB of storage. 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.100
 Ram memory also has card support 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 micro sd if you need to expand the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.360
 memory of the device to the 4 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.579
 inch with wvga resolution have a 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.049
 definition that is relatively good despite 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:46.170
 from simple and he arrives in Brazil until 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.399
 end of April should be available on 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.090
 Brazilian stores will cost around 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:53.759
 450 reais 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 different versions with tv or without tv 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.250
 should bring some difference in price 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.790
 but it is a very mobile input 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.080
 very light and should be perfectly 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.170
 able to meet your needs 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.480
 stay connected in our mwc coverage 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.480
 2015 and until our next video
