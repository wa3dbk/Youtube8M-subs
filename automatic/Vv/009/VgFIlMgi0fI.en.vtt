00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.960
 hello everyone with you fil and this is the second 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.730
 part of the answers to the questions who did not watch 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.430
 First look at the link above 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 and we go further as promised the second 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.849
 parts will answer smaller and more frequent 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.860
 questions that you don’t rush into 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.990
 message to answer they are in contact 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.240
 or on youtube and yes I will not 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.400
 call names and some so simply chose 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 most frequent recurring questions 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.560
 new projects often write sl will 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.360
 new idea or will you continue on 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.699
 continue to do only on top of legends 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
 absolutely not and and tried so sometimes 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.940
 to let something out 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.649
 now for the same as already said on 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 video called plans for the future 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.940
 head mass projects here is one of them i 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.460
 already recently realized this mobile 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.200
 game apps yes I planned after 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 new year immediately take up with zeal for 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.250
 work but in the end tube was resting and walking 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.440
 had fun and generally did not sit at 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 computer and now you see 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.910
 took it and if possible will be gradually 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.469
 implement everything as I said 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.210
 soon there will be a project for 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.160
 the title is just a viewer which will 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.240
 whether reviews or opinions materials 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.740
 various films 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.500
 I told all this in previous videos 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.990
 so do not want to repeat go further 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.539
 sl you said that there will be an analog check 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 legends something about mysticism will yes 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.399
 sure to be but at least 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.140
 episode 2 3 will do and then we'll look at 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.149
 profitability so it will be enough 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.369
 time consuming and is it worth further 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.929
 continue i don't know when it will not 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.849
 I know, but I think soon 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.060
 the announcement is more accurate to say a certain trailer I 

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:34.860
 laid out the next question you promised 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.289
 make a release about cult epsilon 2 but 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 it is not there or there will be a video about 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.090
 mystic you promised no course 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.660
 already said that will be brand new 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.640
 project 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.830
 honestly, I did not see any analogues 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.500
 even western but who knows maybe already 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.300
 anything like that but everyone 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.580
 case it will be completely different 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.590
 in example and legends about the cult epsilon 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.959
 then he will definitely come out hopefully in 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.420
 roles just this is my favorite myth not even 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.660
 myth mystery rather games and therefore 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.489
 I want to do no worse than the first part 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.289
 go ahead I sat down is it true that checking 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:10.080
 whether there is no number twenty years and the last 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.860
 release and otherwise I thought it was rumors about a video 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.900
 no month already 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.450
 I told you that the ambush release then 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.430
 the last release of the second season 3 here 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.100
 just now starts but only now 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.050
 there will be no accurate release schedule 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.600
 Well, as before , I can also 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.510
 dilute videos with interesting stories 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.490
 in short, let's see the next question how are you 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.030
 belong to letpleyam and would not want to 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.220
 take them off 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.990
 frankly no way to treat them 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.540
 so the opinion does not really seem interesting 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.010
 with your kids like someone else plays 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.020
 the same thing to come to a friend and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.209
 watch the icons passes the game just 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.640
 Generally good play play do you 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.470
 it is very difficult to do this charisma 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.390
 well set voice like u 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.700
 sports commentators than i have 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.100
 and just shoot as I go through the game 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.050
 do for this 100 releases and just 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.150
 comment like a cup happening on 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.160
 I'm not particularly interested in the screen I want 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.470
 offend their letplayshchikov their look and 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.930
 this is important but I always used to do something 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.480
 so I myself would not mind to see the countdown 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.280
 I'm not particularly interested in passing 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.560
 still this is some review or opinion on the game 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.270
 or some game lessons but 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.989
 passing on missions do not look 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.930
 you would not be bored anymore 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.299
 shoot reviews of games truth be told 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.549
 such an idea I even tried to make a review 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.739
 for a new courage medal I shot a video 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.140
 passing the case some notes on 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.299
 I didn't really like to play and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.400
 in the end, I took her weeks of children if 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.500
 no more and there is no longer actually became 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.810
 I do not know I like any 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.330
 tunnel sudra such victims hundreds so 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.100
 why rivet still also assumed 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.049
 One well-known site to make 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.090
 especially for them with their logo video 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.519
 devoted to a football simulator but in 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.380
 As a result, they have something to fly with hosting 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.390
 and the cheeks of the trouble and the money started 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.640
 went to another and in general there are 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.440
 plans but even not quite reviews do a 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.019
 rather some opinion in the first days of the release 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.670
 the games you watched the video could do 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:03.180
 for yourself the conclusion is whether to put this 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.340
 toy or not the next question is why 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.380
 do not show yourself shy 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.380
 don't be afraid we won't throw a 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.750
 tomatoes m 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.430
 yes no feel free to can even now 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.620
 photo of yourself or even a small video 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.750
 take off the phone part of a second just me 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.940
 did not prepare the text and look here in the folder 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.540
 With the questions I immediately answer questions 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.540
 I will come now 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.400
 here own 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.000
 The quality is poor but the front camera 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.380
 phone what can you do we go further village 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.790
 you create the impression of someone 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.130
 intellectual person 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.300
 intelligent even faithful to school was 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.580
 A student so no matter how just the other way around 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.160
 understand one thing when i just 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.660
 I talk and the other when I make a video I'm all 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.370
 I support the idea of ​​what to do 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.050
 no products for this 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.750
 I try to say if not very well 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.390
 but more or less masonry without well and so 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.440
 further because this is all really 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.980
 very hard of hearing 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.050
 about Ukraine say w and d yes there is 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.570
 separately the letter g but in all the words in 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.460
 mostly found and that's fine 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.920
 but when people speak Russian and 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.080
 begin to shock those hiccup it gives 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.300
 rural nature of speech today question 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.550
 similar to how you feel about mate 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.770
 noticed that you barely use it 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.350
 actually continuation to the previous one 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.850
 I want to say that the mat is ordinary 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:28.220
 a word that can be characterized 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.440
 some emotion or something else that time 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.660
 without years in the government work gun 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.820
 Well, you understand something else can not call 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.070
 they only need to be understood where possible 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.720
 use mate and where not and many 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.000
 schoolchildren think if mothers can't 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.620
 that is very cool i certainly 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.750
 completely different talk 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.520
 ordinary life but here no one would 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.040
 I liked this speech until the end of the video 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.590
 units would look take the same we 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.960
 gum which even the image of such a thump 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.540
 he uses mate video is funny 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.090
 It sounds but I did recently spin 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.310
 drives somehow so called his video I 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.410
 I didn't notice mats there because they were there 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.780
 would not be correct and need it 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.430
 understand take the same arrow kosovo 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.040
 would be a friend 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.960
 also the patients themselves may offend but 

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:13.240
 look at his blog is very competent 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.280
 pure speech so think gentlemen where 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.230
 need a magician and where there is no remind me even 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.150
 someone wrote the hall your videos this 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.510
 the only video that is not turning off 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.220
 when my mother comes to my room 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:26.020
 Well, I think all the other questions 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.150
 repeat or I already answered 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.130
 so thanks to everyone who watched to 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.050
 the end, too, I want to make a compliment 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.360
 in the audience do not suck up exactly 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.950
 praise here is the same group in contact
