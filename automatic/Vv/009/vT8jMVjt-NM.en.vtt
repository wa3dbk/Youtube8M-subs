there so that way we can just keep on

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.180 
there so that way we can just keep on
mining<00:04:04.350> back<00:04:04.530> in<00:04:04.710> here

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
mining back in here

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:13.070

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
side because once you start to see dirt

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.360 
side because once you start to see dirt
let<00:04:39.690> me<00:04:39.840> near<00:04:39.900> there<00:04:40.320> close<00:04:40.590> to<00:04:42.530> another<00:04:43.530> wall
