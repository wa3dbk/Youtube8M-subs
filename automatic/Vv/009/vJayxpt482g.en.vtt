a half billion years it seems reasonable

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.370 
a half billion years it seems reasonable
to<00:01:27.520> think<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:27.970> the<00:01:28.090> farthest<00:01:28.630> a<00:01:28.750> photon<00:01:29.170> can

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
to think that the farthest a photon can

to think that the farthest a photon can
never<00:01:29.560> travel<00:01:29.830> is<00:01:30.190> thirteen<00:01:31.030> and<00:01:31.060> a<00:01:31.240> half

at<00:01:33.929> first<00:01:34.929> glance<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.800> appears<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:36.369> violate

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
at first glance this appears to violate

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.859 
at first glance this appears to violate
Einstein's<00:01:37.390> theory<00:01:37.869> of<00:01:37.899> special<00:01:37.990> relativity

Einstein's theory of special relativity
common<00:01:40.869> sense<00:01:41.110> would<00:01:41.259> seem<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.619> say<00:01:41.830> that<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
common sense would seem to say that the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
common sense would seem to say that the
observable<00:01:42.700> universe<00:01:42.729> must<00:01:43.390> be<00:01:43.479> bounded<00:01:43.990> by

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
observable universe must be bounded by

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.529 
observable universe must be bounded by
the<00:01:44.229> age<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.800> universe<00:01:45.450> using<00:01:46.450> this

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
the age of the universe using this

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.630 
the age of the universe using this
reasoning<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.590> universe<00:01:47.979> should<00:01:48.009> only<00:01:48.310> be

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
reasoning the universe should only be

the<00:01:57.469> reason<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.130> isn't<00:01:58.369> the<00:01:58.609> case<00:01:58.789> is<00:01:59.149> that

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
the reason this isn't the case is that

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:01.090 
the reason this isn't the case is that
we<00:01:59.420> must<00:01:59.630> take<00:01:59.780> into<00:01:59.960> account<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.590> expansion

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
we must take into account the expansion

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.370 
we must take into account the expansion
