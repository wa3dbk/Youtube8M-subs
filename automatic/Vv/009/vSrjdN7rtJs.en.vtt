Worf<00:02:04.040> and<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:05.810> Dax<00:02:06.110> was<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.770> had<00:02:06.890> captured

them<00:02:07.490> or<00:02:07.640> something<00:02:07.970> and<00:02:09.100> Worf<00:02:10.360> kills<00:02:11.360> when

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
them or something and Worf kills when

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.490 
them or something and Worf kills when
you<00:02:12.440> when<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.130> sort<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.430> set<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.820> up<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:15.320> come

incredibly well trained actors and then

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.420 
incredibly well trained actors and then
I'd<00:04:14.960> spent<00:04:15.320> four<00:04:15.560> years<00:04:15.590> in<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:15.950> classical

school<00:04:16.670> of<00:04:16.790> Julliard<00:04:17.150> myself<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:17.690> in<00:04:18.680> order

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
school of Julliard myself and in order

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:21.100 
school of Julliard myself and in order
to<00:04:19.010> do<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.580> a<00:04:19.940> lot<00:04:20.270> of<00:04:20.299> times<00:04:20.570> sounds<00:04:20.989> like

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
to do this a lot of times sounds like

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.820 
to do this a lot of times sounds like
gobbledygook<00:04:21.709> but<00:04:22.160> really<00:04:22.730> still<00:04:23.000> make<00:04:23.300> it

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
gobbledygook but really still make it

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.010 
gobbledygook but really still make it
sound<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:25.070> it's<00:04:25.250> coming<00:04:25.310> from<00:04:25.600> some<00:04:26.600> kind<00:04:26.840> of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
sound like it's coming from some kind of

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.950 
sound like it's coming from some kind of
a<00:04:27.110> being<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:28.420> really<00:04:29.420> have<00:04:29.570> to<00:04:29.690> be<00:04:29.810> well

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
a being you really have to be well

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.620 
a being you really have to be well
trained<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.650> think<00:04:30.890> stepping<00:04:31.190> on<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:32.330> set

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
trained and I think stepping on the set

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.230 
trained and I think stepping on the set
or<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.050> stage<00:04:33.320> with<00:04:33.560> these<00:04:33.680> people<00:04:34.100> who<00:04:35.090> are

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
or the stage with these people who are

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.450 
or the stage with these people who are
incredibly<00:04:35.690> well<00:04:35.780> trained<00:04:36.230> you<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.160> feel

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
incredibly well trained you you you feel

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.760 
incredibly well trained you you you feel
like<00:04:37.940> you're<00:04:38.150> in<00:04:38.180> rarified<00:04:39.080> company<00:04:39.560> and

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
like you're in rarified company and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.230 
like you're in rarified company and
that's<00:04:40.010> what<00:04:40.220> one<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.640> things<00:04:41.090> that<00:04:41.210> I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
that's what one of the things that I

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.320 
that's what one of the things that I
enjoyed<00:04:41.660> most<00:04:41.840> about<00:04:42.050> it
