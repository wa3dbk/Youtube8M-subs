00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
outside of the map that is a pile of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.250 
outside of the map that is a pile of
glitch<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.300> you'll<00:03:07.420> show<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:07.960> where<00:03:08.170> that

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
making it into this glitch so I've just

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.720 
making it into this glitch so I've just
get<00:03:35.320> into<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.590> glitch<00:03:35.770> originally<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.430> I<00:03:36.550> go

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
get into the glitch originally and I go

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.690 
get into the glitch originally and I go
to<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.940> safe<00:03:37.180> spot<00:03:37.480> I'm<00:03:38.050> just<00:03:38.320> gonna<00:03:38.440> jump<00:03:38.860> to

to the safe spot I'm just gonna jump to

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.580 
to the safe spot I'm just gonna jump to
bypass<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.390> death<00:03:40.540> barriers<00:03:40.930> just<00:03:40.959> continue

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590

jumping<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:42.070> don't<00:03:42.190> even<00:03:42.370> have<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.519> do<00:03:42.610> it

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
jumping you don't even have to do it

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.040 
jumping you don't even have to do it
fast<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.330> just<00:03:43.510> have<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.690> do<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.900> continuously

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
once you get over here you're just going

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.670 
once you get over here you're just going
to<00:03:48.370> jump<00:03:48.700> and<00:03:49.000> continue<00:03:49.660> jumping<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.230> bypass

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
to jump and continue jumping and bypass

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.610 
to jump and continue jumping and bypass
it<00:03:50.860> and<00:03:50.980> jump<00:03:51.280> down<00:03:51.400> to<00:03:51.550> this<00:03:51.640> lower<00:03:51.940> barrier
