00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.020 
the first step is to create your crown
by<00:01:23.440> measuring<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.979> wire<00:01:24.190> around<00:01:24.460> your<00:01:24.850> head

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
removed easily attach the ends together

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.790 
removed easily attach the ends together
by<00:01:31.030> twisting<00:01:31.420> the<00:01:31.509> wire<00:01:31.690> around<00:01:31.899> itself<00:01:32.470> you

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
by twisting the wire around itself you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.350 
by twisting the wire around itself you
could<00:01:32.950> also<00:01:33.100> use<00:01:33.429> floral<00:01:33.850> tape<00:01:34.090> which<00:01:34.330> is

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
could also use floral tape which is

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.330 
could also use floral tape which is
thicker<00:01:34.750> and<00:01:35.050> then<00:01:35.170> specifically<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.159> protect
