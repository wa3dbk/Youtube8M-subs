00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.480

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.780
 songs well and think 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.329
 others know everything about the famous 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.370
 the song went 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.370
 or overpowered it in magic 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.820
 we 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.130
 on 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.130
 bathroom 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 need to 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.320
 and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.040
 after 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.120
 wind 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.120
 I am looking at 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:40.900
 tea 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:43.260
 not rushing 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.260
 but only in 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.470
 I will give the words here seems to be true 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.409
 most of them 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.990
 but maybe the production will not run so 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.770
 how is it played before the song or overpowered it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.649
 into magic 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.540
 and everything is very simple this song to play all 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:08.200
 four chords with you on the first course 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.209
 which play this chords and 4 5 back 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.000
 on the second fret and the third string 1 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.860
 clamped on a $ 1 barr song simple 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.180

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.819
 to another, but I explain it like this 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:35.060
 method 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:40.430
 win 7 4 5 3 strings also 3 4 5 countries - on 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.950
 asus 4 most meetings so he probably 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.250
 sounds exactly different but what doesn't 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.139

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.939

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:56.739
 2 fret the second country preying on 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.739
 the third fret the fight is exactly the same 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.990
 and now we play a chord but also over 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.880
 learn differently well we will pronounce 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:09.040
 it is as if they were beating you 4 3 2 cm from the seam 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.129
