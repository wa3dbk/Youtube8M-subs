00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
about steering not this kind of steering

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.949 
about steering not this kind of steering
this<00:02:11.120> kind<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.540> steering

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
this kind of steering

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.569 
this kind of steering
