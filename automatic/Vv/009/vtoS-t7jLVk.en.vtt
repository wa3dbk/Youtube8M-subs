00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.519
 good 3 - to a new video new trailer 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.740
 of mortal kombat xy this time we 

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.059
 presents its story mode to say that 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.040
 let's go until the fight is like the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.280
 class mate that never fails 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.570
 it does not do everything right and it rages a lot 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.640
 to say that the story mode because 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.710
 is very very very currado is another aspect 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.610
 of the game that seems to be at 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.490
 one hundred by one hundred 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.720
 done well and as we can see in the 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.070
 trailer by ends is pretty 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.869
 deep and he's going to tell us a lot 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.800
 about what we have lost between the 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.109
 9 and 10 was going to say but it's the x and the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.719
 We 'll see what history they tell us 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.670
 and other this game will come out April 14 and 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.519
 the 31 you have in the description the game 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.620
 every time it looks better by the way 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.739
 he said in his multiplayer 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:50.059
 the brutality the fatalities the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.980
 possibility of getting into a faction 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.769
 just start in the game and going up 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.989
 points for our clan we could say 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.180
 good to our our option and others 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.370
 It is quite striking, not all 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.820
 makes the game pretty enough 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.500
 cool and it's for me it's being one of 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.690
 the most complete of struggles that go to 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.750
 that the truth will come out soon 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.729
 I see it and I say fuck is that as I eat 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 everything comes out like the trailers or the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.940
 jobs that we are seeing then 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.800
 awesome this fighting game do not go 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.570
 to have your other competitors is very 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.259
 difficult even if it is in the field of 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.509
 fight genre you know it depends more on 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.399
 which we are used to which 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.140
 we usually play that which is well done 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.060
 not even if time was a whore 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.369
 shit or clutter to went to fucking 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.319
 shit from the people that I played the 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.700
 light yacht that obviously if they are 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:39.679
 consummated their controls if they like 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.330
 those controls because they are simply going to 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.429
 buy that game not so here goes 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.110
 exactly the same but the one that is not 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.610
 used to mortal kombat x I les 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.980
 I recommend that I try it because 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.690
 It looks super awesome 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.340
 although good we will see to see when they leave 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.910

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.530
