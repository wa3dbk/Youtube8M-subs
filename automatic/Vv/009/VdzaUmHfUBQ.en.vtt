00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
potential box of dash if they've walk

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.349 
potential box of dash if they've walk
into<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.369> hair<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> get<00:01:02.999> called<00:01:03.239> down

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
into this hair and get called down

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.490 
into this hair and get called down
without<00:01:03.510> getting<00:01:03.839> up<00:01:03.929> to<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.110> high<00:01:04.260> ground

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
without getting up to the high ground

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.380 
without getting up to the high ground
they<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> lose<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.400> much<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.820> Bernie<00:01:06.150> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
they can lose so much now Bernie just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.330 
they can lose so much now Bernie just
look<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.659> top<00:01:06.900> they're<00:01:07.410> gonna<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.740> man<00:01:07.980> was

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
look up the top they're gonna go man was

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
look up the top they're gonna go man was
it<00:01:08.460> down<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.480> massive<00:01:09.870> wasn't<00:01:10.470> gonna

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
it down I think the massive wasn't gonna

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.870 
it down I think the massive wasn't gonna
be<00:01:10.710> chipped<00:01:10.920> out<00:01:11.040> here<00:01:11.310> there's<00:01:11.670> no

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
be chipped out here there's no

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.640 
be chipped out here there's no
