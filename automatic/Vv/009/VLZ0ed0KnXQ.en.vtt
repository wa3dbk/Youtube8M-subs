00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.790
 you want a sleek and modern garden 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.430
 yes I think that is also very nice but the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.980
 lies a danger because if you 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.560
 so sleek modern garden free 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.720
 a minimalist design 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.999
 yes then she was sleek and modern though 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.820
 nothing full again and frankly bored 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:29.980
 I soon find myself in such a type of garden 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.779
 this garden is so intense is one 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.410
 certain balance have used 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.800
 materials 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.739
 I am standing here on a tile that is the cloud 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.750
 then consists of 3 different sizes and 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.390
 is in two different colors it 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.160
 are their jobs that is laid and correct 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.219
 because of the different sizes it is 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.809
 playful and yet tight 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:51.399
 in addition to those hard materials is also 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.370
 made of wood 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.829
 and here also a piece of floor and 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.140
 that gives just that warmth in santana and 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.719
 this is the cuddle cloth these are great 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.449
 pebbles 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:08.170
 laid in the cement is fine and fair 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.180
 and just said this makes together 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.100
 such a sleek modern era 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.979
 atmospheric 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.110
 you just had that tile in the cloud 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.740
 here are some more tight ones 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:24.990
 60 60 concrete tiles in two shades 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.060
 with a bright grunt as it calls and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.520
 250 50 concrete tiles 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.020
 those are very tight that is just like one 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.759
 little bit of atmosphere 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 you are looking for and which image you 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.170
 wish he has all of these tiles 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.630
 a kind of treatment we received 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.460
 there they no dirt on themselves 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.860
 even attach gum 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.280
 red wine oil does not matter stays there 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.240
 not a really a tile you still need 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.600
 see that's the extra 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.469
 a tile from no less than a meter 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.049
 a meter tall 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:01.270
 it is only four centimeters thick 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.829
 which actually makes it reasonable itself 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.229
 can be laid with two 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:09.460
 look at such a tile and still grab 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:12.250
 lay the top all has one 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.210
 kind of wells in it which makes it yes too 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.020
 still a lot of atmosphere off 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.160
 gray and black are the two colors 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.170
 then of course you have another 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.550
 type of planting that fits very nicely in 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.910
 a modern sleek garden 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.170
 dick think of yew block hedges like you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.270
 that calls it 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.430
 and balls of boxwood in my eyes 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 the more boxwood balls together the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.640
 beautiful 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.070
 that is then you can do them all as 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.390
 go pruning 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:46.410
 what you see a lot these days 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.020
 is that boxwood clouds and yew clouds 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.550
 totally hip and in what are they doing then 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.980
 they add a lot of yew and box 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.640
 each other and they kind of go 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.600
 they will not prune in your clouds 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.200
 tight and very yes almost a peoples 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.380
 round shapes natural form together 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.380
 very man
