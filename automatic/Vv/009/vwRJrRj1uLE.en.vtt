it's<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:41.240> good<00:01:41.390> board<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.050> go<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.260> good<00:01:42.979> across

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's a good board to go to good across

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.690 
it's a good board to go to good across
all<00:01:43.430> conditions<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:44.840> fly<00:01:45.470> F<00:01:45.710> has<00:01:46.220> a<00:01:46.250> single

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
all conditions so the fly F has a single

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.039 
all conditions so the fly F has a single
concave<00:01:46.880> through<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.330> front<00:01:47.540> comes<00:01:47.960> to

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
concave through the front comes to

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:49.390 
concave through the front comes to
double<00:01:48.290> through<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> fin<00:01:48.710> keeps<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.220> lot<00:01:49.310> of

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
double through the fin keeps a lot of

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.830 
double through the fin keeps a lot of
flow<00:01:49.580> and<00:01:49.850> a<00:01:49.909> lot<00:01:50.030> of<00:01:50.120> speed<00:01:50.299> during<00:01:50.570> most

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
flow and a lot of speed during most

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.469 
flow and a lot of speed during most
conditions<00:01:51.640> I'd<00:01:52.640> say<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.909> flyer<00:01:53.120> F<00:01:53.270> is<00:01:53.450> a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
conditions I'd say the flyer F is a

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.140 
conditions I'd say the flyer F is a
board<00:01:53.720> for<00:01:54.170> almost<00:01:54.620> anyone<00:01:54.920> I<00:01:55.159> think<00:01:55.940> it's<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
board for almost anyone I think it's a

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.810 
board for almost anyone I think it's a
good<00:01:56.299> intermediate<00:01:56.799> beginner<00:01:57.820> advanced

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
good intermediate beginner advanced

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.700 
good intermediate beginner advanced
board<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.299> think<00:01:59.360> just<00:02:00.020> tailored<00:02:00.350> to<00:02:00.409> your<00:02:00.530> size

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
board I think just tailored to your size

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.289 
board I think just tailored to your size
and<00:02:00.920> whatever<00:02:01.190> it's<00:02:01.760> good<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.000> all<00:02:02.090> conditions

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
and whatever it's good in all conditions

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.750 
and whatever it's good in all conditions
