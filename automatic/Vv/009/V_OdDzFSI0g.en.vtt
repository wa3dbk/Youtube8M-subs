us<00:03:32.800> there<00:03:33.800> is<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> redwood<00:03:34.400> forest<00:03:34.930> Jurassic

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
us there is a redwood forest Jurassic

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.330 
us there is a redwood forest Jurassic
open<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.560> rain<00:03:36.920> forest<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.660> I<00:03:38.660> think<00:03:39.260> I<00:03:39.560> might
