 the works are without forms but good 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.900

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.240
 of colorful fantasies and I'm not going to 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.760

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.560

 description box you will have my channel

 I suppose so nothing a very fat kiss 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.230
 All of them and I think that's very precious to me 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.160
 droplets that I want more than all 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:43.140
 goodbye things and right now I leave you 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.970
 also with how I have done it as I have 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.530
 had because I've had it all 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.030
 in the information box the discount 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.680
 of the extensions that they gave me in their 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.750
 day that I guess will remain valid and 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.810
 I also leave you so much the link of the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:02.160
 dye as of the mask as the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.570
 red dye is worth so it's not good at 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.430
 this case I'm going to start with the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.340
 blue is good we have the little pot 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.640
 here here you have atlantic blue is the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.110
 Intensive color mask tone 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.050
 in this case I will leave in the box 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.700
 information the brand name the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 we open and well this in theory you have to 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.900
 put it with a skewer and such and such 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 dye theme but not 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.079
 I'm not well with those things myself 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.870
 I have always done this with my hand and 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.060
 I've been doing this like this for years 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.670
 I took it off my hair so nothing 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.470
 what I do is take it with the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 hand apply it mostly as you see in 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.280
 the outer layer and then I go with the 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.530
 hand as if you were loading your hair 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.470
 and I add a little inside also but 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:48.209
 trying inside you will not get to 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.209
 up so that the gradient is done 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.810
 once this is done we close the paper 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.340
 albal also grouping all the hairs 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.890
 this is going to make the heat 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.140
 Concentrate and raise the color faster 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.790
 being in this case colored mask 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.000
 without the color rising because we have 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.010
 simply that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.470
 Well, cover it so it does not get stained 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.120
 everything and as you can see I have not done everything 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.680
 a pull but in neither of the two 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.200
 cases neither with blue nor with the dye 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.120
 red, I'm just not going to teach you 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.250
 I hope everything 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.560
 you know bit by bit that what 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.840
 I've done is pretty much use three 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.670
 extensions or four extensions per 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.950
 each piece will have divided into four 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.210
 pieces every time I had a 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.310
 colour 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.260
 and good as you see, the gloves are left 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.610
 what I do to continue using them 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.010
 as you have seen at the beginning they were still 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.630
 stained I've always used it 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.670
 I do is wash my hands good 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.060
 now I use the dye that is level 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.370
 this oxygenated and good what we are going to 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.960
 do is use dye half of 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.820
 what you think we're going to use I'm going 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.420
 from little by little because the dye like 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.160
 oxida is losing power discoloration and 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.470
 as it goes on spending and goes away 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.630
 using so nothing we remove everything 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.150
 goes as you have checked out parts 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.500
 same and I do it in the same way and I 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.850
 I say I do not get along with the brochita 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.100
 but who gets along with the brush 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.930
 it's super better even it's better with 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.930
 but I'm not 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.859
 nothing like this century covered 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:19.630
 for the need that is for you and 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.940
 faster if you want you can add 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.260
 heat to rise and good now I'm 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.720
 checking that the color has risen well 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.760
 we see that if after all ways at 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.100
 end of this clip the part of the 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.720
 tutorial you will see the actual colors and 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.710
 what I 'm going to do is take it 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.080
 to the bathroom and I'm going to rinse first then 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.810
 wash and rinse it again in the case 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.580
 of the color mask trying 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.740
 in washing it too much because being a 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.840
 mask in a dye is going to go a lot 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.120
 before so with just one wash and 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.340
 enough with red like the red goes 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:56.249
 to lose more dye more color of first 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:05:00.589
 so do not be scared and that's the way 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:05:00.589
 we let it dry, we mold it and it's ready 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.170
 I love that I wanted to 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.840
 change back to red with the others 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.000
 extensions you will see photos by instagram 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.380
 in fact there are already photos in instagram as well 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.710
 that if you want to see how they are there are 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.210
 and nothing because I hope that I have 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.070
 liked the video do not forget to stop by 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.960
 the video I know that surely you have 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.150
 had all the video but good here 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.010
 I understand that it is to explain what is 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:27.100
 an Andalusian as I have super ole olÃ© 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.600
 art art and nothing that are laughing 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.600
 for her after eating
