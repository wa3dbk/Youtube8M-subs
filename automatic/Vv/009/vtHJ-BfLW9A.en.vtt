how it actually felt getting Dee dust

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.290 
how it actually felt getting Dee dust
off<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.750> some<00:00:40.620> league<00:00:40.800> play<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.280> call<00:00:42.120> duty

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
off of some league play and call duty

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.310 
off of some league play and call duty
black<00:00:42.510> ops<00:00:42.600> 2<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> think<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
black ops 2 so you see I think that this

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.979 
black ops 2 so you see I think that this
guy<00:00:46.530> what's<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:46.890> name<00:00:46.980> was<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.719> DDoS<00:00:48.719> sir

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
guy what's your name was the DDoS sir

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.860 
guy what's your name was the DDoS sir
himself<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.700> other<00:00:50.879> guys<00:00:51.090> were<00:00:51.600> just

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
himself and the other guys were just

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.590 
himself and the other guys were just
trying<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.320> use<00:00:52.649> him<00:00:52.980> also<00:00:53.280> I<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.510> were

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
trying to use him also I think they were

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.389 
trying to use him also I think they were
like<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> party<00:00:55.140> or<00:00:55.260> something<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.949> same<00:00:56.219> as

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
like in a party or something you same as

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.180 
like in a party or something you same as
who<00:00:56.550> gets<00:00:56.870> all<00:00:57.870> their<00:00:58.109> master<00:00:58.620> ranks<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
who gets all their master ranks and

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
who gets all their master ranks and
whatnot<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.629> that's<00:01:00.780> super<00:01:01.020> cheap

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
whatnot and I think that's super cheap

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.840 
whatnot and I think that's super cheap
you<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.800> just<00:01:01.829> shooting<00:01:02.129> him<00:01:02.460> nothing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
you see I'm just shooting him nothing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.010 
you see I'm just shooting him nothing
happens<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.300> then<00:01:03.480> BAM<00:01:04.049> kicked<00:01:05.750> very<00:01:06.750> cheap

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
happens and then BAM kicked very cheap

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.359 
happens and then BAM kicked very cheap
