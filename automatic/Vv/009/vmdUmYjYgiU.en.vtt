so<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> transcribed<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.290> course<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.769> verse

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
so I transcribed the course in the verse

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.390 
so I transcribed the course in the verse
up<00:03:39.129> here<00:03:39.370> which<00:03:39.909> has<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.450> e<00:03:40.480> minor<00:03:40.750> 7<00:03:41.140> G<00:03:41.620> the

up here which has the e minor 7 G the
FCI<00:03:42.760> 9<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:44.170> D<00:03:44.560> and<00:03:44.799> then<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.549> have<00:03:45.760> the

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
FCI 9 and the D and then you have the

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.240 
FCI 9 and the D and then you have the
strumming<00:03:46.269> pattern<00:03:46.299> and<00:03:46.620> for<00:03:47.620> each<00:03:47.799> chord

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
strumming pattern and for each chord

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.949 
strumming pattern and for each chord
you're<00:03:48.730> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.909> play<00:03:48.970> it<00:03:49.239> down<00:03:49.390> up<00:03:49.599> and<00:03:49.930> then

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
a minor E minor and D I don't know why I

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.920 
a minor E minor and D I don't know why I
put<00:04:27.010> it<00:04:27.130> twice<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:28.060> because<00:04:28.510> you<00:04:28.660> play<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
put it twice but because you play the

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.290 
put it twice but because you play the
full<00:04:29.080> chord<00:04:29.349> but<00:04:29.800> for<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.130> last<00:04:30.460> part<00:04:30.699> it<00:04:31.210> will

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
full chord but for the last part it will

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.330 
full chord but for the last part it will
do<00:04:31.389> it<00:04:31.510> down<00:04:31.690> up<00:04:31.840> to<00:04:32.110> palm<00:04:32.320> mutes<00:04:32.530> for<00:04:32.949> in<00:04:33.130> the<00:04:33.220> a
