 I am happy of the enchanted life because 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.270
 let's share one of those delicious 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.890
 recipes that people always look at you 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.340

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:36.050
 all of us who are going to make one cheese 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.480
 cream cream if you know how 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.180
 you were taking a cheesecake with 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.980
 rich flavor to coconut and you after you 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.930
 puts all the flavors you want from that 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.390
 baptized but I 'm going to do it 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.310
 virginita the first thing we're going to 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.710
 work is the broth that's fine 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.130
 important and in a saucepan like this 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.870
 is going to heat water and is going to throw pieces 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.660
 of ginger 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.910
 free we cut it into pieces first what 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.100
 that we give with an easy spoon of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.210
 peel it with a teaspoon what 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.210
 we crushed and beat them 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.190
 when I finish it if you have the 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.190
 flu 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.840
 a little touch of cinnamon on the bar too 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.300
 I like to add a little cinnamon in 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.470
 dust but this spice is basic in 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.470
 our broth 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.840
 and we will also add what are the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.600
 nails by truth truth and seeds and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.250
 anise that are very small and do not 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.979
 forget the stars because the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.970
 star let's then add the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.920
 anise star 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.840

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.090

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.350

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.360
 I want the water to evaporate but 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.860
 always will be reduced a little because 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.770

 about 20 25 minutes is going to turn this 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.400
 color and in our Lord direct to 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.960
 value that the throat has if average 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.880
 look I'm going to bring a little fish 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.580

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.490
 of honey 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.030
 this new hour right now I say 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.610
 because 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.650
 Meanwhile the basis of what 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.650
 is the coconut cream and the milk in a 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.260
 blender mix as you taught right now 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.740
 which is coconut milk coconut cream 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.560
 evaporated milk condensed milk 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:42.040
 vanilla extract crisis and if you have 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:46.270
 they go to lavín or little seeds of vanilla 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:49.470
 so you can see those little dots of wine and 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.470
 he is going to leave 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:59.740
 and then we're going to serve it shine 

00:05:55.929 --> 00:06:02.020
 remember that this is taken well then 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.649
 when I added this species, it only remains 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.129
 a little taste that could replace the 

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:08.129
 baptism 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:13.599
 for the pleasure to see them and also is 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.789
 doing so can not be used by our 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.169

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:21.610
 If the house specialty divine site

 pouring and it looks good well 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:35.409
 rich and will keep it in the fridge 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.719

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.129
