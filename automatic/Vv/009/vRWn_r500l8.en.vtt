00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
my favorite back in high school because
it<00:02:20.160> was<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.730> most<00:02:20.910> affordable<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.750> was

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
it was the most affordable and it was

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.380 
it was the most affordable and it was
something<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.380> love<00:02:22.710> which<00:02:23.340> was<00:02:23.610> fruity

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
something that I love which was fruity

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.570 
something that I love which was fruity
and<00:02:24.630> sweet<00:02:24.900> but<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.410> think<00:02:25.710> I<00:02:25.830> grew<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.250> old<00:02:26.280> for

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and sweet but I think I grew too old for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.700 
and sweet but I think I grew too old for
this<00:02:26.760> now<00:02:26.940> but<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.780> still<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.440> still

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
this now but I still have it I still

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.070 
this now but I still have it I still
wear<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.160> those<00:02:29.310> odd<00:02:29.490> days<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.420> definitely

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
wear it on those odd days but definitely

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.840 
wear it on those odd days but definitely
I<00:02:31.110> try<00:02:31.500> to<00:02:31.560> avoid<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.980> during<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> summer

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
I try to avoid this during the summer

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.030 
I try to avoid this during the summer
time<00:02:33.150> because<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.630> find<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.050> whenever<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.860> wear

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
time because I find that whenever I wear

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.730 
time because I find that whenever I wear
this<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.720> attracts<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.840> lot<00:02:37.020> of<00:02:37.140> bugs<00:02:37.350> and<00:02:37.590> bees

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
this it attracts a lot of bugs and bees

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.730 
this it attracts a lot of bugs and bees
because<00:02:38.160> it's<00:02:38.340> definitely<00:02:39.020> SuperDuper<00:02:40.020> sugar
