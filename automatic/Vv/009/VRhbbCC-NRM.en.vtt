kinds<00:00:32.800> of<00:00:32.859> decisions<00:00:33.370> are<00:00:33.550> relatively<00:00:34.030> easy

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:34.359 
kinds of decisions are relatively easy

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:36.450 
kinds of decisions are relatively easy
I'm<00:00:35.230> talking<00:00:35.620> about<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:35.920> time<00:00:36.100> so<00:00:36.250> when<00:00:36.370> you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
I'm talking about the time so when you

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.360 
I'm talking about the time so when you
see<00:00:36.670> something<00:00:37.149> you<00:00:37.570> think<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.320> like<00:00:38.499> it<00:00:38.739> but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
see something you think you like it but

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.520 
see something you think you like it but
maybe<00:00:39.820> it's<00:00:40.059> the<00:00:40.300> finances<00:00:40.899> maybe<00:00:41.109> you're<00:00:41.350> out

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
maybe it's the finances maybe you're out

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.590 
maybe it's the finances maybe you're out
of<00:00:41.649> cash<00:00:42.010> at<00:00:42.249> the<00:00:42.339> moment<00:00:42.699> maybe<00:00:43.059> that<00:00:43.390> piece

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
of cash at the moment maybe that piece

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.509 
of cash at the moment maybe that piece
is<00:00:43.809> priced<00:00:44.199> at<00:00:44.410> a<00:00:44.440> particular<00:00:44.769> price<00:00:45.219> point

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
is priced at a particular price point

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.250 
is priced at a particular price point
that<00:00:45.609> you're<00:00:45.730> just<00:00:45.909> not<00:00:46.030> sure<00:00:46.420> maybe<00:00:46.989> there's

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
that you're just not sure maybe there's

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.020

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
something about the painting itself the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.259 
something about the painting itself the
technique<00:00:49.390> or<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.659> subject<00:00:50.079> matter<00:00:50.260> that<00:00:50.379> you

just not sure if you should get it for
you<00:00:54.629> I've<00:00:55.629> developed<00:00:55.989> a<00:00:56.760> two-step<00:00:57.760> test<00:00:58.149> but

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
you I've developed a two-step test but

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.259 
you I've developed a two-step test but
is<00:00:59.050> very<00:00:59.379> very<00:00:59.620> helpful<00:00:59.859> and<00:01:00.249> before<00:01:01.239> I

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
is very very helpful and before I

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.350 
is very very helpful and before I
figured<00:01:02.079> out<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.409> test<00:01:02.679> I<00:01:02.979> made<00:01:03.670> both<00:01:03.940> kinds

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
figured out the test I made both kinds

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.210 
figured out the test I made both kinds
of<00:01:04.420> wrong<00:01:04.630> decisions<00:01:04.840> I<00:01:05.350> bought<00:01:05.560> art<00:01:05.890> that<00:01:06.160> I

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
of wrong decisions I bought art that I

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.550 
of wrong decisions I bought art that I
should<00:01:06.430> not<00:01:06.610> have<00:01:06.760> bought<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.600> I<00:01:07.750> didn't<00:01:08.410> buy

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
should not have bought and I didn't buy

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.920 
should not have bought and I didn't buy
art<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.160> I<00:01:09.190> deeply<00:01:09.820> regret<00:01:10.240> not<00:01:10.420> getting<00:01:10.660> at

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
art that I deeply regret not getting at

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.530 
art that I deeply regret not getting at
the<00:01:11.050> time<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:12.310> these<00:01:12.490> two<00:01:12.760> tests<00:01:13.150> have<00:01:13.240> helped

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
the time but these two tests have helped

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.780 
the time but these two tests have helped
me<00:01:13.660> since<00:01:13.930> then<00:01:14.200> to<00:01:14.740> make<00:01:14.920> purchases<00:01:15.550> that<00:01:15.730> I

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
me since then to make purchases that I

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.150 
me since then to make purchases that I
think<00:01:16.060> are<00:01:16.390> perfect<00:01:17.050> for<00:01:17.200> me<00:01:17.350> along<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.830> way

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
think are perfect for me along the way

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.070 
think are perfect for me along the way
and<00:01:18.250> maybe<00:01:18.670> some<00:01:19.030> version<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.480> these<00:01:19.630> tests

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
and maybe some version of these tests

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.460 
and maybe some version of these tests
will<00:01:20.200> be<00:01:20.320> very<00:01:20.530> very<00:01:20.710> helpful<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:21.220> YouTube

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
will be very very helpful to YouTube

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
by four feet way past my price range but

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.170 
by four feet way past my price range but
I<00:01:46.870> went<00:01:47.710> in<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.070> look<00:01:48.250> because<00:01:48.430> he<00:01:48.610> was<00:01:48.760> so<00:01:48.940> good

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
I went in to look because he was so good

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.540 
I went in to look because he was so good
and<00:01:49.840> one<00:01:50.140> Christmas<00:01:50.650> he<00:01:50.860> decided<00:01:51.250> he<00:01:51.520> was

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
and one Christmas he decided he was

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.030 
and one Christmas he decided he was
going<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.940> do<00:01:52.120> some<00:01:52.540> small-scale<00:01:52.870> work<00:01:53.500> that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
going to do some small-scale work that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.480 
going to do some small-scale work that
would<00:01:54.160> be<00:01:54.310> priced<00:01:54.960> weighed<00:01:55.960> you<00:01:56.710> know<00:01:56.830> because

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
would be priced weighed you know because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.970 
would be priced weighed you know because
the<00:01:57.640> scale<00:01:57.940> was<00:01:58.120> so<00:01:58.300> small<00:01:58.770> far<00:01:59.770> more

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
the scale was so small far more

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.620 
the scale was so small far more
affordable<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.610> that<00:02:01.060> would<00:02:01.180> move<00:02:01.390> quickly

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
affordable and that would move quickly

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.360 
affordable and that would move quickly
so<00:02:02.080> that<00:02:02.530> he<00:02:02.650> could<00:02:02.800> have<00:02:02.980> some<00:02:03.190> Christmas

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
so that he could have some Christmas

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.250 
so that he could have some Christmas
income<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.150> people<00:02:04.420> could<00:02:04.600> have<00:02:04.720> presents

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
income and people could have presents

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.070 
income and people could have presents
and<00:02:05.820> there<00:02:06.820> was<00:02:06.940> one<00:02:07.150> painting<00:02:07.570> that<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.780> really

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
and there was one painting that I really

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.990 
and there was one painting that I really
really<00:02:08.319> liked

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
really liked

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.209 
really liked
so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.060> went<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.479> there<00:02:10.599> every<00:02:10.959> day<00:02:10.989> and<00:02:11.920> every

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:12.219 
so I went in there every day and every

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:14.190 
so I went in there every day and every
day<00:02:12.280> I<00:02:12.400> saw<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:13.030> painting<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.659> I<00:02:13.750> liked<00:02:13.989> it

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
day I saw this painting and I liked it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.839 
day I saw this painting and I liked it
and<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.859> don't<00:02:14.920> know<00:02:15.159> if<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> bookstore

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
and I don't know if the bookstore

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.699 
and I don't know if the bookstore
suggested<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.599> or<00:02:16.840> if<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:17.049> finally<00:02:17.469> came<00:02:17.680> up

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
suggested it or if I finally came up

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.830 
suggested it or if I finally came up
with<00:02:17.829> the<00:02:18.069> idea<00:02:18.370> but<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.269> was<00:02:19.390> clear<00:02:19.659> that<00:02:19.689> I

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
and at the time I was instinctively

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.580 
and at the time I was instinctively
applying<00:02:45.250> these<00:02:45.489> two<00:02:45.790> tests<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.780> took<00:02:47.379> me<00:02:47.560> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
applying these two tests that took me a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.849 
applying these two tests that took me a
while<00:02:47.799> after<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.639> figure<00:02:48.970> out<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:50.590> first

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
while after that to figure out the first

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.920 
while after that to figure out the first
test<00:02:51.129> is<00:02:51.370> this<00:02:52.349> 24<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.469> 48<00:02:53.829> hours<00:02:54.069> later<00:02:54.790> am<00:02:55.719> I

those<00:03:26.949> cases<00:03:27.250> it's<00:03:27.849> I've<00:03:28.479> come<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.199> realize

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
those cases it's I've come to realize

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.219 
those cases it's I've come to realize
that<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:29.949> worth<00:03:30.220> getting<00:03:30.609> because<00:03:31.449> it<00:03:31.750> has

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
that it's worth getting because it has

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:34.890 
that it's worth getting because it has
power<00:03:32.620> for<00:03:33.010> me<00:03:33.189> that<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.909> speaking<00:03:34.239> to<00:03:34.569> me<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
power for me that is speaking to me and

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.369 
power for me that is speaking to me and
it<00:03:35.560> will<00:03:35.739> have<00:03:36.159> a<00:03:36.189> long-lasting<00:03:36.989> power<00:03:37.989> and

00:03:38.369 --> 00:03:38.379 
it will have a long-lasting power and

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.259 
it will have a long-lasting power and
and<00:03:39.069> it<00:03:39.189> would<00:03:39.280> be<00:03:39.430> worth<00:03:39.629> investing<00:03:40.629> in<00:03:42.269> that

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
and it would be worth investing in that

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.920 
and it would be worth investing in that
test<00:03:43.750> has<00:03:44.259> helped<00:03:44.739> me<00:03:44.979> avoid<00:03:45.639> paintings<00:03:46.329> that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
within one year can I afford it so it's

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.360

for me it's very worthwhile to acquire
the<00:05:16.150> piece<00:05:16.390> to<00:05:16.990> invest<00:05:17.350> in<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.740> because<00:05:18.190> I<00:05:18.490> can

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
the piece to invest in it because I can

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.090
