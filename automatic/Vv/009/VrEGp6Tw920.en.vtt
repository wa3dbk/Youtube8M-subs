video on the NES cartridge restoration

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.480 
video on the NES cartridge restoration
and<00:00:15.049> ironically<00:00:16.049> today<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> got<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> stack<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
and ironically today I got in a stack of

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.880 
and ironically today I got in a stack of
Nintendo<00:00:18.210> 64<00:00:18.750> games<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.260> needed<00:00:19.529> some<00:00:19.710> work

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
Nintendo 64 games that needed some work

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.160 
Nintendo 64 games that needed some work
so<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> thought<00:00:20.490> I'd<00:00:20.640> do<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> follow<00:00:21.689> up<00:00:21.810> video<00:00:22.050> to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
so I thought I'd do a follow up video to

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
so I thought I'd do a follow up video to
that<00:00:22.410> one<00:00:22.619> now<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.760> very<00:00:23.910> typical<00:00:24.119> these

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
that one now this is very typical these

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.470 
that one now this is very typical these
carts<00:00:24.779> are<00:00:24.900> really<00:00:25.140> easy<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.529> clean<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
carts are really easy to clean and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.480

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that they put them on these because when

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.930 
that they put them on these because when
you<00:00:41.760> tear<00:00:41.969> them<00:00:42.059> off<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:43.530> end<00:00:43.739> up<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.700> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
you tear them off you end up with that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
you tear them off you end up with that
and<00:00:45.539> once<00:00:46.410> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.620> ruined<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.399> know<00:00:47.520> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
and once this is ruined you know you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.350 
and once this is ruined you know you
have<00:00:47.969> a<00:00:48.000> choice<00:00:48.289> you're<00:00:49.289> either<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.680> to

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
have a choice you're either going to

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.130 
have a choice you're either going to
want<00:00:51.360> doesn't<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.780> but<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.930> has<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
want doesn't have it but it has the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.010 
want doesn't have it but it has the
marker<00:00:52.469> you're<00:00:53.309> either<00:00:53.460> gonna<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.180> or

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
marker you're either gonna have this or

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
marker you're either gonna have this or
this<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.280> lot<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> times<00:00:56.670> what<00:00:56.820> I'll<00:00:56.940> do<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
this and a lot of times what I'll do is

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270 
this and a lot of times what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.930> off<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> entire<00:00:58.530> thing<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
I'll just take off the entire thing and

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.709 
I'll just take off the entire thing and
I<00:00:59.399> mean<00:00:59.430> it's<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.359> lot<00:01:00.539> less<00:01:01.160> unsightly<00:01:02.160> than

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
I mean it's a lot less unsightly than

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.539 
I mean it's a lot less unsightly than
that<00:01:03.979> so<00:01:05.900> basically<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.500> idea<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.310> same

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that so basically the idea is the same

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.570 
that so basically the idea is the same
you'll<00:01:08.939> take<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:11.250> sticker<00:01:12.920> I'm<00:01:13.920> gonna<00:01:14.100> peel

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
you'll take this sticker I'm gonna peel

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.450 
you'll take this sticker I'm gonna peel
it<00:01:14.610> off<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.270> gonna<00:01:15.450> leave<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:16.460> and

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
it off and it's gonna leave that and

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.770 
it off and it's gonna leave that and
then<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.060> some<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.450> stuff

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
then I want to take some of this stuff

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.440 
then I want to take some of this stuff
and<00:01:19.130> squirt<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.369> there<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> just

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
and squirt it on there and you just

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179 
and squirt it on there and you just
gotta<00:01:21.720> let<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.930> soak<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.650> labels<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
gotta let it soak in these labels are a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.710 
gotta let it soak in these labels are a
lot<00:01:23.369> harder<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.390> once<00:01:24.600> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
lot harder to get off but once that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.780 
lot harder to get off but once that
soaks<00:01:24.990> in<00:01:25.200> really<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:26.220> all<00:01:26.400> starts<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
soaks in really good it all starts to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.300 
soaks in really good it all starts to
come<00:01:27.030> off<00:01:27.290> so<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.560> gonna<00:01:28.650> let<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.890> sit<00:01:29.250> over

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
come off so I'm gonna let that sit over

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.030 
come off so I'm gonna let that sit over
here<00:01:29.460> for<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.790> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.680> work<00:01:31.680> on<00:01:31.860> this

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
here for a little bit and work on this

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
here for a little bit and work on this
marker<00:01:32.490> here

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
marker here

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.770 
marker here
on<00:01:35.560> there<00:01:35.860> and<00:01:36.759> again<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.149> marker<00:01:37.450> always

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
on there and again the marker always

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.630 
on there and again the marker always
just<00:01:37.990> comes<00:01:38.200> right<00:01:38.439> off<00:01:38.469> so<00:01:39.009> a<00:01:39.039> little<00:01:39.460> bit<00:01:39.549> of

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
just comes right off so a little bit of

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.240 
just comes right off so a little bit of
elbow<00:01:39.820> grease<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:41.740> going<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.070> come<00:01:42.219> off

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
elbow grease that's going to come off

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.819 
elbow grease that's going to come off
completely<00:01:42.929> and<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.200> shouldn't<00:01:44.469> be<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.619> problem

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
completely and it shouldn't be a problem

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.209 
completely and it shouldn't be a problem
saying<00:01:45.490> with<00:01:45.700> this<00:01:45.880> one<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:47.770> one<00:01:47.890> came<00:01:48.039> off<00:01:48.189> a

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
saying with this one that one came off a

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.919

lot<00:01:48.490> easier<00:01:49.289> so<00:01:50.970> we'll<00:01:51.970> work<00:01:52.149> on<00:01:52.329> those<00:01:52.569> we'll

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
lot easier so we'll work on those we'll

lot easier so we'll work on those we'll
work<00:01:53.110> on<00:01:53.259> this<00:01:53.439> label<00:01:53.740> as<00:01:54.009> well

once<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.010> are<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:29.110> know<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.290> got<00:02:29.500> a<00:02:29.670> rethink

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
once you are you know you got a rethink

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.070 
once you are you know you got a rethink
how<00:02:30.760> you're<00:02:30.910> doing<00:02:31.150> it<00:02:31.240> messy<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.540> got<00:02:31.690> a<00:02:31.720> tiny

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
how you're doing it messy I got a tiny

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.650 
how you're doing it messy I got a tiny
bit<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.440> ink<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.740> there<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.730> I'll<00:02:34.240> give<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.600> a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
bit of ink on there so I'll give it a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.410 
bit of ink on there so I'll give it a
couple<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.990> wipes<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.130> gets<00:02:36.310> clean<00:02:36.670> and

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
couple of wipes so this gets clean and

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.330 
couple of wipes so this gets clean and
then<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> rest<00:02:37.990> I'm<00:02:38.500> gonna<00:02:38.740> fold<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.130> towel

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
then the rest I'm gonna fold the towel

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.920 
then the rest I'm gonna fold the towel
up<00:02:39.520> and<00:02:39.670> I'm<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.880> to<00:02:39.940> just<00:02:40.270> rub<00:02:40.510> right<00:02:40.720> there

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
up and I'm going to just rub right there

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.230 
up and I'm going to just rub right there
on<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> edge<00:02:41.430> until<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:42.550> gets<00:02:42.700> nice<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:42.910> clean

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
on the edge until it gets nice and clean

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.160 
on the edge until it gets nice and clean
and<00:02:46.240> it's<00:02:46.480> a<00:02:46.570> little<00:02:46.720> more<00:02:46.900> time-consuming

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
and it's a little more time-consuming

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.260 
and it's a little more time-consuming
but<00:02:48.040> as<00:02:48.190> you<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.430> see<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.700> all<00:02:48.790> comes<00:02:49.030> right

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
but as you can see it all comes right

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.080 
but as you can see it all comes right
off<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.920> all<00:02:51.130> is<00:02:51.280> really<00:02:51.550> good<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.850> crys

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
off and that all is really good at crys

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.180 
off and that all is really good at crys
fast<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.810> doesn't<00:02:52.959> corrode<00:02:53.200> anything<00:02:53.770> and

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
fast it doesn't corrode anything and

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.860 
fast it doesn't corrode anything and
then<00:02:54.490> as<00:02:54.700> before<00:02:54.730> on<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.900> inside<00:02:57.720> we're<00:02:58.720> just

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
then as before on the inside we're just

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.300 
then as before on the inside we're just
gonna<00:02:59.020> spray<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.350> little<00:02:59.470> alcohol<00:02:59.860> on<00:03:00.010> some

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
gonna spray a little alcohol on some

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:09.990 
gonna spray a little alcohol on some

q-tips what a man scrub those
connections<00:03:10.510> pretty<00:03:10.780> vigorously<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:13.269> get<00:03:13.390> all

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
connections pretty vigorously to get all

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.750 
connections pretty vigorously to get all
that<00:03:13.630> gunk<00:03:13.870> off<00:03:14.080> look<00:03:14.290> at<00:03:14.350> that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
that gunk off look at that

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.000 
that gunk off look at that
and<00:03:15.849> just<00:03:16.780> as<00:03:16.959> with<00:03:17.170> the<00:03:17.370> NES<00:03:18.370> carts<00:03:19.830> you<00:03:20.830> want

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
and just as with the NES carts you want

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.339 
and just as with the NES carts you want
these<00:03:21.159> connections<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.000> be<00:03:22.120> shiny<00:03:22.480> you<00:03:23.230> know

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:23.349 
these connections to be shiny you know

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:24.680 
these connections to be shiny you know
like<00:03:23.650> they're<00:03:23.830> new

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
like they're new

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.360 
like they're new
so<00:03:25.690> here<00:03:25.810> we<00:03:25.930> are<00:03:25.959> at<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> midway<00:03:26.860> point<00:03:27.159> and<00:03:27.340> I

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
so here we are at a midway point and I

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.460 
so here we are at a midway point and I
thought<00:03:27.549> I'd<00:03:27.730> I've<00:03:28.360> been<00:03:28.599> working<00:03:29.140> on<00:03:29.230> some

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
thought I'd I've been working on some

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.050 
thought I'd I've been working on some
courts<00:03:29.739> simultaneously<00:03:30.489> I<00:03:30.519> realized<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.030> had

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
courts simultaneously I realized I had

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.059 
courts simultaneously I realized I had
kind<00:03:31.299> of<00:03:31.450> a<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.569> little<00:03:31.900> setup<00:03:32.530> where<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.920> could

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
kind of a a little setup where I could

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.920 
kind of a a little setup where I could
show<00:03:33.190> you<00:03:33.220> what<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.489> looks<00:03:33.610> like<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.879> stages<00:03:34.299> so

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
show you what it looks like in stages so

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.199 
show you what it looks like in stages so
after<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:35.980> apply<00:03:36.129> some<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.459> these<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:37.060> know<00:03:37.090> I

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
after you apply some of these you know I

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.180 
after you apply some of these you know I
use<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.540> goof-off<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.709> apply<00:03:38.890> some<00:03:39.160> of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
use the goof-off as you apply some of

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.190 
use the goof-off as you apply some of
that<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.760> rub<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.390> in<00:03:40.480> there<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.840> let<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.080> sit

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
that and rub it in there you let it sit

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.630 
that and rub it in there you let it sit
for<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.410> while<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.650> start<00:03:41.950> peeling<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.549> then

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
for a while you start peeling and then

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.039 
for a while you start peeling and then
you<00:03:42.730> reapply<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.120> little<00:03:43.390> bit<00:03:43.510> more<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.900> mean

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
you reapply a little bit more and I mean

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.110 
you reapply a little bit more and I mean
it<00:03:44.140> only<00:03:44.170> takes<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.560> drip<00:03:44.769> at<00:03:44.890> a<00:03:44.950> time<00:03:45.159> then<00:03:46.000> we

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
it only takes a drip at a time then we

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.920 
it only takes a drip at a time then we
got<00:03:46.269> like<00:03:46.900> stage<00:03:47.200> three<00:03:47.879> there<00:03:48.879> and<00:03:49.299> then

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
got like stage three there and then

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.110 
got like stage three there and then
there's<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.319> last<00:03:50.440> stage<00:03:50.860> where<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.819> really

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
there's the last stage where you really

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.330 
there's the last stage where you really
have<00:03:52.299> pretty<00:03:52.810> much<00:03:52.900> all<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.319> off<00:03:53.500> and<00:03:53.829> just

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
have pretty much all of it off and just

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.619 
have pretty much all of it off and just
a<00:03:54.430> little<00:03:54.640> bit<00:03:54.730> of<00:03:54.790> sticky<00:03:55.030> residue<00:03:55.329> in<00:03:55.510> this

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
a little bit of sticky residue in this

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.390 
a little bit of sticky residue in this
one<00:03:55.780> when<00:03:55.900> you<00:03:55.930> use<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.319> alcohol<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:57.160> get<00:03:57.280> off

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
one when you use the alcohol to get off

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.349 
one when you use the alcohol to get off
like<00:03:58.390> this<00:03:58.780> one<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.739> can<00:03:59.920> see<00:04:00.129> that's<00:04:00.359> it's

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
like this one you can see that's it's

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:03.539 
like this one you can see that's it's
all<00:04:01.510> pretty<00:04:01.750> much<00:04:01.840> coming<00:04:02.140> off<00:04:02.379> now<00:04:02.739> I'll<00:04:03.400> be

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.040 

yeah

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
yeah

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.280 
yeah
those<00:04:15.590> wall<00:04:16.270> be<00:04:17.270> clean<00:04:17.600> here<00:04:17.840> in<00:04:17.900> just<00:04:18.050> a<00:04:18.140> few

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
those wall be clean here in just a few

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.230 
those wall be clean here in just a few
minutes<00:04:19.180> and<00:04:20.180> here<00:04:20.600> we<00:04:20.750> are<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:21.110> done<00:04:22.120> some<00:04:23.120> of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
minutes and here we are all done some of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.580 
minutes and here we are all done some of
those<00:04:23.360> like<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.750> said<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:23.990> had<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.320> take<00:04:24.350> the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
those like I said I had to take the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.710 
those like I said I had to take the
backs<00:04:24.830> off<00:04:25.100> of<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:25.790> you<00:04:25.850> can<00:04:26.090> see<00:04:26.420> how<00:04:26.570> those

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
backs off of so you can see how those

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.290 
backs off of so you can see how those
came<00:04:27.050> out<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:28.310> I<00:04:28.340> think<00:04:28.370> it's<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.880> a<00:04:29.000> lot

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
came out and I think it's just a lot

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
came out and I think it's just a lot
better<00:04:30.050> than<00:04:30.440> the<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:32.570> know<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.870> sticker<00:04:33.290> on

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
better than the you know the sticker on

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.830 
better than the you know the sticker on
the<00:04:33.470> back<00:04:33.620> or<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.340> the<00:04:34.970> damaged<00:04:35.300> label<00:04:35.660> once

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
the back or the the damaged label once

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:43.740 
the back or the the damaged label once
it<00:04:36.020> peels<00:04:36.260> off<00:04:37.240> so<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:39.770> came<00:04:39.950> out<00:04:40.100> nice<00:04:42.370> and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
it peels off so it came out nice and

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.300 
it peels off so it came out nice and
they're<00:04:44.750> ready<00:04:44.960> for<00:04:45.020> someone's<00:04:45.470> collection

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.990 

so<00:04:49.310> that's<00:04:49.520> it

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000 
so that's it

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.150 
so that's it
just<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:50.420> you<00:04:50.480> know<00:04:50.570> this<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:51.140> a<00:04:51.170> method<00:04:52.070> you

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
just so you know this is a method you

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.740 
just so you know this is a method you
could<00:04:52.310> use<00:04:52.460> on<00:04:52.640> pretty<00:04:52.970> much<00:04:53.060> any<00:04:53.270> cartridge

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
could use on pretty much any cartridge

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.270 
could use on pretty much any cartridge
some<00:04:53.990> are<00:04:54.110> harder<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.410> clean<00:04:54.590> than<00:04:54.770> others<00:04:55.010> you

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
some are harder to clean than others you

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.880 
some are harder to clean than others you
know<00:04:55.540> Super<00:04:56.540> Nintendo<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:57.170> NES<00:04:57.470> cartridges

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
know Super Nintendo and NES cartridges

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.010 
know Super Nintendo and NES cartridges
have<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.160> few<00:04:58.340> more<00:04:58.460> nooks<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.030> Genesis

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
have a few more nooks and Genesis

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.870 
have a few more nooks and Genesis
cartridges<00:05:00.560> are<00:05:00.710> even<00:05:00.950> easier<00:05:01.310> because<00:05:01.580> they

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
cartridges are even easier because they

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.170 
cartridges are even easier because they
have<00:05:02.060> no<00:05:03.040> little<00:05:04.040> lines<00:05:04.550> in<00:05:04.880> there<00:05:05.060> or

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
have no little lines in there or

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.900 
have no little lines in there or
anything<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:05.690> you<00:05:05.750> have<00:05:05.840> to<00:05:05.900> clean<00:05:06.170> in<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.460> I

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
anything that you have to clean in so I

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.880 
anything that you have to clean in so I
won't<00:05:08.480> do<00:05:08.630> a<00:05:08.660> video<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.050> every<00:05:09.500> kind<00:05:09.740> of
