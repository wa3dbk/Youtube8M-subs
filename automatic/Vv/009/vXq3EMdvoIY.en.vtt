00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:13.830
 Mr. Logistics and content material about 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.120
 call of duty goes in my today 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.430
 I have some new information about that 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.080
 extension mode and that if today 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.789
 a go back to which classes 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 is in which action will give courage as her 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.850
 you can choose a class, so to speak 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.070
 and do you have certain skills where 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.210
 I would go straight to it 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.680
 that is definitely different than in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.689
 zombie mode where you just type 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.420
 was and there was no matter what classes to 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.070
 the h there was no class so im 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 Extreme sports become a class 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.860
 can choose more what I also 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.090
 actually pretty good because it 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 that above all things the teamwork 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
 can promote because you stop then me 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.079
 who can think what good and what can now 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.360
 who jan which tasks in the battle 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.140
 say I take over and therefore find 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.920
 I'm actually pretty pretty now 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.539
 cool feature 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.550
 the information comes by the way 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.440
 so it was going to be directly from infinity 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.910
 also be correct and they are natural 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 that's why I've been in English 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.170
 translated now and tried that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.000
 they are as good as possible to understand and 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.920
 well expressed and that nevertheless can 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 contents are lost that is 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 now almost a translation and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.400
 start directly with the first class 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 and that is the web special and the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.790
 ability of this class is that one 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.650
 So 20 percent more cool damage has 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.080
 that every ball is about 20 percent more 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.850
 does harm and that is what I think 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 So pretty much 20 billion I 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.030
 do not know how much of these aliens 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.250
 On the side, whether the like 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 normal online players will endure 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.790
 they will probably be something more 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.170
 but in the 20 of the damage pro 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.350
 I already think of myself as a ball 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210
 as pretty handy before and the 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.579
 the task of the webspecials is so many 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.140
 to cool parents as possible and first 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.970
 especially good to use against strong 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.369
 armored or attacking a herd 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.320
 aliens so the situation where it is dangerous 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.030
 will and his weapons antic gets better 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.040
 the more level the specialist earns 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.409
 So I'm not sure yet 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.640
 So the level in game will be something 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.380
 she gets her level while you play 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.909
 and when the game is over 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469
 because the next round again from the beginning 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.090
 on 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.380
 so I think that's it 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.850
 but of course it could be that it 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.649
 how in multiplayer is that he every 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.700
 get game xp and on your home 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.979
 level go up 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.599
 but rather, I think it's every game 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.790
 From the beginning, that's where we're new again 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.260
 So you have to level up 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.150
 webspecial is likely 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.620
 be a full class like most people 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.560
 who play without a team now 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.110
 will use and as a second class 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.909
 with the tank and the ability of him 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.530
 is that the 25 percent more 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.209
 health has as the other classes 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.829
 with his description stands that the 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.049
 tank at the front stands and hits out 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.489
 the other class does not survive 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.250
 You could stop that 25th 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.420
 explain more health and the percent 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.129
 Extra health leaves the complexion 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.379
 play more aggressively and slow things down 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.250
 Situations escape alive and yes 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.659
 that will probably be one too 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.079
 popular class are easy if you 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.250
 because it can take more and it is 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:49.620
 actually always handy if you have a lot 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.849
 stands out and the higher the level of the 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.790
 The higher the tanks the higher 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.950
 health and velvet his strength and me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.150
 By the way, by the way, think this 25 became it 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.680
 not explicitly mentioned here but 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.840
 I think that 's the maximum 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.159
 abilities are so that's it 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.569
 even now when rapping specialist can 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.120
 it also once again say that shortly 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.129
 So I think that the 20 people at 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.470
 web special is 25 percent more 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.239
 health in the tank that the quasi the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.400
 maximum values ​​are so if you that 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.659
 I got the maximum level 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.790
 but unfortunately not easy game 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.889
 I have not played myself yet 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.230
 pc player am and for pc that becomes 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:24.840
 on time at monday at 12 o'clock 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.980
 unlocked what I kind of stupid 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.480
 the console players already 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.299
 page no idea wednesday or something 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 first post your pictures and that the 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.160
 pc player now so punctually around 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.419
 monday in the 12 us can play if 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.980
 we are already there so I will 

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:39.419
 therefore also on Tuesday afternoon 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.980
 upload videos because I have on 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:42.389
 next day school and therefore which one 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.340
 12 and not what else but I believe you 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.540
 especially early on Tuesdays and 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.829
 yes i can not play this game sooner either 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
 I can not get rp 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.639
 changer wants to use that too risky for me 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.519
 and too cumbersome and therefore becomes 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.199
 It is now late on Tuesday 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.879
 afternoon was still in the diet so have it 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.519
 everything comes together so tuesday 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.780
 It will be the first one in the late afternoon 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.280
 give me a gameplay 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.500
 so come back to the 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.000
 tank so the higher the level of the tank 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.220
 the healthier will be the higher 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.440
 and thus his strength as a third 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.030
 cluster with the engineer and this one 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.829
 engineer offers the drill contactor and 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.139
 gets bonuspunkte so this 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.699
 industry so borer there's always something 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.829
 I also think I offered, I do not know 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.239
 More where the floor is, yes this 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.700
 comic device and that will always 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.039
 can provide protection and then too 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.760
 can fix and we can do one 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.720
 description is out 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.310
 yet that without one 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.560
 working drill very hard it 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.060
 for the team to survive so the 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.460
 Drill probably helps the team 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.930
 also and the more level the engineer 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.940
 deserves the better during his 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.760
 so the better the maintenance 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.900
 which repairs quasi and more efficiently 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.160
 it would probably be that and 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 fixed faster 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.010
 then I have the medic and 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.740
 its task is allied 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.480
 everyone can revive that 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.070
 player's player everyone can all 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.510
 but the medica never revives again 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.730
 revive very quickly 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.620
 which of course is practical and in 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.270
 the description stands if something goes wrong 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.500
 goes and it will go wrong is 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.330
 is to collect the shards at the end 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.130
 and the team to do battle again 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.990
 a good magic can be a battle 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.520
 decide yes and the abilities of the 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.440
 magic are that he can run faster 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.790
 and stronger powers so 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.370
 probably faster revival 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.530
 year has the higher its level 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.390
 So yes that's again this level 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.800
 system and at the end will be the 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:20.880
 The most successful teams will be the one 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.680
 variety of classes with 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.440
 different skills themselves 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.330
 Supplement yes that is usually 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.680
 so that's good if you have the 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.850
 skills in the different 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.860
 has skills and then 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.230
 complete and then give each one the tasks 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.490
 you can do well and with the 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.780
 sticks in mode will turn out to be four 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.040
 Players insist that we can do that 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.350
 whole with three different ones 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.330
 friends or play with three strangers 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.920
 and that it definitely is 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.020
 good if everyone is one of them 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.220
 Use it unless it gets any 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.900
 they give themselves a lot 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.460
 stand out because the most useful 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.470
 is and you give some class one 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.150
 actually not really that needs 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.380
 we will see times and is therefore 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.670
 the video now also over I believe 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.200
 this is the last video I have before 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.550
 So coal for the ghosts is coming up 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.720
 I was playing tomorrow 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.320
 I think no video more about it 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.640
 will do 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.170
 that means that we are at the 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.330
 Tuesday afternoon probably again 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:08.220
 see and yes I hope it has you 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.850
 I would like to be impressed 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.320
 still to be happy 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.320
 to report what is out today 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.040
 have to 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.380
 funny
