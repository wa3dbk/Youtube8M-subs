 this is the beginning of the work still 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.910
 but yeah, we work a lot 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890

 we already had a lot of fun so 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.940
 generally the pleasure is communicative 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.890

 attraction on the theme of minimoys 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.750
 since we really wanted to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.329
 make this partnership with luc besson 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.109
 europacorp the minimoys it's a very 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.640
 beautiful story I had it 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.660
 personally already seen in 2006 when the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 first movie was out 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.610
 I am ideas we want to be in 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.590
 the skin of the characters we want to 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 live his adventures the good there is everything 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.400
 little in this world is wondering how far 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.560

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 the ja for us fans decoration we're going 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.570
 things like that it's going to be really 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.939
 very impressive that you ask and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.799
 the mack family is having a system 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.030
 of transport there we will literally stole 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.130
 in the world of minimoys will pass 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 from one world to another to go to the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 treasure hunt luc besson saw it there 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.829
 advised you as you go 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.939
 told you two three little things 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 behind the scenes it happened 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.290
 how to it was really a very beautiful 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.570
 work we dreamed together I'm going 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.530
 present the general idea of ​​the project so 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.210
 to do more than just an attraction 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 since one has to the complete universe the village 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.140
 minimoys will be recreated with 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
 attractions and then I presented the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.500
 transport system that I put at 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.650
 point with society mc rise and by 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.630
 report to that 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.610
 he left he wrote the story the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.900
 treasure hunt he defined the 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.360
 characters with a tool without binding 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.100
 his decorator chef who gave me all 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.259
 the documents that were needed then he has 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.810
 did the sketches we made some 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.250
 scene in each scene and the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.990
 maintenance and realization so here 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.340
 it fits into the forest of tales of 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.550
 fairy we already opened in 2011 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.070
 and that we grew up in 2013 is to do 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.290
 pass timeless values ​​like 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.730
 the magic of being tiny in a world 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.260
 where everything big is like the respect of 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.610
 nature 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.910
 the values ​​of the family the most 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.550
 friends and those values ​​that we want 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.360
 convey to this attraction 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.490
