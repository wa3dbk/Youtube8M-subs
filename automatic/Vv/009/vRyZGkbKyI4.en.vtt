00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
better I noticed in middle school I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.780 
better I noticed in middle school I
broke<00:02:04.259> out<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.590> lot<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.829> my<00:02:05.040> forehead<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.579> I

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
broke out a lot on my forehead and I

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.580 
broke out a lot on my forehead and I
notice<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> reduction<00:02:06.780> in<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.190> and<00:02:08.190> then

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
notice the reduction in that and then

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.040 
notice the reduction in that and then
it<00:02:08.709> led<00:02:09.069> to<00:02:09.099> my<00:02:09.489> cheeks<00:02:09.879> in<00:02:10.149> high<00:02:10.330> school<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
it led to my cheeks in high school and

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.130 
it led to my cheeks in high school and
then<00:02:11.560> now<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.099> my<00:02:12.250> mid-20s<00:02:13.000> all<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.660> breakouts

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
then now in my mid-20s all the breakouts

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.740 
then now in my mid-20s all the breakouts
are<00:02:14.349> happening<00:02:14.950> again<00:02:15.430> on<00:02:15.700> my<00:02:15.940> chin<00:02:16.420> and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
are happening again on my chin and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.900 
are happening again on my chin and
sometimes<00:02:17.260> on<00:02:17.379> my<00:02:17.470> cheek<00:02:17.709> but<00:02:17.920> mainly<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.879> my

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
sometimes on my cheek but mainly on my

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.360 
sometimes on my cheek but mainly on my
chin<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.569> around<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.260> area<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> main

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
chin and around this area so the main

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.660 
chin and around this area so the main
reason<00:02:21.819> why<00:02:22.000> I<00:02:22.030> resulted<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:23.200> fading<00:02:23.620> cream<00:02:24.099> is

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
reason why I resulted to fading cream is

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.490 
reason why I resulted to fading cream is
because<00:02:25.090> I<00:02:25.209> have<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.629> little<00:02:25.690> dark<00:02:26.230> spot

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
because I have this little dark spot

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.400 
because I have this little dark spot
above<00:02:27.010> my<00:02:27.220> lips<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.599> driving<00:02:28.840> me<00:02:28.989> crazy

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
above my lips and it's driving me crazy

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.110 
above my lips and it's driving me crazy
because<00:02:29.620> every<00:02:30.040> time<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.250> try<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.430> conceal<00:02:30.849> it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
because every time I try to conceal it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.270 
because every time I try to conceal it
it<00:02:31.180> doesn't<00:02:31.690> really<00:02:31.840> conceal<00:02:32.379> properly<00:02:32.920> so

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
it doesn't really conceal properly so

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.699 
it doesn't really conceal properly so
when<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.090> had<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.629> pimple<00:02:35.019> D<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.200> kind<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.620> look

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
when I had that pimple D I kind of look

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.930 
when I had that pimple D I kind of look
like<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.890> was<00:02:35.980> picking<00:02:36.310> my<00:02:36.400> nose<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.790> whole

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
