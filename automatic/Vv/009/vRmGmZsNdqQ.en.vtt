00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.870
 they receive it they deliver it and with much calm 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.030
 without suffocation while we 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.190
 player our player is the one who 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.590
 we give them a warm hug I have a 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.700
 contest a tournament made 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.230
 to benefit television and so 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.390
 both the organization has been guaranteed 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.340
 that the teams that have more 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 probabilities of advancing are the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.059
 big teams that's why it's been located 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 a mexican team a team 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.190
 American as group heads of 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.200
 way they could never be eliminated 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.040
 in the first round a Mexican and a team 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.890
 American called major teams 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.660
 silver this will be the third participation 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.460
 of the estelí real in the concachampions 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.040
 but for the first time he will have four 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.980
 matches two of them at home we 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.990
 we are a country that enjoys very few 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.670
 international matches and have a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.670
 tigers of the national university 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.950
 autonoma of new lion 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.560
 it is an unprecedented fact then the 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.390
 draw leaves very bad to the real 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.759
 estelí with possibilities to classify 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.070
 but it leaves it very well stopped from the 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.740
 media aspect of this link then 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.020
 I insist he's going to fight in front of the league 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.490
 sports to cell must throw all there and 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.259
 more is going to be the most of all 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.180
 fundamental the two parties that are 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.920
 go play in the group stage home 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.960

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.030
 round trips and only 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.380
 a set of group classify 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.380
