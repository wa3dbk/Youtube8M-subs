going to call it London because we're in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.130 
going to call it London because we're in
London<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:17.100> basically<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.970> on<00:00:18.180> way<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.480> 28

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
London but basically we're on way of 28

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.599 
London but basically we're on way of 28
I<00:00:19.170> was<00:00:19.350> just<00:00:19.439> playing<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> mate<00:00:20.130> is

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I was just playing with a mate is

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.490 
I was just playing with a mate is
actually<00:00:21.359> probably<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> funnest

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actually probably one of the funnest

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.040 
actually probably one of the funnest
maps<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.100> think<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.640> do<00:00:23.850> especially<00:00:24.539> when

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
maps I think you can do especially when

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.570 
maps I think you can do especially when
you<00:00:25.140> know<00:00:25.170> what<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.470> doing<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:26.250> was<00:00:26.400> only

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
you know what you're doing this was only

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.220 
you know what you're doing this was only
one<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.240> first<00:00:27.449> times<00:00:27.630> I've<00:00:27.869> played<00:00:28.080> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
one of the first times I've played this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
one of the first times I've played this
map<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.769> think<00:00:29.220> he<00:00:29.369> played<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.880> couple<00:00:30.060> more

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
map I think he played it a couple more

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.690 
map I think he played it a couple more
times<00:00:30.480> than<00:00:30.720> me<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.769> it's<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> really

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
times than me but it's just a really

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.630 
times than me but it's just a really
fairly<00:00:33.480> intense<00:00:34.200> pretty<00:00:34.590> epic<00:00:34.739> gameplay<00:00:35.460> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
fairly intense pretty epic gameplay that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
fairly intense pretty epic gameplay that
I<00:00:35.700> thought<00:00:35.910> I'd<00:00:36.030> bring<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> guys<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:37.440> actually

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
I thought I'd bring you guys we actually

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.520 
I thought I'd bring you guys we actually
get<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.250> around<00:00:38.579> 30<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.510> then<00:00:40.140> everything

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
get to around 30 and then everything

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.280 
get to around 30 and then everything
goes<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:40.890> bit<00:00:41.190> pear-shaped<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.750> sort<00:00:43.200> of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
goes a bit pear-shaped and we sort of

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.770 
goes a bit pear-shaped and we sort of
lose<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.280> composure<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.360> much<00:00:45.420> died

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
lose your composure and pretty much died

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.920 
lose your composure and pretty much died
but<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:47.010> last<00:00:47.370> few<00:00:47.640> minutes<00:00:47.850> these<00:00:48.660> are

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
but are those last few minutes these are

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.049 
but are those last few minutes these are
pretty<00:00:49.260> epic<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.340> you're<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> be

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
pretty epic and you're going to be

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.110 
pretty epic and you're going to be
seeing<00:00:51.270> some<00:00:51.570> our<00:00:51.719> great<00:00:52.050> plays<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.640> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
seeing some our great plays I think in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.779 
seeing some our great plays I think in
the<00:00:54.239> last<00:00:54.390> few<00:00:54.690> minutes<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> basically<00:00:56.670> our

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the last few minutes so basically our

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.170 
the last few minutes so basically our
strategy<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:58.140> stay<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.100> sort<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
strategy is to stay in this sort of I

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
strategy is to stay in this sort of I
know<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> call<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.320> sort<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.800> tunnel

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
know what you call this sort of tunnel
thing<00:01:02.129> leads<00:01:02.820> down<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> train<00:01:03.510> station

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
thing leads down to the train station

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.530 
thing leads down to the train station
and<00:01:04.500> basically<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.640> want<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.390> wanna

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
guns there and basically you just hold

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.060 
guns there and basically you just hold
out<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.210> area<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.860> probably

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
out in that area and this it's probably

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.359 
out in that area and this it's probably
one<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.820> easiest<00:01:44.899> areas<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.409> sort<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.159> hold

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
one of the easiest areas to sort of hold

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
one of the easiest areas to sort of hold
down<00:01:47.610> because<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.810> air<00:01:49.079> support<00:01:49.560> can't<00:01:49.829> get

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
down because the air support can't get

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.410 
down because the air support can't get
you<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.399> you're<00:01:50.790> fully<00:01:51.000> enclosed

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
you because you're fully enclosed

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.450 
you because you're fully enclosed
there's<00:01:51.750> no<00:01:51.869> windows<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.530> anything<00:01:52.590> there<00:01:53.159> and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there's no windows or anything there and

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.859 
there's no windows or anything there and
when<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.149> need<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.420> take<00:01:54.570> out<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
when you need to take out the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.300 
when you need to take out the
helicopters<00:01:55.500> like<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> just<00:01:56.009> run

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
helicopters like that you just run

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.359 
helicopters like that you just run
outside<00:01:56.490> unit<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.180> worse<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:57.930> a

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
outside unit to the worse so it's a

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.149 
outside unit to the worse so it's a
fairly<00:01:59.369> easy<00:01:59.790> just<00:02:00.180> refuel<00:02:00.689> your<00:02:00.719> ammo<00:02:01.170> I'd

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
fairly easy just refuel your ammo I'd

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.399 
fairly easy just refuel your ammo I'd
recommend<00:02:02.520> having<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.930> gun<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.320> I'm

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
recommend having this this gun that I'm

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.089 
recommend having this this gun that I'm
using<00:02:04.590> at<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> moment<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.360> also<00:02:06.360> having

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:07.099 
using at the moment and also having

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.969 
using at the moment and also having
maybe<00:02:08.099> an<00:02:08.220> RPG<00:02:09.000> or<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.720> sort<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.410> light<00:02:10.619> machine

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
maybe an RPG or a sort of light machine

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.440 
maybe an RPG or a sort of light machine
gun

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
gun

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.199 
gun
I<00:02:11.480> think<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.410> that's<00:02:13.310> really<00:02:13.430> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> be

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
I think and that's really going to be

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.089 
I think and that's really going to be
what<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.599> want<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.840> keep<00:02:15.020> throughout<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
what you want to keep throughout the

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.600 
what you want to keep throughout the
whole<00:02:16.250> game<00:02:16.930> American<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.140> ACR<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.099> probably

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
whole game American this ACR is probably

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.199 
whole game American this ACR is probably
one<00:02:19.879> of<00:02:19.910> the<00:02:20.060> best<00:02:20.420> weapons<00:02:21.519> sort<00:02:22.519> of<00:02:22.640> compared

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
one of the best weapons sort of compared

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.350 
one of the best weapons sort of compared
on<00:02:23.390> accuracy<00:02:24.080> damage<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.790> quickly<00:02:26.120> it

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
on accuracy damage how quickly it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.259 
on accuracy damage how quickly it
reloads<00:02:26.810> instead<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.500> its<00:02:27.680> ammo<00:02:27.980> capacity

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
reloads instead of its ammo capacity

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.170 
reloads instead of its ammo capacity
it's<00:02:29.269> probably<00:02:29.890> one<00:02:30.890> of<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.099> most<00:02:31.340> useful

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
it's probably one of the most useful

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.330 
it's probably one of the most useful
weapons<00:02:32.750> in<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.050> game<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:34.010> i<00:02:34.040> definitely

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
weapons in the game so i definitely

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.580 
weapons in the game so i definitely
recommend<00:02:34.700> using<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:35.420> as<00:02:35.660> I<00:02:35.810> just<00:02:35.989> readjust

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
recommend using that as I just readjust

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.839 
recommend using that as I just readjust
these<00:02:36.890> totes<00:02:37.160> because<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.459> couldn't<00:02:37.700> get

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
these totes because I couldn't get

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.940 
these totes because I couldn't get
through<00:02:38.090> I'm<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.019> can<00:02:39.200> see<00:02:39.500> we've<00:02:39.709> bought

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
through I'm you can see we've bought

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.250 
through I'm you can see we've bought
think<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.790> bought<00:02:41.000> them<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.360> Delta<00:02:41.720> Squad<00:02:42.049> or

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
think I bought them the Delta Squad or

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.860 
think I bought them the Delta Squad or
the<00:02:42.349> riot<00:02:42.590> squad<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.280> they're<00:02:44.209> they're<00:02:44.720> not

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the riot squad and they're they're not

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.170 
the riot squad and they're they're not
really<00:02:45.170> that<00:02:45.290> helpful<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:46.519> this<00:02:46.700> strategy

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
really that helpful in this strategy

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.630 
really that helpful in this strategy
they<00:02:47.450> are<00:02:47.660> in<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.959> lot<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.200> other<00:02:48.349> maps<00:02:48.650> they

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
they are in a lot of other maps they

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.100 
they are in a lot of other maps they
didn't<00:02:49.910> seem<00:02:50.060> to<00:02:50.180> be<00:02:50.269> doing<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.569> lot<00:02:50.599> nothing

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
didn't seem to be doing a lot nothing

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.770 
didn't seem to be doing a lot nothing
that<00:02:51.260> we<00:02:51.380> couldn't<00:02:51.920> do<00:02:52.040> already<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.269> that's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that we couldn't do already so that's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.050 
that we couldn't do already so that's
why<00:02:54.049> they<00:02:54.500> weren't<00:02:54.739> too<00:02:54.980> helpful<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.910> you'll

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
why they weren't too helpful and you'll

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.910 
why they weren't too helpful and you'll
see<00:02:56.209> towards<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.780> end<00:02:56.989> they<00:02:57.380> are<00:02:57.500> pretty<00:02:57.680> much

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
see towards the end they are pretty much

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.650 
see towards the end they are pretty much
absolutely<00:02:58.400> useless<00:02:58.880> they<00:02:59.269> just<00:02:59.480> sort<00:02:59.599> of

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
absolutely useless they just sort of

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.199 
absolutely useless they just sort of

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
gameplay you guys will see in a few

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.059 
gameplay you guys will see in a few
minutes<00:03:11.299> sort<00:03:12.260> of<00:03:12.319> running<00:03:12.590> around<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.860> map

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
minutes sort of running around the map

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.280 
minutes sort of running around the map
everyone's<00:03:13.489> getting<00:03:13.610> down<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.599> reviving

each<00:03:15.380> other<00:03:15.620> and<00:03:15.950> one<00:03:16.549> thing<00:03:16.760> I<00:03:16.880> dislike<00:03:17.420> about

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
each other and one thing I dislike about

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.750 
each other and one thing I dislike about
survival<00:03:18.440> mode<00:03:18.620> although<00:03:18.859> it's<00:03:19.250> growing<00:03:19.670> on

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
survival mode although it's growing on

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.400 
survival mode although it's growing on
me<00:03:19.819> it's<00:03:20.060> definitely<00:03:20.420> a<00:03:20.450> great<00:03:20.630> game<00:03:20.900> mode<00:03:21.139> and

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
me it's definitely a great game mode and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.809 
me it's definitely a great game mode and
going<00:03:21.650> to<00:03:21.709> be<00:03:21.829> bringing<00:03:22.069> quite<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> few<00:03:22.700> more

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
going to be bringing quite a few more

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.789 
going to be bringing quite a few more
videos<00:03:23.180> in<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.750> future<00:03:23.780> throughout<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.590> year

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
videos in the future throughout the year

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.670 
videos in the future throughout the year
but<00:03:25.010> um<00:03:25.819> one<00:03:26.389> thing<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.750> does<00:03:26.989> annoy<00:03:27.319> me<00:03:27.500> is

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
but um one thing that does annoy me is

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.180 
but um one thing that does annoy me is
when<00:03:28.609> your<00:03:29.120> teammate<00:03:29.540> goes<00:03:29.780> down<00:03:30.170> if<00:03:30.980> you

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
when your teammate goes down if you

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.920 
when your teammate goes down if you
don't<00:03:31.220> revive<00:03:31.670> them<00:03:31.880> in<00:03:32.030> time<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> game<00:03:32.600> ends

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
don't revive them in time the game ends

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780 
don't revive them in time the game ends
whereas<00:03:33.410> in<00:03:33.560> zombies<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.220> would<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.400> play

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
whereas in zombies it would just play

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.940 
whereas in zombies it would just play
like<00:03:34.989> single<00:03:35.989> player<00:03:36.170> so<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.530> could<00:03:36.799> just

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
like single player so you could just

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.759 
like single player so you could just
finish<00:03:37.220> off<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.609> mission<00:03:37.790> I<00:03:38.090> think<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:39.049> is<00:03:39.500> a

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
finish off the mission I think that is a

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.410 
finish off the mission I think that is a
pretty<00:03:40.100> dumb<00:03:40.549> move<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:43.609> does<00:03:43.970> ruin

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
pretty dumb move because it does ruin

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.940 
pretty dumb move because it does ruin
the<00:03:44.690> fun<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.900> little<00:03:45.079> bit<00:03:45.290> because<00:03:45.440> as<00:03:45.769> you<00:03:45.889> can

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:45.950 
the fun a little bit because as you can

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.250 
the fun a little bit because as you can
see<00:03:46.069> I've<00:03:46.340> only<00:03:46.459> got<00:03:46.670> 30<00:03:47.000> seconds<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.690> reviving

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
see I've only got 30 seconds to reviving

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.479 
see I've only got 30 seconds to reviving
so<00:03:48.470> if<00:03:48.530> he's<00:03:48.709> all<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:48.950> way<00:03:49.069> on<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.220> other<00:03:49.340> side

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
so if he's all the way on the other side

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.879 
so if he's all the way on the other side
of<00:03:49.700> map<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.239> may<00:03:50.600> not<00:03:50.750> even<00:03:50.930> make<00:03:51.079> there<00:03:51.530> in<00:03:51.680> time

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:51.889 
of map I may not even make there in time

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.550 
of map I may not even make there in time
so<00:03:52.250> keep<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.269> 30<00:03:53.480> seconds<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.109> once<00:03:54.319> they

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
so keep the 30 seconds but once they

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.819 
so keep the 30 seconds but once they
that<00:03:55.340> 30-second<00:03:56.060> timer<00:03:56.269> runs<00:03:56.569> out<00:03:56.840> you<00:03:57.590> want

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
that 30-second timer runs out you want

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.080 
that 30-second timer runs out you want
to<00:03:57.920> our<00:03:58.900> don't<00:03:59.900> want<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.170> just<00:04:00.290> end<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.709> game

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
to our don't want to just end the game

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.699 
to our don't want to just end the game
so<00:04:02.090> I<00:04:02.120> think<00:04:02.359> that<00:04:02.540> was<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.780> bit<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.109> a<00:04:03.200> bad<00:04:03.380> move

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
so I think that was a bit of a bad move

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.129 
so I think that was a bit of a bad move
from<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:04.790> creators<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.389> modern<00:04:05.810> warfare<00:04:05.989> 3

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
from the creators of modern warfare 3

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:08.199 
from the creators of modern warfare 3
but<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.829> guess<00:04:07.099> maybe<00:04:07.549> they'll<00:04:07.819> patch<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.150> in

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
but I guess maybe they'll patch it in

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.300 
but I guess maybe they'll patch it in
the<00:04:08.359> future<00:04:08.690> but<00:04:08.840> ID<00:04:09.019> at<00:04:09.230> it<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.560> think<00:04:10.130> that's

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
the future but ID at it I think that's

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.680 
the future but ID at it I think that's
just<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.639> way<00:04:10.730> they<00:04:10.880> wanted<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.359> be<00:04:11.510> but

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
just the way they wanted it to be but

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.050 
just the way they wanted it to be but
it's<00:04:12.319> definitely<00:04:12.530> a<00:04:12.769> really<00:04:13.069> fun<00:04:13.459> map<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:13.940> I'd

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
it's definitely a really fun map and I'd

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.909 
it's definitely a really fun map and I'd
suggest<00:04:14.510> you<00:04:14.630> guys<00:04:14.780> try<00:04:15.079> this<00:04:15.139> strategy<00:04:15.769> yeah

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
suggest you guys try this strategy yeah

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.400 
suggest you guys try this strategy yeah
it's<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.729> lot<00:04:17.000> of<00:04:17.030> fun<00:04:17.180> and<00:04:17.630> it<00:04:17.989> really<00:04:18.200> makes

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
it's a lot of fun and it really makes

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.399 
it's a lot of fun and it really makes
survival<00:04:19.479> sort<00:04:20.479> of<00:04:20.570> a<00:04:20.750> bit<00:04:20.900> more<00:04:21.019> enjoyable

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
survival sort of a bit more enjoyable

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:23.080 
survival sort of a bit more enjoyable
than<00:04:21.769> when<00:04:21.919> you<00:04:22.010> play<00:04:22.250> solo<00:04:22.610> or<00:04:22.789> whatever

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
than when you play solo or whatever

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.150 
than when you play solo or whatever
definitely<00:04:23.840> get<00:04:23.930> a<00:04:23.990> maid<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.289> and<00:04:24.650> you<00:04:24.740> can

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
definitely get a maid in and you can

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.910 
definitely get a maid in and you can
have<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.520> bit<00:04:25.700> of<00:04:25.730> fun<00:04:25.820> doing<00:04:26.210> it<00:04:26.390> that<00:04:26.540> way<00:04:26.570> and

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
have a bit of fun doing it that way and

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.790 
have a bit of fun doing it that way and
so<00:04:27.920> by<00:04:28.190> this<00:04:28.250> round<00:04:28.820> is<00:04:29.090> like<00:04:29.540> pretty<00:04:30.380> much<00:04:30.470> air

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
so by this round is like pretty much air

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.220 
so by this round is like pretty much air
support<00:04:31.190> every<00:04:31.550> wave<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.210> that's<00:04:32.960> why<00:04:33.170> you

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
support every wave so that's why you

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.900 
support every wave so that's why you
have<00:04:33.440> your<00:04:33.470> ACR<00:04:34.130> something<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.730> you<00:04:34.790> can

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
have your ACR something that you can

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.300 
have your ACR something that you can
take<00:04:35.090> it<00:04:35.240> down<00:04:35.270> with<00:04:35.630> fairly<00:04:35.900> quickly<00:04:36.230> and<00:04:36.680> as

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
take it down with fairly quickly and as

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.510 
take it down with fairly quickly and as
soon<00:04:37.460> as<00:04:37.550> you<00:04:37.640> do<00:04:37.790> just<00:04:38.060> refuel<00:04:38.600> your<00:04:38.630> mo<00:04:39.520> but

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
soon as you do just refuel your mo but

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.340 
soon as you do just refuel your mo but
so<00:04:40.670> pretty<00:04:40.880> much<00:04:41.030> now<00:04:41.270> as<00:04:41.390> I'm<00:04:41.690> about<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:42.080> skip

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
so pretty much now as I'm about to skip

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.310 
so pretty much now as I'm about to skip
ahead<00:04:42.500> to<00:04:42.890> about<00:04:43.340> rap<00:04:43.580> wave<00:04:43.880> 30<00:04:44.270> or<00:04:44.600> 31<00:04:45.080> or

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
ahead to about rap wave 30 or 31 or

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.650 
ahead to about rap wave 30 or 31 or
wherever<00:04:45.560> it<00:04:45.710> was<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:46.820> is<00:04:47.000> where<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.300> starts

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
wherever it was this is where it starts

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.000 
wherever it was this is where it starts
getting<00:04:47.720> intense<00:04:48.320> because<00:04:48.530> we<00:04:48.710> get<00:04:48.830> some

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
getting intense because we get some

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.000 
getting intense because we get some
juggernaut<00:04:49.460> dudes<00:04:49.790> sort<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.740> spawning<00:04:51.740> in

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
juggernaut dudes sort of spawning in

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:54.340 
juggernaut dudes sort of spawning in
from<00:04:52.220> everywhere<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:53.270> you'll<00:04:53.960> see<00:04:54.170> what<00:04:54.290> I

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
from everywhere and you'll see what I

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.140 
from everywhere and you'll see what I
mean<00:04:54.410> in<00:04:54.650> a<00:04:54.710> sec<00:04:54.950> when<00:04:55.100> I<00:04:55.190> start<00:04:55.520> the<00:04:55.640> next<00:04:55.790> part

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
mean in a sec when I start the next part

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.200 
mean in a sec when I start the next part
which<00:04:56.390> is<00:04:56.660> right<00:04:57.020> now<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:58.160> I<00:04:58.670> just<00:04:58.700> gets

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
which is right now and I just gets

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.300 
which is right now and I just gets
really<00:04:59.690> really<00:05:00.140> intense<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.860> see<00:05:01.040> under<00:05:01.220> way

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
really really intense so see under way

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.810 
really really intense so see under way
of<00:05:01.370> 29<00:05:01.850> got<00:05:02.750> my<00:05:02.870> predator<00:05:03.230> ice<00:05:04.070> I<00:05:04.310> just<00:05:04.580> check

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
of 29 got my predator ice I just check

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.820 
of 29 got my predator ice I just check
it<00:05:05.000> out<00:05:05.090> what's<00:05:05.270> going<00:05:05.510> on<00:05:05.630> here<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.470> can<00:05:06.620> see

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
it out what's going on here we can see

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.530 
it out what's going on here we can see
that<00:05:06.980> big<00:05:07.220> force<00:05:07.550> through<00:05:08.090> there's<00:05:08.420> like

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
that big force through there's like

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.120 
that big force through there's like
three<00:05:08.870> of<00:05:08.900> them<00:05:09.170> and<00:05:09.410> then<00:05:09.620> there's<00:05:09.800> three

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
three of them and then there's three
