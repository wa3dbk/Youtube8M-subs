how you got around these recorded via

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.099 
how you got around these recorded via
component<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.420> there's<00:03:39.690> no<00:03:39.870> way<00:03:40.049> to

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
component because there's no way to

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.909 
component because there's no way to
enforce<00:03:40.500> HDCP<00:03:41.370> via<00:03:41.639> component<00:03:42.269> and<00:03:42.739> you<00:03:43.739> know

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
that's why when I hook on my ps3 to my

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.500 
that's why when I hook on my ps3 to my
Elgato<00:03:46.530> I<00:03:47.040> hook<00:03:47.549> it<00:03:47.669> up<00:03:47.790> via<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.000> component

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
Elgato I hook it up via the component
