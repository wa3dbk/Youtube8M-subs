00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the concept when we first started

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
the concept when we first started
talking<00:00:28.680> about<00:00:29.130> beauty<00:00:29.490> Mart<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> idea

of<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.590> probably<00:00:32.550> three<00:00:32.850> or<00:00:32.910> four

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
of it it was probably three or four

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.740 
of it it was probably three or four
years<00:00:33.180> ago<00:00:33.780> Milly<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:35.120> been<00:00:36.120> friends<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
years ago Milly and I been friends for a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.209 
years ago Milly and I been friends for a
long<00:00:36.780> time<00:00:37.200> we've<00:00:37.469> known<00:00:37.680> each<00:00:37.829> other<00:00:37.980> since

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
long time we've known each other since

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
long time we've known each other since
the<00:00:38.460> early<00:00:38.579> 90s<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.420> both<00:00:39.660> worked<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
the early 90s we both worked in the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.110 
the early 90s we both worked in the
industry<00:00:40.320> for<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.829> long<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.550> think<00:00:41.850> what<00:00:41.969> we

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
industry for a long time I think what we

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.180 
industry for a long time I think what we
realized<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.750> was<00:00:42.870> post<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> recession<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
realized it was post the recession and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
realized it was post the recession and
women<00:00:44.610> had<00:00:44.820> started<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> celebrate<00:00:46.230> buying

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
women had started to celebrate buying

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
women had started to celebrate buying
less<00:00:47.730> expensive<00:00:48.390> more<00:00:48.629> massive<00:00:48.960> price

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
less expensive more massive price

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.810 
less expensive more massive price
products<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> say<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> understood<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.670> value

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
products to say and understood the value

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.580 
products to say and understood the value
of<00:00:51.000> them<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.750> not<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.289> stopped

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
of them it's not that they stopped

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
of them it's not that they stopped
buying<00:00:52.890> premium<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.789> they<00:00:54.059> were<00:00:54.360> shopping<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
buying premium but they were shopping a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
buying premium but they were shopping a
much<00:00:55.530> broader<00:00:55.860> market<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.180> they<00:00:57.300> were

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
much broader market so they were

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.779 
much broader market so they were
shopping<00:00:57.629> high<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> low<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.039> nobody<00:00:59.640> was

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
shopping high and low and nobody was

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.520 
shopping high and low and nobody was
selling<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.780> beauty<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.260> we

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
selling like this in beauty and we

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.830 
selling like this in beauty and we
realized<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.850> an<00:01:03.570> opportunity

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
realized that there was an opportunity

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.590 
realized that there was an opportunity
there<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.309> very<00:01:05.369> much<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.760> selection<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
there so it's very much a selection of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.710 
there so it's very much a selection of
the<00:01:06.810> best<00:01:07.610> from<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> brands<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.510> don't

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the best from the brands so we don't

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
the best from the brands so we don't
have<00:01:09.990> an<00:01:10.170> entire<00:01:10.560> range<00:01:10.830> from<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.130> brand<00:01:11.369> we
