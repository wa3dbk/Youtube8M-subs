00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.860
 hello I am oceanerosemarie said the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 invisible lesbian since I wrote 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.460
 a show called the lesbian 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.040
 invisible that I play for three years 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.660
 and a half now which is so a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.160
 show that tells the story of 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.210
 this young lesbian that no one 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.879
 believe when she says she is 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.239
 lesbian and more widely it was for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.760
 speak 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.309
 here are lesbians explain a little 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.199
 Female homosexuality with straight 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.580
 that's all you always have 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.070
 wanted to know about lesbians without 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.970
 never have dared to ask 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.140
 obviously offered to lesbians a 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.510
 show they can 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
 identify themselves and who is reviewing a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.350
 little any clichÃ©s what I call 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.539
 benevolent homophobia even though it's 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.860
 a bit of a paradox to say all 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.239
 things that we face in 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.309
 as a lesbian in our life 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.380
 daily 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.310
 today I am more than 500 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.780
 dates 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.640
 I started in Paris in a very small 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.130
 theater called the last one I did 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.780
 all year 2011 at the gym and then 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.720
 now here I am going to play at the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.130
 cicada sold out on March 9th and the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.340
 tour continues here and we will go out 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.090
 a DVD during the year the DVD of the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.830
 show and so bajeux let's say I 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.020
 be part of the people who here that gives 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.490
 a little talk to lesbians mats 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.950
 in the shadow that we never see and 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:43.209
 all of a sudden bomb to whom to tell a 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:45.549
 little their life so I support the 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.479
 candidacy of gay games in paris en 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.399
 2018 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.229
 because I think that's the sport 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.670
 it's a bit like humor in some 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.830
 good share even if the humor is a small 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.200
 a little less tiring but it's a way 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.080
 of effective enough to fight against the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.509
 discrimination and having seen all we could 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.490
 see in France lately with 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.130
 the manifs of the people who were 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.149
 against marriage for all 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.470
 today the pma who is still not 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.780
 past etc 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.290
 I think it's good to lead the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.840
 maximum of actions that who fights 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.720
 homophobia and that gives messages 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.850
 positive and gives visibility 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.230
 to homosexuals in all areas 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.230
 understood the sport obviously
