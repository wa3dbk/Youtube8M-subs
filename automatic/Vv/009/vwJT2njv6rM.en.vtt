in<00:00:06.190> this<00:00:07.090> session<00:00:07.300> we'll<00:00:07.630> cover<00:00:07.900> two<00:00:08.350> types<00:00:08.680> of

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
in this session we'll cover two types of

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.820 
in this session we'll cover two types of
finite<00:00:09.100> state<00:00:09.340> machines<00:00:09.820> mealy<00:00:10.540> and<00:00:10.660> Moore<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
finite state machines mealy and Moore to

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.260 
finite state machines mealy and Moore to
understand<00:00:12.309> the<00:00:12.400> difference<00:00:12.730> we<00:00:12.850> have<00:00:13.090> to

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
understand the difference we have to

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.320 
understand the difference we have to
introduce<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.660> concept<00:00:13.809> of<00:00:14.380> machine<00:00:14.769> output

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
introduce the concept of machine output

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.339 
introduce the concept of machine output
mealy<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.480> find<00:00:16.660> its<00:00:16.810> output<00:00:17.170> on<00:00:17.260> the

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
mealy to find its output on the

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.350 
mealy to find its output on the
transition<00:00:17.950> whereas<00:00:18.550> Moore<00:00:18.880> defines<00:00:19.210> it

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:19.360 
transition whereas Moore defines it

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.440 
transition whereas Moore defines it
inside<00:00:19.810> the<00:00:20.020> state<00:00:20.290> but<00:00:21.070> what<00:00:22.029> exactly<00:00:22.119> does

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
inside the state but what exactly does

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.030 
inside the state but what exactly does
that<00:00:22.570> mean<00:00:22.750> and<00:00:23.230> what<00:00:23.770> are<00:00:23.860> the<00:00:23.919> repercussions

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
that mean and what are the repercussions

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.210 
that mean and what are the repercussions
of<00:00:24.669> choosing<00:00:25.000> one<00:00:25.150> over<00:00:25.180> the<00:00:25.509> other<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:27.099> is<00:00:27.189> a

doing<00:01:06.640> something<00:01:06.850> different<00:01:07.659> when<00:01:07.780> it's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
doing something different when it's

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.859 
doing something different when it's
heating<00:01:08.380> versus<00:01:08.799> when<00:01:08.979> it's<00:01:09.009> idling<00:01:09.729> so<00:01:10.270> let's

heating versus when it's idling so let's

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.190 
heating versus when it's idling so let's
add<00:01:11.049> that<00:01:11.350> information<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:12.039> the<00:01:12.130> diagram<00:01:13.200> when

add that information to the diagram when

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.809 
add that information to the diagram when
you<00:01:14.289> express<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.890> behavior<00:01:15.249> of<00:01:15.340> a<00:01:15.399> system
