00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.430
 welcome to the first future in eels of the year 2013 containing the 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.290
 ajax match against FC Volendam her that concerned the 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.010
 practice game due to bad weather 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.010
 but of course there was a minute's silence beforehand 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.239
 eyi the silence on the gentlemen of course 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.119
 the deceased honorary member included schoevaart sir wimke schoevaart 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.529
 do the match yourself for match here with the first chances of the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.860
 competition for that set left bazur 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.760
 and then the second chance immediately after that, many lindsey collapsed 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.970
 Volendam makes it well away 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.650
 bazur so arrived from psv 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
 may only play exhibition games for the time being 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.530
 is such a moment when he can participate 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.310
 this is branco van den boomen 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.060
 two well done like that of the trees twitter just in front 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.420
 some nice attacks 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 He also became a slender business and Ronald de Boer 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.760
 at how many matches are they present 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.810
 that is the one role in making the basics beautiful of bazoer and finishing 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.510
 jordi bitter there is also a very neat 4 what offers 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.760
 this theme 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.060
 had some injuries in recent years 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.140
 now I was in the peak agenda in the team of alfons groenendijk and kenneth 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.340
 perez very quickly when the liquid see more often he is doing the right thing 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.890
 on klinsi many 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.030
 who took care of the 2 0 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.720
 unnecessary to lay down many but choose 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 just shoot yourself in and that was a good choice 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.799
 Volendam then get a chance to be exact but that one 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.120
 is easily caught by keeper peter leeuwenburgh 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.310
 they see him back to this summary and for the rest it was 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.070
 especially the attack of ajax 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.820
 what the clock was here unfortunately something with a pass on twitter that turned well 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.580
 away 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.580
 and there it is 3 0 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.950
 well done from white 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.209
 it appears from Saturday played again 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.359
 here he is again at the ball 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.149
 bazoer 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:18.129
 and then just 4 lindsey crowd 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.220
 but they grow and the right leg turns and shoots and neatly inside 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.229
 4 0 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.719
 then it is not even resting unfortunately something for example still has a chance 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.859
 boban lazic sees 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.149
 but this time 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 what is the goal of volendam an obstacle sc 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.469
 then the second half with a free kick of cherry germ the substitute's header 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.469
 other substitute tom noordhoff 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.519
 but he just headed next 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.359
 in the second half, ajax actually played better than the first half 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.750
 never or does he play a third of the match in this field 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 and so it is 5 0 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.709
 4 tbsp hassnaoui well done 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.709
 but misses 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.459
 after one of ajax 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.539
 the following week Tuesday 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.929
 the last match in the group stage of the match in series is now playing one 

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:25.759
 has a good warm-up with the last chance of the last match 

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:26.159
 something 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.689
 it is and remains a painful 5 0 for it against Volendam
