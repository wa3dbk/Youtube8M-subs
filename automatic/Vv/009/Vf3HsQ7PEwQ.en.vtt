00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:11.110
 Crossfader is one of the visualization solutions 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:16.450
 Augmented Reality ar is an iphone app that maps maps to ar maps 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:20.140
 I developed an upgrade version reverse request 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:26.280
 This map app looks on the bottom half of the screen on the ground 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.280
 The map is projected there and the image is displayed on the upper half 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:38.200
 Especially iphone 5 even map 8 ios standard map 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:43.570
 Or it is something you can use in the field from google map 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:50.830
 As for version 1.4, if you support the English version, it will support English 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:54.880
 But first one point after the eyes and eh usually a certain map itself and when it built the device 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:55.750
 It becomes a mechanism to switch from the perr mode to the map mode when it is defeated 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.940
 but 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.659
 By displaying a tag called ar tag pasted on the destination on the video 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:10.299
 It makes the navigation more visible 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:13.299
 In the new version, the camera 's power is turned off except when in ar mode. 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.200
 Consumption is being reduced 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:22.780
 In addition, when you fix iphone with ク リ で etc. and install it 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 It is also possible to make settings such that the mode does not change when it is raised or lowered 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.090
 Well there is a map 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.469
 And now it consists of basically Hano three modes 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:40.360
 Basically, in the map mode 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:44.920
 You can if you use I received grandson used as an ordinary map of plane 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.940
 For example, what kind of thing there is around my current location in the neighborhood search 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:54.730
 I can continue something like restaurant information or hotel information 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:59.560
 A lot of pins will fall when we search in and try to list this inspection result well 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:00.350
 The list mode is also well prepared, and I use them roughly 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.130
 So normal cheese 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:11.150
 Well, I can do it as a function, but more 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:13.960
 Ask if there is a by holding the actual device at the time of when the say when and lower in doubt from there 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:18.700
 In fact the peripheral mode 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:23.720
 Things like say that can be confirmed by checking a certain 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.050
 Well , if you still get lost in a good position, make a friend here 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:31.300
 To by, for example, send 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.040
 To the point where you can really get help, what can be done as a part of it 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.689
 It has become 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:42.090
 Since the future ar map in the cross-fader than iphone by resistance even 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:48.569
 We are planning to add other paid optional features as well. 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:51.019
 Also we plan to also promoted the expansion of information for which there is a lot of information is still insufficient areas in foreign countries 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.019
 is
