00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.750
 a new video and today I bring 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.279
 this piece of my tree that good use what 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.800
 you can call tree house like 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.960
 want but basically this house is 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.660
 based on what has been the house of 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.190
 a well-known youtuber more than everything is 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.039
 what is being North America is 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.570
 say usa which is called captain is 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.250
 partners that is a player of 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.590
 minecraft to her very famous dress in 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.210
 youtube that I like a lot in 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.430
 the videos that this does is that this 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.890
 house is recreated because I do not know if 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.929
 he did it I do not know if it's represented 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.300
 some way for him but the fact is 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.460
 that this house bears his name 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.129
 good tree house and well as you can see 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.659
 is that is that that huge thing that I 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.609
 I'm here climbed on a piece of 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:54.829
 platform what does bother me a 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.300
 little bit good to me that is to hear that is 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 recording is the fact that the 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.460
 lighting then of what has been 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.499
 the house does not finish me 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.510
 convince because it does not look very good 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.860
 really you will enter and then 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.510
 they will see it perfect because you 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.000
 just do not enter to play then a 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.460
 second that sometimes to the tablet you 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.320
 an attack of epilepsy comes and it is us 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.079
 super weird happened a shattered motorcycle 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.090
 videos as if there was not a tomorrow and 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.990
 basically this would be what comes 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.090
 being the rise to the house as it returns 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 is that it is huge apart that I love 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.619

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.990
 Well, as you can see, it's decorated with 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.659

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.259
