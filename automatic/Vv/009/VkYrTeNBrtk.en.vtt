 hello well we have authorial all 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.640
 I will teach how to install the tools daemon 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.020
 for windows 8 well the first thing that 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.169
 we have to do is go to the link of the 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.260
 description and you have already downloaded the 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:33.550
 file will not appreciate the installer will 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.550
 let's double click 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.180
 and start opening the installer 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.880
 we hope to be 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.880
 even check the system 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.470
 following 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.700
 except 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.700
 in free license 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.770
 following 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.130
 here we will see a file that says 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.049
 where we want the shortcuts 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.049
 let's give him the three popcorn 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690
 do not know next 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.119
 and here we are going to remove the popcorn 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.080
 because we do not want that software and 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.960
 additional 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.320
 williams to remove again the 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.320
 Popcorn 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 and install 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.650
 we wait for him to install 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.090
 the previous popcorn were words 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.680
 additional software to this program 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.190
 that usually 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.940
 It's good for nothing but good 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.940
 we wait for it to be installed 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.940
 once I have one we are going to give 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.940
 run from monster I'll use finish 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.530
 We hope to install the unit 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.530
 virtual site 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:47.180
 we hope and as you can see already detected 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.730
 the scary virtual tray would be all 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.130
 very simple we can add our 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.230
 iso file 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.230
 in this case I do not have files here 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.540
 but I would be ready to open 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.400
