00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
banned I think maybe because of the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.819 
banned I think maybe because of the
trolling<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.560> something<00:02:01.560> you

me<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.520> feel<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.600> could<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.869> been<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.890> I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
me I feel like it could have been the I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
me I feel like it could have been the I
have<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:09.750> main<00:02:10.020> reasons<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.590> mine<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.950> one

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
have two main reasons in mine and one

have two main reasons in mine and one
which<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> reason<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.360> was

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
which I think the reason was was

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.510 
which I think the reason was was
when<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> lost<00:02:14.130> my<00:02:15.230> milestone<00:02:16.230> Ovechkin<00:02:17.040> if<00:02:17.340> you

probably all on the month exactly I got
banned<00:03:33.600> and<00:03:34.050> I<00:03:35.330> because<00:03:36.330> I<00:03:36.480> started<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.960> new

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
banned and I because I started the new

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.510 
banned and I because I started the new
account<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.830> could<00:03:38.040> have<00:03:38.070> been<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.280> reason

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
account that could have been a reason

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.030 
account that could have been a reason
but<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:38.940> thing<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:40.020> got<00:03:40.260> lost<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.920> it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
but the thing is it got lost and it

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.710 
but the thing is it got lost and it
should<00:03:41.220> have<00:03:41.310> been<00:03:41.430> under<00:03:41.670> match<00:03:41.880> account<00:03:42.240> so

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
should have been under match account so

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.870 
should have been under match account so
I<00:03:42.750> send<00:03:43.080> them<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.560> like<00:03:43.709> cuz<00:03:43.950> what<00:03:44.730> was

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
I send them that like cuz what was

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.160 
I send them that like cuz what was
happening<00:03:45.270> the<00:03:45.360> trade<00:03:45.600> didn't<00:03:45.870> go<00:03:45.959> high

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
happening the trade didn't go high

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.930 
happening the trade didn't go high
enough<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:47.190> just<00:03:47.310> gonna<00:03:47.430> send<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.850> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
enough so I was just gonna send it to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.360 
enough so I was just gonna send it to
him<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.270> had<00:03:48.420> him<00:03:48.660> send<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.020> a<00:03:49.140> safe<00:03:49.320> trade<00:03:49.650> so<00:03:50.340> I

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
him I had him send in a safe trade so I

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.020 
him I had him send in a safe trade so I
just<00:03:50.670> accepted<00:03:51.120> his<00:03:51.330> trade<00:03:51.630> and<00:03:52.070> not<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.820> so

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
just accepted his trade and not like so

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.340 
just accepted his trade and not like so
cuz<00:03:54.270> the<00:03:54.390> bidding<00:03:54.600> wasn't<00:03:54.870> going<00:03:55.020> high<00:03:55.110> enough

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
cuz the bidding wasn't going high enough

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350 
cuz the bidding wasn't going high enough
right<00:03:55.560> so<00:03:55.800> he<00:03:56.550> would<00:03:56.670> get<00:03:56.820> him<00:03:56.940> then<00:03:57.090> he'd<00:03:57.209> said

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
right so he would get him then he'd said

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.750 
right so he would get him then he'd said
them<00:03:57.450> back<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.780> I<00:03:57.810> list<00:03:58.050> him<00:03:58.170> again<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:59.640> that

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
them back and I list him again so that

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.190 
them back and I list him again so that
was<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.940> plan<00:04:00.090> but<00:04:00.150> he<00:04:00.450> never<00:04:00.660> got<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.020> card

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
was the plan but he never got the card

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.470
