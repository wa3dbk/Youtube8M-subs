asking me about how do I start

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.490 
asking me about how do I start
developing<00:00:14.240> pic<00:00:14.510> speed<00:00:14.750> or<00:00:14.900> how<00:00:15.020> do<00:00:15.380> I<00:00:15.440> get

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
developing pic speed or how do I get

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.240 
developing pic speed or how do I get
faster<00:00:16.040> at<00:00:16.280> picking<00:00:17.260> so<00:00:18.260> what<00:00:18.830> we're<00:00:18.950> gonna<00:00:19.040> do

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
faster at picking so what we're gonna do

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.680 
faster at picking so what we're gonna do
is<00:00:19.490> we're<00:00:19.640> gonna<00:00:19.700> take<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:19.940> look<00:00:20.150> at<00:00:20.270> the<00:00:20.360> first

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
is we're gonna take a look at the first

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.170 
is we're gonna take a look at the first
step<00:00:21.290> to<00:00:21.740> starting<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.430> be<00:00:22.550> able<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.820> pick

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
step to starting to be able to pick

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.170 
step to starting to be able to pick
faster<00:00:23.960> and<00:00:24.200> what<00:00:25.040> we're<00:00:25.160> gonna<00:00:25.250> do<00:00:25.430> is<00:00:25.640> focus

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
faster and what we're gonna do is focus

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.830 
faster and what we're gonna do is focus
on<00:00:26.860> picking<00:00:27.860> on<00:00:28.009> just<00:00:28.550> one<00:00:29.150> string<00:00:29.599> we're

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
on picking on just one string we're

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.150 
on picking on just one string we're
gonna<00:00:29.960> look<00:00:30.020> at<00:00:30.169> some<00:00:30.320> technique<00:00:30.710> things<00:00:30.950> for

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
gonna look at some technique things for

and guidelines for you to start
developing<00:00:35.540> your<00:00:35.989> picking<00:00:36.290> because<00:00:36.410> if<00:00:36.770> you

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
developing your picking because if you

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.950 
developing your picking because if you
want<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.340> be<00:00:37.460> able<00:00:37.610> to<00:00:37.670> pick<00:00:37.880> best<00:00:38.150> throughout

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
want to be able to pick best throughout

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.889 
want to be able to pick best throughout
a<00:00:38.989> scale<00:00:39.410> or<00:00:39.770> a<00:00:40.460> lake<00:00:40.790> or<00:00:40.940> something<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:41.750> you

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
a scale or a lake or something if you

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.139 
a scale or a lake or something if you
can't<00:00:42.079> pick<00:00:42.289> fast<00:00:43.100> on<00:00:43.370> one<00:00:43.640> single<00:00:43.820> string

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:44.149 
can't pick fast on one single string

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:45.189 
can't pick fast on one single string
there's<00:00:44.359> no<00:00:44.510> way<00:00:44.660> you're<00:00:44.780> gonna<00:00:44.870> be<00:00:45.020> able<00:00:45.079> to

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
there's no way you're gonna be able to

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.410 
there's no way you're gonna be able to
pick<00:00:45.379> fast<00:00:46.160> throughout<00:00:46.489> a<00:00:46.550> scale<00:00:46.879> or<00:00:46.910> lick<00:00:47.300> or

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
pick fast throughout a scale or lick or

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.660 
pick fast throughout a scale or lick or
anything<00:00:47.600> like<00:00:47.809> that<00:00:47.870> so<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:49.280> simple

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
anything like that so the simple

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.279 
anything like that so the simple
exercise<00:00:50.149> what<00:00:50.510> we're<00:00:50.629> gonna<00:00:50.719> do<00:00:50.930> is<00:00:51.079> pick

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
exercise what we're gonna do is pick

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:59.830 
exercise what we're gonna do is pick
just<00:00:51.590> on<00:00:51.829> one<00:00:52.640> string<00:00:58.149> like<00:00:59.149> that<00:00:59.179> and<00:00:59.600> then

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
just on one string like that and then

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.229 
just on one string like that and then
we're<00:01:00.230> gonna<00:01:00.350> move<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.800> on<00:01:01.010> all<00:01:01.429> to<00:01:01.820> all<00:01:01.910> six

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
we're gonna move that on all to all six

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.720 
we're gonna move that on all to all six
strings<00:01:02.420> because<00:01:03.019> each<00:01:03.440> string<00:01:04.040> feels

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
strings because each string feels

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.460 
strings because each string feels
different<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.300> thickness<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:05.870> different<00:01:06.320> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
different the thickness is different and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.750 
different the thickness is different and
the<00:01:06.560> tension<00:01:06.920> is<00:01:07.040> a<00:01:07.070> little<00:01:07.340> bit<00:01:07.430> different<00:01:07.700> on

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
the tension is a little bit different on

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.550 
the tension is a little bit different on
each<00:01:07.910> one<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:08.390> it<00:01:08.480> feels<00:01:08.690> different<00:01:08.900> from<00:01:09.350> one

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
each one so it feels different from one

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.690 
each one so it feels different from one
to<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.710> other<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.070> have<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.310> kind<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.520> get

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
to the other you have to kind of get

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.780 
to the other you have to kind of get
good<00:01:10.850> at<00:01:11.090> picking<00:01:11.840> on<00:01:12.200> each<00:01:13.010> individual

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
good at picking on each individual

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.429 
good at picking on each individual
string<00:01:14.090> so<00:01:14.420> we're<00:01:14.900> going<00:01:14.990> to<00:01:15.079> go<00:01:15.140> through<00:01:15.320> this

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
string so we're going to go through this

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:16.840 
string so we're going to go through this
with<00:01:15.680> just<00:01:15.829> one<00:01:16.100> string<00:01:16.400> but<00:01:16.640> you're<00:01:16.729> gonna

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
with just one string but you're gonna

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.789 
with just one string but you're gonna
want<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.119> move<00:01:17.299> it<00:01:17.479> around<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:18.350> each<00:01:18.500> other

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
want to move it around to each other

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.679 
want to move it around to each other
individual<00:01:19.369> string<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.850> when<00:01:20.030> I<00:01:20.060> practice

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
individual string and when I practice

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.270 
individual string and when I practice
this<00:01:20.900> if<00:01:21.110> I<00:01:21.170> have<00:01:21.320> it<00:01:21.470> like<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.619> picking<00:01:22.130> day

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
this if I have it like a picking day

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.429 
this if I have it like a picking day
I'll<00:01:22.909> spend<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.299> 5<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.689> 10<00:01:23.869> minutes<00:01:24.140> on<00:01:24.259> each

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
I'll spend a 5 to 10 minutes on each

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.620 
I'll spend a 5 to 10 minutes on each
string<00:01:24.740> I'll<00:01:24.950> work<00:01:25.640> on<00:01:25.790> picking<00:01:25.939> fast<00:01:26.299> on<00:01:26.540> my

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
string I'll work on picking fast on my

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.749 
string I'll work on picking fast on my
high<00:01:26.810> E<00:01:26.840> string<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.860> I'll<00:01:28.040> move<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.310> my<00:01:28.490> B

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
high E string and I'll move to my B

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.010 
high E string and I'll move to my B
string<00:01:29.119> try<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:29.600> again

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
string try it again

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.690 
string try it again
move<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.530> my<00:01:30.619> g<00:01:30.799> strings<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.340> all<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.640> way

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
move to my g strings and all the way

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.289 
move to my g strings and all the way
down<00:01:31.939> to<00:01:32.360> my<00:01:32.479> 6th<00:01:33.020> string<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.460> let's<00:01:34.970> split<00:01:35.149> the

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
down to my 6th string so let's split the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.690 
down to my 6th string so let's split the
difference<00:01:35.329> go<00:01:35.990> with<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.229> g<00:01:36.470> string<00:01:36.860> and<00:01:37.100> you

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
difference go with the g string and you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.090 
difference go with the g string and you
can<00:01:37.880> thread<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.509> note<00:01:38.689> on<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.930> string<00:01:39.259> or<00:01:39.890> you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
can thread a note on that string or you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.389 
can thread a note on that string or you
can<00:01:40.219> mute<00:01:40.490> it<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.909> can<00:01:41.570> do<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:41.689> open<00:01:42.020> I<00:01:42.770> like<00:01:43.189> to

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
can mute it I can do it open I like to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.090 
can mute it I can do it open I like to
just<00:01:43.850> prep<00:01:44.149> one<00:01:44.360> let's<00:01:44.600> say<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.590> 9th<00:01:45.770> fret<00:01:46.009> on

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
just prep one let's say the 9th fret on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.200 
just prep one let's say the 9th fret on
the<00:01:46.219> g<00:01:46.430> string<00:01:48.610> one<00:01:49.610> thing<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.000> want<00:01:50.149> to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
the g string one thing that you want to

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
fast is to relax that's probably one of

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:57.039 
fast is to relax that's probably one of
the<00:01:55.159> biggest<00:01:55.549> factors<00:01:55.729> and<00:01:56.479> being<00:01:56.780> able<00:01:56.899> to

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049

there and that is the grip that I prefer
now<00:02:12.350> some<00:02:12.680> people<00:02:12.920> may<00:02:13.100> have<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.280> grip<00:02:13.550> that's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
now some people may have a grip that's

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.480 
now some people may have a grip that's
more<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.000> this<00:02:14.470> with<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.010> picked<00:02:16.250> laying

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
across their finger like that and that's

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.290 
across their finger like that and that's
really<00:02:19.280> up<00:02:19.610> to<00:02:19.640> you<00:02:19.790> you're<00:02:19.970> gonna<00:02:20.060> have<00:02:20.239> to

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
but I like the kind of pointing at my

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.930 
but I like the kind of pointing at my
guitar<00:02:25.590> method<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.040> works<00:02:26.220> best<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.580> me<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:26.820> I

off relax and then start again another

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.350 
off relax and then start again another
thing<00:02:50.220> you'll<00:02:50.370> notice<00:02:50.550> is<00:02:50.760> most<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.270> the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
thing you'll notice is most of the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
thing you'll notice is most of the
motion<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:51.990> picking<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.070> doing<00:02:53.190> is

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
motion for the picking that I'm doing is

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.740 
motion for the picking that I'm doing is
coming<00:02:53.760> from<00:02:53.970> my<00:02:54.390> wrist<00:02:56.030> not<00:02:57.030> my<00:02:57.330> elbow<00:02:57.720> like

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
coming from my wrist not my elbow like

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.110 
coming from my wrist not my elbow like
this<00:03:01.340> there's<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.430> couple<00:03:02.550> reasons<00:03:02.790> for<00:03:02.970> that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
this there's a couple reasons for that

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.900 
this there's a couple reasons for that
one<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.860> biggest<00:03:05.070> reason<00:03:05.580> is<00:03:05.670> because

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
one the biggest reason is because

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730 
one the biggest reason is because
playing<00:03:06.390> with<00:03:06.870> your<00:03:06.990> elbow<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.470> after

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
playing with your elbow like that after

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.410 
playing with your elbow like that after
a<00:03:07.770> while<00:03:07.920> starts<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.460> hurt<00:03:08.640> you<00:03:09.150> can<00:03:09.270> get<00:03:09.390> a

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
a while starts to hurt you can get a

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.850 
a while starts to hurt you can get a
tendinitis<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.230> stuff<00:03:10.500> like<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.740> in<00:03:10.800> your

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
tendinitis and stuff like that in your

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.980 
tendinitis and stuff like that in your
elbow<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.280> really<00:03:11.670> recommend<00:03:11.790> getting<00:03:12.780> most

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
elbow so I really recommend getting most

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.950 
elbow so I really recommend getting most
of<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.230> motion<00:03:13.560> from<00:03:13.620> your<00:03:13.830> picking<00:03:14.960> from

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
of the motion from your picking from

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.960 
of the motion from your picking from
your<00:03:16.170> wrist<00:03:16.500> or<00:03:16.740> kind<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.400> a<00:03:17.490> combination<00:03:17.670> of

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
your wrist or kind of a combination of

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:27.550 
your wrist or kind of a combination of
your<00:03:18.120> wrists<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.450> your<00:03:18.510> fingers

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.590

really the first step to being able to
pick<00:04:56.040> fast<00:04:56.400> through<00:04:56.760> scales<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.480> licks<00:04:57.690> and
