00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.719
 Hello and welcome here 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.209
 are includes hardware and software 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.990
 reviews I welcome you today to one 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.789
 new video 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.289
 Today I want to show you the 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:24.080
 Differences between ewg x650 the ibu 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.829
 superclocked version and the normal one 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.289
 budget 650 ti right in the picture then the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.550
 puff superclocked version 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.400
 you can also see here already a 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.530
 difference and that the construction in the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:40.070
 case, this graphics card is just as big 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.440
 that's how the 660 ti is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.989
 the first feature are the dimensions 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.969
 different otherwise in the rest 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.730
 Here are the orange marked fields 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.680
 the differences between the two cards 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.239
 I shocked the whole thing so much 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.390
 that I'm the most important here 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.820
 data is for example the gpu-tact is 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.730
 in the boost super person works like 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:05.000
 the name already says 1072 of course higher 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.120
 megahertz at the normal 650 ti are 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.340
 it only 9 128 meters 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.430
 as the name suggests , the had 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.040
 boost version then the penalty clock what the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.180
 other graphics cards from the 660 ti 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.759
 respectively 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.040
 So the 650 de has the normal one 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.110
 not the shader clock is too 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.420
 slightly increased and the memory 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.210
 relationships of the store act amounts 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.430
 then effectively at 6008 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.600
 megahertz at the conscious superclocked 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.170
 person and both normal only at 5400 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.030
 meter 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.930
 the memory connection has also 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.600
 increased to 192 bits at normal 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.969
 128 bit else you can 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.310
 like the rest of the data here 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.770
 and read what you might still 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.479
 should know the maximum number of 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.390
 Monitors is at the super clock 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.329
 version 4 monitor at the normal are 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.939
 Note 3 both cards must be over 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.250
 powered by a 6 pin pci power connector 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:08.390
 and the whole thing is a recommendation 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.390
 from the manufacturer of 400 to 450 watts like that 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.730
 as a test system for yes this video have 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.069
 I had a computer here and 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:21.799
 though an i5 2500k a gigabyte z68 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.329
 eight gigabytes of RAM as well 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:29.060
 then the new GLGT x6 50i in the bus's 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:33.079
 super klopp a 24 inch monitor 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.450
 windows 7 64bit sp1 and the here 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:38.480
 tested games you can see dania tomb 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.159
 raider battlefield 3 before cry and crysis 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.060
 I think that's a good choice 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.930
 play 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.400
 the whole paired with two 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.049
 alternatively graphics cards you then the same 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.120
 See the attitude of the hit 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.579
 been in the games in series then in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.950
 the diagram if there is not something 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.900
 I'm not a gambler and have one 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.760
 Little to see, I am so up to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.169
 date as far as this attitude is concerned 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.629
 I've then had only briefly literate 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.349
 and the whole time tested what's there 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.269
 possible before 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.500
 otherwise I would be happy if you 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.659
 the whole thing stays on now 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.310
 look at the video in the end one 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.569
 thumb up and sometimes in the 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.829
 Video description comes by 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.599
 maybe not yet 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.370
 commented and maybe also 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.930
 recommend and if you like it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.540
 if you have a new audience here 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.699
 you're just an abo too 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.629
 then have fun on the course of the videos and 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:25.629
 yes until next time
