that I planed down to about an eighth of

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.689 
that I planed down to about an eighth of
an<00:00:21.840> inch<00:00:21.960> thick<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.590> largest<00:00:23.130> width<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
so I ripped both of these boards to 2

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.230 
so I ripped both of these boards to 2
and<00:00:28.140> 3/4<00:00:28.949> inch<00:00:29.189> just<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.760> give<00:00:29.910> me<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> little

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and 3/4 inch just to give me a little

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.120 
and 3/4 inch just to give me a little
extra<00:00:30.570> room<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.779> cut<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.529> need<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> cut<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
extra room to cut out I need to cut a

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.240 
extra room to cut out I need to cut a
narrow<00:00:32.730> shallow<00:00:33.360> groove<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.230> each<00:00:34.620> side<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
narrow shallow groove on each side of

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
narrow shallow groove on each side of
one<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.760> boards<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.440> I'm

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
one of these boards and to do that I'm

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
one of these boards and to do that I'm
just<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> use<00:00:38.129> my<00:00:38.160> drill<00:00:38.760> press<00:00:38.790> because

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
just going to use my drill press because

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
just going to use my drill press because
I<00:00:39.540> don't<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.870> bit<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.500> my<00:00:40.649> router<00:00:40.920> that's

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
I don't have a bit for my router that's

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.360 
I don't have a bit for my router that's
any<00:00:41.430> smaller<00:00:41.790> than<00:00:42.059> an<00:00:42.180> eighth<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> an<00:00:42.600> inch<00:00:46.370> so

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
any smaller than an eighth of an inch so

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
any smaller than an eighth of an inch so
that<00:00:47.460> works<00:00:47.640> out<00:00:47.789> pretty<00:00:48.030> well<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.360> I'm

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that works out pretty well and I'm

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
that works out pretty well and I'm
stopping<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> cut<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> couple<00:00:50.370> inches<00:00:50.520> before

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
stopping the cut a couple inches before

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.860 
stopping the cut a couple inches before
the<00:00:51.149> end<00:00:51.390> I<00:00:52.280> just<00:00:53.280> need<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> clean<00:00:54.390> them<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the end I just need to clean them up a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.119

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
slot that connects this group to this

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
slot that connects this group to this
group<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.280> all<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> way<00:01:02.699> through<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> wood

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
group going all the way through the wood

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.100 
of glue I just don't want the glue to go
down<00:01:23.549> into<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.150> grooves

knot<00:02:08.440> onto<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.580> and<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.210> just<00:02:10.479> drew<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.810> line

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
knot onto that and I just drew a line

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.140 
knot onto that and I just drew a line
here<00:02:11.560> where<00:02:11.770> it<00:02:11.890> kind<00:02:12.100> of<00:02:12.190> intersects<00:02:12.700> I've

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
here where it kind of intersects I've

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.090 
here where it kind of intersects I've
cut<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.630> couple<00:02:13.750> more<00:02:14.320> strips<00:02:14.710> of<00:02:14.890> wood

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
cut out a couple more strips of wood

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.130 
cut out a couple more strips of wood
that<00:02:15.310> I'm<00:02:15.400> just<00:02:15.610> going<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.760> glue<00:02:16.030> on<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.870> these

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
that I'm just going to glue on to these

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.010 
that I'm just going to glue on to these
sides<00:02:17.590> so<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.490> just<00:02:18.640> making<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:19.030> little<00:02:19.180> box<00:02:19.600> up

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
sides so I'm just making a little box up

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.190 
sides so I'm just making a little box up
here<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.760> I'll<00:02:21.910> clamp<00:02:22.210> this<00:02:22.510> together<00:02:22.960> with

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
here and I'll clamp this together with

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:42.120 
here and I'll clamp this together with
rubber<00:02:23.500> bands

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.510 

I<00:02:42.190> have<00:02:43.030> some<00:02:43.210> elastic<00:02:43.630> cord<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:45.070> I'm<00:02:45.340> going

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
I have some elastic cord that I'm going

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.280 
I have some elastic cord that I'm going
to<00:02:45.550> just<00:02:45.700> thread<00:02:45.970> all<00:02:46.300> the<00:02:46.330> way<00:02:46.570> through<00:02:46.690> and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
to just thread all the way through and

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:59.700 
to just thread all the way through and
back<00:02:47.560> up<00:02:57.210> now<00:02:58.210> here's<00:02:58.420> why<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.570> cut<00:02:58.960> that<00:02:59.140> slot

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
back up now here's why I cut that slot

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.530 
back up now here's why I cut that slot
it's<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.310> can<00:03:00.550> send<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.970> cord<00:03:01.270> through

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
it's so that I can send the cord through

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.680 
it's so that I can send the cord through
on<00:03:01.720> this<00:03:02.050> side<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.880> grab<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:04.540> I'll

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
on this side and grab it and then I'll

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.930 
on this side and grab it and then I'll
be<00:03:04.870> able<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.230> put<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.530> back<00:03:05.740> through<00:03:06.250> this

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
be able to put it back through this

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:21.540 
be able to put it back through this
other<00:03:07.180> hole<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:19.530> got<00:03:20.530> plenty<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.860> extra<00:03:21.160> cord

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550
