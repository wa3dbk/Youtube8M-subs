00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.910
 not quiet quiet 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.929
 good teacher first thing is that 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.270
 reflections teachings of this party 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.700
 in Brazil 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.940
 good afternoon, good I think it's a 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.410
 very match 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.860
 the complex easy to comment for some 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.860
 plays 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.540
 that marked the development of the game 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.570
 but very difficult to analyze it 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.940
 elaborating a bit on my answer 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.430
 I want to say that normally when one 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.160
 plays possession of the ball in Brazil 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.800
 it's between 60 and 70 percent a 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.680
 favor of the Brazilian locals and in 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.290
 this opportunity was basically that 60 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.000
 40 in favor of national and the second 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:01.880
 time 65 35 or almost 70 30 then I 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.309
 I think that in terms of ownership the team 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.440
 he had it but we lacked effectiveness in the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.550
 banks we missed what I was and 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.729
 it was determination and good 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.600
 selection in the last 30 meters I 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.229
 I think when the game was 1 to 0 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.000
 with a goal that is still very controversial 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.299
 we have the penalty 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.670
 in everyone's opinion a clear penalty 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.259
 against fernando and starting the second 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.700
 time we have to the minute of the of 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.159
 Orlando to tie the game and 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.800
 surely seeing has been very different 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.640
 however, it was not like that 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.800
 we gave them opportunity to 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.860
 return to the pal pal and the second 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.020
 goal I think a mistake 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.620
 It corresponded to Orlando because he can 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.780
 happen to anyone and that is very difficult 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.330
 individualize the errors and simply 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.030
 say that when we had it, no, no, 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.460
 we take advantage and now to try how 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.380
 today to improve in three aspects 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.220
 fundamental for that effectiveness 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.410
 Become part of the behavior 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.280
 of the team and is that in the past 30 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.580
 meters we have to 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.709
 achieve or half instance or actions 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.709
 combinativas or duels 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.330
 if he gave me what I said before the game 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.710
 of fire in brazil for the party 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:35.710
 against city we made a decision very 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.360
 very difficult and was to 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.880
 d 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.890
 put to travel to Orlando and Juan David 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.850
 knowing that we did not have strikers for 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 the game against entity thinking about 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.010
 save them that game in saving them for 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.280
 the refresh that having them fresh for the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.260
 Tuesday match and obviously against 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.930
 the one that could no longer be nor louis parents 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
 neither nor nor wilder who have been very 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.710
 important to us then 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.720
 undoubtedly yes, but nevertheless 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.400
 you have to face the tournament like 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.640
 it corresponds and good and fortunately 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.870
 louis trained today and wilder i think 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.870
 to be with us soon 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.140
 very good I think it's very positive 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.860
 by national well- deserved by part of 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.080
 them because there are both stephanie and 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.880
 alexander are already going through a very 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.750
 good time and I think more than 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.750
 deserved called 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.210
 it makes an important game 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.770
 Yesterday I am moving the game a bit 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.090
 as always very good team with very 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.090
 good good front flyers 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.050
 and a solid defensive line then I 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.050
 I believe that 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.670
 Hernán 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.370
 with enough experience in the 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.810
 Colombian know how to face this game and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.280
 surely to do very difficult to 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.040
 we as all have been 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.989
 matches previously with Pedro with 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.989
 with hernán and everyone 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:17.459
 not very difficult I think that in so little 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.769
 time for for an opinion apart from 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.420
 that's just the match shot 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.420
 yesterday I have not seen the other games 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:34.599
 I do not think that as we live in 

00:04:32.589 --> 00:04:37.479
 South American Cup at the time 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.899
 we said was to finish how strong 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.809
 is the group mentally and xd in the 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:45.339
 character to overcome already 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.769
 we'll look at what the group's reaction is 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:49.419
 but what affects affects logical but 

00:04:47.769 --> 00:04:52.899
 we know that professional football and that 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.209
 this is not again of not losing but of 

00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:56.679
 stop not falling is to stand and 

00:04:55.209 --> 00:04:59.279
 to stand fast and I think that the 

00:04:56.679 --> 00:04:59.279
 team is going to do it 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:07.239
 well I think that 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.840
 it's opinions not 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.160
 I prefer to rely on good 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.440
 reactions that the group has had the year 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.690
 happened when we needed it 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.640
 we did this year after having 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.150
 left out the losing super league 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.060
 the box we went to have won here 10 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.520
 but losing the penalty kick went 34 days 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.390
 then we played a great game here 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.860
 I believe that the team is capable of 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.370
 do it hopefully we can show it 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.370
 again 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.890
 ten days 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.890
 the four parties because 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.860
 oh how good is hard if above all 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.750
 that now apart related is going to 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.730
 estefanía and alexander and well deserved 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.250
 as I said earlier and very good for 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.800
 them but we will be left unprotected 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.360
 then to try to rotate again 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.220
 all the payroll and that all the boys 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.840
 take advantage of this opportunity and we 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.840
 contribute to continue up in the table 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.530
 good luis had to travel 

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:19.000
 to solve something familiar and Orlando 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:21.340
 he had a little discomfort in him 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.410
 in the hamstring I understand the 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:27.570
 game in brazil then for precaution 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.570
 we can rest
