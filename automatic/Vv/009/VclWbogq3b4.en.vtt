00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 a chocolate mousse recipe 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.900
 but not just any 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.540
 famous chocolate mousse recipe 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.759
 that you see for 40 years behind 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.090
 your nestle chocolate chip 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.419
 dessert and for this recipe we have everything 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.669
 simply need 6th of the tablets of 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.309
 chocolate nestle dessert and a pinch 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.800
 of salt first of all let's do 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 melt our chocolate in a bain-marie for 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.739
 that breaks and the tablet into squares and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:53.429
 arrange them in a Pyrex salad bowl 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:56.190
 for example once the chocolate is 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.199
 broken into quarters and arrange them on a 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.870
 pot of boiling water that you 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.069
 then shudder to 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.120
 to be able to melt it gently 

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:05.120
 for five minutes 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.030
 meanwhile we're going to separate the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 whites of the yellows and we put them each 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 in a different container I you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.700
 advise to take large salad bowl 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.620
 since in a year we will mount the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.630
 white in snow and in the other we go 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.330
 to make the mixture of the foam and it is necessary 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.820
 so also a large container mix 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.250
 Gently pinch is added as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.170
 in the snow whites and we 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.220
 whips with a fake electric up 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.420
 what they become well done them 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.460
 whites in snow will be perfect 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.350
 when they are firm but 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.330
 when they hold high salat says 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.060
 demonstration now we will 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.540
 to be able to mix our chocolate that has 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.610

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.270

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.080
 bain marie 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.420
 if you use a bowl made 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.979
 be careful to put manic when 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.599

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.599
