00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.020

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.310
 anime base or icopor a pattern of 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.790
 our snowflake that we are going to 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.820
 Make a paint kitchen grater 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:36.120

 electric anime pieces brush 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.960
 and pencil 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.660
 let's transfer our snowflake 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.660
 to the anime base 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.739
 transferring this snowflake measured 15 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.899
 centimeters in diameter but we can 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.899
 elaborate the size that we of 100 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.830
 we will see all our piece 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.750
 to then cut with our cutter 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.750
 anime electric 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.110
 then transfer and with the before with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.560
 marker with what we have in that 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.560
 moment 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.120
 the toco helps us to elaborate more for 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.690
 decorate our parties our 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.690
 events 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.840
 we will work all our little anime 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.700
 now let's cut back with our 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 cutter bore coporo 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.259
 or trimming like that along the entire shore 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.509
 where we transfer this cut what 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.149
 can get in stationery bookstore or 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.469
 craft stores 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.740
 remember that it is called anime cutter 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.880
 electric manual 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.880
 they can get it 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.060
 see and transfer all my snowflake 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.160
 snow to our base of ccoo's soul 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.270
 it will not remain this way for the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.130
 people who find it difficult 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.740
 get the anime cutter too 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.110
 can cut it with exact or cutter 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.180
 that I have met in other countries now 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.760
 let's proceed to perform the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.650
 textured for our coconut like 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.900
 legitimate we're going to need a radio 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.300
 cook a kitchen grater and a piece 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.910
 of anime on this side we are going to grate 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.750
 our anime in this way and it's going to 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.800
 stay like this 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.800
 it will not be like that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.129
 or scratching the amount we find the 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.230
 quantity that we need according to the size 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.849
 of the piece this is the texturing is not going 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.079
 to stay like this 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.700
 in this case the goby sar of color 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.549
 white because I'm going to make a snowflake 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.889
 snow but stylized or anime 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.109
 has already scratched what we can paint as 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:54.629
 we do the blank here we put 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.299
 just a few drops of cold paint 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.799
 of the color that we are going to work you 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.349
 we put a drop of this and go 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.389
 moving the bag and take the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.709
 tone we want 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.930
 Let's start, I'll do it 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.329
 white because as you indicated is a little 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.230
 of snow is a very beautiful technique and 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.060
 easy to make 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.800
 first we have to take our codend 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.360
 of snow that we previously cut 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.909
 in anime of ciborium and we put painting 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.040
 to the cold so you can stick in 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.860
 our textures are going to place 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.740
 quickie a lot because this 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.660
 is going to be the glue of our textured 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.640
 We are not going to place white like I am 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.340
 saying I'm working a snowflake 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.630
 snow this is a very beautiful technique 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.890
 these flakes are used to decorate 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.990
 our spaces in our parties 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.970
 we can stick it to the wall we can 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.950
 hang to the ceiling really that is very 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.050
 cute to decorate our pacifier in 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.050
 our centerpieces is quite 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.240
 Useful and practical and with few materials 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.910
 to elaborate I know that all the leaves 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.709
 you can realize remember not to stop 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.470
 why not get the anime cutter 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.270
 use exact or cutter to be able 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.910
 cut out your pieces 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.740
 we already put a lot of it too 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.290
 we can place it on the sides as 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.140
 we said where we put the 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.730
 painting there is going to hit the anime 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.610
 lined 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.700
 I already put all our paint now 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.190
 we take our striped line 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.110
 we throw enough amount on top of 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.710
 the piece does not matter that it's going to cover 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.570
 the whole piece 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.660
 and place where we call places 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.340
 painting was going to be stuck and I covered 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.680
 I think all white 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.170
 we'll have to wait two or three minutes 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.070
 that this complained seal the textured 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.070
 of the girl 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.900
 past and after 2 minutes we will remove 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.470
 the surplus of the grated anime of the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.140
 figure 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 we take our codend and we remove it here 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.360
 same in the bag where we already have the 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.360
 striped anime 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.830
 we can also remove it on top of the 

00:05:01.119 --> 00:05:04.899
 cardboard or the newspaper where we are 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.439
 working that does not matter we're going to 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:10.539
 remove a little the striped anime so that 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:14.559
 can see how we have our snowflake 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:16.029
 textured we remove a little more that does not 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:18.129
 is going to take off do not worry no 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:19.899
 feel afraid that it will take off because 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.779
 It will look good, see how it will look 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:24.759
 our textured snowflake and see 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:27.639
 if it was drying little by little it's getting closer 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.709
 more look how beautiful a difference looks 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.469
 when we have the texturing and when 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:34.389
 we do not have the textured snowflake is a 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:37.209
 very beautiful technique are a little bit too 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.490
 cute as I indicated you can place 

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.949
 cold paint around and also you 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.839
 we place the striped anime where 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.969
 you want to place them then place 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:47.949
 we can expect that this dry well 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.369
 part and we can also be placed by 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:53.229
 the back if we are going to hang the 

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:55.149
 cube so that it is not textured by 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.099
 both sides if we're going to hit the 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:59.289
 we only leave it like this because of this 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.190
