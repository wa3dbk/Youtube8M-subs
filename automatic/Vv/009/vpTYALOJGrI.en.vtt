the<00:03:21.410> next<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.010> think<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.430> think<00:03:22.700> one<00:03:22.849> into

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
the next one I think I think one into

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.370 
the next one I think I think one into
space<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:25.120> promise<00:03:26.120> you<00:03:26.270> it's<00:03:26.510> not<00:03:26.630> launched

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
space I promise you it's not launched

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.820 
space I promise you it's not launched
into<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.770> stratosphere<00:03:32.590> yep

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
into the stratosphere yep

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.479 
into the stratosphere yep
that's<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.489> record<00:03:34.640> I<00:03:39.040> guess<00:03:40.040> we'll<00:03:40.220> never<00:03:40.340> know

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
that's a record I guess we'll never know

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.220 
that's a record I guess we'll never know
how<00:03:40.730> far<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.000> tennis<00:03:41.390> ball<00:03:41.420> win<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:41.989> without

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
how far that tennis ball win it without

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.620 
how far that tennis ball win it without
a<00:03:42.410> sight<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.069> fast<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.030> far<00:03:48.760> well<00:03:49.760> maybe<00:03:50.390> we'll

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
a sight so fast so far well maybe we'll

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.120 
a sight so fast so far well maybe we'll
try<00:03:50.870> that<00:03:50.900> again<00:03:51.200> sometime
