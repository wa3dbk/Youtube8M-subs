00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
my original concepts very rough sketch

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.719 
my original concepts very rough sketch
here<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.050> was<00:02:02.039> supposed<00:02:02.550> to<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:03.000> brick<00:02:03.840> detail

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
here I was supposed to have brick detail

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.400 
here I was supposed to have brick detail
but<00:02:05.729> when<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:05.910> tried<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:06.539> I<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.899> couldn't<00:02:07.200> fit

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
but when I tried it I just couldn't fit

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.699 
but when I tried it I just couldn't fit
enough<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.250> I<00:02:08.489> mean<00:02:08.820> I<00:02:08.989> ended<00:02:09.989> up<00:02:10.140> having<00:02:10.560> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
enough on it I mean I ended up having to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.880 
enough on it I mean I ended up having to
do<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.070> front<00:02:11.340> side<00:02:12.050> and<00:02:13.050> not<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.320> back<00:02:13.620> side

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
do the front side and not the back side

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.920 
do the front side and not the back side
and<00:02:14.040> that<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.459> won't<00:02:14.640> look<00:02:14.910> right<00:02:15.300> so<00:02:16.310> yeah

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
and that just won't look right so yeah

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.030
