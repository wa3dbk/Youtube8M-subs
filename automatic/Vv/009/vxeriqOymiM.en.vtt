I'm<00:01:56.170> almost<00:01:56.470> at<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> thousand<00:01:57.430> so<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.450> I<00:02:01.479> now<00:02:01.840> I

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
I'm almost at a thousand so so I now I

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:11.970 
I'm almost at a thousand so so I now I
got<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:04.060> wasn't<00:02:04.390> 100<00:02:10.410> open<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.530> health<00:02:11.740> and

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
got that wasn't 100 open the health and

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.100 
got that wasn't 100 open the health and
hoping<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.500> then<00:02:14.500> now<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:16.450> little<00:02:16.900> thing

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
hoping and then now one little thing

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.790 
hoping and then now one little thing
that<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.410> have<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:17.740> have<00:02:18.070> is<00:02:18.940> this<00:02:19.510> charger<00:02:20.230> it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
that you have to have is this charger it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.030 
that you have to have is this charger it
connects<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.220> your<00:02:21.400> computer<00:02:22.019> so<00:02:23.019> it<00:02:23.769> this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
connects to your computer so it this

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.810 
connects to your computer so it this
could<00:02:24.310> work<00:02:24.580> if<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:25.870> constantly<00:02:26.530> if<00:02:27.400> you

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
could work if you just constantly if you

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.910 
could work if you just constantly if you
look<00:02:28.000> down<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.390> constantly<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:28.959> forward<00:02:29.290> it's

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
look down and constantly go forward it's

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.890 
look down and constantly go forward it's
easier<00:02:30.400> if<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.700> hold<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:32.489> unplug<00:02:33.489> it

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
easier if you just hold it unplug it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.890 
easier if you just hold it unplug it
hold<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.019> back<00:02:35.140> in<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:37.300> you'll<00:02:37.540> watch

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
hold it back in and you'll watch

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.270 
hold it back in and you'll watch
straight<00:02:38.470> into<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.040> mystery<00:02:40.000> box<00:02:41.280> you'll

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
straight into the mystery box you'll

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.940 
straight into the mystery box you'll
start<00:02:42.580> watching<00:02:42.970> you<00:02:43.030> might<00:02:43.209> say<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.950> press

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
start watching you might say that press

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.330
