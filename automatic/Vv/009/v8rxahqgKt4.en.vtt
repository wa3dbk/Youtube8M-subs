00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.480
 silvana on the plane without taking off ben 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.400
 that's possible all have a jersey 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.869
 green you will see but it's not done 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.890
 for the bodies of the two nice pilots 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.660
 is made for people who have a small 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.070
 little scared maybe in national yes it 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.080
 are going to have cd internships at the 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.300
 back a bit for that of course he 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.259
 is obvious that if if you if we are 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.150
 in a cockpit can be we 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.490
 better understand the things there the idea the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.510
 concept comes from new zealand 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.550
 the idea is to end up in their 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.420
 side of a real pilot to a real pilot 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.320
 from boeing 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.940
 at the controls of the boeing so you happen 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.800
 and we give you a speech on you 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
 explains how it will work and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.710
 you have the real orders you have 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.870
 the real feelings of a take-off 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.180
 with the tarpaulins of the mages 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.859
 in high definition at 180 degrees in front of 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 you can also choose the 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.109
 flight you want if you prefer 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 flying over Rome or by there was and you 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.489
 take off there are several possibilities 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.640
 plus several times of two flights 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.140
 the real ones on the ground on your seat 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.240
 finally you really are in a 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.369
 hell beaches to do collages to 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.040
 the exact person and so you have 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.840
 the pilot by your side who tells you what 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.750
 How do we do we'll do it and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.710
 so the experience is extraordinary 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.810
 it's in paris 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.100
 it's the only one in Europe 1 that exists 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.720
 concept and New Zealander but that's 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.070
 arrived in europe when leaving i can be 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.939
 useful but otherwise it's what it is 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.909
 entertainment is it yes it disgusts 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.619
 so I'll tell you this after no that 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.759
 cost not great in the tests I 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.009
 think it's well done 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.420
 then good then we had had rhin 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.189
 the choice we did not shoot at startup 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.610
 is lost it's michel cube who realizes 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.810
 the subject that is woven foot comments a 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.860
 other to the bad and the host finally good 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.860
 to pronounce the 110 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.479
 the concept is to allow any 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.829
 interested person to be able to do 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.780
 the experience of an airplane flying in 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:10.209
 line in our simulator which is the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.890
 exact replica of the cockpit of a b737 and 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.840
 so to do this flight by being accompanied 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.430
 of course by an instructor who does 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.140
 co - pilot and who is himself 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.580
 a trained professional airline pilot 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.580
 to accompany the general public 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.569
 see through the portholes an image 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.760
 projected on a 180-degree screen by 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.989
 three projectors with definitions to 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.310
 outside of the cabin you know a 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.690
 speaker rack that faithfully reproduces 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.640
 the sulk actors who when you 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.630
 push the throttle to take off 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.989
 we could hear the sound of 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.790
 reactors 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.170
 but besides use a headset and 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.680
 microphone to interact with a 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.680
 twitter 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.370
 and finally the chairs sound vibrating this 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.200
 who does that when you're installed 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.530
 you 're strapped you shoot at the 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.390
 handle 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.530
 you 're doing a turn you're really 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.569
 the impression that all that she 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.780
 move and you are immersed in your 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.780
 skin 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.780
 we are speaking to all fans of 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:13.900
 simulation to all amateurs 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.430
 aeronautics from 9 years to over 90 years 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.170
 we had customers who are shutters 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.940
 who had this venerable age and our 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.420
 first client our youngest client 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.420
 was nine years old 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.349
 the majority of our clients are 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.530
 men who were offered an hour of 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:31.530
 flight 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.980
 for the little story the majority of 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.930
 our customers are customers who 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.459
 buy coupons to offer them to 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.769
 their sons and their husbands to their father to 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.450
 their grandfather and the goblins buys it 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.709
 and men fly that's how 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.120
 airports that will partially 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.690
 asked his saint martin in the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.220
 Caribbean or the old airport 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.239
 Hong Kong cocktail that is pretty 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.010
 spectacular that women and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.510
 today is we can practice 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.500
 since we are in a simulator and we 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.500
 wants to recreate this idea environment 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.299
 the spotlight 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.299
 m 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.030
 we are preparing by then the return to 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.400
 offer courses to 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.019
 treat the family of the plane the idea 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.580
 it is to be able to spend a morning at home 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.959
 to meet a psychologist 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:20.489
 what he was sleeping in understanding what is 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.620
 goes on a flight to be able to handle better 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.620
 their apprehensions of the plane
