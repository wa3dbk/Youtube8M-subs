00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.890
 hello my name is I keep love I 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.010
 am furious burlesque and I live in 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.010
 Paris 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.750
 for me to be sexy it's more of a 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.330
 attitude question a way of being 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.040
 a gesture a step rather than a 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.790
 physical characteristic to properly 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:48.970
 to speak is something that is built 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.530
 little by little over the years we are 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.440
 not sexy in the same way at 20 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.239
 at age 30 40 50 60 and so on 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.739
 we actually find our strong point 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.909
 what we like already we stay 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.170
 authentic in our way to us from 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.360
 we actually like it I think it takes 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.460
 perhaps being more selfish already 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.590
 please yourself and I think that after 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 it's easier to please and seduce 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:15.460
 she is sexy in the eyes of others me the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.780
 the sexiest woman of all time 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.340
 it is rather a combination of 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.820
 several characters of the characters 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.820
 rather fictional such as miss piggy than 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.450
 look a little weird but jessica 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.280
 rabbit 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.200
 and then also the collection bearded 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 which are very far from the plastic model 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 which one 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 accustomed all 3 2 represent 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 pretty strong enough characters and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 independent and at the same time they are 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.729
 very feminine very sexy they do not have 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.950
 ashamed of their bodies and their 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.750
 femininity and she usually assumes 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 still to help career despite everything 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 since barbie a career like 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.470
 delighted jessica and economists predicts a 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.830
 male archetypes model as clive 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.200
 owen 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.840
 he is a very reggae character 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.700
 contemporary it is a man who manly 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 but not too much a little bit 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 mature but very little it prevents me 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.009
 not to do the dishes anyway and 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.470
 to be yes to stay in the archetypes 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.289
 classic or but also evolve and be 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.039
 modern as we all are today 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.039
 anyway 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.220
 for me the shoe the tool to do 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.799
 to raise the temperature is rather a 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.599
 shoe I like a lot of heels very 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.939
 high and very thin and in a cup 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.310
 still very classic in fact at the 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.560
 base the two-color side also gives a 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.519
 very chic side and we have precisely the 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.920
 sexy touch by either Guinean printed 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.390
 leopard as for this one or 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.310
 little rhinestones or things like that 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.670
 but it's for a year a detail 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.690
 keep a very very classic cut and 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.069
 this one tell us too well then 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.470
 failed the cliche and at the same time 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.940
 brings something subtle and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.370
 refined it's not something 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.230
 too bright to wear heels we 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.989
 makes us aware of our body 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.590
 in a different way and that's 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.849
 exactly what makes you have a 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.560
 different appearance in this sense 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.959
 different it's really a conscience 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.819
 real body and not just a 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.829
 accessory that we wear as we can 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.500
 see her with a bag of jewelry etc. 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.629
 the shoe gives since that's what 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.849
 support us somewhere that's what 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:27.230
 also gives impulse the way that 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.230
 we must behave on the rest 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.180
 to put an end to his feet my 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.370
 god if there was a particular rule 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.450
 on the one hand it would be and it is especially that 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.430
 would be sad to know she 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:42.320
 the interest works on the contrary 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.660
 2 10 m a little bit of his energy from his 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.610
 personality to seduce each other and not 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.950
 necessarily sought to apply rules 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.120
 basic rules and then what way 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.470
 was never really the front 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.890
 who will please the water all that will not 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.150
 had to please 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.800
 so the best is still him 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.280
 ask what they like him 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.989
 and then do for valentine's day 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.890
 you makes for me the principle it's 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.150
 not to do like everyone else 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.930
 it's either we do something the day before 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.400
 the next day 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.900
 but never the same day the same day 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.269
 it's more like going out with friends in 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.530
 a chic place glamorous we will be able to 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.720
 do all this beautiful and all that is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.760
 fun but for Valentine's Day in 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.209
 in love is rather out of convention 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.209
 made 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.460
 m 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.870
 all
