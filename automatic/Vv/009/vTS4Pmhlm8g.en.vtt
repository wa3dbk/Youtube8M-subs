00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
one cool then finally I'm gone and away
very<00:01:39.630> nice<00:01:39.810> move<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.259> think<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> better<00:01:40.890> if<00:01:41.390> we

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
very nice move I think it's better if we

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.990 
very nice move I think it's better if we
practice<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.810> moving<00:01:43.079> backwards<00:01:43.850> to<00:01:44.850> get<00:01:44.970> a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
practice it moving backwards to get a

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.990 
practice it moving backwards to get a
lot<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.180> repetitions<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> space

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
lot of repetitions in so in the space

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.880 
lot of repetitions in so in the space
back<00:01:48.000> behind<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.720> across<00:01:48.960> back<00:01:49.290> behind<00:01:49.530> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
back behind and across back behind and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.340 
back behind and across back behind and
across<00:01:51.920> wide<00:01:52.920> with<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.220> arms<00:01:54.110> so<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> we're

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
across wide with our arms so that we're

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.359 
across wide with our arms so that we're
in<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.590> game<00:01:56.060> we<00:01:57.060> would<00:01:57.210> be<00:01:57.329> shielding<00:01:58.250> try<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
in a game we would be shielding try and

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.870 
in a game we would be shielding try and
keep<00:01:59.460> our<00:01:59.670> head<00:01:59.850> up

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
keep our head up

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.160 
keep our head up
and<00:02:02.880> we<00:02:02.970> repeat<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.300> movements<00:02:03.840> until<00:02:03.960> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
and we repeat that movements until it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.820 
and we repeat that movements until it
almost<00:02:04.880> become<00:02:05.880> second<00:02:06.240> nature<00:02:06.270> okay<00:02:07.080> it's

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
almost become second nature okay it's

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:21.520 
almost become second nature okay it's
another<00:02:08.009> very<00:02:08.190> important<00:02:08.640> one<00:02:08.729> go

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.839 

I'm<00:02:22.530> gonna<00:02:22.680> pay<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:22.950> movements<00:02:23.519> until<00:02:23.760> it

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
I'm gonna pay that movements until it

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.020 
I'm gonna pay that movements until it
almost<00:02:24.530> becomes<00:02:25.530> second-nature<00:02:25.950> okay

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
almost becomes second-nature okay

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.590 
almost becomes second-nature okay
it's<00:02:27.510> another<00:02:27.689> very<00:02:27.780> important<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.409> go
