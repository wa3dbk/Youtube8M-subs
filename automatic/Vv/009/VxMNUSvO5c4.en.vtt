00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.119 
it a lot but my friends tongue swelled a
lot<00:00:50.340> right<00:00:51.329> after<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.960> bleeding<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.649> if

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
lot right after it was bleeding so if

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.069 
lot right after it was bleeding so if
people<00:00:53.430> say<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.629> supposed<00:00:55.020> to

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
people say that it's not supposed to

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.540 
people say that it's not supposed to
bleed<00:00:55.320> when<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.590> get<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> they're<00:00:56.340> wrong

bleed when you get it they're wrong

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.930 
bleed when you get it they're wrong

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
muscle on stuff so you're putting a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.410 
muscle on stuff so you're putting a
needle<00:01:02.850> through<00:01:03.149> it
