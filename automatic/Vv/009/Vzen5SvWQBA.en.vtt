00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 that the skate shop skate skates 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.510
 well today I left a tutorial 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.820
 how to paste your Skype shoes now 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:20.000
 that has been broken or something like that 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.270
 it's something simple we need a bar 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.270
 silicone silicone I do not know in your country 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.829
 whatever it is called and a fork 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.590
 the good shoe what we will have to 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.510
 do 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.510
 burst silicone 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:44.500
 with the fork until it melts and 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.060
 carve it here in the shoe well 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.060
 and then let's do it 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.170
 and so your skate shoes are going to 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:59.110
 last longer as you see I am here taking the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.110
 this is already hot we had it here 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.960
 in that broken like we squeeze it and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 let's continue like this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.090
 all the part that is of the sideburns 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.210
 is that we were asked 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.600
 once it is removed again a 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.600
 process 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.549
 we detail no matter how we stay 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.729
 but it's going to hit well I can assure you another 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.729
 time 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.830
 I always break on this side 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.920
 I know why it never broke me this 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.220
 side for a while but then this one if I 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.220
 broke 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.560
 have been doing so all the parts of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560
 your shoe that is broken 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.130
 we would all be 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.710
 and there is not done all that we hope to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.630
 let it dry because if we do not put it 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.190
 can take off because the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.040
 100% dry 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.140
 we do the same we undertake that 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.140
 melt and we had fun 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.910
 once all this is done 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.100
 we will have filled our output of 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.780
 skate 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.780
 to keep skating 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.250
 I would like to know what brand is your 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:32.030
 tablet marks the summer its tables 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.390
 because life is a story but now 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.069
 it's all old 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.069
 but still improves 100 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.960
 and well that leaves well you can say that 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.150
