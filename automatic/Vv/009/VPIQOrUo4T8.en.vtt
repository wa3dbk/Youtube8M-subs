bathrooms since blacks could not buy

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.310 
bathrooms since blacks could not buy
those<00:02:17.310> Louboutins<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.360> those<00:02:18.570> coach<00:02:18.900> bags

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
those Louboutins and those coach bags

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.630 
those Louboutins and those coach bags
and<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:19.770> this<00:02:19.860> other<00:02:19.980> stuff<00:02:20.130> because<00:02:20.520> you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and all this other stuff because you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.060 
and all this other stuff because you
were<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:20.790> allowed<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:22.110> into<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.740> malls

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
were not allowed to go into the malls

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.970 
were not allowed to go into the malls
that<00:02:23.730> house<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.570> stores<00:02:24.900> that<00:02:25.230> sold<00:02:25.740> those

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
that house the stores that sold those

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.950 
that house the stores that sold those
particular<00:02:26.430> products<00:02:26.850> so<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> think<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
particular products so I think that it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.940 
particular products so I think that it
is<00:02:27.990> unfair<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.750> think<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.350> things<00:02:31.710> have

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
is unfair to to think that things have

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.790 
is unfair to to think that things have
changed<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.820> twinkling<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.300> as<00:02:33.840> if<00:02:34.170> Jesus<00:02:34.620> has

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
changed in a twinkling I as if Jesus has

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.460 
changed in a twinkling I as if Jesus has
come<00:02:35.010> again<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.480> case<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.170> case

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
come again that is not the case the case

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.880 
come again that is not the case the case
is<00:02:37.800> very<00:02:38.460> simply<00:02:39.060> that<00:02:39.480> racism<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.350> still

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
is very simply that racism is still

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.290 
is very simply that racism is still
alive<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.670> well<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.260> lives<00:02:44.060> in<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
alive and well in and it lives in the

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.190 
alive and well in and it lives in the
hearts<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:46.010> many<00:02:47.010> people<00:02:47.670> still<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.720> this<00:02:48.900> day

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
hearts of many people still to this day

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.480 
hearts of many people still to this day
and<00:02:49.440> is<00:02:49.740> even<00:02:50.090> overflowing<00:02:51.090> into<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:52.490> younger

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
and is even overflowing into a younger

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.790 
and is even overflowing into a younger
generations<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.630> are<00:02:54.690> coming<00:02:55.140> about<00:02:55.350> okay

so that's number one because that's just

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.440 
so that's number one because that's just
a<00:02:57.390> fact<00:02:57.630> okay<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:58.290> does<00:02:58.500> not<00:02:58.650> mean<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.450> you

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
a fact okay it does not mean that you

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.420 
a fact okay it does not mean that you
know<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:01.020> should<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.500> walk<00:03:01.950> around<00:03:02.130> with

that we remember that words do have

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.660 
that we remember that words do have
power<00:03:58.800> if<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.670> want<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.000> get<00:04:00.180> real<00:04:00.690> deep<00:04:01.140> into
