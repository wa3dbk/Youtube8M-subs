00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.219
 but leaves a thumb up there 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.389
 folds a thumb up at the lidl then 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.930

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.710
 comscore china was somewhere else 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.300
 test and no hair and finally 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 dead and therefore no accounts 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.870
 But now the days are coming 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.460

 any case, nice player 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.610
