on and then throws it up there it does

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.979 
on and then throws it up there it does
come<00:02:42.180> with<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.630> light<00:02:43.319> blue<00:02:43.650> rip<00:02:44.310> cord<00:02:44.989> which

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
come with the light blue rip cord which

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.820 
come with the light blue rip cord which
you<00:02:46.170> can<00:02:46.410> just<00:02:46.850> place<00:02:47.850> in<00:02:48.290> obviously<00:02:49.290> this

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
you can just place in obviously this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.920 
you can just place in obviously this
piece<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.640> optional<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.300> don't<00:02:51.390> have<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.900> have

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
piece is optional you don't have to have

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.140 
piece is optional you don't have to have
it<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:53.220> i<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.400> his<00:02:53.640> speedo<00:02:53.940> looks

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
it on but i think his speedo looks

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.630 
it on but i think his speedo looks
pretty<00:02:54.390> cool<00:02:54.570> with<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.769> this<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.310> kind

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
pretty cool with it and this is the kind

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.430 
pretty cool with it and this is the kind
of<00:02:56.700> ramp<00:02:56.940> thing<00:02:57.209> doesn't<00:02:57.690> work<00:02:57.870> as<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> ramp

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
of ramp thing doesn't work as a ramp

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.890 
of ramp thing doesn't work as a ramp
because<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:59.070> ol<00:02:59.190> idea<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.910> your<00:03:00.600> speedo

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
because the ol idea is that your speedo

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.509 
because the ol idea is that your speedo
comes<00:03:01.260> in<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.950> hits<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:04.100> lifts<00:03:05.100> up<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.310> bit

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
comes in and it hits that lifts up a bit

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:06.979 
comes in and it hits that lifts up a bit
and<00:03:05.640> goes<00:03:05.820> back<00:03:06.000> down<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.390> then<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.600> launches

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
and goes back down and then it launches

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.430 
and goes back down and then it launches
that<00:03:07.050> at<00:03:07.530> these<00:03:08.209> targets<00:03:09.260> they're<00:03:10.260> all

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
that at these targets they're all

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.190 
that at these targets they're all
they're<00:03:10.800> all<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.220> same<00:03:11.250> part<00:03:11.880> from<00:03:12.090> one<00:03:12.989> has<00:03:13.170> a

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
they're all the same part from one has a

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.170 
they're all the same part from one has a
yellow<00:03:13.380> one<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.830> these<00:03:13.980> targets<00:03:14.519> on<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.970> has<00:03:15.150> a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
yellow one of these targets on one has a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.090 
yellow one of these targets on one has a
red<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:16.440> one<00:03:16.950> has<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> green<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.829> they<00:03:19.829> are

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
red and one has a green and they are

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.440 
red and one has a green and they are
supposed<00:03:20.459> to<00:03:20.579> represent<00:03:20.670> each<00:03:21.590> Ravens<00:03:22.590> as<00:03:23.549> you

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
supposed to represent each Ravens as you

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.080 
supposed to represent each Ravens as you
can<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:24.810> it's<00:03:25.019> kind<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.260> like<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> black<00:03:26.090> birds

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
can see it's kind of like a black birds

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.340 
can see it's kind of like a black birds
may<00:03:27.269> represent<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.930> raven<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:29.250> move<00:03:29.459> them

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
may represent a raven you can move them

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.170 
may represent a raven you can move them
about<00:03:31.350> which<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.489> think<00:03:32.730> it's<00:03:32.820> pretty<00:03:32.970> cool

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
about which I think it's pretty cool

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.680 
about which I think it's pretty cool
main<00:03:34.140> idea<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.709> that<00:03:34.739> you<00:03:34.890> stand<00:03:35.220> them<00:03:35.459> up

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
main idea is that you stand them up

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.660 
main idea is that you stand them up
pretty<00:03:36.690> close<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.200> each<00:03:37.320> other<00:03:37.470> not<00:03:38.250> too<00:03:38.459> close

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
pretty close to each other not too close

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.880 
pretty close to each other not too close
so<00:03:39.269> they<00:03:39.299> don't<00:03:39.600> just<00:03:39.989> knock<00:03:40.380> over<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.799> you

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
so they don't just knock over and you

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.370 
so they don't just knock over and you
get<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.220> easy<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.600> you<00:03:42.690> can<00:03:42.870> have<00:03:43.260> an

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
get it easy but so you can have an

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.350 
get it easy but so you can have an
advantage<00:03:43.680> in<00:03:43.980> knocking<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.430> more<00:03:44.610> you<00:03:45.269> get

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
advantage in knocking the more you get

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.210 
advantage in knocking the more you get

got to Eagles down Ravens down so if I

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.690

was<00:05:13.620> playing<00:05:13.740> with<00:05:13.950> someone<00:05:14.250> else<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.520> they

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
was playing with someone else and they

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.730 
was playing with someone else and they
got<00:05:14.880> all<00:05:15.060> three<00:05:15.360> down<00:05:15.660> they<00:05:16.260> would<00:05:16.440> get<00:05:16.620> to
