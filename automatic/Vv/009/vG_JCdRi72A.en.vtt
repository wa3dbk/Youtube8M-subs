00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.519
 so today's podcast 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.990
 2 successful coffee machines and then 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.800
 I just want to show what 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.710
 the small differences are size and 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.270
 just the function for once 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.070
 get small when playing then 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.939
 It is very difficult to recognize, above all 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.300
 to compare 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.379
 That's how you just really see the machine 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.570
 maybe something is better 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.570
 to show bad odors 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:43.269
 where may meet both machines running 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 automatically on staple run power play 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.500
 demand 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.930
 Here you can maybe see that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.170
 the right machines significantly better 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.869
 of a child left 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.220
 secondly, the water is also used by 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.460
 Clear Munich are usually only 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:05.950
 Replacement on the right side for that 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.700
 correctly measured clear water over 40 13 41 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.710
 ford when off 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.860
 In spite of all that you can really do the 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.930
 cleanups only say positive that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.480
 Turkish function is that others have 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.680
 Machines two games do not pay you 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.390
 actually spares the whole 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.700
 cleaning the whole thailand 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.220
 not just learning about the coffee grounds 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.260
 the this drawers house and it 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:34.090
 really super easy made to the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.500
 attitudes of coffee over the jesus 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.050
 In the end, everything is controlled in a controlled manner 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.480
 that is the coffee can set 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.400
 Compare machines of the case and also 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.170
 The starch would like to put over 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:50.050
 some experts quality that is very 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.310
 strong coffee with it said here against 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.320
 set evil 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.640
 I thought then also with the left 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.990
 you can even go to my café 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.700
 that is, it really is 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.840
 a setting where you say that is 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.850
 my coffee 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:11.680
 and so should always be and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:18.299
 otherwise you will be saved 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.299
 the baltic states those who know 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:41.560
 and sometimes to make a big offer 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:44.290
 smaller coffee making it was a 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.660
 really wear it once and you see 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:54.460
 also really great as a skunk of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.570
 topkapi derivatives thereof below 50 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:04.300
 comparable to any café can go 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:07.240
 and after the coffee preparation here 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.730
 At first , just do not mention it 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.770
 Just put on the alster are one 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:19.270
 Machine hall automatic removal 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:20.680
 actions or machines no work 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:24.070
 it should just be clear 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.790
 water through the hoses and files are 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:32.550
 So for secretly traveling really 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.550
 an additional function yes 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.570
 now come again to a comparison 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.840
 where you can see the barkeepers in the café 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.890
 in the end , that's what he turns off the coffee 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.870
 I have tested here with the café 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.510
 floor I can only recommend it 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.600
 but various never really tried 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.180
 at least of the favorable the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.010
 just the best really do not say 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.810
 verarbeitungs simplistic given just the best 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.490
 with stainless steel and so on up 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.730
 both a heating plate that is more 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.140
 You can already earn in advance 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.390
 Years will be seen everything else 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.590
 but energy class a also says a lot 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.400
 endure absolutely lower 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.690
 power consumption and if more 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.050
 Questions should not seem to be asked 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.050
 easy on
