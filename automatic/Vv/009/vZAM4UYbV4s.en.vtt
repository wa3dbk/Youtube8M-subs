00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
this picture of this girl and fell in

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.609

love<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.799> her<00:01:07.890> hair<00:01:08.130> um<00:01:08.810> but<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.020> decided<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
love with her hair um but I decided and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
love with her hair um but I decided and
we'll<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.890> go<00:01:11.070> darker<00:01:11.490> red<00:01:11.640> because<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.000> can't

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
we'll just go darker red because I can't

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
we'll just go darker red because I can't
really<00:01:12.510> find<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> orange<00:01:12.930> they<00:01:13.080> want<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
really find the orange they want and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
really find the orange they want and
then<00:01:14.040> maybe<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> would<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.850> been<00:01:15.390> into<00:01:15.689> a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
then maybe that would have been into a

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.320 
then maybe that would have been into a
nice<00:01:15.930> orange<00:01:16.439> color<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.549> hopefully<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.090> one

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
nice orange color but hopefully this one

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.140 
nice orange color but hopefully this one
will<00:01:18.420> fade<00:01:18.830> maybe<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.549> know<00:01:20.790> but

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
will fade maybe I don't really know but

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.600 
will fade maybe I don't really know but
it's<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.530> bright<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.189> wasn't<00:01:23.520> is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's very very bright to wasn't is

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
it's very very bright to wasn't is
brightest<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.600> thought<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> was<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> be

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
brightest I thought it was going to be

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.130 
brightest I thought it was going to be
um<00:01:25.850> like<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.939> said<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.540> little<00:01:27.810> bit<00:01:27.900> darker

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
um like I said it's a little bit darker

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.990 
um like I said it's a little bit darker
but<00:01:29.040> how<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> got<00:01:29.909> this<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.630> had<00:01:30.840> dark<00:01:31.170> brown

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
but how I got this was I had dark brown

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.359 
but how I got this was I had dark brown
on<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.270> side<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:34.049> head<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:35.040> remove

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
on this side of my head and to remove

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
on this side of my head and to remove
and<00:01:35.729> then<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:36.860> didn't<00:01:37.860> color<00:01:38.100> strip<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.579> because

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and then I didn't color strip it because

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.990 
and then I didn't color strip it because
