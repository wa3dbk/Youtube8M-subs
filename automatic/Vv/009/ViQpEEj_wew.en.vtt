 this canvas a mention of honor and the 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.790
 praise of some critics 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.740
 the style of manet in these dates 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.260
 includes the tribute to painting 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.900
 Spanish baroque with the employment of 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.850
 suggestions of the Japanese print as 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.220
 the articulation of the tonalities to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.920
 through contrasts and the renunciation of 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.540
 traditional chiaroscuro 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.790
 these novelties earned him the 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.130
 admiration of young artists who 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.660
 they are grouped around him and they encourage him to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.660
 perform more ambitious works 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.860
 the taste for the Spanish causes that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.229
 manet uses the Hispanic theme in 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.540
 good part of his works but of 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.549
 gradually the artist goes 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.920
 incorporating scenes from the 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.920
 Parisian life of the moment becoming 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.320
 in 1863 when dawn or tower hit 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.320
 definitive to the lounge structures 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.510
 of Paris maybe without pretending it like that 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.540
 presents his work more 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.630
 controversial breakfast on the grass that 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.300
 next to two thousand 804 is more was rejected 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.670
 by the official jury breakfast over 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.070
 the grass was totally censored by 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.200
 criticism despite receiving a strong 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 accolade of the young artists who 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.290
 they were frankly attracted to the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.519
 work 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.340
 to the salon of 1865 he presented again two 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.909
 works christo mocked by three 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.430
 soldiers and the Olympia the figure of the

 High-nude prostitute naked before 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.319
 the eyes of the Parisians was a 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:15.200
 new scandal although deep down 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.569
 it stopped being a tribute to tiziano 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.120
 This rejection caused a trip to Spain 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.160
 where you will deepen your admiration for 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.700
 the painting of Velázquez 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 considered the painter of painters

 homenajeándoles in GDP to the 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.620
 Spanish reappears in his works 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.940
 as we observed in the bullfighter who salutes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.159
 the universal exhibition of paris of the year 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.739
 1867 is another setback for the 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.640
 teacher to be rejected from the section 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.770
 artistic 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.720
 manet found that the rejection of 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.240
 exposure was not enough to exhaust 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.510
 his forces so he decided to ride 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:57.090
 a private sample the public mocks 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.090
 of manet's works and the critics are 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.850
 very severe what causes desolation in 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.370
 the artist as a critic of the politics of 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.280
 third napoleon paints the execution of 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.350
 Maximilian looking for inspiration in 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.350
 the May 3 executions of goya 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.509
 criticism was again blunt 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.699
 respect to their jobs the desire to 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.500
 triumph in the room leads him to present 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:35.490
 annually several works that are 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:39.539
 rejected systematically until in 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.050
 1873 gets great success with the hype that 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:46.150
 will be in the summer of the year 1874 when in

 sharper and vivid colors your 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.030
 brush strokes will be fast and you will worry 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.680
 by the luminous effects clinging without 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.610
 However, almost black tones 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.490
 prohibited by the impressionists 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.860
 however these compositions way 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:09.509
 he remained an independent painter 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.009
 who was interested in life 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:16.080
 contemporary in the summer of 1878 and 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:18.090

 St. Petersburg of Paris 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.720
 manet wanted to perpetuate the landscape that 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.970
 I had watched from his window 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.040
 for this he made a rich series of 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.890
 cityscapes among us 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.440
 they lacked coffee breweries and others 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.920
 entertainment centers and fashion themselves 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.950
 the French capital 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.200
 from 1879 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.950
 manet would feel the first symptoms of 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.140
 his locomotor ataraxia disease is 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.729

 died on April 30 , 1883 one of 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.960
 his last most significant works and 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:03.870
 exposed in the 1882 room was the 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.059
 entitled the bar of folies bergère a 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.039
 mysterious composition in which the 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.900
 artist plays with the extensions of the 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:12.840
 space 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.790
 in his scenes manet presented numerous 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.280
 innovations with which he faced the 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:19.380
 academic art and arranged for young people 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.259
 artists to continue in that 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.240
 line but manet always considered the 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.419
 triumph in the living room as the only 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:30.710
 career goal a career between 

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:32.960
 Realism and impressionism
