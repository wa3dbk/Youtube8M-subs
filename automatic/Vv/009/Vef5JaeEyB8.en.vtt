00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello welcome to crash pepper today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:14.849
 He taught you how to make a delicious 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:17.160
 refreshing of jamaica and strawberries for 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.440
 this is going to need a liter of water 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.080
 5 tablespoons of jamaica 100 grams of 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.950
 sugar strawberries to taste mint peace and a 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.160
 little ice 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:31.180
 We are going to weigh and see about two cups of 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.000
 water then let's place the jamaica and 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.670
 let's let it infuse and we're going to 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.410
 pay for the water after the beans of 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.770
 jamaica let's go in the little flowers 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:45.730
 jamaica network that linda let's leave them 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.920
 infuse at least 5 to 10 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 minutes at least we're going to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.050
 transfer to a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 This is my coffee maker but I am 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.960
 using as a colander basically what 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.539
 I'm sneaking my tea then in a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.780
 We will add sugar to your liking 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.540
 and we are going to add the jamaica water 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.440
 is a little concentrated this me 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.780
 I am somewhat strong yes no 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.260
 we are going to stir very well so that 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:17.860
 undo all the sugar and now we're going to 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.810
 add chopped strawberries on casters 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.760
 those of mine that have to be cold 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.650
 because if not the strawberries are cooked and 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.510
 they are very very ugly then you have to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.840
 be this at room temperature so 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.840
 less then let's mix it with the 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.109
 rest of the water 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:41.189
 and now we are going to place it in a small cup 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:44.100
 pretty ice a few mint leaves and 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.289
 our if you want you can place the tea 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.810
 to cool before serving it would be 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.630
 preferable but I had a lot to do well 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 that I did it to see this rich 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.260
 was left 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.420
 remember to subscribe to my channel every 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.720
 week a new recipe kisses 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.720
