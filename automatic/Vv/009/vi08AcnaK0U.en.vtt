00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello very good everyone is now a 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.669
 I also require my channel and welcome 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.439
 to a Friday of the three that in this 

00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:09.000
 Occasion we are in portal 2 as you are 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.130
 watching on your screens in your 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.809
 monitors and before proceeding with it 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.969
 I would like to thank you because 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.650
 this star you have chosen you and 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.660
 you have repeatedly told me 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.570
 sent comments to my videos 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 asking me to analyze what he said 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 anchored in this chamber in portal 2 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.770
 well with this I hope that already many of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.690
 you have deduced what I want 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.969
 say but for those who do not know the 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.519
 stress that we are going to unlock today is that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.859
 in which glados this charismatic and 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.379
 hateful but at the same time kind character 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:41.940
 gives us an encrypted message to a 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.899
 lightning fast 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
 we are in chapter 2 camera 8 and 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:48.600
 we are playing in its english version 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.300
 because the English version and the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.249
 Spanish version contains astÃ©rix 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.480
 different so first we will observe 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:56.519
 the English version and then 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.339
 We will contrast the information with your 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.350
 Spanish version now clear is 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.179
 when he starts talking and in about 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.570
 seconds will give us the message to all 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.570
 321 speed inside key message 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.240
 in English 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.500
 yes 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 yes yes friends it is a message 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.020
 quite interesting since it makes a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.329
 reference to the book of 'moby dick' more 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 specifically to the first page and the 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.380
 first chapter that in Spanish 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.420
 it would be something like knock down 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.270
 methodically hat to 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.209
 passersby then I understand that it is more 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.690
 what time to go to sea so soon 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.100
 how can i 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.410
 many of you will be 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.440
 asking what the hell is this what 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:51.290
 meaning has this phrase and I 'm going to 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.270
 try to answer with my words 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.890
 this phrase has the word hat has 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.710
 the word hat and can make a 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.990
 small reference to team fortress 2 no 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.150
 it is known with certainty but of course the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
 message does not hide anything else since 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.140
 it would simply be the book that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.730
 I would be reading the benders or 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.640
 game programmers and they decided 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.690
 put this little glitch here I know that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.310
 many of you will be 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.610
 asking very well the English version 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.130
 it is well known we know it or we have 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.810
 heard more than one and you're right the 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.150
 English version is uploaded by all 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.640
 internet and you will find thousands of videos 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.820
 with this message deciphered the mortarboard 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.440
 deciphered a thousand times well I 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.580
 continued big to this one I've decided 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.320
 do it also in its version in 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.900
 Spanish so let's listen 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.460
 spoken the babbling the english version 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.320
 and the Spanish version is different 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.000
 so listen carefully to see if 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.680
 you are able to decipher the mystery 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.180
 before I put it in slow motion 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.420
 within degrees 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.420
 with these tools, yes, yes 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.340
 positive and more hypothetical there are potatoes 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.670
 with that there are potatoes valve with hat 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.740
 live 3 patatas bravas with hat light 3 no 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.070
 we know it is an enigma potatoes with 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.950
 this sentence has no meaning is absurd 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.690
 it is seen that the benders have doubled 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.670
 the whole game but in this sentence 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.700
 They decided to turn a deaf ear and 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.010
 They decided not to fold it, they left it like that and 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.350
 those of us who are not English or American 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.320
 we annoyed ourselves and we were left without having 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.630
 our disaster gene version itself does not 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.030
 in Spanish version or in version of the 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.530
 country that you are but good I hope that you 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.270
 I liked it and I hope not to have 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.280
 I am disappointed I expected which is 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.960
 that said the release date of 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.670
 portal 3 or the hand life 3 but not 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.770
 it's just a babbling without much 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.270
 meaning and as I say I hope that I have 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.500
 liked and I hope you enjoyed and 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.170
 that at least you have thrown us some 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.490
 laughs that is my intention first of all 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.020
 you have the original files in the 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.940
 description so that you can 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.580
 modify to see if you are able to 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.960
 discover something and nothing with this I 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.370
 dismissal you have all the info the 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.560
 description on my blog 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.569
 and you know any comment no 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.459
 hesitate to leave it in the box 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.780
 comments below a greeting and thanks 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.780
