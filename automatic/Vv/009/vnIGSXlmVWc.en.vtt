00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
maintenance program or not but figured

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
maintenance program or not but figured
it<00:03:56.970> can't<00:03:57.150> hurt<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.989> then<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:58.860> other<00:03:58.980> thing<00:03:59.190> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.400 
unboxing video on the head assembly
I<00:04:23.250> pulled<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.760> out<00:04:23.880> of<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.330> box<00:04:24.540> out<00:04:25.230> of<00:04:25.290> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
I pulled it out of the box out of the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.600 
I pulled it out of the box out of the
bag<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> actually<00:04:27.290> dropped<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.410> bolt<00:04:28.620> out<00:04:28.800> it

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
bag and actually dropped a bolt out it

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.690 
bag and actually dropped a bolt out it
fell<00:04:29.880> down<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.420> the<00:04:30.450> table<00:04:31.100> it<00:04:32.100> turns<00:04:32.340> out<00:04:32.550> the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
fell down to the table it turns out the

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.450 
fell down to the table it turns out the
reason<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.090> fell<00:04:33.270> out<00:04:33.420> is<00:04:33.720> because<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:35.250> did<00:04:35.430> not

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
reason it fell out is because it did not

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
reason it fell out is because it did not
have<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:37.580> nut<00:04:38.580> on<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:38.910> end<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.210> it

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
have a nut on the end of it

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.150 
have a nut on the end of it
like<00:04:39.870> this<00:04:40.020> side<00:04:40.230> does<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:41.520> I<00:04:42.510> looked<00:04:42.900> all<00:04:43.050> over

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
like this side does so I looked all over

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.470 
like this side does so I looked all over
every<00:04:44.160> bag<00:04:44.340> all<00:04:44.730> over<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.060> table

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
every bag all over the table

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.660 
every bag all over the table
I<00:04:45.660> can't<00:04:46.350> find<00:04:46.530> a<00:04:46.680> nut<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:47.010> looked<00:04:47.250> at<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.430> video

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
I can't find a nut I looked at the video

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.670 
I can't find a nut I looked at the video
I<00:04:47.970> don't<00:04:48.060> see<00:04:48.360> a<00:04:48.390> nut<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.930> know<00:04:49.050> falling<00:04:49.530> out

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
I don't see a nut you know falling out

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.530 
I don't see a nut you know falling out
and<00:04:50.010> getting<00:04:50.250> lost<00:04:50.400> or<00:04:50.730> anything<00:04:50.880> like<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.120> I

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
and getting lost or anything like that I

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.840 
and getting lost or anything like that I
just<00:04:52.110> think<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.350> shipped<00:04:52.620> with<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.460> missing

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
just think it's shipped with a missing

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.380 
just think it's shipped with a missing
nut<00:04:55.520> if<00:04:56.520> that's<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:57.000> worst<00:04:57.150> thing<00:04:57.360> that

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
nut if that's the worst thing that

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.860 
nut if that's the worst thing that
happens<00:04:57.810> I'll<00:04:58.050> take<00:04:58.080> it<00:04:58.700> so<00:04:59.700> in<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.540> end<00:05:00.660> it

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
happens I'll take it so in the end it

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.480 
happens I'll take it so in the end it
meant<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.200> had<00:05:01.230> to<00:05:01.410> go<00:05:01.500> find<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> replacement

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
meant I had to go find a replacement

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.120 
meant I had to go find a replacement
I<00:05:02.520> was<00:05:03.360> pretty<00:05:03.540> easy<00:05:03.690> like<00:05:04.650> I<00:05:04.680> said<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.980> hobby

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
I was pretty easy like I said the hobby

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.220 
I was pretty easy like I said the hobby
store<00:05:05.250> actually<00:05:05.580> had<00:05:05.850> this<00:05:06.000> for<00:05:06.210> two<00:05:06.330> bucks<00:05:06.570> to

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
store actually had this for two bucks to

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.300 
store actually had this for two bucks to
set<00:05:07.440> a<00:05:07.470> twelve<00:05:08.570> so<00:05:09.570> I've<00:05:10.380> got<00:05:10.590> some<00:05:10.770> some<00:05:11.130> room

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
set a twelve so I've got some some room

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:22.970 
set a twelve so I've got some some room
to<00:05:11.460> lose<00:05:11.640> a<00:05:11.670> few<00:05:11.970> more<00:05:12.150> here<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:17.010> I'm<00:05:17.520> gonna<00:05:21.980> do

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
to lose a few more here but I'm gonna do

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.270 
to lose a few more here but I'm gonna do
a<00:05:23.040> little<00:05:23.130> unboxing<00:05:23.550> right<00:05:24.060> here<00:05:24.300> how's<00:05:24.510> that

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
a little unboxing right here how's that

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:33.560 
a little unboxing right here how's that
so<00:05:26.280> in<00:05:26.700> the<00:05:26.880> end<00:05:27.919> that<00:05:28.919> should<00:05:29.310> now<00:05:32.360> be<00:05:33.360> my

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
so in the end that should now be my

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.590 
so in the end that should now be my
replacement<00:05:33.780> nuts<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:35.060> I'm<00:05:36.060> back<00:05:36.360> to<00:05:36.390> a

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
replacement nuts and I'm back to a

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.980 
replacement nuts and I'm back to a
complete<00:05:37.020> kit<00:05:37.640> so<00:05:38.640> two<00:05:39.270> extra<00:05:39.630> bucks<00:05:39.810> I

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
complete kit so two extra bucks I

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.420 
complete kit so two extra bucks I
probably<00:05:40.200> could<00:05:40.440> have<00:05:40.470> found<00:05:40.710> it<00:05:40.860> at<00:05:41.010> an<00:05:41.160> auto

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
probably could have found it at an auto

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.390 
probably could have found it at an auto
parts<00:05:41.760> store<00:05:41.820> as<00:05:42.210> an<00:05:42.330> individual<00:05:42.780> item<00:05:43.400> for

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
parts store as an individual item for

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.140 
parts store as an individual item for
probably<00:05:44.729> ten<00:05:45.030> cents<00:05:45.450> but<00:05:46.040> what<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.100> heck<00:05:47.310> so

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
probably ten cents but what the heck so

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.120 
probably ten cents but what the heck so
now<00:05:48.300> I'm<00:05:48.450> golden<00:05:48.930> as<00:05:49.350> far<00:05:49.560> as<00:05:49.590> I<00:05:49.740> know<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.890> have
