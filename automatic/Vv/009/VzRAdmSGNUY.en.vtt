00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.930
 all zdarova in touch flex Well 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.080
 tomorrow is March 17th, which means that 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.300
 right 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.099
 will be released battlefield hardline 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.190
 today we look at the key 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.630
 changes that were made after 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 open beta testing 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.880
 taking into account the feedback of players in principle 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.760
 some corrections were expected 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 and necessary start with shotguns 870 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.179
 magnum and spas-12 in the cue ball they were 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.520
 powerful enough you can even say 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.800
 unbalanced because vanshot 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.410
 only in melee but also on medium 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.180
 distances and therefore to at least somehow 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.129
 loosen them 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.930
 the developers decided to reduce the distance 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.590
 some required one shot for 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.250
 killings 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.289
 and in the case of the 870 he reduced 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.710
 rate of fire as well as increased 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.390
 recoil well suffered the nerf also 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.960
 my favorite assault rifles 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.239
 great and terrible m 16 3 which 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.370
 made some players nervous 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.580
 disruption still in battlefield 3 and 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.540
 416 m they increased the vertical return in 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.909
 one and a half times 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.049
 I also want to remind you that in the course of the b 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.560
 you have them reduced the maximum from 28 to 24 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.750
 but I think these changes will not scare away 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.259
 true fans of these assault rifles 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 including me about m 416 also 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.390
 I would like to add that now it is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 default assault rifle 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.759
 owned by the criminal and the cops in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.180
 turn received from criminals 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:38.310
 g36 in my rational exchange now 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.280
 criminals have a worthy competitor 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.310
 m 16 and what do you think is not bad 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.030
 balanced expensive cartridge 338 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.670
 magnum 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.740
 remind in hardline for some 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.009
 sniper rifles can be purchased 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.750
 cartridge 338 magnum for 100 mowers 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.969
 in-game currency 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.759
 its main difference from the standard 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.399
 cartridge in increased damage technique 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.140
 Beta such a cartridge has introduced an imbalance 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.180
 since it was possible to use it 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.860
 destroy patrol helicopter like 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.020
 at least two hits 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.130
 And this is an obvious bust and passenger 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.740
 car with three four hits 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.960
 as for the destruction of the infantry then 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.530
 it was enough to shoot in the chest to 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.540
 send the enemy to the forest full so here 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.760
 developers have reduced the damage to the technique in 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.800
 twice and also reduced the distance by 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.850
 where you can kill one 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.290
 shots as for gameplay 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.440
 you probably know what to use 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.660
 any weapon as cops 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.630
 so criminals need a license 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.430
 which costs 50,000 but needs 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.240
 still make a certain amount 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.630
 kills 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.270
 so now you need to do 1200 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.430
 kills instead of 300 how was the kill 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.610
 and to get a golden camouflage 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.710
 you need 1000 kills on it all 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.380
 see you in hardline but also about 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.380
 battlefield 4 we will not forget everything yet
