00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
that that throws the the picture from it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.260 
that that throws the the picture from it
just<00:02:15.540> sends<00:02:15.990> lights<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.980> screen<00:02:17.310> but<00:02:17.940> but

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
just sends lights on the screen but but

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.050 
just sends lights on the screen but but
this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.690> different<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.610> millions

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
