00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
can play reasonably quickly I haven't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.070 
can play reasonably quickly I haven't
worked<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.970> this<00:01:42.090> one<00:01:42.270> for<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.510> while<00:01:42.660> so<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
worked on this one for a while so it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.140 
worked on this one for a while so it
might<00:01:43.290> be<00:01:43.410> a<00:01:43.440> bit<00:01:43.590> rough<00:01:43.800> but<00:01:44.010> I've<00:01:44.430> been

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
might be a bit rough but I've been

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.660 
might be a bit rough but I've been
trying<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> harmonize<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.960> two<00:01:46.080> together<00:01:46.670> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
trying to harmonize the two together the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.600 
trying to harmonize the two together the
Kuban<00:01:48.030> new<00:01:48.180> banks<00:01:48.479> one<00:01:48.869> two<00:01:49.280> middle<00:01:50.280> finger

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
Kuban new banks one two middle finger

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.800 
Kuban new banks one two middle finger
and<00:01:50.760> thumb<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:52.880> Matt<00:01:53.880> Garrison's<00:01:54.330> one<00:01:54.660> two

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and thumb and Matt Garrison's one two

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.560 
and thumb and Matt Garrison's one two
three<00:01:55.020> four<00:01:55.670> so<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:56.940> what<00:01:57.090> he<00:01:57.210> does<00:01:57.360> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
three four so this is what he does you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.710 
three four so this is what he does you
use<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:01.860> P<00:02:02.640> thumb<00:02:03.149> index

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
use so it's basically P thumb index

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.090 
use so it's basically P thumb index
middle<00:02:04.200> ring

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
middle ring

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.419 
middle ring
okay<00:02:05.520> so

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:19.229 

and<00:02:09.819> then<00:02:10.119> you<00:02:10.209> can<00:02:10.360> apply<00:02:10.479> that<00:02:10.659> to<00:02:10.720> scales<00:02:18.239> so

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
and then you can apply that to scales so

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.899 
and then you can apply that to scales so
this<00:02:19.629> would<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:19.870> good<00:02:19.989> for<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.849> sort<00:02:21.849> of

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
this would be good for like a sort of

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:30.059 
this would be good for like a sort of
digital<00:02:22.060> Titans<00:02:22.599> kind<00:02:22.840> of<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:29.650> kind<00:02:29.859> of<00:02:29.890> stuff

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
digital Titans kind of a kind of stuff

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.080 
digital Titans kind of a kind of stuff
very<00:02:30.970> very<00:02:31.209> quick<00:02:31.420> and<00:02:31.599> pretty<00:02:32.319> clean

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.780 

yeah<00:02:37.859> basically<00:02:38.859> and<00:02:39.250> it's<00:02:39.370> also<00:02:39.489> easy

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
yeah basically and it's also easy

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.539 
yeah basically and it's also easy
because<00:02:39.909> you're<00:02:40.390> basically<00:02:41.049> any<00:02:41.440> feeling<00:02:41.739> one

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
because you're basically any feeling one

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.250 
because you're basically any feeling one
E<00:02:42.579> and<00:02:42.760> a<00:02:43.060> two<00:02:43.090> E<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:43.569> three<00:02:44.049> E<00:02:44.290> and<00:02:44.500> four<00:02:44.980> years

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
which brings me back to 1 e and that

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.179 
which brings me back to 1 e and that

evening<00:03:01.629> so<00:03:01.810> that's<00:03:01.989> coming<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.439> I<00:03:02.680> had<00:03:03.340> added

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
evening so that's coming for I had added

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.879 
evening so that's coming for I had added
a<00:03:03.670> weirdness<00:03:04.299> about<00:03:04.450> playing<00:03:05.230> one<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.739> two

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
a weirdness about playing one and two

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.890 
a weirdness about playing one and two
and<00:03:06.069> three<00:03:06.159> and<00:03:06.459> four<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.849> one<00:03:06.939> E<00:03:07.329> and<00:03:07.540> O<00:03:07.689> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and three and four and one E and O to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.449 
and three and four and one E and O to
the<00:03:07.930> end<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:11.079> can<00:03:11.200> also<00:03:11.260> do<00:03:11.470> triplets<00:03:11.829> with

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
the end you can also do triplets with

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.309 
the end you can also do triplets with
three<00:03:12.790> fingers<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.079> actually

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
three fingers so this is actually

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.830 
three fingers so this is actually
similar<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.650> how<00:03:17.919> a<00:03:17.949> linear<00:03:18.489> order<00:03:18.790> would<00:03:19.239> play

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
similar to how a linear order would play

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.939 
similar to how a linear order would play
he<00:03:20.769> also<00:03:20.949> would<00:03:21.370> use<00:03:21.699> because<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.919> lot<00:03:23.919> of

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949 
he also would use because a lot of

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:25.939 
he also would use because a lot of
string<00:03:24.459> fingerings<00:03:24.849> in<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.060> left<00:03:25.239> hand<00:03:25.510> as

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:25.949 
string fingerings in the left hand as

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:29.309 
string fingerings in the left hand as
three<00:03:26.949> notes<00:03:27.129> per<00:03:27.250> string<00:03:28.019> he<00:03:29.019> would<00:03:29.169> actually

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
three notes per string he would actually

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:33.330 
three notes per string he would actually
use<00:03:29.560> this<00:03:29.799> technique<00:03:30.310> which<00:03:30.579> was<00:03:32.069> he<00:03:33.069> would<00:03:33.190> go

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
use this technique which was he would go

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.629 
use this technique which was he would go
up<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.819> so<00:03:34.540> if<00:03:34.629> with<00:03:34.750> with<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.190> scale<00:03:36.190> that<00:03:36.220> goes

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:46.080 

CDC<00:03:41.220> sorry<00:03:42.220> G<00:03:42.459> maybe<00:03:42.819> see<00:03:44.909> basically<00:03:45.909> three

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
CDC sorry G maybe see basically three

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.610 
CDC sorry G maybe see basically three
hundred<00:03:46.299> four<00:03:46.389> string<00:03:46.599> going<00:03:47.109> up<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.349> C<00:03:47.470> major

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
hundred four string going up to C major

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.860 
hundred four string going up to C major
scale<00:03:47.829> he<00:03:48.609> would<00:03:50.040> start<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.250> his<00:03:51.870> ring

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
scale he would start with his ring

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.740 
scale he would start with his ring
finger<00:03:53.639> and<00:03:54.639> then<00:03:54.790> go<00:03:54.909> backwards<00:03:55.150> when<00:03:55.569> he<00:03:55.629> was

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
finger and then go backwards when he was

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.270 
finger and then go backwards when he was
ascending

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.220 

and<00:04:00.330> then<00:04:01.330> when<00:04:01.510> he<00:04:01.569> was<00:04:01.690> going<00:04:01.840> back<00:04:01.989> down

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
and then when he was going back down

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:17.580 
and then when he was going back down
again<00:04:02.470> he<00:04:02.590> would<00:04:02.709> use<00:04:02.830> his<00:04:02.980> thumb<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.790> stop<00:04:16.590> and

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
again he would use his thumb to stop and

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:24.540 
again he would use his thumb to stop and
you<00:04:17.709> could<00:04:17.889> do<00:04:18.100> it<00:04:18.220> in<00:04:18.280> triplets<00:04:18.639> or<00:04:23.310> very<00:04:24.310> easy

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
you could do it in triplets or very easy

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:38.100 
you could do it in triplets or very easy
very<00:04:24.880> clean<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:27.419> yeah<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:35.580> yeah<00:04:36.580> so<00:04:37.000> I<00:04:37.389> think

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
very clean and yeah but yeah so I think

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.469 
very clean and yeah but yeah so I think
they<00:04:38.380> did<00:04:38.410> he<00:04:38.740> did<00:04:38.950> this<00:04:39.070> because<00:04:39.700> when<00:04:40.330> you're

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
they did he did this because when you're

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.820 
they did he did this because when you're
ascending<00:04:42.330> starting<00:04:43.330> with<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:44.620> middle

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
ascending starting with the middle

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.870 
ascending starting with the middle
finger<00:04:45.280> you<00:04:46.770> you're<00:04:47.770> by<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.250> time<00:04:48.520> you<00:04:48.669> get<00:04:48.820> to

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
finger you you're by the time you get to

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.760 
finger you you're by the time you get to
the<00:04:49.270> third<00:04:49.570> note<00:04:49.840> which<00:04:50.080> is<00:04:50.110> gonna<00:04:50.500> be<00:04:50.590> playing

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
the third note which is gonna be playing

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.129 
the third note which is gonna be playing
with<00:04:50.860> your<00:04:51.070> thumb<00:04:51.479> your<00:04:52.479> middle<00:04:52.690> finger<00:04:53.020> will

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
with your thumb your middle finger will

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.590 
with your thumb your middle finger will
be<00:04:53.169> on<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.440> next<00:04:53.650> string<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.060> ready<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.450> play

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
be on the next string and ready to play

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.770 
be on the next string and ready to play
so<00:04:56.500> it's<00:04:57.010> it<00:04:57.490> seems<00:04:57.729> to<00:04:57.910> be<00:04:58.030> cleaner<00:04:58.240> than<00:04:58.450> just

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
so it's it seems to be cleaner than just

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.740 
so it's it seems to be cleaner than just
doing<00:04:59.010> some<00:05:01.320> this<00:05:02.320> finger<00:05:02.680> to<00:05:02.889> stick<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:03.130> finger

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
doing some this finger to stick a finger

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:11.580 
doing some this finger to stick a finger
all<00:05:04.750> the<00:05:04.810> way<00:05:09.090> but<00:05:10.090> I<00:05:10.389> mean<00:05:10.900> if<00:05:11.169> you<00:05:11.260> work<00:05:11.440> when

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
all the way but I mean if you work when

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.870 
all the way but I mean if you work when
you<00:05:11.680> take<00:05:11.860> me<00:05:11.979> anyway<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.460> doesn't<00:05:12.760> really

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
you take me anyway it doesn't really

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.180 
you take me anyway it doesn't really
matter<00:05:13.150> but<00:05:13.500> that's<00:05:14.500> something<00:05:14.800> that<00:05:14.919> he<00:05:15.039> did

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
matter but that's something that he did

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.469 
matter but that's something that he did
it<00:05:15.310> he<00:05:15.400> hit<00:05:15.520> and<00:05:17.070> okay<00:05:19.770> there's<00:05:20.770> also<00:05:20.919> the

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
it he hit and okay there's also the

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.879 
it he hit and okay there's also the
flamenco<00:05:22.479> or<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.750> Giacomo<00:05:23.260> maybe<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.680> Jaco
