feature which will pre infuse the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.140 
feature which will pre infuse the
quarter<00:01:26.680> prior<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.310> extraction<00:01:27.700> which<00:01:27.970> will

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
quarter prior to extraction which will

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.700

stronger coffee therefore enabling a

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.670 
stronger coffee therefore enabling a
longer<00:01:34.090> extraction<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.290> coffee<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
and the generator keeps it and then

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.489 
and the generator keeps it and then
pumps<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.679> right<00:01:45.009> back<00:01:45.219> up<00:01:45.429> it<00:01:46.420> has<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.630> 13<00:01:47.289> litre
