wasn't producing we planted trees when
we<00:01:36.320> were<00:01:36.500> developing<00:01:36.740> tree<00:01:37.730> Haven<00:01:38.090> they'll

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
we were developing tree Haven they'll

we were developing tree Haven they'll
started<00:01:39.080> thinking<00:01:39.470> whoa<00:01:40.060> it<00:01:41.060> could<00:01:41.360> all<00:01:41.510> be

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
started thinking whoa it could all be

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.470 
started thinking whoa it could all be
developed<00:01:42.290> some<00:01:42.560> day<00:01:42.770> but<00:01:43.340> he<00:01:43.520> thought<00:01:43.730> this

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
developed some day but he thought this

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.810 
developed some day but he thought this
Marsh<00:01:44.810> was<00:01:45.140> really<00:01:45.590> differ<00:01:45.950> and<00:01:46.280> it<00:01:46.580> should<00:01:46.790> be

even though Cooper marsh is man-made
it<00:02:25.329> is<00:02:25.510> still<00:02:25.780> important<00:02:26.349> because<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:27.129> a

started to look at restoration of the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.879 
started to look at restoration of the
whole<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.449> the<00:04:31.720> marsh<00:04:31.930> it's<00:04:32.320> a<00:04:32.470> human-made

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
whole of the marsh it's a human-made

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.149 
whole of the marsh it's a human-made
structure<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.760> was<00:04:33.969> made<00:04:34.270> by<00:04:34.889> building<00:04:35.889> some

00:04:36.149 --> 00:04:36.159 
structure it was made by building some

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.760 
structure it was made by building some
ring<00:04:36.580> dike<00:04:36.880> sand<00:04:37.389> and<00:04:37.630> flooding<00:04:38.200> the

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
ring dike sand and flooding the

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.189 
ring dike sand and flooding the
inside<00:04:39.340> the<00:04:39.550> ring<00:04:39.729> dykes<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.780> create<00:04:41.050> that

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
inside the ring dykes to create that

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.100 
inside the ring dykes to create that
wetland<00:04:41.680> and<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.669> unlike<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.090> natural<00:04:43.690> wetland

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
wetland and so unlike a natural wetland

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.159 
wetland and so unlike a natural wetland
over<00:04:44.949> time<00:04:45.220> it's<00:04:45.580> going<00:04:45.879> to<00:04:46.030> fill<00:04:46.810> in<00:04:47.020> with

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
over time it's going to fill in with

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.850 
over time it's going to fill in with
vegetation<00:04:47.710> it<00:04:48.280> was<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:48.729> important<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.860> to

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
vegetation it was very important to to

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.159 
vegetation it was very important to to
bring<00:04:51.069> back<00:04:51.340> a<00:04:51.400> lot<00:04:51.819> of<00:04:51.940> open<00:04:52.360> areas<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:53.020> open

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
bring back a lot of open areas of open

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.309 
bring back a lot of open areas of open
waters<00:04:53.830> so<00:04:54.069> we<00:04:54.250> could<00:04:54.840> encourage<00:04:55.840> the

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:56.319 
waters so we could encourage the

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.649 
waters so we could encourage the
increase<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.580> breeding<00:04:58.150> species

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
increase in breeding species

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.159 
increase in breeding species
particularly<00:04:59.080> ducks<00:04:59.470> and<00:05:00.060> wetland<00:05:01.060> birds<00:05:01.360> so

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
particularly ducks and wetland birds so

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.610 
particularly ducks and wetland birds so
the<00:05:02.259> birds<00:05:02.530> can<00:05:02.680> fly<00:05:02.800> mine<00:05:03.190> is<00:05:04.199> open<00:05:05.199> water<00:05:05.379> for

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
the birds can fly mine is open water for

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.170 
the birds can fly mine is open water for
them<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.830> land<00:05:05.979> people<00:05:06.430> who<00:05:06.580> go<00:05:06.699> out<00:05:06.729> there<00:05:07.060> are

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
them to land people who go out there are

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.029 
them to land people who go out there are
going<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.419> notice<00:05:07.629> this<00:05:07.930> drawdown<00:05:08.289> going<00:05:08.860> on

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
going to notice this drawdown going on

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.520 
going to notice this drawdown going on
and<00:05:09.310> the<00:05:09.909> idea<00:05:10.270> there<00:05:10.330> is<00:05:10.599> to<00:05:10.810> try<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.139> simulate

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
and the idea there is to try to simulate

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.350 
and the idea there is to try to simulate
what<00:05:12.009> would<00:05:12.159> happen<00:05:12.580> naturally<00:05:12.789> an

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
what would happen naturally an

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.809 
what would happen naturally an
occasional<00:05:14.199> period<00:05:14.650> of<00:05:15.039> extreme<00:05:15.460> drought

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:15.819 
occasional period of extreme drought

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.689 
occasional period of extreme drought
that<00:05:16.300> would<00:05:16.479> kill<00:05:16.720> back<00:05:16.930> some<00:05:17.259> of<00:05:17.289> the

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
that would kill back some of the

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:20.129 
that would kill back some of the
vegetation<00:05:18.699> will<00:05:19.180> be<00:05:19.330> doing<00:05:19.569> that<00:05:19.720> over<00:05:19.930> the

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139 
vegetation will be doing that over the

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.010 
vegetation will be doing that over the
next<00:05:20.169> several<00:05:20.590> years<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:21.810> regenerate<00:05:22.810> the

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
next several years to regenerate the

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.800 
next several years to regenerate the
marsh<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:23.560> just<00:05:24.280> doing<00:05:24.569> improve<00:05:25.569> on

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
marsh and just doing improve on

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.469 
marsh and just doing improve on
biodiversity<00:05:26.349> and<00:05:26.979> one<00:05:27.909> of<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.150> other

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
biodiversity and one of the other

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.390 
biodiversity and one of the other
important<00:05:29.110> things<00:05:29.259> we've<00:05:29.470> done<00:05:29.710> is<00:05:29.949> to<00:05:30.219> get

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
important things we've done is to get

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.490 
important things we've done is to get
the<00:05:30.550> money<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:31.030> funding<00:05:31.479> for<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.139> viewing

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
the money the funding for a viewing

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.589 
the money the funding for a viewing
platform<00:05:32.650> near<00:05:33.580> the<00:05:33.669> visitor<00:05:33.969> center<00:05:34.270> which

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
platform near the visitor center which

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.320 
platform near the visitor center which
would<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.960> closer<00:05:35.289> to<00:05:35.560> the<00:05:35.860> marsh<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:37.210> the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
would be closer to the marsh to the

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.200 
would be closer to the marsh to the
ponds<00:05:37.599> and<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:38.650> viewing<00:05:39.190> platform<00:05:39.699> will<00:05:40.000> be

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
ponds and that viewing platform will be

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.420 
ponds and that viewing platform will be
wheelchair<00:05:40.780> accessible<00:05:40.810> so<00:05:41.710> we're<00:05:41.860> trying<00:05:42.009> to

have<00:06:16.599> so<00:06:16.779> very<00:06:17.080> few<00:06:17.319> wetlands<00:06:17.860> left<00:06:18.250> in<00:06:18.430> along

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
have so very few wetlands left in along

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.730 
have so very few wetlands left in along
the<00:06:19.300> North<00:06:19.479> Shore<00:06:19.599> maybe<00:06:20.349> because<00:06:20.560> of

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
the North Shore maybe because of

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.189 
the North Shore maybe because of
development<00:06:21.400> and<00:06:21.550> also<00:06:21.610> because<00:06:22.210> some<00:06:22.870> areas

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
development and also because some areas

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:25.230 
development and also because some areas
just<00:06:23.380> aren't<00:06:23.650> conducive<00:06:23.889> to<00:06:24.130> having<00:06:24.580> wetlands

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
just aren't conducive to having wetlands

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.760 
just aren't conducive to having wetlands
it's<00:06:25.449> a<00:06:25.539> professionally<00:06:26.050> significant

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:26.770 
it's a professionally significant

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.040 
it's a professionally significant
wetland<00:06:27.610> plus<00:06:27.969> one

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
wetland plus one

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.830 
wetland plus one
it's<00:06:29.590> going<00:06:29.830> to<00:06:29.949> basically<00:06:30.310> stay<00:06:30.940> like<00:06:31.629> that

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
it's going to basically stay like that

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.469 
it's going to basically stay like that
for<00:06:32.169> ages<00:06:32.620> to<00:06:33.069> come<00:06:33.370> the<00:06:33.819> area<00:06:34.240> is<00:06:34.360> a<00:06:34.389> little

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
for ages to come the area is a little

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.080 
for ages to come the area is a little
