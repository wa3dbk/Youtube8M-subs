00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
I'll start off with the packaging and

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.540 
I'll start off with the packaging and
comes<00:00:57.410> in<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:58.420> frosty<00:00:59.420> type<00:00:59.690> of<00:00:59.930> glass<00:01:00.550> bottle

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.720 
guys different brushes that I've used
two<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:39.989> is<00:03:40.139> flat<00:03:40.500> tops<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.129> one<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.549> a

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
two of it is flat tops and one is a

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.559 
two of it is flat tops and one is a
round<00:03:41.970> top<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:42.959> I'll<00:03:43.109> first<00:03:43.410> buff<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:44.099> the

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
round top but I'll first buff in the

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.379 
round top but I'll first buff in the
foundation<00:03:45.569> with<00:03:45.750> a<00:03:45.780> flat<00:03:46.230> top<00:03:46.500> I<00:03:47.150> find<00:03:48.150> that

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
foundation with a flat top I find that

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.479 
foundation with a flat top I find that
with<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.079> flat<00:03:49.409> top<00:03:49.650> you<00:03:49.799> still<00:03:50.069> kind<00:03:50.310> of<00:03:50.340> get<00:03:50.459> a

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
with a flat top you still kind of get a

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.189 
with a flat top you still kind of get a
light<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.940> medium<00:03:51.120> coverage<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:52.079> bit

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
light to medium coverage a little bit

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.680 
light to medium coverage a little bit
more<00:03:52.409> on<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.709> medium<00:03:53.099> side<00:03:53.430> compared<00:03:54.359> to<00:03:54.449> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
more on the medium side compared to the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.409 
more on the medium side compared to the
Beauty<00:03:55.319> Blender<00:03:55.669> because<00:03:56.669> it<00:03:56.879> still<00:03:57.180> covers

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
Beauty Blender because it still covers

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.530 
Beauty Blender because it still covers
up<00:03:57.750> more<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.650> my<00:03:59.280> scarring<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.150> everything

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
up more of my scarring and everything

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.050 
up more of my scarring and everything
like<00:04:00.659> that<00:04:00.720> and<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.919> just<00:04:02.129> kind<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.340> looks<00:04:02.609> it

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
like that and it just kind of looks it

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.390 
like that and it just kind of looks it
still<00:04:03.359> looks<00:04:03.599> airbrush<00:04:04.049> but<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:05.129> round

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
still looks airbrush but with the round

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.689 
still looks airbrush but with the round
pop<00:04:05.840> kabuki<00:04:06.840> brush<00:04:07.079> from<00:04:07.109> Sedona<00:04:07.829> lays<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.280> 480

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
pop kabuki brush from Sedona lays to 480

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:11.869 
pop kabuki brush from Sedona lays to 480
foot<00:04:08.989> brush<00:04:09.989> I<00:04:10.290> find<00:04:10.919> that<00:04:11.099> it<00:04:11.280> gives<00:04:11.489> me<00:04:11.669> a

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
foot brush I find that it gives me a

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.360 
foot brush I find that it gives me a
medium<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.780> full<00:04:13.019> coverage<00:04:13.049> I<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.680> think<00:04:14.190> that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
medium to full coverage I do think that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.969 
medium to full coverage I do think that
this<00:04:14.579> foundation<00:04:15.120> is<00:04:15.690> buildable<00:04:16.409> and<00:04:16.769> it

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
this foundation is buildable and it

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.750 
this foundation is buildable and it
doesn't<00:04:17.280> look<00:04:17.400> cakey<00:04:17.609> at<00:04:17.940> all<00:04:19.459> that's<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.639> my

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
doesn't look cakey at all that's just my

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.129 
doesn't look cakey at all that's just my
own<00:04:20.789> preference<00:04:21.150> I<00:04:21.449> don't<00:04:21.659> think<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:21.959> looks

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
own preference I don't think it looks

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.800 
own preference I don't think it looks
cakey<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:23.220> as<00:04:23.430> you<00:04:23.580> can<00:04:23.729> see<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.510> finished

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
cakey so as you can see the finished

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.450 
cakey so as you can see the finished
product<00:04:25.260> there<00:04:25.470> is<00:04:25.530> more<00:04:25.800> coverage<00:04:26.190> on<00:04:26.340> my

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
product there is more coverage on my

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.010 
product there is more coverage on my
right<00:04:26.639> side<00:04:26.909> of<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.180> face<00:04:27.389> where<00:04:27.599> I<00:04:27.690> use<00:04:27.840> of

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
right side of the face where I use of

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.170 
right side of the face where I use of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
brushes compared to the left side with a

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.210 
brushes compared to the left side with a
Beauty<00:04:30.539> Blender<00:04:30.570> but<00:04:31.470> even<00:04:31.770> though<00:04:31.889> I<00:04:31.919> still

so<00:05:28.730> you<00:05:28.790> guys<00:05:28.970> can<00:05:29.150> see<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:30.050> I<00:05:30.080> did<00:05:30.410> want<00:05:30.590> to

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
so you guys can see that I did want to

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.830 
so you guys can see that I did want to
add<00:05:30.890> on<00:05:31.100> extra<00:05:31.550> coverage<00:05:31.910> and<00:05:32.210> this<00:05:32.540> is<00:05:32.720> how

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
add on extra coverage and this is how

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.690 
add on extra coverage and this is how
the<00:05:32.900> foundation<00:05:33.410> looks<00:05:33.590> like<00:05:33.800> after<00:05:34.520> maybe

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
the foundation looks like after maybe

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.970 
the foundation looks like after maybe
10-15<00:05:35.510> minutes<00:05:35.810> of<00:05:35.960> its<00:05:36.140> setting<00:05:36.500> on<00:05:36.620> my<00:05:36.650> face

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
10-15 minutes of its setting on my face

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.250 
10-15 minutes of its setting on my face
so<00:05:37.250> it's<00:05:37.400> a<00:05:37.520> finally<00:05:37.970> set<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.840> don't<00:05:39.020> feel

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
so it's a finally set you don't feel

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.590 
so it's a finally set you don't feel
sticky<00:05:39.740> at<00:05:39.830> all<00:05:40.040> it<00:05:40.310> feels<00:05:40.610> lightweight<00:05:41.360> I

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
sticky at all it feels lightweight I

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.870 
sticky at all it feels lightweight I
don't<00:05:42.140> think<00:05:42.290> though<00:05:42.770> that<00:05:42.800> it<00:05:43.160> is<00:05:43.190> a<00:05:43.370> 10<00:05:43.670> hour

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
don't think though that it is a 10 hour

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.030 
don't think though that it is a 10 hour
where<00:05:44.210> foundation<00:05:44.240> just<00:05:45.050> for<00:05:45.230> me<00:05:45.500> because<00:05:46.010> I

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
it's super hot so I don't think it's ten

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:54.400 
it's super hot so I don't think it's ten
hours<00:05:52.130> I've<00:05:52.400> used<00:05:52.640> this<00:05:52.760> to<00:05:52.940> work<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.510> work

in<00:05:54.530> an<00:05:54.650> air-conditioned<00:05:55.310> place<00:05:55.340> but<00:05:56.090> I<00:05:56.120> think

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:56.510 
in an air-conditioned place but I think

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:58.780 
in an air-conditioned place but I think
after<00:05:56.720> eat<00:05:57.110> around<00:05:57.620> eight<00:05:57.950> hours<00:05:58.310> is<00:05:58.580> the

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
after eat around eight hours is the

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.630 
after eat around eight hours is the
longest<00:05:59.240> that<00:05:59.330> I<00:05:59.450> think<00:05:59.930> it'll<00:06:00.650> last<00:06:00.980> on<00:06:01.400> me

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640
