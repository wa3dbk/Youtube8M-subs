00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.390
 to do 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.830
 hello good friends told them to go 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.110
 making videos about different eggs 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.340
 good games this is a first video that 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.039
 this heads software tricks let's see 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.680
 first let's start with arcade 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:35.230
 easy 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.230
 and you choose any player you have 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.430
 any player who texas and who was going to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 play against the shura alone against his 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.840
 side he could ask you to follow 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.340
 spend money 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 then we go to sura 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.530
 the delay and go down for one that we have 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.730
 against the shura that now most played the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.309
 english look 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.610
 We play the question you must spend 50 of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.640
 points for a game against south 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.520
 and I say I am a home but if not 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.760
 you want to play with this player because he 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.480
 call something something the little arrows look 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.350
 then with the arrows 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.530
 changing let's put for example the 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.010
 Canadian 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 agreement we spend ask me points I do not 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.940
 I have a foundation, but if you have 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400
 if you can play with the game that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.920
 you want against sura even if you do not have 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 but you can only play when you 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.730
 ask if you want to spend 50 points on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.730
 next right trick what is 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.740
 the one in the league 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.740
 let's do it more than hour 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:51.680
 then to next games to follow the league 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.710
 finally with this same as the route and 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.010
 It is worth to follow 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.740
 then the league is already counted 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.450
 back when you give next you 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.070
 question do you want 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.710
 continue the help of the commented 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.780
 so 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.460
 you are changing about the dates then 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.460
 changing who wants to be like the other 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.460
 it's a little harder because you can 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.260
 catch those new laws because 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:24.290
 you will continue with the other player on 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.290
 lounge with the player is that I do not have 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.720
 another place 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.720
 for example the d 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.270
 the head coach easy like that of 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.380
 Cádiz sán exists question that to be 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:45.520
 50,000 points and more on the arrows 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.230
 they are watching with the player you want 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.830
 one that we do not have with him alone 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:59.010
 when we have we are in a few points 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.010
 and we play the tournament for the hours
