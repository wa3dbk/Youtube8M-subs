00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
someone thinks of somebody thinks

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.990 
someone thinks of somebody thinks
towards<00:02:45.239> somebody<00:02:45.540> then<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.440> Qi<00:02:47.000> according

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
towards somebody then the Qi according

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.009 
towards somebody then the Qi according
to<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:50.870> according<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:51.930> this

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
to the you know according to this

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.500 
to the you know according to this
formula<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.950> start<00:02:53.280> flowing<00:02:53.820> towards<00:02:54.300> them

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
formula will start flowing towards them

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.500 
formula will start flowing towards them
so<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.560> fight<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.700> my<00:02:56.850> hold<00:02:57.180> my<00:02:57.300> hand

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
so if we fight if I have my hold my hand

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.530 
so if we fight if I have my hold my hand
out<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.930> I<00:02:57.989> think<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.620> my<00:02:58.769> hand<00:02:59.090> then<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.120> Qi

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
out and I think of my hand then the Qi

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.740 
out and I think of my hand then the Qi
is<00:03:00.840> going<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.380> flow<00:03:01.650> into<00:03:01.980> my<00:03:02.280> hand<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:03.150> if<00:03:03.630> I

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
is going to flow into my hand and if I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.540 
is going to flow into my hand and if I
think<00:03:04.550> about<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.790> air<00:03:06.090> above<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:07.050> hand<00:03:07.550> then

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
think about the air above my hand then

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720 
think about the air above my hand then
the<00:03:08.580> Qi<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.630> flow<00:03:09.870> if<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.769> like<00:03:10.950> my

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
the Qi is going to flow if you like my

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.150 
the Qi is going to flow if you like my
Qi<00:03:12.120> if<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> exists<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.950> flow

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
Qi if that exists it's going to flow

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.670 
Qi if that exists it's going to flow
into<00:03:14.550> the<00:03:14.970> air<00:03:15.239> above<00:03:15.989> my<00:03:16.350> hand<00:03:18.320> to<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> certain

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
into the air above my hand to a certain

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.979 
into the air above my hand to a certain

there<00:03:39.690> they<00:03:40.170> might<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.500> sending<00:03:40.829> areas<00:03:41.160> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
there they might be sending areas to

send energy to these internal pictures

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.819 
send energy to these internal pictures
or<00:04:01.709> take<00:04:02.100> energy<00:04:02.310> away<00:04:02.519> from<00:04:03.320> these<00:04:04.320> internal

or take energy away from these internal
pictures<00:04:05.329> which<00:04:06.329> brings<00:04:06.600> me<00:04:06.780> basically

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
pictures which brings me basically

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.199 
pictures which brings me basically
there's<00:04:07.739> two<00:04:07.799> ways<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.549> dealing<00:04:08.730> the<00:04:09.000> cheese

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.880 
interested but let me know how to make a
cheat<00:04:17.880> ball<00:04:18.060> basically<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.229> can<00:04:19.470> see<00:04:19.680> from

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
cheat ball basically you can see from

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.000 
cheat ball basically you can see from
this<00:04:20.039> video<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.640> imagine<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.959> have<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.620> chi

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
this video you imagine you have a chi

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.990 
this video you imagine you have a chi
ball<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.120> have<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.300> chi<00:04:24.539> ball

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
ball and then you have a chi ball

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.480 
ball and then you have a chi ball
there<00:04:26.629> isn't<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.439> the<00:04:27.680> in<00:04:28.069> nature

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
there isn't that in the in nature

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.570 
there isn't that in the in nature
circular<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:30.050> circular<00:04:30.560> or<00:04:30.830> spiral<00:04:30.979> form

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
circular the circular or spiral form

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.499 
circular the circular or spiral form
returns<00:04:32.449> returns<00:04:33.229> to<00:04:33.620> us<00:04:33.680> time<00:04:34.189> and<00:04:34.340> again<00:04:34.580> as

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
returns returns to us time and again as

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:39.159 
returns returns to us time and again as
it<00:04:35.719> would<00:04:36.400> so<00:04:37.400> obviously<00:04:38.180> you<00:04:38.449> know<00:04:38.479> using<00:04:39.050> the

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
it would so obviously you know using the

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.520 
it would so obviously you know using the
ball<00:04:39.409> is<00:04:40.870> according<00:04:41.870> to<00:04:41.900> my<00:04:41.990> teacher<00:04:42.349> would

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
ball is according to my teacher would

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.080 
ball is according to my teacher would
say<00:04:42.710> that<00:04:42.860> she<00:04:43.039> travels<00:04:43.430> anyway<00:04:43.789> in<00:04:43.939> a

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
say that she travels anyway in a

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.850 
say that she travels anyway in a
circular<00:04:44.539> form<00:04:44.780> because<00:04:45.139> it<00:04:45.289> is<00:04:45.469> a<00:04:45.500> circular

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
circular form because it is a circular

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.379 
circular form because it is a circular
thing<00:04:46.099> and<00:04:46.819> everything<00:04:47.419> we<00:04:47.509> can<00:04:47.539> find<00:04:49.360> have<00:04:50.360> a

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
thing and everything we can find have a

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.420 
thing and everything we can find have a
smaller<00:04:50.840> smaller<00:04:51.379> and<00:04:51.620> smaller<00:04:51.830> we<00:04:51.979> look<00:04:52.189> we

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
smaller smaller and smaller we look we

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.369 
smaller smaller and smaller we look we
find<00:04:52.610> something<00:04:52.939> so<00:04:53.300> -<00:04:53.360> and<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:53.900> we<00:04:53.990> look<00:04:54.169> out

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
find something so - and then we look out

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.320 
find something so - and then we look out
outside<00:04:55.189> our<00:04:55.400> world<00:04:55.610> we<00:04:55.729> find<00:04:55.909> something

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
outside our world we find something

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.059
