00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
십자가군병들아
Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
by Van Denman Thompson
Hallelujah Choir 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
ye soldiers of the cross,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.300
Lift high His royal banner, 
it must not suffer loss.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:53.500
From victory unto victory 
His army shall He lead,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Till every foe is vanquished, 
and Christ is Lord indeed.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.400
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the trumpet call obey,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.500
Forth to the mighty conflict, 
in this His glorious day.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Ye that are brave now serve 
Him against unnumbered foes,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:41.000
Let courage rise with danger, 
and strength to strength oppose.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:03.000
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
stand in His strength alone,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The arm of flesh will fail you, 
ye dare not trust your owwn.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.500
Put on the Gospel armor, 
each piece put on with prayer,

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.800
Where duty calls or danger, 
be never wanting there.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.150
Flag height flag enter.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.850
Stand up, stand up for Jesus, 
the strife will not be long,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:53.000
This day the noise of battle, 
the next the victor's song.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000
To those who vanquish evil 
a crown of life shall be,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:13.000
They with the King of Glory 
shall reign eternally.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:25.100
Amen Amen
