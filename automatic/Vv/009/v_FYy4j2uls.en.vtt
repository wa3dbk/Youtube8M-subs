good<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.720> way<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.870> get<00:02:45.050> around<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.740> to

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
good the way to get around that is to

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.070 
good the way to get around that is to
close<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.520> app<00:02:47.800> and<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:50.360> go<00:02:50.660> ahead<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.990> go

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
back into the app and you can see your

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.150 
back into the app and you can see your
your<00:02:53.570> sizes<00:02:54.200> will<00:02:54.380> be<00:02:54.500> correct<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.070> that
