Hi everyone. So the sales numbers for Europe over the last week or so taking into account Drive Club VS Forza Horizon 2

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.770
Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One and Drive Club on PlayStation 4 do not make good reading

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.770
for Microsoft unfortunately. Now in my opinion, Forza Horizon 2 is a phenomenal game, better

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.550
than Drive Club. Certainly when we factor
in the technical problems that Drive Club

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.570
is having right now which frankly, after a
year on of delay they really should not have

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.350
been having. So what are these sales numbers looking like? PlayStation 4 has sold 96,000

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.190
units and around 16% of those sales come from a Drive Club bundle. Whereas the Xbox One

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.190
managed only 19,700 units in the same time period. This essentially puts the PlayStation

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:02.289
4 at a 5:1 selling advantage. Not inconsiderable at all. The issue really here is we've discussed

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.149
on this channel a few times is perception
is killing the Xbox One now. It doesn't matter Drive Club VS Forza Horizon 2

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.450
that they've actually got the best driving
game on the market right now and potentially

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.780
the best driving game this year. Unfortunately the install base of consoles means that people

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.860
are gravitating very rapidly towards what
is the driving game I can play on my

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.880
PS4. It's not unfortunately encouraging people to go out and buy an Xbox One to play Forza

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.880
Horizon 2. What can Microsoft do to stem this massive problem? Not a lot now unfortunately.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.989
They're going to have to ride it out for this
next year, start building up that install

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:45.989
base and start trying to convert people effectively into Xbox One gamers. Like I say, Drive Club

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.830
pulling one million units for a game that
effectively has some of the worst metacritic

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.310
scores for a driving game, certainly a first party title in a very long time, coupled with the substantial

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.200
technical problems they were having with their online servers, and it's even more remarkable Drive Club VS Forza Horizon 2

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.200
that people have flocked to buy Drive Club.
