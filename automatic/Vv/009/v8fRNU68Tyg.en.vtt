00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.950
 Hello everyone, my name is vincenzo 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.150
 I greet all my friends 

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:10.380
 this my bike is my transformation I was a little like that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.189
 in fixed land 

00:00:12.189 --> 00:00:16.519
 to perform this transformation guion harmon from her husband 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.609
 normal but mondom electric bike 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.999
 we all realize that 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.999
 now the time 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:34.739
 binkan send towards a great change that concerns unreal 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.140
 progress of civilization 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.530
 the beauty of our life 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.670
 it cannot be postponed to the future and depends directly on us who gives 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 our choices 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.270
 the bike as you all know 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.210
 queen - da da da leonardo da vinci 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.770
 and it is certainly one of the most brilliant insights 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.290
 die of the human race we try to take advantage of it 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 now the technology that allows us to be italy 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.640
 from the batteries accu electric motors for combustion engine is over 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.930
 shows a little bit about rolec features 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.430
 and details of my life is not a re formation 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.810
 first of all the engine 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.850
 it's a front engine 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.100
 futsal on the front wheel 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.050
 she is incontinent 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 is according to the law 250 watts a 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.860
 at 48 volts 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.140
 which means law standard engines must have the system pass 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.590
 the system passes 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.460
 here it is 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 this is the system passes 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.810
 petar assisted 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 which activates the motor only when 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.220
 himmler turn the petals 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.569
 the brakes are yesterday with the safety switches 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.899
 here here 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.749
 3d with the switches so that when 1 brakes the motor detaches gu 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.019
 certainly in a microcomputer 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.589
 that does the electrical management of all functions 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.499
 here it is 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.919
 and last but not least the batteries 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:40.449
 I opted for a battery pack 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.819
 lead gel 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.079
 I'm 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.779
 in fact a little bit heavy 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:51.259
 matcos are really cheap they are on the order of twenty euros a iodide 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.649
 mount 4 12 volt batteries sa 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.499
 - r have avv. 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.939
 a current 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.189
 room of a voltage of 48 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:03.439
 novem for now 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:05.379
 great 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.299
 also 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:09.469
 pecks 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.469
 of the artist light 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.109
 switch 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:18.519
 review 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.609
 and here it is 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.839
 we can leave 

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:24.839
 I take this opportunity to greet everyone 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.069
 ab to the realization 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.289
 hello everyone from vincenzo
