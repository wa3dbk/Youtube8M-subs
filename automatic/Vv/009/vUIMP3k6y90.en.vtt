00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
me on the shoulder and he said well I

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920 
me on the shoulder and he said well I
guess<00:01:41.040> those<00:01:41.250> scripts<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.180> dull<00:01:42.450> after<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
guess those scripts do get dull after a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.920 
guess those scripts do get dull after a
while<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> couldn't<00:01:45.360> tell<00:01:45.509> him<00:01:45.689> why<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
while and here I couldn't tell him why I

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.380 
while and here I couldn't tell him why I
had<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> lap<00:01:46.740> full<00:01:47.009> of<00:01:47.159> comic<00:01:47.520> books<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
had a lap full of comic books because it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.380 
had a lap full of comic books because it
was<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> big<00:01:48.840> secret<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.680> this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
was a big secret that you know this

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.499 
was a big secret that you know this
approaching<00:01:51.390> series<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:53.850> after<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.329> day

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
approaching series so then after a day

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
approaching series so then after a day
or<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.170> fairly<00:01:55.860> obvious<00:01:56.369> idea<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> seems

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
or so the fairly obvious idea it seems

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.459 
or so the fairly obvious idea it seems
obvious<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:58.259> least<00:01:58.469> to<00:01:59.990> make<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.200> so

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
obvious now at least to make it so

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.429 
obvious now at least to make it so
