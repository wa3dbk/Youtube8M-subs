isn't the last video I ever make okay so
let's<00:00:32.189> get<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
let's get to it

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330 
let's get to it
what<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.719> is<00:00:33.960> coming<00:00:34.170> from<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.559> socket<00:00:34.829> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
what I have is coming from the socket I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.370 
what I have is coming from the socket I
have<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:35.910> wire<00:00:36.149> there's<00:00:36.600> two<00:00:36.809> black<00:00:37.110> wires

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
have this wire there's two black wires

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.350 
have this wire there's two black wires
from<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.730> power<00:00:38.879> supply

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
from the power supply

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.389 
from the power supply
I<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:40.170> those<00:00:40.350> tied<00:00:40.590> together<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.160> wired

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
I have those tied together and wired

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.709 
I have those tied together and wired
into<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.329> hot<00:00:43.200> side<00:00:43.530> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:45.059> shorter

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
into the hot side which is the shorter

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.799 
into the hot side which is the shorter
pin<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.320> an<00:00:46.440> AC<00:00:46.559> socket<00:00:47.420> then<00:00:48.420> I'll<00:00:48.660> there's

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
pin on an AC socket then I'll there's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.750 
pin on an AC socket then I'll there's
two<00:00:49.020> red<00:00:49.410> wires<00:00:49.680> coming<00:00:50.070> from<00:00:50.190> there<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
two red wires coming from there and I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.319 
two red wires coming from there and I
have<00:00:50.940> those<00:00:51.239> run<00:00:51.690> into<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:53.149> neutral<00:00:54.149> side

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
have those run into the neutral side

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.779 
have those run into the neutral side
which<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.750> longer<00:00:55.230> slot<00:00:55.530> there's<00:00:56.460> also<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
which is the longer slot there's also a

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.760 
which is the longer slot there's also a
green<00:00:57.090> wire<00:00:57.329> which<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> ground<00:00:57.989> which<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
green wire which is ground which is the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380 
green wire which is ground which is the
third<00:00:58.980> pin<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> socket<00:00:59.879> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> that

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
third pin on a socket and I have that

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.060 
third pin on a socket and I have that
connected<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.590> terminal<00:01:01.890> here

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
connected to this little terminal here

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.179 
connected to this little terminal here
and<00:01:02.250> then<00:01:02.370> off<00:01:02.670> onto<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.660> chassis<00:01:03.920> because<00:01:04.920> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
and then off onto the chassis because I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.440 
and then off onto the chassis because I
don't<00:01:05.400> have<00:01:05.519> this<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.790> an<00:01:05.880> enclosure<00:01:06.119> right

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
don't have this in an enclosure right

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.670 
don't have this in an enclosure right
now<00:01:07.939> also<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.400> black<00:01:11.400> wires<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
now also on the black wires that is the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.630 
now also on the black wires that is the
hot<00:01:13.890> side<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.130> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> 12<00:01:15.180> amp<00:01:15.860> slow-burn<00:01:16.890> glass

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
hot side I have a 12 amp slow-burn glass

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.179 
hot side I have a 12 amp slow-burn glass
fuse<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> make<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.680> over

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
fuse you can kind of make it out over

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.899 
fuse you can kind of make it out over
here<00:01:20.700> all<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.210> good<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.689> right<00:01:22.790> here<00:01:23.790> in

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the corner I was just I was told on the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.850 
the corner I was just I was told on the
forums<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.470> good<00:01:28.680> idea

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
forums that that would be a good idea

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.969 
forums that that would be a good idea
just<00:01:29.759> in<00:01:29.880> case<00:01:30.030> something<00:01:30.240> goes<00:01:30.360> wrong<00:01:30.979> they

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
just in case something goes wrong they

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
just in case something goes wrong they
actually<00:01:32.310> wanted<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.759> what<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.299> contactor

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
actually wanted a what is it a contactor

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.690 
actually wanted a what is it a contactor
but<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.650> don't<00:01:35.040> even<00:01:35.130> know<00:01:35.250> what<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
but I don't even know what that is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.929 
but I don't even know what that is
so<00:01:36.030> I'll<00:01:36.600> get<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.229> day<00:01:37.880> all<00:01:38.880> right

so I'll get to that one day all right
moving<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.900> outputs<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.869> it's

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
moving on the outputs of this that it's

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.569 
moving on the outputs of this that it's
an<00:01:43.259> interesting<00:01:43.439> story<00:01:43.770> because<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.369> told

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
an interesting story because I was told

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.569 
an interesting story because I was told
in<00:01:44.850> order<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.180> get<00:01:45.299> 72<00:01:45.659> volts<00:01:46.020> DC<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.740> would<00:01:47.460> have

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
in order to get 72 volts DC I would have

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.460 
in order to get 72 volts DC I would have
to<00:01:47.670> wire<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.299> things<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.780> series<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to wire these things in series and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.780 
to wire these things in series and
you'll<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.920> green<00:01:50.220> wire<00:01:50.430> right<00:01:50.729> here

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
you'll see this green wire right here

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.630 
you'll see this green wire right here
going<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.520> basically<00:01:53.520> what

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
going from here to here basically what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.200 
going from here to here basically what
that's<00:01:53.729> doing<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.149> that's<00:01:54.180> connecting<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
that's doing is that's connecting the

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.120 
that's doing is that's connecting the
negative<00:01:57.210> side<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.020> left<00:01:58.380> channel<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
negative side of the left channel to the

negative side of the left channel to the
positive<00:01:59.640> side<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> right<00:02:00.479> channel<00:02:00.990> and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
positive side of the right channel and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.770 
positive side of the right channel and
essence<00:02:03.500> doubling<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.590> voltage<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.719> what<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
essence doubling the voltage and what I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.169 
essence doubling the voltage and what I
know<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.350> okay<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.849> would<00:02:09.000> make

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
know is that okay so now that would make

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.210 
know is that okay so now that would make
the<00:02:09.750> negative<00:02:10.410> on<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.679> side<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the negative on this side and the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.350 
the negative on this side and the
positive<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.730> this<00:02:11.940> side

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
positive on this side

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.170 
positive on this side
would<00:02:14.110> then<00:02:14.290> go<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:15.280> motors<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:15.820> all<00:02:15.940> that

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
would then go to the motors and all that

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
would then go to the motors and all that
but<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:18.040> noticing<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.080> go

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
but what I'm noticing is that if I go

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.240 
but what I'm noticing is that if I go
ahead<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.530> touch<00:02:20.710> these<00:02:22.470> that's<00:02:23.470> I<00:02:23.890> don't

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
ahead and touch these that's I don't

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.440 
ahead and touch these that's I don't
know<00:02:24.310> if<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:24.430> can<00:02:24.520> read<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.790> let<00:02:25.060> me<00:02:25.090> move<00:02:25.300> it

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
know if you can read it let me move it

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.810 
know if you can read it let me move it
over<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.930> coming<00:02:29.260> out<00:02:29.380> to<00:02:29.530> be<00:02:29.710> one<00:02:30.460> thirty

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
over it's coming out to be one thirty

eight point two volts point one that's

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.940 
eight point two volts point one that's
too<00:02:35.200> much<00:02:35.380> voltage<00:02:35.560> for<00:02:36.130> me<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.410> gate<00:02:38.620> goes<00:02:38.800> I

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
too much voltage for me the gate goes I

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.850 
too much voltage for me the gate goes I
believe<00:02:39.160> only<00:02:39.310> take<00:02:39.640> up<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:39.880> eighty<00:02:40.860> so

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
believe only take up to eighty so

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.170 
believe only take up to eighty so
anybody<00:02:42.280> out<00:02:42.430> there<00:02:42.460> correct<00:02:42.850> me<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.030> I'm

thirty four point three six ish this

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.990 
thirty four point three six ish this
side<00:03:44.470> also<00:03:44.620> puts<00:03:44.980> out<00:03:45.100> if<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.610> just<00:03:45.790> connect

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
side also puts out if I just connect

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.729 
side also puts out if I just connect
negative<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.540> positive<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:47.230> guess<00:03:47.260> you<00:03:47.560> get<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
negative to positive I guess you get the

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.660 
negative to positive I guess you get the
sixty<00:03:48.040> nine<00:03:48.070> point<00:03:48.519> two

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.040 

so<00:03:51.670> what<00:03:52.120> I'm<00:03:52.209> probably<00:03:52.360> gonna<00:03:52.540> end<00:03:52.630> up<00:03:52.720> doing

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
so what I'm probably gonna end up doing

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.170 
so what I'm probably gonna end up doing
is<00:03:53.170> I'm<00:03:53.230> probably<00:03:53.320> gonna<00:03:53.560> just<00:03:53.650> run<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.970> get

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
is I'm probably gonna just run to get

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.729 
is I'm probably gonna just run to get
goes<00:03:55.390> on<00:03:55.570> this<00:03:55.720> side<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.380> goes<00:03:56.530> on<00:03:56.620> this

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
goes on this side to get goes on this

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.140 
goes on this side to get goes on this
side<00:03:56.950> get<00:03:57.220> rid<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.640> jumper<00:03:59.100> so<00:04:00.150> basically

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
side get rid of this jumper so basically

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.479 
side get rid of this jumper so basically
the<00:04:01.330> geckos<00:04:01.600> will<00:04:01.750> be<00:04:01.840> getting<00:04:02.190> much<00:04:03.190> was<00:04:03.370> it

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
the geckos will be getting much was it

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:03.690 
the geckos will be getting much was it
again

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
again

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.120 
again
let's<00:04:04.120> see<00:04:05.130> sixty<00:04:06.130> nine<00:04:06.280> volts<00:04:08.010> that's<00:04:09.010> not

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
let's see sixty nine volts that's not

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.090 
let's see sixty nine volts that's not
too<00:04:09.220> bad<00:04:09.340> I<00:04:09.400> don't<00:04:09.700> think<00:04:09.910> so
