00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.640 
spread it up and down the driveway on
this<00:01:30.090> side<00:01:30.300> and<00:01:30.480> then<00:01:31.230> we're<00:01:31.320> gonna<00:01:31.410> have<00:01:31.560> to

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this side and then we're gonna have to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.550 
this side and then we're gonna have to
rake<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.040> across<00:01:32.660> we<00:01:33.660> didn't<00:01:33.930> quite<00:01:34.110> get<00:01:34.260> it<00:01:34.320> as
