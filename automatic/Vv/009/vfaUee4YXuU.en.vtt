was sick and see it I took a suspension
push<00:00:20.609> rod<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.560> mounted<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> piece<00:00:23.730> of

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
push rod and mounted it on a piece of

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.689 
push rod and mounted it on a piece of
aluminum<00:00:24.590> basically<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> took<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:26.010> three

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
aluminum basically I took a three

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.820 
aluminum basically I took a three
millimeter<00:00:26.910> drill<00:00:27.359> bit<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:27.630> drilled<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> hole<00:00:28.410> in

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
millimeter drill bit I drilled a hole in

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.450 
millimeter drill bit I drilled a hole in
the<00:00:28.920> center<00:00:29.340> then<00:00:30.119> two<00:00:30.330> holes<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.869> sides

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
the center then two holes on the sides

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.190 
the center then two holes on the sides
basically<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:33.000> screws<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> sides<00:00:33.930> are

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
basically the screws on the sides are

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
basically the screws on the sides are
just<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> screws<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.640> hold<00:00:35.910> in<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.210> shocks

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
just the screws that hold in the shocks

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.639 
just the screws that hold in the shocks
and<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> shock<00:00:37.200> mount<00:00:37.530> for<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.250> rear<00:00:38.460> end<00:00:39.649> so

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
and the shock mount for the rear end so

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
and the shock mount for the rear end so
I<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.460> threaded<00:00:41.879> those<00:00:42.059> through<00:00:42.420> so<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.809> hold

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
I just threaded those through so to hold

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.590 
I just threaded those through so to hold
the<00:00:43.290> plate<00:00:43.530> down<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.969> took<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> normal

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
the plate down then I just took a normal

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020 
the plate down then I just took a normal
three<00:00:45.750> millimeter<00:00:46.200> screw<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:47.460> had<00:00:47.820> laying

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
three millimeter screw that had laying

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.350 
three millimeter screw that had laying
around<00:00:48.500> and<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.770> put<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> nut<00:00:50.370> under<00:00:50.789> Neath<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
around and I put a nut under Neath the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.740 
around and I put a nut under Neath the
one<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> middle<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.500> hold<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> push<00:00:53.039> rod

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
one in the middle to hold the push rod

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.209 
one in the middle to hold the push rod
so<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:55.340> was<00:00:56.340> hard<00:00:56.670> mounted<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> front<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.780> it

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
so that was hard mounted the front of it

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:00.170 
so that was hard mounted the front of it
then<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> rear<00:00:59.520> is<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.670> little<00:00:59.940> bit<00:01:00.030> more

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
then the rear is a little bit more

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.780 
then the rear is a little bit more
difficult<00:01:01.699> see<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.110> yeah<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.430> I'm

make the brace then I popped out this
pillow<00:01:44.310> ball<00:01:44.579> out<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.780> time<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.729> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
pillow ball out of the time then so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.020 
pillow ball out of the time then so
pretty<00:01:48.509> much<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.220> something<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.820> looks

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
pretty much you get something that looks

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.740 
pretty much you get something that looks
like<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:53.340> time<00:01:54.030> with<00:01:54.299> no<00:01:54.479> pillow

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
like this just a time with no pillow

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
like this just a time with no pillow
ball<00:01:55.310> then<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.369> took<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.640> drill<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.390> drill

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
ball then I took a drill bit and drill

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
ball then I took a drill bit and drill
that<00:01:58.439> out<00:01:58.759> too<00:02:00.049> tightly<00:02:01.640> make<00:02:02.640> sure<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.060> not

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that out too tightly make sure it's not

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.920 
that out too tightly make sure it's not
loose<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.810> drilled<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.649> tightly<00:02:04.950> fit

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.670 

one<00:02:08.930> of<00:02:09.050> these<00:02:09.229> spacers<00:02:09.979> in<00:02:10.310> there<00:02:11.680> this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
one of these spacers in there this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740 
one of these spacers in there this
spacer<00:02:13.130> was<00:02:13.190> off<00:02:13.370> an<00:02:13.550> AK<00:02:13.730> CLA<00:02:14.180> x10

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
spacer was off an AK CLA x10

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020 
spacer was off an AK CLA x10
transmission<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.590> believe<00:02:15.890> that's<00:02:16.520> out<00:02:16.790> laying

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
transmission I believe that's out laying

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.860 
transmission I believe that's out laying
around<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.830> it's<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.250> plastic<00:02:19.870> spacer

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
around and it's just a plastic spacer

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.360 
around and it's just a plastic spacer
bushing<00:02:21.530> or<00:02:21.740> something<00:02:22.420> pretty<00:02:23.420> much<00:02:23.630> so

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
bushing or something pretty much so

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.820 
bushing or something pretty much so
there's<00:02:25.370> no<00:02:25.640> pivot<00:02:26.090> ball<00:02:26.270> anymore<00:02:26.830> because

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
there's no pivot ball anymore because

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.000 
there's no pivot ball anymore because
what<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.160> problem<00:02:28.550> was<00:02:28.730> for<00:02:29.570> the<00:02:30.010> exhaust

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
what the problem was for the exhaust

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.310 
what the problem was for the exhaust
hanger<00:02:31.580> back<00:02:31.790> here<00:02:32.240> that's<00:02:32.600> a<00:02:32.930> four

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
hanger back here that's a four

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.520 
hanger back here that's a four
millimeter<00:02:33.560> screw<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:36.290> screws<00:02:36.680> for<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
millimeter screw and the screws for the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.740 
millimeter screw and the screws for the
suspension<00:02:39.790> push<00:02:40.790> rods<00:02:41.090> are<00:02:41.450> three

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
suspension push rods are three

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.280 
suspension push rods are three
millimeter<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.400> wouldn't<00:02:43.670> work<00:02:43.850> so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
millimeter so it wouldn't work so

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.800 
millimeter so it wouldn't work so
basically<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.680> used<00:02:46.370> this<00:02:49.060> little<00:02:50.060> bushing

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
basically I used this little bushing

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.880 
basically I used this little bushing
spacer<00:02:51.350> thing<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.780> drilled<00:02:53.780> it<00:02:53.930> out<00:02:54.050> then<00:02:54.860> I

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
spacer thing and drilled it out then I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.420 
spacer thing and drilled it out then I
took<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.250> Vice<00:02:55.870> then<00:02:56.870> I<00:02:57.020> pressed<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:57.620> in<00:02:57.860> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
took the Vice then I pressed it in the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.790 
took the Vice then I pressed it in the
side<00:02:58.730> I<00:02:58.760> took<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.480> pillow<00:03:00.080> ball<00:03:00.350> out<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:02.800> pay

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
side I took the pillow ball out and pay

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.280 
side I took the pillow ball out and pay
much<00:03:04.040> just<00:03:04.250> mounted<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.820> on<00:03:04.970> from<00:03:05.209> there<00:03:05.450> so

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
much just mounted it on from there so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.400 
much just mounted it on from there so
far<00:03:06.560> it<00:03:06.980> works<00:03:07.520> pretty<00:03:07.820> well

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
far it works pretty well

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.650 
far it works pretty well
I've<00:03:09.410> used<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:09.950> for<00:03:09.980> probably<00:03:10.940> at<00:03:11.330> least<00:03:11.360> a

from<00:04:48.590> the<00:04:48.830> push<00:04:49.760> rod<00:04:50.000> itself<00:04:51.430> so<00:04:52.430> yeah<00:04:52.729> that's

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
from the push rod itself so yeah that's

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.980 
from the push rod itself so yeah that's
pretty<00:04:53.120> much<00:04:53.389> what<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.780> did<00:04:54.610> yeah<00:04:55.610> it's<00:04:55.970> it<00:04:56.630> only

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
pretty much what I did yeah it's it only

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.320 
pretty much what I did yeah it's it only
took<00:04:57.430> and<00:04:58.430> probably<00:05:00.729> they're<00:05:01.729> either<00:05:01.910> 40

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
took and probably they're either 40

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.990 
took and probably they're either 40
minutes<00:05:02.660> max<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.289> make<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:03.979> so<00:05:04.520> far<00:05:04.820> it's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
minutes max to make it and so far it's

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.100 
minutes max to make it and so far it's
been<00:05:05.060> pretty<00:05:05.180> effective<00:05:05.570> as<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:07.070> stopped<00:05:08.110> my

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
been pretty effective as it stopped my

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.219 
been pretty effective as it stopped my
headers<00:05:09.710> from<00:05:09.979> bending<00:05:10.430> or<00:05:10.610> completely

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
headers from bending or completely

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.600 
headers from bending or completely
shearing<00:05:12.229> off<00:05:12.380> as<00:05:12.740> that's<00:05:13.039> happened<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.580> couple

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
shearing off as that's happened a couple

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.749 
shearing off as that's happened a couple
times<00:05:13.910> now<00:05:14.800> all<00:05:15.800> right<00:05:15.949> well<00:05:16.190> if<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.400> have<00:05:16.610> any

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
times now all right well if you have any

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.529 
times now all right well if you have any
more<00:05:16.849> questions<00:05:17.090> just<00:05:17.720> post<00:05:18.259> a<00:05:18.470> comment<00:05:18.919> and

that's<00:05:20.539> pretty<00:05:20.690> much<00:05:20.810> it

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
that's pretty much it

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.520
