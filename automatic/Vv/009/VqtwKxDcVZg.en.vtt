originally I thought you'd get at least
one<00:00:32.040> per<00:00:32.340> week<00:00:32.550> per<00:00:32.880> character<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.809> you

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
one per week per character when you

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.420

that's<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.149> happened<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> me<00:00:36.840> during<00:00:37.079> my

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
that's what happened to me during my

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
that's what happened to me during my
time<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.680> game<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.100> went<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> Bungie

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
time with a game when I went to Bungie

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
time with a game when I went to Bungie
however<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.690> quickly<00:00:40.020> realized<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
however we quickly realized that this

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.330 
however we quickly realized that this
was<00:00:41.969> not<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.270> case<00:00:42.750> there<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> low<00:00:44.040> chance

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
was not the case there is a low chance

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.130 
was not the case there is a low chance
to<00:00:44.640> get<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> key<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.149> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> small

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
to get a key from one of the small

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
to get a key from one of the small
chests<00:00:46.649> but<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.370> not<00:00:47.760> reliable<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.629> any

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
chests but this is not reliable in any

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.290 
chests but this is not reliable in any
way<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.440> think<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.860> gotten<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.579> keys<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
way I think I've gotten two keys out of

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.170 
way I think I've gotten two keys out of
15<00:00:51.840> or<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.170> runs<00:00:52.500> also<00:00:53.190> for<00:00:53.760> those<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
15 or so runs also for those of you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.450 
15 or so runs also for those of you
working<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:54.629> level<00:00:54.870> 35<00:00:55.230> there<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.039> an<00:00:56.250> issue

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
working on level 35 there is an issue

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
working on level 35 there is an issue
right<00:00:56.670> now<00:00:56.940> with<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.510> first<00:00:57.809> time<00:00:58.199> rewards

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
key some players have reported just

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.530 
key some players have reported just
straight-up<00:01:14.159> not<00:01:14.640> getting<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> items<00:01:15.450> from

straight-up not getting the items from
the<00:01:15.689> chest<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.110> well<00:01:16.290> which<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.560> an<00:01:17.040> issue<00:01:17.310> that

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
the chest as well which is an issue that

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.370 
the chest as well which is an issue that
I<00:01:17.610> have<00:01:17.820> no<00:01:18.119> way<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.420> addressing<00:01:18.630> other<00:01:19.110> than

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
I have no way of addressing other than

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
I have no way of addressing other than
the<00:01:20.040> items<00:01:20.340> should<00:01:20.549> really<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.060> drop<00:01:21.330> from

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
the items should really just drop from

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.719 
the items should really just drop from
Scola's<00:01:22.020> himself<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.770> not<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.460> chest

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
Scola's himself and not the chest

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
Scola's himself and not the chest
hopefully<00:01:24.270> Bungie<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.810> resolve<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.320> issue

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
hopefully Bungie can resolve that issue

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.390 
hopefully Bungie can resolve that issue
right<00:01:26.520> now<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> only<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.770> reliably<00:01:28.770> farm

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
right now the only way to reliably farm

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.850 
right now the only way to reliably farm
keys<00:01:29.820> is<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.360> find<00:01:30.810> bounty<00:01:31.290> targets<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
keys is to find bounty targets in the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
keys is to find bounty targets in the
wild<00:01:32.220> kill<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> then<00:01:33.509> form<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.110> chests

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
wild kill them and then form the chests

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.190 
wild kill them and then form the chests
however<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.880> nothing<00:01:36.119> reliable<00:01:36.930> about

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
however there is nothing reliable about

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200 
however there is nothing reliable about
this<00:01:37.500> as<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.920> keys<00:01:38.189> have<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.460> very<00:01:38.700> low<00:01:38.909> drop

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
this as the keys have a very low drop

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
this as the keys have a very low drop
rate<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.630> are<00:01:40.020> basically<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.500> RNG<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.579> get

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
rate and are basically just RNG to get

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.030 
rate and are basically just RNG to get
you<00:01:42.479> could<00:01:42.689> come<00:01:42.930> away<00:01:43.140> with<00:01:43.290> three<00:01:43.590> keys<00:01:43.890> in

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you could come away with three keys in

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.819 
you could come away with three keys in
an<00:01:44.159> hour<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.670> no<00:01:45.090> keys<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.420> three<00:01:45.960> hours<00:01:46.110> this

an hour or no keys in three hours this

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.580 
an hour or no keys in three hours this
is<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.340> fun<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> do<00:01:48.030> at<00:01:48.270> all<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.350> much

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is not fun to do at all I would much

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
is not fun to do at all I would much
rather<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.399> key<00:01:50.820> per<00:01:51.180> hour<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.990> knew<00:01:52.320> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
rather get one key per hour if I knew I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.889 
rather get one key per hour if I knew I
would<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.979> key<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.520> opposed<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> key

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
would get a key as opposed to key

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.260 
would get a key as opposed to key
farming<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> way<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.950> right<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.280> key

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
farming the way it is right now key

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630 
farming the way it is right now key
farming<00:01:57.659> should<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.020> easier<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.430> in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
farming should be easier to do not in

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.179 
farming should be easier to do not in
terms<00:01:59.790> of<00:02:00.030> difficulty<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.320> rather<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.890> terms

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
terms of difficulty but rather in terms

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.880 
terms of difficulty but rather in terms
of<00:02:02.509> consistency<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.229> what<00:02:04.380> can<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.740> to

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
of consistency so what can we do to

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.069 
of consistency so what can we do to
increase<00:02:05.040> reliable<00:02:06.000> key<00:02:06.270> drops<00:02:06.600> while<00:02:06.840> not

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
increase reliable key drops while not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.740 
increase reliable key drops while not
subjecting<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.890> RNG<00:02:08.580> well<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.690> a

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
subjecting it to RNG well I have a

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.150 
subjecting it to RNG well I have a
couple<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.080> suggestions<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.770> I've<00:02:10.860> seen<00:02:11.099> a

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
couple of suggestions and I've seen a

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.130 
couple of suggestions and I've seen a
good<00:02:11.370> suggestion<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.030> well<00:02:12.270> the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
good suggestion as well the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.050 
good suggestion as well the
the<00:02:13.260> idea<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.650> to<00:02:13.770> have<00:02:13.890> key<00:02:14.190> fragments<00:02:14.790> drop

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
the idea is to have key fragments drop

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.390 
the idea is to have key fragments drop
from<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.420> prison<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.810> elders<00:02:15.990> small<00:02:16.680> chests

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.900 
from the prison of elders small chests
one<00:02:17.970> fragment<00:02:18.270> for<00:02:18.600> level<00:02:18.870> 28<00:02:19.319> to<00:02:19.800> 432<00:02:20.400> 3<00:02:20.760> for

one fragment for level 28 to 432 3 for

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.540 
one fragment for level 28 to 432 3 for
34<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.540> possibly<00:02:21.959> even<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.440> full<00:02:22.680> key<00:02:22.920> for<00:02:23.130> 35

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
34 and possibly even a full key for 35

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.610 
34 and possibly even a full key for 35
or<00:02:23.790> at<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> very<00:02:24.240> least<00:02:24.450> almost<00:02:25.350> enough

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
or at the very least almost enough

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.830 
or at the very least almost enough
fragments<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> make<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> full<00:02:26.730> key<00:02:26.970> require

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
fragments to make a full key require

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.380 
fragments to make a full key require
four<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.500> five<00:02:28.709> or<00:02:29.100> maybe<00:02:29.190> six<00:02:29.340> key<00:02:29.820> fragments

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
four to five or maybe six key fragments

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.110 
four to five or maybe six key fragments
to<00:02:30.540> forge<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.200> key<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:32.190> way<00:02:32.400> if<00:02:32.640> people<00:02:32.940> just

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to forge one key this way if people just

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.760 
to forge one key this way if people just
want<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> farm<00:02:33.750> prison<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.140> elders<00:02:34.260> for<00:02:34.560> keys

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
want to farm prison of elders for keys

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.770 
want to farm prison of elders for keys
they<00:02:35.310> can<00:02:35.520> do<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.820> maybe<00:02:36.120> up<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.480> cap

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
they can do that maybe up to a cap

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.140 
they can do that maybe up to a cap
though<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.740> think<00:02:37.920> giving<00:02:38.220> one<00:02:38.490> full<00:02:38.820> key

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
though I don't think giving one full key

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.420 
though I don't think giving one full key
for<00:02:39.420> every<00:02:40.050> run<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.500> good<00:02:40.709> idea<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.100> think

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
for every run is a good idea I think

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340 
for every run is a good idea I think
that's<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:41.790> bit<00:02:41.910> too<00:02:42.209> much<00:02:42.510> but<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.170> like

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
that's a little bit too much but I like

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.680 
that's a little bit too much but I like
the<00:02:43.560> idea<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.920> key<00:02:44.250> fragments<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.090> being<00:02:45.480> able

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the idea of key fragments and being able

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.870 
the idea of key fragments and being able
to<00:02:45.840> get<00:02:46.110> rewarded<00:02:46.739> little<00:02:47.130> by<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.580> but

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
to get rewarded little by little but

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.690 
to get rewarded little by little but
consistently<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.620> next<00:02:49.950> suggestion<00:02:50.430> is<00:02:50.580> to

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
consistently the next suggestion is to

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.850 
consistently the next suggestion is to
have<00:02:50.850> petra<00:02:51.390> venj<00:02:51.570> give<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> key<00:02:52.500> for

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
have petra venj give you a key for

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.740 
have petra venj give you a key for
completing<00:02:53.370> all<00:02:53.519> the<00:02:53.550> bounties<00:02:54.180> for<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.570> week

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
completing all the bounties for the week

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.020 
completing all the bounties for the week
it's<00:02:55.230> six<00:02:55.590> targets<00:02:55.830> worth<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.340> bounty<00:02:56.670> hunting

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it's six targets worth of bounty hunting

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.810 
it's six targets worth of bounty hunting
takes<00:02:57.239> maybe<00:02:57.510> 30<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.019> 45<00:02:58.380> minutes<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.130> I

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
takes maybe 30 to 45 minutes to do and I

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.240 
takes maybe 30 to 45 minutes to do and I
think<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.239> reasonable<00:03:01.050> for<00:03:01.230> getting<00:03:01.620> one<00:03:01.860> key

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
think is reasonable for getting one key

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.940 
think is reasonable for getting one key
plus<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.239> incentivizes<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:04.110> bounties<00:03:04.440> after

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
plus it incentivizes the bounties after

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.009 
plus it incentivizes the bounties after
people<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.459> reached<00:03:05.730> max<00:03:06.180> reputation<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
people have reached max reputation and

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.440 
people have reached max reputation and
continues<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> give<00:03:08.340> people<00:03:08.580> reason<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.269> go

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
continues to give people reason to go

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.259 
continues to give people reason to go
out<00:03:09.630> into<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.019> wild<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.370> you<00:03:11.910> know<00:03:12.030> it's

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
out into the wild that and you know it's

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.750 
out into the wild that and you know it's
only<00:03:12.390> one<00:03:12.480> key<00:03:12.870> per<00:03:13.110> week<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.950> last<00:03:14.160> idea<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.640> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
only one key per week the last idea is a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.330 
only one key per week the last idea is a
great<00:03:15.030> idea<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.630> saw<00:03:16.080> on<00:03:16.290> Reddit<00:03:16.709> by<00:03:16.860> users

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
great idea I saw on Reddit by users

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.360

judgment for a treasure key I think this

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.100 
judgment for a treasure key I think this
is<00:03:25.620> an<00:03:25.799> absolutely<00:03:26.670> great<00:03:26.940> idea<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.690> tokens
