00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:09.850
 have you ever heard such a term 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.280
 form factor is essentially a degree 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.020
 sophistication of designers and engineers 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.090
 filling all the gadgets about the same 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.400
 what remains to play correctly with the form 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.860
 so we see the bent devices 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.230
 the smartphone and the button screens themselves are not there 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.600
 where do you expect them well and cleverly folded 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.760
 corps however sometimes such decisions 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.520
 are both successful and convenient 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.680
 For example, six months ago in Russia appeared 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.659
 transformer lenovo ideapad yoga 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.149
 michael bay with their autobot here not 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:40.600
 and all the cases of patented hinges 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.409
 you need a laptop please tired 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.519
 bent 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:47.530
 I taught the tablet and you can do it this way or that way 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.420
 pay tribute to this scavenger volumes 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.239
 sky synthesis lineup they didn't stop 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.159
 on achieved and made a tablet so 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.379
 the same name they say a joke repeated 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:01:00.389
 twice it gets twice as fun 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.389
 but this is not the case here everything is serious 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.250
 lenovo yoga tablet appeared pretty 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.840
 unexpectedly samsung and apple don't 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.390
 there were no leaks no one lost 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 The gadget in the bars just took announced 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.369
 people did not expect such a surprise was 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.369
 in slight bewilderment 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.750
 but when the famous actor ashton 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.210
 Kutcher introduced as a new engineer 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.210
 lenovo in the world has become a couple here 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.940
 you study bile jokes more in the hands of 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.930
 me a 10-inch yoga tablet seemingly 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.259
 ordinary tablet 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.990
 but what is this exactly for this unit and 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.060
 all the power of the gadget is you languages 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.000
 as usually claimed that the idea is lapped up and 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.619
 all came up gave nola oh oh oh how not 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.970
 ashamed 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.890
 indeed yoga tablet has an example 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.659
 some similarity sony tablet s or 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.060
 supra mcs 27 g 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.130
 but only similarities but the most evil 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.940
 say change to keyboard for mac and 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.650
 you all understand well look oh sorry 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.630
 apple did not patent elongated 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.819
 cylinder smoothly rolling plane 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.620
 is new lucky thanks to this 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.680
 The features of the tablet are incredibly comfortable 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.350
 lies in the hand of course this is not a book but everything 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.150
 same feeling different from those when 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.700
 you keep an ordinary tablet and obviously for the better 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.340
 side of the example of the cancellation weighs 300 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.230
 grams iyoga twice as much but this 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.150
 the difference to be honest is practically not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.799
 felt by the way due to the unusual 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.170
 constructions managed to reduce the overall 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.959
 device thickness well one more secret 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.440
 inside the battery is 9 thousand mA 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.600
 o'clock 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.690
 device keeps afloat incredibly 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.519
 long producer says about 18 hours 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.829
 work but since the parameters are all 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.930
 loose I can only say that yoga can 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.150
 compete with the same ipad mini 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:00.609
 and now you are ready for magic 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:03.070
 sim-salabim thanks to this aluminum 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.480
 the tablet takes the perfect 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.549
 typing position 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.069
 carbon itself is secured quite reliably 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.569
 that you will need to open the skill but 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.430
 it's like a zippo lighter case 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.519
 practice a day or two and all you have 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 work out and now try 2 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.810
 take a slight 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.180
 great by the way have you noticed that lenovo 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.180
 made your version of the graphical shell 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.829
 yes and here we got to the first weak 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:38.220
 seats inside quad processor 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.349
 from mtk but budget series judging system 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 according to the testimony of special tests below 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.220
 middle 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.099
 if you use a daily set 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.840
 applications mail browser video music 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.540
 light toys you hardly notice 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:56.540
 twitching pause but worth running 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.540
 something resource intensive and put out the light 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 finally the console mode is just 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.389
 turn the tablet and get 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.730
 great for watching videos 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.920
 tilt angle adjustable true 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.879
 maximum is better not to reach the tablet 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.560
 can tip over 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.859
 it is easy to see that the screen has 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.659
 good brightness excellent viewing angles and 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:18.320
 weak resolution after modern 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:21.419
 hd displays and especially screens retina 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.479
 1280 by 800 seems like yesterday afternoon 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.599
 I will add that the tablet is equipped with two 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.490
 stereo speakers 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:28.349
 which settings are possible in known 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.780
 limits change using the app 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.300
 debts at one of the ends of the cylinder button 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.810
 inclusions from the opposite below under 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.539
 headphones comfortable micro beaten buttons 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.180
 volume by the way too small constantly 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.310
 miss under the reclining support 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.110
 hiding slot under the card necrosis 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.570
 some modifications here 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.800
 Simka is well and original 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.659
 conveniently located camera 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.139
 work when you hold the tablet 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.139
 a little book 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.850
 as experts say 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.670
 lenovo yoga tablet turned device 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:04.770
 controversial until its form factor is unusual but 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.260
 comfortable and sure to please those who do not 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.300
 parting with the tablet materials assembly 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.100
 I would put a solid four, but for 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.830
 performance evaluation screens will have to 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.790
 reduce to satisfactory let's say 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.680
 in our area 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.990
 this bird is rare and not everyone can 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:22.170
 tame but given the fact that the price of 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.060
 The 10 inch version ranges from 12 to 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.130
 14 thousand that is, does not go beyond 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.290
 categories need to think 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:30.200
 tablet may well decorate your personal 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.520
