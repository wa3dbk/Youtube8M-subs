00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.240
 that's what could not be done 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.710
 inside is going to be done now 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.849
 that is, the trainer of 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.549
 flipping could be done side 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 hull but side deck you can not 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.670
 because when once it was too much 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.439
 did not have height in the shed 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.880
 so we have to do it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.710
 complement 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 quickly made plywood that is missing for 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.779
 make the trainers adjust them 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.220
 I had it had been prepared a little 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 before we knew the shapes but 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 that's it and we put them in place 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.220
 with those already on the hull 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.030
 the goal is anchored in circle words in 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.640
 wherein the vessel will roll smoothly without 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.040
 blow and it's certainly there are taken over 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.540
 on the structure of the boat ie 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.800
 that there is no risk of deforming the hull 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.970
 in one place it is imperative that this 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:59.519
 either in front of the partitions 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:01:00.629
 main there are some tips to put 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.339
 before returning to the well of 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.390
 drift because it's the same we go by 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:04.710
 lift the boat once it will be 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.780
 in the yard so this drifting well 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 we had made next we were 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.320
 obliged to wait until the boat is 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.610
 outside to put it in it must 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.930
 just if there is no collar and that's 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 just my son aymon finish the last 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.220
 fitting and put it in his housing 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 is stuck temporarily it will be glued 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 later so the ball and the hole is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.610
 done but as usual there is always a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.490
 little small allowance by here 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 little trick a little bowl made 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.079
 and here it is, but overall it comes 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.079
 still 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.240
 the trainers are ready there is 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.979
 more than to roll we shift the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.759
 boat hoping they do not leave 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.649
 drive alone 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.439
 normally not alas it's the crane in 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.799
 does it help it start up to roll 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.299
 and who will then slow down the descent of 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.520
 the other side 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.690
 but here the problem is to adjust 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.100
 constantly the long hours for not 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.240
 that it goes too fast in one direction or 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.680
 that it comes back in the other direction so 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.810
 That's why 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 we are the world that ensures 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.390
 buttes in fact they ensure the adjustment 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.700
 for that very long cases works 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.160
 always at the same time 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.020
 operation does not impress me since 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.390
 I had already returned boats from 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.150
 this size here finally 60 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.800
 feet the same way good even if the one 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.780
 there is heavier 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.830
 it can not happen much what 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.330
 can happen is that the boat or a 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.850
 little too fast or you not obvious so 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.270
 but here is there not a risk of damaging large 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.550
 thing 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.410
 it was a lot less problematic 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.900
 roll the boat for their tour 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:45.430
 than to get it out of the hangar upside down and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.140
 moreover it goes faster and here are the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.910
 cons trainer he suffers a bit because 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.040
 that again we do not have a single 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.360
 parent does is that in addition to the cons 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.670
 bridge side trainer were not 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.800
 laminate but overall they have 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.300
 very well done their duties 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.760
 so in fact we take our time to 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.830
 to roll it and there now he 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.930
 works more than on 2 zinc and that's 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.180
 his weight he keeps rolling 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.510
 so the grÃ¼ne is just there for that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.510
 curb 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.739
 and there it stabilizes in fact it has a 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.450
 stable position 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.760
 so there we change we move the 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.620
 slings to finish because there you have to 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.269
 that the crane pulls back on the other 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.530
 him winter to finish his turn 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.700
 it's a nice moment because it's at 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.319
 say for the first time we see the 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.160
 boat pretty much in the right direction and 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:44.660
 especially we do not see as a whole 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.610
 until then we did not have much 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.410
 seen in hindsight I discovered it 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.569
 like everyone nobody had 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.989
 actually saw its forms with a little bit of 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.420
 recoil and yes the satisfaction is there 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.959
 it's a boat that looks aesthetic 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.200
 already despite its size and volume 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:07.420
 there are still limits to and one 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.420
 general line who is nice 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.519
 so that's the only moment of 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.710
 truth we know how much he weighs 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.810
 now towards big c 9 tons 8 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.070
 so that's good we said between 10 and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.690
 11 it was an estimate not 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.730
 the precise hyper but with respect to 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.700
 materials put in and that confirms 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.990
 we are in the nails 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.600
 Here we see it for the first time 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.370
 as a whole that is now fighting 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.860
 slide the cart underneath to 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.710
 their return so this one can 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.120
 use a real trolley a boat a 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.460
 hydraulic trolley which is still 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.190
 a bit just in size but there is no 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.930
 a lot of big available so but in 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.100
 load it does it without problem there is 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.260
 just a disadvantage is that it is a 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.440
 little short is yesterday that the boat is 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.290
 well exceeds a lot in front and behind 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.520
 and but the advantage of heckling 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.200
 hydraulic is that there to pass the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.510
 cant we have no problem since we 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.840
 can play on the plate thanks to the waters 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.840
 to 1 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:26.330
 there is too much I still straighten it 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.250
 that's what surprised everyone 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.270
 already know if it would come upside down and 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.640
 if he comes back to the place I had 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.230
 still check on what plans 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.820
 but it impressed everyone and we 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:39.980
 really has the feeling at times that 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.030
 the boat is not going to go there, we say 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.730
 that it's not possible it can not 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:52.940
 to enter it does not go up and in 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:56.210
 width and if yet his part is 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.170
 calculated at the fairest it was checked 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.580
 what can not be said that it was 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.780
 calculated since the shed was not done 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.000
 especially lost but we do not have 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:12.830
 cut off either the bulkheads of the boat or 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:14.330
 their shed then once inside 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.020
 we wanted to position it ideally 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.430
 to optimize the work because we 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.200
 is still here for a moment in this 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.850
 worksite to easily bypasses 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.700
 around that there is room for them 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.110
 machines and 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.750
 especially by saying we can 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.670
 move the boat after he's going to be stalled 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:37.670
 definitely on his who on a line 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:39.560
 of complexion classically after once 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.240
 calais boat in the yard is good 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:44.600
 stalled so definitely so that there 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.060
 stays two years one is one-third of the 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:49.070
 shipyard when the case the hull is made 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.289
 it's a third a little third of the 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.610
 shipyard after it's 

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.289
 another third for all that is 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.050
 carpentry layout is still a 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.189
 third for the team and this boat so 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.349
 now it's a good slice of 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.529
 done but we are not yet at the end of 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:02.529
 thing
