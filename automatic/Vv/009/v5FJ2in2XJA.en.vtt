00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 france cac and marathon 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 it is true that the fact of having grace cuática 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.039
 concludes this polar bear expert 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.199
 with the head of this black bear 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.909
 look how the head of the polar bear is narrowed I made pointy 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.970
 this course has to swim 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 and nothing shorter water better than a head like this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.759
 the Chicano the happiest mammal on earth 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.989
 it also has a small head 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.989
 his slender, streamlined body cuts the air 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.310
 just like the head of the polar bear cuts the water 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.329
 this does not mean that big headed animals can not be fast 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.900
 the rhinoceros 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.260
 and the bison can compete with the best in short distances 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.560
 the long-distance runners 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.790
 and the swimmers 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.860
 The census has a body shape to optimize the speed 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.950
 while we are in the water it comes to mind is present all the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.949
 animals need legs 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.730
 even when they have wings 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.730
 parents need legs to walk 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.470
 hold on 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.290
 and catch growing 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.720
 the birds that do not fly like the ostrich and the emu has their legs for 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.810
 make the trips they need 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 if an elusive group run like the wind 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.840
 also the time they do not fly they need legs to walk on land 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.410
 but their villages and they turned into the e3 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.330
 or those of water 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.670
 to be able to popular Basque in lakua 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.720
 the front legs of sea turtles became alert to 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.320
 stop 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 also fly underwater 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.760
 the dolphins are mammals that breathe air 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.150
 and they live in the sea 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.460
 and clearly they do not have arms or legs but they have alerts 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 and a long tail 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.719
 spikins swim by moving your body up and down 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.499
 same as the manatee 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.449
 another aquatic mammal 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.449
 it's very different from how a good majority of fish 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:28.789
 a fish moves its body from side to side or the tail back and forth 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.620
 this movement puja keep back to forward pushing the weight 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:40.359
 Of course there are always exceptions 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.439
 legs who need 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.439
 underwater nobody 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.909
 Of course there are some animals that seem to have too many legs 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:58.819
 teka tarantula is a very large spider with 4 50 the four pairs of legs 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.079
 for years are not insects are our forums 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.939
 unlike insects, no antenna is high and they only have 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.939
 little eyes instead of big bulging eyes 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.250
 we look closely at them as if the tarantula had ten legs 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.939
 but these two of the two front appendages is called lopez and boxes 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
 and they use like radars not like legs 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.989
 talking about eights 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.489
 how an octopus moves if it has eight arms but none tender 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:37.679
 this aquatic invertebrate is a propellant chip 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:39.659
 this detail 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 and that throws the cynicism of the place the place 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:46.999
 if you need legs 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.199
 neither five hours 

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:53.199
 the great reptiles fish and since many humans 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.379
 in the fact is that the figure are vertebrates that have no members 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.809
 they are not phenomena they simply do not have members and that feels very good 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.819
 how a viper moves to have members 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.359
 the great sharks as a writer 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.669
 a lot of rectilinear movement 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:16.850
 the debate actions your stomach and are propelled forward 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:22.270
 there are many figures however they use their muscles to move their skeleton like 

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:25.269
 one this while they advance 

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:29.770
 schock and canapés more fascinating than a huge shark moving in the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.770
 paddock in a rectilinear way 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:38.599
 as well as a giraffe so stagnant 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:44.069
 today a team that swings 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.069
 Concord that walk on your knuckles 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.120
 with horses trotting 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.620
 a polar diver swimming 90 kilometers in the icy water 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.189
 an elephant walking on its cushions grows without leaving traces of its 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:01.770
 Steps 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.770
 everyone has legs 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:30.900
 not all
