00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.490 
to make making the onion ring
flavor<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.940> then<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:22.840> take<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.319> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
flavor and then you take one of the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.610 
flavor and then you take one of the
onion<00:02:23.800> rings<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.280> you<00:02:24.670> dip<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.000> in<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.120> batter

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
onion rings and you dip it in the batter

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.510 
onion rings and you dip it in the batter
and<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.780> need<00:02:28.959> it<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.440> texture<00:02:30.220> to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
and you really need it this texture to

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.370 
and you really need it this texture to
coat<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:31.030> onion<00:02:31.360> ring<00:02:31.480> if<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.690> make<00:02:32.020> it<00:02:32.200> too

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
coat the onion ring if you make it too

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.199 
coat the onion ring if you make it too
thick<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.890> won't<00:02:33.069> stay<00:02:33.340> on<00:02:33.370> if<00:02:33.790> you<00:02:33.910> make<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
thick it won't stay on if you make it

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.960 
thick it won't stay on if you make it
too<00:02:34.360> thin<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.720> won't<00:02:34.900> stay<00:02:35.170> on<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:36.640> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.819> make

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
too thin it won't stay on so if you make

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.729 
too thin it won't stay on so if you make
it<00:02:37.000> like<00:02:37.240> a<00:02:37.270> thick<00:02:37.569> pancake<00:02:38.170> batter<00:02:38.410> you're

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
it like a thick pancake batter you're

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.680 
it like a thick pancake batter you're
good<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.069> go<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.940> exact<00:02:40.270> batter<00:02:40.569> I

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
good to go this is the exact batter I

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.770 
good to go this is the exact batter I
made<00:02:41.020> these<00:02:41.260> in<00:02:41.590> and<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.910> just<00:02:43.239> dip<00:02:43.540> them

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
made these in and so you just dip them

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.140 
made these in and so you just dip them
in<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.110> batter<00:02:44.319> and<00:02:44.760> some<00:02:45.760> people<00:02:46.030> actually

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
in the batter and some people actually

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.140 
in the batter and some people actually
go<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.900> forth<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.350> dip<00:02:47.530> them<00:02:47.800> twice

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
go back and forth and dip them twice

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.640 
go back and forth and dip them twice
they<00:02:49.150> dip<00:02:49.420> it<00:02:49.569> back<00:02:49.600> in<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.050> batter<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.380> then

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
they dip it back in the batter and then

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.229 
they dip it back in the batter and then
back<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.459> onion<00:02:51.730> ring<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.959> batter<00:02:53.530> and

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
back in the onion ring the batter and

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.970 
back in the onion ring the batter and
then<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.720> other<00:02:55.870> way<00:02:56.050> you<00:02:56.110> can<00:02:56.230> do<00:02:56.500> it<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
then the other way you can do it is a

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.550 
then the other way you can do it is a
different<00:02:57.220> recipe<00:02:57.870> instead<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.140> almond

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
different recipe instead of the almond

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.630 
different recipe instead of the almond

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the onion rings see how thick that is

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.590 
the onion rings see how thick that is
then<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:26.769> put<00:03:26.980> these<00:03:27.130> in<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.430> dehydrator<00:03:27.730> at

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
then you put these in the dehydrator at

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.720 
then you put these in the dehydrator at
104<00:03:29.410> degrees<00:03:30.000> for<00:03:31.000> 24<00:03:31.510> hours<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:33.610> can

104 degrees for 24 hours and you can

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.130 
104 degrees for 24 hours and you can
take<00:03:33.910> them<00:03:34.030> out<00:03:34.150> sooner<00:03:34.510> but<00:03:34.660> they<00:03:34.780> won't<00:03:34.989> be

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
take them out sooner but they won't be

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.640 
take them out sooner but they won't be
as<00:03:35.260> crispy<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.950> then<00:03:36.519> you<00:03:36.700> make<00:03:36.940> your<00:03:37.650> well

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650
