00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:14.450
 Also, as an example of a special kind of curtain 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.980
 For example, it is the material of the curtain It is made for each item and arranged in this way 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.320
 So it Yes This effect is now it is as much as possible To it against Oh date Rent 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.130
 Disp 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.670
 So yes I choose this warp 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.270
 It is with it's stood the Fu that the lunch box of this warp wiggler 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.450
 It is just by moving in Nakai of Lander 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:39.010
 Such as fluttering Well in this way 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.460
 It is also possible that such expression is the next time it is not a curtain a little 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.310
 But 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.880
 Unusual 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:49.250
 I think I would like to create something like a cloth fluctuation 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:54.620
 First of all, it's a flag noise It's applied this New plane applied 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:58.780
 I make this kind of video first This is just right now I'm fluctuating in overlay 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.269
 It is synthesized that we have two piles 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:06.820
 Now it's time to use this new packing and this is the map you made earlier . 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.670
 Yes this is two 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:15.340
 And place it in the up and down 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.290
 If it is arranged, it is the upper direction this time, but this is the part that becomes the curtain part 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.770
 First is Hakkei Warp 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.030
 Now that I say a little bit of mouth Next I applied something like a little card dance 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.260
 I would like to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:31.090
 Map 1 this a curve dance to name the I gradient layer is a 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:33.429
 Thus to set the form of the curtain portion of punishment to name a background layer 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.359
 Yes it looks like 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:42.069
 You can use the clipping of the part of the fluttering place 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:47.170
 Yes, I want to take a look at a little It is here Kedomo of now just such a such a form of part 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:51.340
 The shape is derived from the color . Now it is against it 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.330
 Mullah Roh and the colored with further triton by applying the smooth 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.190
 The say it is by closed school 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.780
 When this but try to synthesize such a move will be to form, such as that and a little background 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.320
 It looks like 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.080
 It is just now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 I'm doing 100% of just opacity I by per 75 this 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.530
 Ne 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.750
 You can just give it a slightly transparent look 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:21.690
 If you build an iron ball safely, such an all-rounder swaying like this is shaking 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 Such expressions can also be made
