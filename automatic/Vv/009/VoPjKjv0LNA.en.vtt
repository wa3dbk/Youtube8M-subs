00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.630
 Hello such meeting of all techno 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.240
 well I wanted to bring a little bit of 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:13.719
 news about jailbreak in this case 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:16.120
 good of today is the 6.1 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:18.460
 point 3 how good many means 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:23.560
 they ask and well what there is in reality 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.930
 It's a famous 613 stetter so I 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.080
 I do not really recommend it for 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:31.480
 accident has updated to that this 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.879
 good firmware if you want to get away and 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.129
 do it always well but have in 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.499
 account that each time it is turned off or 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.929
 restart the device they will have to 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.089
 connect it and do it again is the break 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.030
 There is no way to go back to 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:49.839
 learn it so that's the disadvantage for 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.160
 that's the good thing about waiting for an antenna that 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:55.880
 in fact I hope it does not come out 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.470
 613 some will wonder why not 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.910
 I want them to come out just I just 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.830
 video about that good basically because 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.740
 it could be a possibility that when 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.930
 come out that 7 that is obviously going to be 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.970
 the next and gods that come out already no longer 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.450
 it will come out more for them and six vouchers 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.720
 apparently it is very likely that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.740
 vulnerability that you will find at 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.950
 above that 13 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 the pelbor blocks 237 as in fact already 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.170
 he did it with evasion the last one the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.619
 last break of the last form of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 cecebre that until 6 12 you could but 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.830
 when he took the 3 apple and he blocked it 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.259
 to that program then therefore when 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.460
 if someone comes to discover a 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.470
 vulnerability that are in fact 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 working to find and I think that 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 until they found that if it reaches 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.759
 taking out a good program is going to give you the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 chance to learn that when you jump 17 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.799
 plug that patch and again we stay 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.229
 in xerez with the possibility that by 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.240
 the bonus comes out of 17 still there 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.250
 have that new vulnerability is that 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.880
 they have found and come out quickly 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.530
 very elegant so for that simple 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.549
 reason I hope that actually not 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.100
 leave a teapot for the current ibex 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.910
 but well so unfortunately the 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.769
 who are in 3 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.630
 it is very likely that for this reason that 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.430
 I counted, I was not going to leave one before the most 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.500
 it would be the most reasonable 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.110
 so good who is where 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.780
 are possible and who wants to do 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.940
 I know that at least the program 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.770
 snow breathe that is for windows in the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.880
 description of the video I leave the link to the 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.010
 page 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 this program can follow it to 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.330
 will make 613 inmate warns him the 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.820
 own program that you are going to stop but 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.350
 At least I know that he does it 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.110
 liberation does not do it directly 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.260
 it detects that it does not have that and it does not leave it 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.140
 do 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.319
 and the rest the truth honestly I do not know 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.829
 if they do so because it is a part 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.260
 in fact I do not have that 3 for this reason 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:02.950
 put like this 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.079
 and that little news obviously if 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.840
 they arrive in some strange case and it arrives 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:11.590
 they left 1 3613 obviously I'm going to do 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.989
 a video to see how they are made 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.819
 obviously so be alert to the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.579
 channel in case something of this happens 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:22.000
 and also that it is a small other 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.709
 comment that you will have noticed that I have 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.890
 been climbing our last days 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.170
 few videos to the good channel is 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.049
 simply by vÃ­ctor with a lot of work 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.109
 everything and good I have many animations 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.579
 many things to do and unfortunately 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:39.310
 I do not have much time to devote to 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.680
 channel and unfortunately because I have 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.829
 prepared a few videos of 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.870
 this very good but what good I do not have 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.690
 really time to do it so 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.970
 I will see them I will try to do what 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.250
 impossible to make a hole and 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.790
 try to do some but really 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.700
 I'm with a lot of work lately 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.989
 so stay tuned out there in 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.480
 any moment 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.959
 this may be that some video 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.989
 this new but good I will see when 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.599
 I can free myself of so much work I hope 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.750
 I have answered your questions 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.560
 about her like and well we're 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.560
 Seeing you later
