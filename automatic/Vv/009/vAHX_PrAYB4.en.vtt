00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.780
 hi friends and friends of youtube I'm from 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.490
 1813 and today I work for you I bring you a 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.759
 video tutorial on how to make a 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.250
 stone generator do not copper this before 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.220
 If no stone is stone must take in 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:25.570
 the schools we go stone and good this 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:28.259
 is the mechanism is very simple can 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.599
 that the raw materials are not so much 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:34.349
 but you will see that it works well and is a 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.349
 unlimited resource 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.140
 17 let's go this lever this is going to 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.090
 start generating stone and the piston that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.540
 there's around inside 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.060
 we will be producing stone there 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.660
 taking out the stone 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:58.770
 it may be to become a little slow 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:01:01.200
 but good is quite effective 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.810
 There will come a time when I can not 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.290
 move so many blocks of stone that 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:10.270
 moment will be ten blocks and it will be when 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.149
 the machine will stop automatically 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.789
 to put the machine the only thing that makes 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.789
 missing is to turn off the lever 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:25.800
 and we were looking for this honey 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.800
 what the fuck 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.280
 well and now I'm going to show you how to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.130
 build 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.460
 good friends, now I'm going to teach you 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:39.460
 how to build that first of all the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.940
 let's take any type of block 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.800
 that can not be burned I'm going to catch 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:50.970
 the diamond because I am very cool network 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:55.860
 of straight we are going to catch repeaters 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:03.230
 redstone network cakes are 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:07.520
 and levers and a piston 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.430
 and here we are going to take water a bucket of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.300
 lava and an empty bucket in case the mess 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.560
 too 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.560
 and let's start 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:22.810
 first of all we are going to build the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:27.340
 main structure and they will be three 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:30.390
 blocks here and three here with a 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:38.160
 separation in the middle of one 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:40.040
 let's put on yes yes yes son of a bitch 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.569
 lucky 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.200
 that's right and the dispenser is going to put it 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.200
 here 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:55.130
 and let's put the other block and good 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.130
 this was reserved for the end 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.570
 clint these hours 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.570
 I first a lever here 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.319
 and we will connect it with redstone 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.709
 well jay shit 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:24.070
 a retreat here I recommend that you 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.830
 delays to the maximum if it will not go very 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.000
 too much too fast depends on 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:35.290
 those that you put or too much inside 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.430
 I put it yes yes 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:44.780
 one around here, what is true is 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.660
 the penultimate the last of this we're going 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 and here 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.880
 i 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.880
 and I'm still talking 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:00.060
 sorry, not like this 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.190
 there is good 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.640
 perfect now let's put another earth 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.680
 will take maximum 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.739
 a block here 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.400
 and leaning against the wall on the wall of 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:18.269
 block as a cake 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.280
 we connect this 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.280
 to dispensation 2 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.970
 there 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.600
 and we will connect this so that it works 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.850
 best 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.290
 and well this will start to work for 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.500
 turn it off the only thing you have to do 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.500
 is 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.540
 this is going to stay like this and here at 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.650
 sides are going to put water 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:53.940
 Water 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:57.330
 I'll close this with a block and I'll 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.030
 I would recommend that they make a hole 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.750
 here because so that the water does not 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.980
 because before I did not 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:09.340
 and in this hole that is around here 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.690
 you put side 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:16.650
 yes and then yes so far as you can see 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:20.210
 activate the device 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.210
 and making stone 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:26.470
 and meanwhile that makes stone here 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:30.490
 I'm going to show you my multiple generator 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:33.880
 of stone glue is basically what 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:36.850
 same what happens when you have arrived 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.540
 the limit then I put it in exactly 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:44.230
 the same mechanism here equal and good 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.750
 this can be increased in size 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:50.200
 as you want and you will have infinite stone 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.600
 until you get rid of the eggs and 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.280
 well that's all I hope you have 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:00.220
 liked the video valdÃ©s loyal like 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:06.090
 subscribed please comment, it would help me 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:06.090
 a lot and until the next video goodbye 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:20.669
 I'm very sorry but it's no longer useful 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.669
 Y 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.350
 yes 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.590
 then suddenly 

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.980
 and 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:41.980
 the factor 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.550
 the actor 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:50.060
 such 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.720
 the woman 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.720
 all right 

00:06:56.059 --> 00:06:59.059
 d 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.889
 efe 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.320
