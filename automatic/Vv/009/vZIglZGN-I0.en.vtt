00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
is well no it's not it's an LED laser

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.830 
is well no it's not it's an LED laser
there's<00:00:22.680> quite<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> few<00:00:23.240> quite<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.269> few<00:00:24.449> cutters

there's quite a few quite a few cutters
just<00:00:25.140> going<00:00:25.350> through<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> settings<00:00:26.310> now<00:00:31.850> just

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
just going through the settings now just

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
just going through the settings now just
quite<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> few<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.200> quite<00:00:34.800> honest

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
quite a few to be to be quite honest

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.389 
quite a few to be to be quite honest
with<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.520> just<00:00:36.149> sound<00:00:36.390> too<00:00:36.570> light<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:40.399> just

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
with you just sound too light and just

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:55.800 
with you just sound too light and just
quite<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> lot<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.390> see

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:55.810 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.030 

so<00:00:56.810> if<00:00:56.870> we<00:00:56.930> put<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.170> light<00:00:57.410> on<00:00:57.440> we'll<00:00:57.830> show<00:00:57.860> you

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
so if we put the light on we'll show you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.299 
so if we put the light on we'll show you
the<00:00:58.280> light<00:00:58.430> itself<00:01:02.500> so<00:01:03.500> it's<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.740> green<00:01:03.980> and<00:01:04.160> red

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
the light itself so it's a green and red

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:12.520 
the light itself so it's a green and red
laser<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:06.290> turn<00:01:06.530> it<00:01:06.710> off<00:01:06.800> at<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.400> back<00:01:11.530> so

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
laser just turn it off at the back so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.850 
laser just turn it off at the back so
there's<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.920> laser<00:01:13.130> itself<00:01:13.720> got<00:01:14.720> qtx<00:01:15.380> lights

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
there's the laser itself got qtx lights

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.450 
there's the laser itself got qtx lights
just<00:01:16.340> there<00:01:16.810> you<00:01:17.810> got<00:01:18.020> obviously<00:01:18.260> there<00:01:18.770> the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
just there you got obviously there the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.469 
just there you got obviously there the
lens<00:01:19.760> there<00:01:20.150> you've<00:01:20.720> got<00:01:20.750> two<00:01:21.290> lens<00:01:21.619> screws<00:01:22.479> so

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
lens there you've got two lens screws so

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.410 
lens there you've got two lens screws so
you<00:01:23.540> can<00:01:23.900> unscrew<00:01:24.500> these<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.400> then<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:26.180> can

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can unscrew these and then you can

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.900 
you can unscrew these and then you can
fix<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.110> up<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.530> then<00:01:27.860> tighten<00:01:28.460> these<00:01:28.640> up

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
fix that up and then tighten these up

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.880 
fix that up and then tighten these up
and<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.560> then<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.520> stays<00:01:32.350> you've<00:01:33.350> got<00:01:33.560> music

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
and so then it stays you've got music

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.889 
and so then it stays you've got music
and<00:01:34.369> you've<00:01:34.520> got<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.790> power<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.540> power<00:01:35.720> is

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
and you've got the power so the power is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.690 
and you've got the power so the power is
always<00:01:36.320> on<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.680> then<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.009> music's<00:01:37.490> they've

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
always on and then the music's they've

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.719 
always on and then the music's they've
returned<00:01:38.090> it<00:01:38.270> on<00:01:38.500> then<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.160> should<00:01:40.369> see<00:01:40.580> the

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
returned it on then you should see the

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.260 
returned it on then you should see the
power<00:01:40.940> is<00:01:41.149> always<00:01:41.300> on<00:01:41.630> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:41.960> if<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.259> tap<00:01:42.500> it

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
power is always on and then if we tap it

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.180 
power is always on and then if we tap it
then<00:01:44.270> obviously<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:45.170> see<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.410> blue<00:01:45.649> light<00:01:45.950> as

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
then obviously you see the blue light as

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.690 
then obviously you see the blue light as
well<00:01:46.369> there's<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.820> laser<00:01:47.030> itself<00:01:47.680> okay<00:01:48.700> so

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
well there's the laser itself okay so

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.450 
well there's the laser itself okay so
we'll<00:01:50.210> turn<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.479> round<00:01:50.840> turn<00:01:51.830> it<00:01:52.040> off<00:01:52.160> at<00:01:52.340> the

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
we'll turn it round turn it off at the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.270 
we'll turn it round turn it off at the
back<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:53.630> does<00:01:53.960> come<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:54.470> many<00:01:54.770> of<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:54.979> cam

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
back it does come like many of the cam

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.330 
back it does come like many of the cam
series<00:01:56.619> with<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:59.979> with<00:02:00.979> a<00:02:02.110> external<00:02:03.110> key<00:02:03.590> so

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
series with a with a external key so

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.580 
series with a with a external key so
she's<00:02:04.640> going<00:02:04.819> off<00:02:05.030> digging<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.929> can<00:02:06.140> take<00:02:06.380> it

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
she's going off digging you can take it

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.110 
she's going off digging you can take it
out<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.069> can<00:02:07.640> pop<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.660> back<00:02:08.690> in<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.120> and

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
out you can pop it back in and and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.550 
out you can pop it back in and and
basically<00:02:12.880> put<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.970> in<00:02:14.120> turn<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.810> on<00:02:15.080> or<00:02:15.319> turn

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
basically put it in turn it on or turn

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.630 
basically put it in turn it on or turn
it<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:15.800> or<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.069> could<00:02:16.220> leave<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.430> on

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
it off or you could leave it on

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.730 
it off or you could leave it on
basically<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.990> don't<00:02:18.230> think<00:02:18.410> you'd<00:02:18.560> really

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
basically but I don't think you'd really

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.320 
basically but I don't think you'd really
want<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.130> you<00:02:19.220> but<00:02:19.370> your<00:02:19.490> safety<00:02:19.819> loop<00:02:20.000> if<00:02:20.180> it's

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
want to you but your safety loop if it's

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.840 
want to you but your safety loop if it's
going<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.870> be<00:02:21.290> installed<00:02:21.709> anywhere<00:02:22.010> you've

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
going to be installed anywhere you've

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.420 
going to be installed anywhere you've
got<00:02:23.180> different<00:02:24.110> settings<00:02:24.800> on<00:02:25.040> here<00:02:25.250> you've

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
got different settings on here you've

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.990 
got different settings on here you've
got<00:02:25.459> mode<00:02:25.849> up<00:02:26.180> down<00:02:26.569> or<00:02:26.840> enter<00:02:27.610> you've<00:02:28.610> got<00:02:28.849> the

motor one or motor two different little

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.699 
motor one or motor two different little
things<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.660> then<00:02:33.200> you've<00:02:33.380> got<00:02:33.530> the

microphone and you've got a sound level
low<00:02:36.920> to<00:02:36.980> high<00:02:37.310> obviously<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.300> cooling<00:02:38.720> fan

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
low to high obviously the cooling fan

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:46.480 
low to high obviously the cooling fan
and<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.709> is<00:02:40.459> a<00:02:41.860> 240<00:02:43.120> volt<00:02:44.120> unit<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.319> you<00:02:46.250> can

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
and this is a 240 volt unit and you can
