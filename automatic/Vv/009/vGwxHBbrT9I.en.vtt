00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
real trouble then so I'm going to open

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.740 
real trouble then so I'm going to open
this<00:00:34.290> can<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.620> paint<00:00:34.800> up<00:00:39.020> and<00:00:41.510> I'm<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.690> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
this can of paint up and I'm going to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.720 
this can of paint up and I'm going to
need<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.050> stir<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.620> paint<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.309> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
need to stir this paint because it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.360 
need to stir this paint because it's
separated<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:45.780> an<00:00:45.899> oil<00:00:46.020> base<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:47.340> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
separated it's an oil base so some of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.190 
separated it's an oil base so some of
the<00:00:47.489> pigment<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.910> down<00:00:48.090> at<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> bottom<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the pigment is down at the bottom so you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.819 
the pigment is down at the bottom so you
get<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.739> stir<00:00:50.010> stick<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.550> very<00:00:51.059> carefully<00:00:51.829> stir

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
get a stir stick and very carefully stir

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.520 
get a stir stick and very carefully stir
this<00:00:53.010> paint<00:00:53.809> you<00:00:54.809> don't<00:00:54.840> want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> start<00:00:55.350> too

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
this paint you don't want to start too

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
this paint you don't want to start too
fast<00:00:55.800> because<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.610> start<00:00:56.820> too<00:00:57.000> fast

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
fast because if you start too fast

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.090 
fast because if you start too fast
there's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> chance<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.070> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there's a chance that you're going to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150 
there's a chance that you're going to
spill<00:00:59.760> some<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.270> side<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.809> just<00:01:01.160> gently

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
spill some out the side so just gently

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.399 
spill some out the side so just gently
just<00:01:02.399> start<00:01:02.520> for<00:01:03.030> perhaps<00:01:03.780> maybe<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.170> two

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
just start for perhaps maybe about two

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.490 
just start for perhaps maybe about two
minutes<00:01:05.479> so<00:01:06.479> now<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.659> our<00:01:06.810> paint<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.260> stirred

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
minutes so now that our paint is stirred

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.840 
minutes so now that our paint is stirred
we've<00:01:07.680> got<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> brush<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.430> we're<00:01:08.580> ready<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
paint and I always like to start on the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.330 
paint and I always like to start on the
wall<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> like<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:12.930> paint<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.290> walls<00:01:13.560> first

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
wall so I like to paint the walls first

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.940 
wall so I like to paint the walls first
and<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:15.330> way<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.720> any<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> paint<00:01:16.560> drips

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
and that way if any of the paint drips

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
and that way if any of the paint drips
off<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.220> wall<00:01:17.400> which<00:01:17.729> happens<00:01:18.390> quite<00:01:18.450> often

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
off the wall which happens quite often

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.450 
off the wall which happens quite often
when<00:01:19.020> I'm<00:01:19.110> holding<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> brush<00:01:19.590> up<00:01:19.740> there<00:01:19.950> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
when I'm holding the brush up there you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.249 
when I'm holding the brush up there you
have<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> little<00:01:20.759> drip<00:01:20.939> fall<00:01:21.150> down<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
have a little drip fall down if you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.560 
have a little drip fall down if you
painted<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> bottom<00:01:23.220> first

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
painted the bottom first

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.960 
painted the bottom first
you<00:01:24.930> couldn't<00:01:25.200> blend<00:01:25.380> those<00:01:25.500> drips<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.850> if

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you couldn't blend those drips in so if

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480 
you couldn't blend those drips in so if
I<00:01:27.060> paint<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.479> walls<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.650> paint<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
I paint the walls and then I paint the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
I paint the walls and then I paint the
bottom<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:30.060> kind<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> blends<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.990> drips

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
bottom it kind of blends all the drips

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.230 
bottom it kind of blends all the drips
in<00:01:32.329> so<00:01:33.530> dabble<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
in so dabble a bit on there and just be

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.020 
in so dabble a bit on there and just be
very<00:01:36.509> careful<00:01:36.780> with<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:38.729> don't<00:01:38.790> want<00:01:38.970> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
very careful with this you don't want to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.749 
very careful with this you don't want to
get<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.240> black<00:01:39.450> paint<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.900> anything<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.979> your

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.190 
and more than likely you're going to
have<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.240> have<00:01:51.420> two<00:01:51.780> coats<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.350> paint

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.609 

and<00:01:57.159> you<00:01:57.460> let<00:01:57.670> it<00:01:57.790> set<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.119> perhaps<00:01:58.960> an<00:01:59.110> hour<00:01:59.259> or

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
and you let it set it perhaps an hour or

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.850 
and you let it set it perhaps an hour or
two<00:01:59.830> between<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.340> coats<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:05.500> just<00:02:05.649> want<00:02:05.830> to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
two between the coats you just want to

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.130 
two between the coats you just want to
work<00:02:06.009> it<00:02:06.130> into<00:02:06.549> all<00:02:06.790> the<00:02:07.000> crevices<00:02:07.210> in<00:02:07.840> between

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
work it into all the crevices in between

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.199 
work it into all the crevices in between
the<00:02:08.229> bricks<00:02:08.470> try<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.489> get<00:02:09.640> everything<00:02:09.849> covered

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
the bricks try to get everything covered

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.680 
the bricks try to get everything covered
with<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.539> paint<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.940> now<00:02:13.120> I've<00:02:13.270> painted<00:02:13.480> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690

sides<00:02:13.959> of<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.230> fireplace<00:02:14.739> and<00:02:15.069> it's<00:02:15.280> already

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
sides of the fireplace and it's already

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.040 
sides of the fireplace and it's already
starting<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.760> look<00:02:15.819> a<00:02:15.940> lot<00:02:16.090> better<00:02:16.330> now<00:02:16.959> I'm

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
starting to look a lot better now I'm

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.990 
starting to look a lot better now I'm
ready<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.380> paint<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> bottom<00:02:18.190> and<00:02:18.520> as<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.910> can

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
see I've already

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.809 
see I've already
I<00:02:19.810> had<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.080> few<00:02:20.290> drips<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.709> paint<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.520> that's<00:02:21.670> why

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
I had a few drips of paint so that's why

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.850 
I had a few drips of paint so that's why
I<00:02:21.850> always<00:02:22.000> like<00:02:22.300> to<00:02:22.330> start<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.380> sides<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
I always like to start on the sides and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.750 
I always like to start on the sides and
then<00:02:23.980> work<00:02:24.160> on<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.370> bottom<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.280> we<00:02:27.340> finish

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
then work on the bottom so now we finish

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.100 
then work on the bottom so now we finish
painting<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.180> bottom<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.540> our<00:02:28.569> fireplace

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
painting the bottom of our fireplace

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.860

and<00:02:29.440> as<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.489> see<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.970> looks<00:02:31.330> almost<00:02:31.630> like

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
and as you can see it looks almost like

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.230 
and as you can see it looks almost like
men
