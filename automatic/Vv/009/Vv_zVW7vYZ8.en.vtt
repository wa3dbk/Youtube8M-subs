00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
every riff to kind of see what fits and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.170 
every riff to kind of see what fits and
and<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.800> doesn't<00:02:14.250> kind<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.550> limonade<00:02:15.000> all

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
certain amount of time like it would've

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.890 
certain amount of time like it would've
been<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> lot<00:02:23.970> harder<00:02:24.150> for<00:02:24.330> him<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> kind<00:02:24.659> of<00:02:24.750> get
