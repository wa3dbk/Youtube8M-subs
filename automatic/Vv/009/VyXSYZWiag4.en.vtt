at<00:01:17.400> all<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.759> angles<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.619> here's<00:01:19.619> how

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
at all different angles so here's how

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:56.499 
at all different angles so here's how
she<00:01:19.799> sits

engine<00:02:19.150> anything<00:02:20.150> above<00:02:20.390> idle<00:02:20.690> speed<00:02:20.930> it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
engine anything above idle speed it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:33.320 
engine anything above idle speed it
would<00:02:21.170> actually<00:02:21.459> plank<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.750> steady<00:02:23.750> pace

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.020 
straighter valve kind of a tire truck
you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:42.990> use<00:02:43.170> any<00:02:43.620> track<00:02:43.980> anything<00:02:44.790> you

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
you can use any track anything you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.080 
you can use any track anything you
normally<00:02:45.360> use<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.570> fill<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.050> tire<00:02:46.290> up<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
normally use to fill the tire up and

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:59.690 
normally use to fill the tire up and
then<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.240> has<00:02:50.420> just<00:02:51.420> kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:58.520> cheap<00:02:59.520> little

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
then it has just kind of a cheap little

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
it holds pressure just fine I don't

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.540
