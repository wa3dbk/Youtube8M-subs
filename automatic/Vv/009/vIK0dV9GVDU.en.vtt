00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
similar to this to see if we could use

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.919 
similar to this to see if we could use
this<00:02:05.649> method<00:02:06.039> here<00:02:06.340> where<00:02:07.179> you<00:02:07.390> partially

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
this method here where you partially

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.660 
this method here where you partially
breach<00:02:08.200> into<00:02:08.500> something<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.369> trample

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
breach into something with a trample

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.350 
breach into something with a trample
