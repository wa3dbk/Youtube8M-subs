00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
in like October twentieth of 2012 and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.050 
in like October twentieth of 2012 and
then<00:02:13.799> after<00:02:14.069> that<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.459> started<00:02:14.790> branching

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
then after that they started branching

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.330 
then after that they started branching
off<00:02:15.360> into<00:02:15.569> doing<00:02:15.989> you<00:02:16.410> know<00:02:16.530> adding<00:02:17.190> different

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
off into doing you know adding different

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.940 
off into doing you know adding different

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
parts of updates into the game so that's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.970 
parts of updates into the game so that's
why<00:02:20.160> we're<00:02:20.370> not<00:02:20.400> at<00:02:20.760> an<00:02:20.970> equivalent<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.230> pc

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
