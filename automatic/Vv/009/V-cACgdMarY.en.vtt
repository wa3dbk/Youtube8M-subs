can also do an unpowered hand toss as

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.559 
can also do an unpowered hand toss as
long<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.099> are<00:01:50.310> pretty<00:01:51.029> quick<00:01:51.209> to<00:01:51.359> get<00:01:51.450> on

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
long as you are pretty quick to get on

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.819 
long as you are pretty quick to get on
the<00:01:51.659> throttle<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> model<00:01:52.709> will

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the throttle because the model will

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.620 
the throttle because the model will
start<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.159> drop<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.090> can<00:01:54.299> launch<00:01:54.479> it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
start to drop so you can launch it

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.899 
start to drop so you can launch it
basically<00:01:54.929> unpowered<00:01:55.380> or<00:01:55.770> full<00:01:56.369> power<00:01:56.579> take

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
basically unpowered or full power take

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.269 
basically unpowered or full power take
your<00:01:57.060> pick<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:58.229> model<00:01:58.499> gains<00:01:58.679> altitude<00:01:58.859> very

00:01:59.269 --> 00:01:59.279 
your pick the model gains altitude very

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
easily under power and with the 450
packs<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.829> was<00:02:01.950> getting<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.340> 5<00:02:02.609> minutes<00:02:02.880> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
packs I was getting about 5 minutes of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.449 
packs I was getting about 5 minutes of
power<00:02:03.809> so<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.529> use<00:02:04.709> much<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.219> time

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
power so if you use much of that time

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.669 
power so if you use much of that time
for<00:02:05.999> climbing<00:02:06.869> to<00:02:06.959> altitude<00:02:07.319> and<00:02:07.559> then

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
for climbing to altitude and then

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:09.290 
for climbing to altitude and then
gliding<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:08.940> pretty<00:02:09.090> long

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
gliding you can have some pretty long

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
gliding you can have some pretty long
flight<00:02:09.479> times<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.560> model<00:02:10.770> does<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.069> very

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
flight times the model does have a very

flight times the model does have a very
nice<00:02:11.489> glide<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.329> you<00:02:12.450> are<00:02:12.540> an<00:02:12.629> experienced

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
nice glide and if you are an experienced

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.350 
nice glide and if you are an experienced
glider<00:02:13.590> pilot<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.159> am<00:02:14.610> sure<00:02:14.819> you'll<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.150> able<00:02:15.209> to

glider pilot I am sure you'll be able to

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.180 
glider pilot I am sure you'll be able to
find<00:02:15.540> some<00:02:16.049> thermals<00:02:16.469> and

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
find some thermals and

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.740 
find some thermals and
check<00:02:17.250> out<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> plane<00:02:17.730> keep<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.540> in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.720> air

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
check out the plane keep it in the air

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.470 
check out the plane keep it in the air
for<00:02:19.050> quite<00:02:19.140> some<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:20.090> initially<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.150> did<00:02:21.300> find

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
for quite some time initially I did find

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.910 
for quite some time initially I did find
the<00:02:21.570> model<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> little<00:02:22.350> bit<00:02:22.500> nose-heavy

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the model to be a little bit nose-heavy

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.950 
the model to be a little bit nose-heavy
with<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> pack<00:02:23.460> all<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.330> way<00:02:24.390> at<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.570> back<00:02:24.720> of

with the pack all the way at the back of
the<00:02:25.020> battery<00:02:25.170> compartment<00:02:25.430> so<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.460> did<00:02:26.670> place

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
the battery compartment so I did place

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.310 
the battery compartment so I did place
it<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.120> little<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.510> further<00:02:27.750> back<00:02:27.960> into<00:02:28.170> the

it a little bit further back into the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.800 
it a little bit further back into the
fuselage<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.220> helped<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.640> bit<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.510> model

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
fuselage and that helped a bit the model

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.390 
fuselage and that helped a bit the model
flew<00:02:31.110> great<00:02:31.380> I<00:02:31.590> didn't<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.950> any<00:02:32.100> big<00:02:32.370> issues

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
flew great I didn't have any big issues

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.670 
flew great I didn't have any big issues
with<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.660> was<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.230> little<00:02:34.440> bit

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
with it but it was just a little bit

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.050 
with it but it was just a little bit
nose-heavy<00:02:35.070> for<00:02:35.340> my<00:02:35.430> liking

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.720 

the<00:02:41.930> Adagio<00:02:42.140> performs<00:02:42.709> graceful<00:02:43.100> aerobatics

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the Adagio performs graceful aerobatics

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.670 
the Adagio performs graceful aerobatics
and<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.480> contrasting<00:02:45.050> top<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.440> bottom

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and with the contrasting top and bottom

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.740 
and with the contrasting top and bottom
is<00:02:45.800> very<00:02:45.830> easy<00:02:46.220> to<00:02:46.340> follow<00:02:46.580> in<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> sky<00:02:47.180> it

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
is very easy to follow in the sky it

00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:31.680 
is very easy to follow in the sky it
also<00:02:47.870> flies<00:02:48.140> quite<00:02:48.530> well<00:02:48.819> inverted

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.720 

the<00:03:32.200> flaps<00:03:32.500> are<00:03:32.680> very<00:03:32.860> helpful<00:03:33.100> with<00:03:33.340> landing

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
the flaps are very helpful with landing

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.940 
the flaps are very helpful with landing
as<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.940> model<00:03:34.210> does<00:03:34.390> like<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.750> carry<00:03:35.050> I<00:03:35.350> found

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
as the model does like to carry I found

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.190 
as the model does like to carry I found
that<00:03:36.070> half<00:03:36.280> flaps<00:03:36.580> were<00:03:36.820> plenty<00:03:37.720> adequate<00:03:38.110> to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
that half flaps were plenty adequate to

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.450 
that half flaps were plenty adequate to
slow<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> model<00:03:38.740> down<00:03:38.860> for<00:03:39.160> some<00:03:39.310> nice

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
slow the model down for some nice

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.550 
slow the model down for some nice
landings<00:03:39.940> full<00:03:40.720> flaps<00:03:41.050> will<00:03:41.230> essentially

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
landings full flaps will essentially

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.470 
landings full flaps will essentially
arrest<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> model<00:03:42.670> completely<00:03:43.030> within<00:03:43.390> the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
arrest the model completely within the

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.020 
arrest the model completely within the
air<00:03:43.630> in<00:03:44.440> about<00:03:44.590> three<00:03:44.980> or<00:03:45.100> four<00:03:45.250> feet<00:03:45.280> so<00:03:45.790> once

that<00:03:46.120> happens<00:03:46.570> it's<00:03:46.720> going<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:46.900> drop<00:03:47.110> straight

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
that happens it's going to drop straight

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.140 
that happens it's going to drop straight
down<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:48.280> be<00:03:48.400> prepared<00:03:48.550> for<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.910> if<00:03:49.060> you

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
down so be prepared for that if you

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.270 
down so be prepared for that if you

on<00:03:57.550> down<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.650> do<00:03:59.650> have<00:04:00.010> a<00:04:00.040> new<00:04:00.250> respect<00:04:00.580> for
