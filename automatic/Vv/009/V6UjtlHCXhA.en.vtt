00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
war itself was going on I decided the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.550 
war itself was going on I decided the
thing<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.359> do<00:03:29.510> would<00:03:29.660> be<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:29.900> go<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.319> the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
thing to do would be to go to the

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.059 
thing to do would be to go to the
records<00:03:31.129> of<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.400> expelling<00:03:31.910> countries<00:03:32.510> and

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 
being human I think it's a very

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.300 
being human I think it's a very
