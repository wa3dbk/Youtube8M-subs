00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.840 
picked another ball that you can see has
been<00:02:38.900> used<00:02:39.110> a<00:02:39.260> lot<00:02:39.440> but<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.400> nice<00:02:40.550> soft

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
been used a lot but it's a nice soft

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.300

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
ball so and right off up I'll make the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.640 
ball so and right off up I'll make the
same<00:02:46.520> noise<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.060> it's<00:02:47.330> softer<00:02:48.110> so<00:02:48.320> it<00:02:48.410> doesn't

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
same noise but it's softer so it doesn't

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:58.740 
same noise but it's softer so it doesn't
make<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:48.890> same<00:02:51.850> amount<00:02:52.850> of<00:02:52.910> noise<00:02:54.370> but<00:02:56.140> yeah

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
this is pretty good I mean it's not very

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.319 
this is pretty good I mean it's not very
high<00:03:35.120> off<00:03:35.360> the<00:03:35.600> ground<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:36.940> can<00:03:37.940> see<00:03:39.040> that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
high off the ground but you can see that

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:47.800 
high off the ground but you can see that
it's<00:03:41.329> not<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.750> high<00:03:41.930> but<00:03:44.049> like<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:47.360> can<00:03:47.660> take

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
it's not that high but like it can take

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.360 
it's not that high but like it can take
a<00:03:47.840> beating<00:03:48.049> like<00:03:48.320> I'll<00:03:48.500> just<00:03:48.739> walk<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.160> here

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
a beating like I'll just walk in here

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:57.220 
a beating like I'll just walk in here
sometimes<00:03:49.760> I'll<00:03:50.239> be<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.980> just<00:03:51.980> kind<00:03:52.489> of<00:03:56.230> hang

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
sometimes I'll be like just kind of hang

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.870 
sometimes I'll be like just kind of hang
on<00:03:57.410> it<00:03:57.590> pull<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.340> ring<00:03:58.519> down

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:10.320 

it<00:04:03.880> stays<00:04:04.300> level<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.700> stay<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
it stays level it's going to stay it

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.910 
it stays level it's going to stay it
when<00:04:10.570> you<00:04:10.660> come<00:04:10.930> when<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.350> get<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> it's<00:04:11.800> going

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
to be a little bit angled but it's good

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.710 
to be a little bit angled but it's good
in<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.900> backboard<00:04:17.640> when<00:04:18.640> you<00:04:18.790> dunk<00:04:19.180> on<00:04:19.420> it<00:04:19.570> it

bends<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.350> little<00:04:20.620> bit<00:04:21.000> but<00:04:22.000> that's<00:04:22.240> only

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
bends in a little bit but that's only

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.850 
bends in a little bit but that's only
because<00:04:22.690> right<00:04:23.170> here<00:04:25.470> overall<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:26.680> a<00:04:26.740> good
