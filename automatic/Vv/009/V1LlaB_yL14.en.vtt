00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
of energy and then you know what will

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.540 
of energy and then you know what will
happen<00:04:29.240> in<00:04:29.690> fact<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.200> that<00:04:30.830> you<00:04:31.190> know<00:04:31.340> the

happening<00:04:41.419> there<00:04:41.630> into<00:04:42.470> the<00:04:42.590> machine<00:04:42.919> so

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
happening there into the machine so

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.980 
happening there into the machine so
that's<00:04:43.520> how<00:04:43.700> to<00:04:43.729> fix<00:04:44.060> it<00:04:44.240> peeps<00:04:44.479> I'm<00:04:44.660> not<00:04:44.810> going
