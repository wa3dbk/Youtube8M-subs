00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.160 

I<00:00:00.450> wasn't<00:00:01.230> expecting<00:00:02.189> as<00:00:02.519> good<00:00:03.419> result<00:00:03.840> as<00:00:04.020> I

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I wasn't expecting as good result as I

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.660 
I wasn't expecting as good result as I
got<00:00:04.380> not<00:00:04.680> just<00:00:04.710> from<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.040> weight<00:00:05.220> loss<00:00:05.250> but

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
got not just from the weight loss but

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.089 
got not just from the weight loss but
from<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> whole<00:00:06.120> overall<00:00:07.009> feeling<00:00:08.009> of

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
from the whole overall feeling of

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.220 
from the whole overall feeling of
well-being<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.820> guess<00:00:09.120> it's<00:00:09.299> not<00:00:09.419> to<00:00:09.570> sound<00:00:09.780> too

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
well-being I guess it's not to sound too

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.039 
well-being I guess it's not to sound too
much<00:00:10.740> like<00:00:10.950> an<00:00:11.070> advert<00:00:11.370> but<00:00:11.669> when<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> came<00:00:12.749> here

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
much like an advert but when I came here

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.199 
much like an advert but when I came here
I'd<00:00:13.200> got<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.829> the<00:00:13.889> stage<00:00:14.129> where<00:00:14.159> I<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:14.639> really

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
I'd got to the stage where I was really

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.640 
I'd got to the stage where I was really
cut<00:00:15.360> myself<00:00:15.449> off<00:00:15.749> from<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.929> friends<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.470> was

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
cut myself off from my friends I was

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.000 
cut myself off from my friends I was
really<00:00:16.980> quiet<00:00:18.200> it<00:00:19.200> was<00:00:19.350> finding<00:00:19.560> it<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.740> hard

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
really quiet it was finding it very hard

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.890 
really quiet it was finding it very hard
funny<00:00:20.280> joy<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.670> life<00:00:20.820> because<00:00:21.120> I<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.480> so

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
funny joy in life because I was just so

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.290 
funny joy in life because I was just so
so<00:00:22.170> stressed<00:00:22.530> out<00:00:22.710> from<00:00:23.070> being<00:00:23.610> here<00:00:23.910> within<00:00:24.180> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
so stressed out from being here within a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570 
so stressed out from being here within a
matter<00:00:24.570> of<00:00:24.690> days<00:00:24.780> just<00:00:25.020> this<00:00:25.740> incredible

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
matter of days just this incredible

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.980 
matter of days just this incredible
amount<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.880> energy<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.450> the<00:00:27.630> one<00:00:27.810> thing

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
amount of energy which is the one thing

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.930 
amount of energy which is the one thing
I<00:00:28.110> wasn't<00:00:28.350> expecting<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:28.950> have<00:00:29.100> I<00:00:29.490> was

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
I wasn't expecting to have I was

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.700 
I wasn't expecting to have I was
expecting<00:00:30.360> to<00:00:30.390> come<00:00:30.570> here<00:00:30.780> for<00:00:30.930> a<00:00:30.960> month<00:00:31.140> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
expecting to come here for a month and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.460 
expecting to come here for a month and
barely<00:00:32.700> leave<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.030> room<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.690> know<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.900> be<00:00:34.200> able

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
barely leave my room you know to be able

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.680 
barely leave my room you know to be able
to<00:00:34.650> stick<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> program<00:00:35.490> but<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.570> not

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to stick to the program but really not

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.720 
to stick to the program but really not
have<00:00:36.900> much<00:00:37.110> energy<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:38.040> really<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.610> out

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
have much energy that to really get out

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.850 
have much energy that to really get out
of<00:00:38.820> bed<00:00:38.970> but<00:00:39.300> I've<00:00:39.450> been<00:00:39.960> surprised<00:00:40.350> every<00:00:40.710> day

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of bed but I've been surprised every day

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.350 
of bed but I've been surprised every day
I've<00:00:41.040> done<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.090> everything<00:00:42.329> from

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
I've done you know everything from

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.290 
I've done you know everything from
walking<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> gym<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.829> yoga<00:00:44.310> to<00:00:44.640> swim<00:00:44.880> in<00:00:45.060> and

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
walking to gym to yoga to swim in and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.210 
walking to gym to yoga to swim in and
say<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.110> bouncing<00:00:46.560> off<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> walls<00:00:46.980> I

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
say I'm just bouncing off the walls I

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.610 
say I'm just bouncing off the walls I
can't<00:00:47.489> believe<00:00:47.790> how<00:00:48.720> much<00:00:48.930> energy<00:00:49.140> I've<00:00:49.380> got

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
can't believe how much energy I've got

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.610 
can't believe how much energy I've got
and<00:00:49.860> how<00:00:50.190> much<00:00:50.399> better<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:50.700> felt<00:00:51.380> first<00:00:52.380> week

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and how much better I felt first week

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.530 
and how much better I felt first week
things<00:00:52.920> definitely<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.460> hardest<00:00:53.640> after<00:00:54.390> that

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
things definitely the hardest after that

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.810 
things definitely the hardest after that
it's<00:00:54.899> much<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.620> easier

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
it's much much easier

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.060 
it's much much easier
just<00:00:57.630> cannot<00:00:57.930> believe<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.290> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
just cannot believe that you can have so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.180 
just cannot believe that you can have so
much<00:00:59.220> energy<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.910> feel<00:01:00.150> so<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:01.650> eating

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
much energy and feel so good not eating

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.610 
much energy and feel so good not eating
and<00:01:02.370> 25<00:01:02.820> days<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.360> lot<00:01:03.600> more<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:04.080> trying<00:01:04.440> to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:04.620 
and 25 days is a lot more I'm trying to

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.830 
and 25 days is a lot more I'm trying to
do<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:05.010> I've<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.250> felt<00:01:05.729> happy<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.540> haven't

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
do it I've just felt happy and I haven't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.870 
do it I've just felt happy and I haven't
felt<00:01:07.140> particularly<00:01:07.920> happy<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.520> long<00:01:08.670> time

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
felt particularly happy for a long time

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.750 
felt particularly happy for a long time
so<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> guess<00:01:09.300> that<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.840> me<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.760> emotional

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so I guess that for me was my emotional

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.430 
so I guess that for me was my emotional
you<00:01:12.000> know<00:01:12.030> I've<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.240> been<00:01:12.420> walking<00:01:13.350> around

way the place is is it's just perfect

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
way the place is is it's just perfect
for<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.320> meet<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.680> many
