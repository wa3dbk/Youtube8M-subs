00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
to experience is a rota sysm redirected

to experience is a rota sysm redirected
that<00:02:21.250> entire<00:02:21.760> energy<00:02:22.030> continues<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> be<00:02:23.170> alive

that entire energy continues to be alive

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.589 
that entire energy continues to be alive
and<00:02:23.650> well<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.280> is<00:02:24.400> now<00:02:24.580> channeled<00:02:25.209> on<00:02:25.420> to

the<00:02:25.720> children<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.830> crucial<00:02:27.280> for<00:02:27.580> couples

to<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.290> couple<00:02:38.650> or<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.190> become<00:02:39.370> much<00:02:39.760> too
