00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 cuddly flexible and with every amount 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 sympathy bonus is equipped the 4 x 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.759
 4 variant of the fiat panda currently well 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.450
 the smallest option is an all-wheel-drive car 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.119
 to drive 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.400
 in normal everyday operation is the panda 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.080
 a front wheel drive only when it 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.289
 required is the switch 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.840
 rear wheels to that happens 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.279
 fully automatic and just only 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.009
 fully automatic manual control 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 There is not at most there is still 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.110
 a kind of electronic 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.790
 locking differential by pressing a button clearly 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.320
 between him and a real one 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 SUVs lie worlds 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.460
 Nevertheless, the panda can do much more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 as over muddy lanes or 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.320
 cobblestones drive when you leave 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
 sometimes too uneven or too stony 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.719
 the underbody protection itself helps in the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.850
 difficult terrain while in this 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.399
 only an Italian offroad 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 course, he is doing well here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 his light weight comes to him 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.229
 just finished 1150 kilograms and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.439
 its compact dimensions benefit 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.350
 with three meters 68 length and just under 1 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.600
 meter 70 width and a wheelbase of 2 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860
 meters 30 he has very short overhangs 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.200
 at the back and the front 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.270
 This helps to get through and protects 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.570
 right in the terrain the lower part of the 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.729
 front partie enormous slopes up to 70 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.460
 percent he takes easily in the first 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.530
 he feels at home on the street 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.020
 sporty on it is still the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.240
 vote comfortable enough yourself 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.189
 drive over bumpy cobblestones 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.770
 is relaxed the suspension dampens 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.350
 Neat what's behind the steering wheel 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.399
 From the uneven road surface relatively 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.299
 to feel little 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.220
 the 1.3 liter diesel with 75 ps is 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.220
 always strong enough for the little one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.990
 car what we like the drive is his 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.810
 strong torque of 190 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.899
 Newton meters and the good vote of the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 gearbox on the engine something annoying 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.729
 is the loud nail of the diesel that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.369
 clearly audible even when the engine is warm 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.420
 He stays with it sparingly 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.730
 the fuel around 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.130
 During our test drives the leveling off 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.860
 consumption at 6 1 liters of diesel per 100 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.520
 kilometer stretch a fiat gives as 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.620
 Average consumption 4.7 liters at the 4 x 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.810
 4 panda in the rock edition is 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.420
 already pretty decent and standard 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.700
 extensively equipped the sp 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.959
 a kind of electronic 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.780
 locking differential a manual 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.750
 Air conditioning a decent music system 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.599
 as well as 15 inch alloy wheels are there 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.239
 in the basic price thereby whereby this with 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.150
 over 16,000 euros is quite steep 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.010
 now for comparison the basis panda 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.239
 with front wheel drive there are now and then 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:53.069
 with special actions already starting from 8000 euro 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.080
 who wants to be safe all year long 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.569
 to move forward in any weather and 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.970
 like a small car without many 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.940
 superfluous technology market is with the 4 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.100
 x 4 panda well served at the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.560
 relatively high price does not bother 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.390
 with the all-wheel panda a compact 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.120
 small car for which there are hardly any obstacles 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.670
 gives the four-wheel drive does not help her 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.220
 only in the terrain but also in the rain 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.100
 and snow on the other side almost 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.570
 8000 euro price difference between 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.970
 four-wheel model rock and the cheapest 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.269
 front wheel drive model is already one
