00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:06.330
 Your grandpa support Professor 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.600
 Contact Grandpa of another To距 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.050
 forever 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.000
 I wanted to see 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.540
 It is not good until 5 years old 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540
 Ted 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.170
 But today is the 5th birthday 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.599
 I asked your grandpa the most to wake up in the morning 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.599
 Good with the exception of the other To距 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.620
 Then Grandpa 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 When it's night 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.370
 I laughed and followed my nose Te Cho N'in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.429
 Eat cake for your birthday 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.920
 Give me the present I got from dad and mom 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.400
 After night came, I asked od again 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.320
 Good except for the telescope precisely this time 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 Then Grandpa closed one eye 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.640
 The beginning 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.640
 I laughed a bit at the end of the north end 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:31.690
 Look peeps 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:35.460
 It was pounding really unlikely to rupture of the heart when it was said to your grandpa 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.460
 I saw a telescope 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:47.270
 The first time in a row 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.270
 The moon which I always watched from a distance was not clear but the moon was shining 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.700
 When I thought it was beautiful 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.700
 It moved me bullet What is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.850
 That 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:06.850
 I thought about it and when I took a good look, I used to dance Chinese cabbage for fun 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.090
 I'm surprised 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.440
 Really rabbit's 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.440
 If you put it on and listen 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.650
 The rabbit stopped dancing and waved to the north 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.700
 I also if you look back a pleased hand 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.280
 The rabbit sang Happy Birthday while taking 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.940
 When I finished singing , the rabbit disappeared someday 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:47.140
 I am not lonely at all 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.140
 I will say next year because I heard it from a distance
