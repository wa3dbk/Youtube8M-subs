00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.650 

first<00:02:20.870> you'll<00:02:21.110> take<00:02:21.350> your<00:02:21.800> bobbin<00:02:22.420> need<00:02:23.420> to

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
first you'll take your bobbin need to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780 
first you'll take your bobbin need to
look<00:02:23.810> at<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.140> bobbin<00:02:24.530> case<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.070> make<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.580> like

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
look at the bobbin case and make it like

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.540 
look at the bobbin case and make it like
a<00:02:25.820> six<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.930> thread<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.320> coming<00:02:27.500> out<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.800> six<00:02:28.040> so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
a six the thread is coming out of six so

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.460 
a six the thread is coming out of six so
if<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.760> start<00:02:29.180> spinning<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.810> it's<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:30.380> to

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
if I start spinning it it's going to

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.600 
if I start spinning it it's going to
spin<00:02:30.770> clockwise<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:33.590> going<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.890> take<00:02:34.160> that

case dropping it in and once again
checking<00:02:44.210> if<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.570> spin<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.940> my<00:02:46.940> wheel<00:02:48.040> should

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
checking if I spin it my wheel should

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.180 
checking if I spin it my wheel should
turn<00:02:49.310> in<00:02:49.550> clockwise<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:51.500> I'm<00:02:51.650> going<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:51.920> find

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
turn in clockwise then I'm going to find

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.850 
turn in clockwise then I'm going to find
the<00:02:52.520> groove<00:02:53.050> which<00:02:54.050> is<00:02:54.230> right<00:02:54.760> here<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.620> I'm

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
the groove which is right here and I'm

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.430 
the groove which is right here and I'm
going<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.070> take<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.460> around<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.780> that<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.110> snaps

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
going to take it around so that it snaps

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.870 
going to take it around so that it snaps
into<00:03:00.980> there<00:03:02.740> then<00:03:03.740> I'm<00:03:04.250> going<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.580> take<00:03:04.730> it

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
into there then I'm going to take it

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.140 
into there then I'm going to take it
around<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:06.380> gold<00:03:06.800> plate<00:03:07.990> to<00:03:08.990> the<00:03:09.110> left

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
around the this gold plate to the left

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.050 
around the this gold plate to the left
so<00:03:11.150> that<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.480> pops<00:03:11.840> down<00:03:12.110> into<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.550> hole<00:03:13.790> right

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
so that it pops down into the hole right

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.370 
so that it pops down into the hole right

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.520 
all the way till the needle gets up and

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.120 
all the way till the needle gets up and
the<00:04:04.580> take<00:04:04.760> up<00:04:04.910> levers<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.420> the<00:04:05.540> top<00:04:05.780> then<00:04:06.770> you

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
the take up levers to the top then you

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.940 
the take up levers to the top then you
will<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.360> your<00:04:08.480> your<00:04:09.110> bottom<00:04:09.710> thread

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
will see that your your bottom thread

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.760 
will see that your your bottom thread
has<00:04:10.160> been<00:04:10.340> pulled<00:04:10.670> up<00:04:11.050> and<00:04:12.050> then<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.560> usually

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
has been pulled up and then I usually

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.710 
has been pulled up and then I usually
just<00:04:13.130> grab<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.640> bottom<00:04:14.030> thread<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.570> then

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
just grab that bottom thread and then

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.940 
just grab that bottom thread and then
pull<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.200> out<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.940> comes<00:04:17.150> up<00:04:17.380> then<00:04:18.380> close

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
pull it out so that comes up then close

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.000 
pull it out so that comes up then close
the<00:04:19.310> bottom<00:04:19.640> case<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.320> then<00:04:21.320> put<00:04:21.590> your<00:04:21.739> thread

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
the bottom case and then put your thread

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.320 
the bottom case and then put your thread
underneath<00:04:22.610> your<00:04:22.820> presser<00:04:23.000> foot<00:04:24.160> and<00:04:25.330> there

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
underneath your presser foot and there

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.190 
underneath your presser foot and there
your<00:04:26.750> machine<00:04:27.110> is<00:04:27.350> now<00:04:27.560> threaded<00:04:28.010> correctly
