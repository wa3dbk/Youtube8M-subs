influence<00:00:47.940> as<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.600> comes<00:00:48.809> from

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
influence as a that comes from

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.540 
influence as a that comes from
blood-borne<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> slightly<00:00:50.070> sped<00:00:50.399> up

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
blood-borne is just a slightly sped up

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.459 
blood-borne is just a slightly sped up
gameplay<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.899> it's<00:00:52.020> not<00:00:52.079> blood-borne

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
gameplay you know it's not blood-borne

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
gameplay you know it's not blood-borne
fast<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.520> makes<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.629> whole

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
fast but it makes the game as a whole

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.180 
fast but it makes the game as a whole
little<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.379> accessible<00:00:56.070> without

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
little bit more accessible without

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.430 
little bit more accessible without
having<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> sacrifice<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.570> difficulty<00:00:58.320> level

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
having to sacrifice the difficulty level

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.349 
having to sacrifice the difficulty level
what<00:00:59.370> do<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.489> guys<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.030> dark

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
what do you guys think it is about dark

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.029 
what do you guys think it is about dark
souls<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.930> whole<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.230> has<00:01:01.500> withstood<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
souls as a whole that has withstood the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
souls as a whole that has withstood the
test<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.399> time<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.789> remains<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.480> popular

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
test of time it remains to be so popular

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.300 
test of time it remains to be so popular
I<00:01:05.540> definitely<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.470> unique<00:01:08.100> and

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I definitely think it's the unique and

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.460 
I definitely think it's the unique and
challenging<00:01:09.060> gameplay<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> Souls<00:01:10.200> fans

challenging gameplay like a Souls fans

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.510

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
challenging but very very rewarding if

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.630 
challenging but very very rewarding if

of this a spoon fed to you so music has
said<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> he<00:01:45.570> doesn't<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.079> of

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
said that he doesn't like that kind of

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.319 
said that he doesn't like that kind of
gameplay<00:01:46.560> he<00:01:46.950> wants<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.640> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> let<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
gameplay he wants to kind of let you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
gameplay he wants to kind of let you
uncover<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.170> story<00:01:49.229> line<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> lot<00:01:50.100> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
uncover the story line so a lot of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.889 
uncover the story line so a lot of
community<00:01:50.490> bands<00:01:50.700> together<00:01:50.880> they<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.689> find

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
community bands together they they find

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.030 
community bands together they they find
out<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.259> find<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:52.860> kind<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
out what you find out and they kind of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.260 
out what you find out and they kind of
started<00:01:53.280> piece<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.640> store<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.880> together<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.240> I

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
started piece to store it together so I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.819 
started piece to store it together so I
think<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.509> really<00:01:54.630> gave<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.500> a<00:01:55.590> very

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
think that really gave it a very

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.370 
think that really gave it a very
grassroots<00:01:56.130> community<00:01:56.729> driven<00:01:57.380> experience

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
grassroots community driven experience

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.690 
grassroots community driven experience
that's<00:01:58.619> kind<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.950> carried<00:01:59.280> its<00:01:59.399> way<00:01:59.520> all<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
that's kind of carried its way all the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.819 
that's kind of carried its way all the
way<00:01:59.820> through<00:02:00.030> 12<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.420> l3<00:02:00.659> yeah<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.590> speaking

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
way through 12 and l3 yeah so speaking

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.499 
way through 12 and l3 yeah so speaking
of<00:02:01.950> story<00:02:02.189> where<00:02:02.430> does<00:02:02.549> this<00:02:02.670> game<00:02:02.880> take<00:02:03.270> place

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
of story where does this game take place

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.039 
of story where does this game take place
in<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> dark<00:02:04.020> souls<00:02:04.380> timeline<00:02:05.840> that's<00:02:06.840> part

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
in the dark souls timeline that's part

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.350 
in the dark souls timeline that's part
of<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.290> think<00:02:07.350> Mike<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> good

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
of it I think Mike well so the good

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.999 
of it I think Mike well so the good
thing<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.200> don't<00:02:10.349> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.649> play<00:02:10.800> one

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
thing is that you don't have to play one

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.710 
thing is that you don't have to play one
and<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.520> order<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> enjoy<00:02:12.000> three<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:12.540> not

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
and two in order to enjoy three it's not

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
and two in order to enjoy three it's not
really<00:02:12.930> a<00:02:13.050> linear

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
really a linear

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.729 
really a linear
a<00:02:13.790> time<00:02:14.790> line<00:02:15.000> from<00:02:15.120> one<00:02:15.300> two<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.660> three<00:02:15.959> so<00:02:16.230> we

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
a time line from one two and three so we

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.410 
a time line from one two and three so we
haven't<00:02:17.069> really<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.640> said<00:02:17.940> what<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
haven't really kind of said what the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.509 
haven't really kind of said what the
world<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.080> but<00:02:19.349> what<00:02:19.500> we<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.739> say<00:02:19.920> is<00:02:19.950> that<00:02:20.099> the

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
world is but what we can say is that the

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.430 
world is but what we can say is that the
world<00:02:20.879> is<00:02:21.090> kind<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.390> coming<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> ruin<00:02:22.170> stage
