because I thought about it and a riddle

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.510 
because I thought about it and a riddle
of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> concept<00:02:22.290> of<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.590> way<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.280> plays

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
of the concept of the way it plays

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.980 
of the concept of the way it plays
around<00:02:23.700> me<00:02:23.880> your<00:02:24.030> mind<00:02:24.180> as<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> player<00:02:24.660> rather

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
around me your mind as the player rather

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.390 
around me your mind as the player rather
than<00:02:25.110> just<00:02:25.260> as<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.500> character<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.250> thought

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
than just as the character and I thought

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.860 
than just as the character and I thought
that<00:02:26.460> was<00:02:26.640> really<00:02:26.880> quite<00:02:27.150> clever<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.600> really

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
that was really quite clever and really

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.160 
that was really quite clever and really
fun<00:02:28.280> anyway<00:02:29.280> where<00:02:29.850> I'm<00:02:29.880> babbling<00:02:30.390> on<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.720> I

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
fun anyway where I'm babbling on and I

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.750 
fun anyway where I'm babbling on and I
really<00:02:31.440> should<00:02:31.560> get<00:02:31.680> started<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.460> can<00:02:32.700> you

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760
