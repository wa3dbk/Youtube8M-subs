comparison a lot of people are going to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.960

draw its games like borderlands or even
Diablo<00:00:21.960> obviously<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> think<00:00:22.890> bungee<00:00:23.310> thinks

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
Diablo obviously I think bungee thinks

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.050 
Diablo obviously I think bungee thinks
it's<00:00:23.670> more<00:00:23.910> than<00:00:24.090> just<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:25.320> sort<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.859> thing

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
it's more than just that sort of thing

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.300 
it's more than just that sort of thing
so<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.510> know<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.779> makes<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.080> different

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
so you know what makes it different

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.080 
so you know what makes it different

destinies a game we've been thinking
about<00:00:30.179> for<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> long<00:00:30.720> time<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.679> many<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> us

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
about for a long time for many of us

this is the game that we've always

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
this is the game that we've always
wanted<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.739> make<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.250> what<00:00:36.059> we<00:00:36.180> want<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.450> do

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.069 
wanted to make and what we want to do
was<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.770> take<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.579> visceral

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
was to take that that visceral

that we've been we've been making for a
long<00:00:42.870> time<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.280> marry<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.360> in<00:00:45.629> a

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
long time and and marry it up in a

long time and and marry it up in a
really<00:00:45.840> elegant<00:00:46.140> way<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.520> investment

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
really elegant way with the investment

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.940 
really elegant way with the investment
game<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.570> you<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> world<00:00:49.800> is

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
game so that you so that the world is

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.709 
game so that you so that the world is
all<00:00:50.070> about<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> become<00:00:51.149> legend<00:00:51.660> you

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
all about you you can become legend you

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.049 
all about you you can become legend you
can<00:00:51.899> build<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> grow<00:00:52.710> who<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.340> over<00:00:53.820> time

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can build and grow who you are over time

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.660 
can build and grow who you are over time
so<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.110> look<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.219> for<00:00:56.550> us

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so when we look at the game we for us

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.660 
so when we look at the game we for us
this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.879> very<00:00:57.719> much<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.920> next<00:00:59.550> evolution

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this is very much a the next evolution

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.819 
this is very much a the next evolution
is<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> sort<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> our<00:01:00.660> next<00:01:01.320> logical<00:01:01.500> step

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is a sort of our next logical step

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
is a sort of our next logical step
forward<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.000> what<00:01:03.300> we<00:01:03.359> used

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
forward if you think about what we used

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.090 
forward if you think about what we used
to<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.600> as<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> 30<00:01:04.260> seconds<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.739> fun<00:01:04.920> right

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to say as the 30 seconds of fun right

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
to say as the 30 seconds of fun right
hello<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.939> what<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.270> new<00:01:06.570> 30

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
hello what is that what is that new 30

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
hello what is that what is that new 30
seconds<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.979> fun<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.150> once<00:01:09.299> we<00:01:09.390> were<00:01:09.479> able

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
seconds of fun and so once we were able

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.500 
seconds of fun and so once we were able
to<00:01:09.720> pull<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.049> off<00:01:10.909> put<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.000> in<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> world<00:01:12.330> with

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
to pull that off put it in a world with

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.499 
to pull that off put it in a world with
a<00:01:12.540> great<00:01:12.780> sandbox<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.979> great<00:01:14.790> characters

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a great sandbox and great characters

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.480 
a great sandbox and great characters
yeah<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> play<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.100> strike

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
yeah so I got to play the strike

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.359 
yeah so I got to play the strike
missions<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.409> couple<00:01:19.409> times<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.220> is

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
missions a couple times and this is

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.080 
missions a couple times and this is
obviously<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.850> multiplayer-focused<00:01:23.090> concept

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
obviously a multiplayer-focused concept

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820 
obviously a multiplayer-focused concept
you<00:01:24.390> dive<00:01:24.630> in<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> play<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.770> about

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
you dive in there you play for about

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.380 
you dive in there you play for about
maybe<00:01:26.040> 30<00:01:26.340> minutes<00:01:26.549> with<00:01:26.759> your<00:01:26.880> buddies<00:01:27.119> take

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
maybe 30 minutes with your buddies take

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.840 
maybe 30 minutes with your buddies take
down<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> boss<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:28.140> some<00:01:28.320> new<00:01:28.439> gear<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> think

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
down a boss get some new gear so I think

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.069 
down a boss get some new gear so I think
the<00:01:30.030> biggest<00:01:30.210> question<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.990> probably
