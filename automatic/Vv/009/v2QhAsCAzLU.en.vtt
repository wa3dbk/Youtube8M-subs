skills<00:04:24.610> now<00:04:26.050> this<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.590> easiest<00:04:27.890> way<00:04:28.190> in<00:04:28.400> my

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
skills now this is the easiest way in my

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.020 
skills now this is the easiest way in my
opinion<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.210> takes<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.810> takes<00:04:30.050> some<00:04:30.440> time<00:04:31.030> but

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
opinion it takes it takes some time but

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.840 
opinion it takes it takes some time but
it's<00:04:32.830> shut<00:04:33.830> up<00:04:34.060> it<00:04:35.060> takes<00:04:35.720> some<00:04:36.080> time<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:37.460> it's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
it's shut up it takes some time but it's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.930 
it's shut up it takes some time but it's
worth<00:04:38.090> it<00:04:38.360> in<00:04:38.510> the<00:04:38.540> end<00:04:38.710> because<00:04:39.710> it's<00:04:40.370> really

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
worth it in the end because it's really

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.000 
worth it in the end because it's really
difficult<00:04:41.330> for<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:42.050> to<00:04:42.169> die<00:04:42.380> because<00:04:42.680> your
