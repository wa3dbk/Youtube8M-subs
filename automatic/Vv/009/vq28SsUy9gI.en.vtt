00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330

thought i would do is ever work on this
some<00:00:21.830> copper<00:00:22.830> thing<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.279> let's<00:00:23.490> say<00:00:23.670> I'm

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
some copper thing and let's say I'm

some copper thing and let's say I'm
about<00:00:23.970> sixty<00:00:24.660> seventy<00:00:25.140> percent<00:00:25.380> done<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.580> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
about sixty seventy percent done so I

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.910 
about sixty seventy percent done so I
thought<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.300> would<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> critique<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.470> my<00:00:28.680> own

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
painting just let you know how I what my

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
painting just let you know how I what my
process<00:00:32.550> is<00:00:32.759> as<00:00:33.059> they<00:00:33.180> go<00:00:33.329> through<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
process is as they go through the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.810 
process is as they go through the
painting<00:00:33.989> process<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.219> look<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:35.550> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
painting process and what I look for in

my own paintings and I think that'd be a
really<00:00:38.460> cool<00:00:38.820> insight<00:00:39.360> but<00:00:39.629> it's<00:00:39.840> also<00:00:40.079> at<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
really cool insight but it's also at the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.380 
really cool insight but it's also at the
same<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:40.950> let<00:00:41.550> those<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> who<00:00:42.239> aren't

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
my paintings that I would have

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.490 
my paintings that I would have
relatively<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:18.330> started<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.110> fifty

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
relatively just started it's about fifty

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.070 
relatively just started it's about fifty
sixty<00:01:19.830> percent<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.490> would<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.840> most

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
sixty percent in would you see is most

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.990 
sixty percent in would you see is most
everything's<00:01:22.530> kind<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.920> late<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.610> there's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
everything's kind of late in but there's

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.480 
everything's kind of late in but there's
everything<00:01:24.360> needs<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.020> lot<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.650> work<00:01:25.770> yet<00:01:26.189> but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
everything needs a lot of work yet but

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.170 
everything needs a lot of work yet but
to<00:01:26.640> um<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:28.170> it's<00:01:28.290> just<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.560> good<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:29.180> for

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.410 
to um I think it's just a good thing for
you<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.960> see<00:01:31.259> where<00:01:32.159> how<00:01:32.610> my<00:01:32.790> thinking<00:01:33.240> process

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you to see where how my thinking process

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630 
you to see where how my thinking process
goes<00:01:33.990> as<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.380> go<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.890> these<00:01:35.430> are<00:01:35.549> the

goes as I go through this these are the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.510 
goes as I go through this these are the
kind<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> questions<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.630> ask<00:01:36.900> myself<00:01:37.290> or<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> talk

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520

to myself while I'm painting so let me

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.200 
to myself while I'm painting so let me
just<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.860> through<00:01:40.890> talk<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.909> some<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210

shapes are really nice I think the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.539 
shapes are really nice I think the
thickness<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> paint<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.549> really

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
thickness of the paint on this is really

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.030 
thickness of the paint on this is really
beautiful<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.899> some<00:02:01.110> nice<00:02:01.290> brush<00:02:01.710> strokes

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040

and<00:02:02.280> then<00:02:02.820> yet<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.360> pull<00:02:03.750> away<00:02:03.869> they're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and then yet when we pull away they're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.029 
and then yet when we pull away they're
still<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.640> still<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.270> retains<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.200> shape

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.370 
okay these little grapes are nice
they're<00:03:37.269> very<00:03:37.660> subdued<00:03:39.660> that's<00:03:40.660> good<00:03:40.989> this

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
they're very subdued that's good this

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.060 
they're very subdued that's good this
tabletop<00:03:41.860> here<00:03:42.459> I<00:03:42.640> like<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.810> color<00:03:44.110> here<00:03:44.650> but

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
tabletop here I like the color here but

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.710 
tabletop here I like the color here but
I<00:03:45.100> think<00:03:45.370> what<00:03:45.730> if<00:03:45.910> I<00:03:46.030> brought<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.480> little

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
I think what if I brought in a little

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.140 
I think what if I brought in a little
bit<00:03:46.840> different<00:03:47.320> color<00:03:47.620> down<00:03:47.980> in<00:03:48.310> here<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
bit different color down in here that

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.970 
bit different color down in here that
would<00:03:49.299> be<00:03:49.450> my<00:03:49.600> suggestion<00:03:50.110> for<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:50.739> bring

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
would be my suggestion for that is bring

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.670 
would be my suggestion for that is bring
down<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.220> little<00:03:51.489> bit<00:03:51.610> more<00:03:52.000> of<00:03:52.510> a<00:03:52.720> color<00:03:53.019> or<00:03:53.350> in

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
down a little bit more of a color or in

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.259 
down a little bit more of a color or in
the<00:03:53.860> photograph<00:03:54.340> there's<00:03:54.519> actually<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.910> rug

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
the photograph there's actually a rug

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.090 
the photograph there's actually a rug
here<00:03:55.630> maybe<00:03:56.110> even<00:03:56.320> put<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.620> little<00:03:56.769> bit<00:03:56.890> of<00:03:56.980> a

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
here maybe even put a little bit of a

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.640 
here maybe even put a little bit of a
rug<00:03:57.310> with<00:03:57.519> maybe<00:03:57.820> I<00:03:57.910> some<00:03:58.180> tassels<00:03:58.480> and<00:03:58.930> to

maybe really bring this thing and bring
it<00:04:02.650> home<00:04:02.829> I<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:03.880> a<00:04:03.910> blue<00:04:04.269> bowl<00:04:04.600> here<00:04:05.170> in<00:04:05.380> this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.190 
it home I have a blue bowl here in this
I<00:04:06.489> couldn't<00:04:07.269> decide<00:04:07.450> whether<00:04:07.810> or<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.110> I

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
I couldn't decide whether or not I

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.410 
I couldn't decide whether or not I
wanted<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.680> put<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.549> do<00:04:09.880> like<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.209> little

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
wanted to put it in I do like the little

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.060 
wanted to put it in I do like the little
pieces<00:04:10.720> of<00:04:11.049> blue<00:04:11.260> because<00:04:11.590> it's<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.890> nice

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
pieces of blue because it's a nice

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.199 
pieces of blue because it's a nice
discord<00:04:12.880> but<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.540> is<00:04:13.600> very<00:04:13.690> warm<00:04:15.090> for<00:04:16.090> this

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
discord but it is very warm for this

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.580 
discord but it is very warm for this
very<00:04:16.600> warm

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
very warm

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.590 
very warm
harmony<00:04:19.400> that<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.699> see<00:04:19.970> here<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.389> make<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
harmony that you see here so make it

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.080 
harmony that you see here so make it
would<00:04:20.810> make<00:04:20.959> for<00:04:20.989> a<00:04:21.230> very<00:04:21.260> nice<00:04:21.880> discord<00:04:22.880> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
would make for a very nice discord and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.300 
would make for a very nice discord and
what<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.510> discord<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.169> is<00:04:24.380> that's<00:04:24.889> the

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
what the discord is is that's the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.270 
what the discord is is that's the
someplace<00:04:25.910> different<00:04:26.389> on<00:04:26.750> the<00:04:27.320> color<00:04:28.190> wheel

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
someplace different on the color wheel

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.180 
someplace different on the color wheel
normally<00:04:28.820> on<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> opposite<00:04:29.540> side<00:04:29.949> so<00:04:30.949> those

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
normally on the opposite side so those

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.800 
normally on the opposite side so those
are<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.400> things<00:04:31.669> i<00:04:31.910> see<00:04:32.120> i<00:04:32.150> see<00:04:32.270> here<00:04:32.630> I've<00:04:32.780> got

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
are the things i see i see here I've got

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.170 
are the things i see i see here I've got
some<00:04:33.229> green<00:04:33.530> grapes<00:04:33.889> I<00:04:34.070> want<00:04:34.370> to<00:04:34.460> put<00:04:34.610> in<00:04:34.729> but<00:04:35.120> I

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
some green grapes I want to put in but I

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.850 
some green grapes I want to put in but I
want<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.389> leave<00:04:35.570> them<00:04:35.690> very<00:04:35.930> abstract<00:04:36.620> but

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
want to leave them very abstract but

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.710 
want to leave them very abstract but
they<00:04:37.010> need<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.190> be<00:04:37.280> resolved<00:04:37.460> more<00:04:38.120> than<00:04:38.419> that

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
they need to be resolved more than that

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.719 
they need to be resolved more than that
we<00:04:39.440> have<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.650> hump<00:04:39.949> on<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.190> table<00:04:40.580> that

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
we have this hump on the table that

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.219 
we have this hump on the table that
we're<00:04:40.850> going<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.060> have<00:04:41.150> to<00:04:41.240> deal<00:04:41.479> with<00:04:41.720> the

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
we're going to have to deal with the

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.710 
we're going to have to deal with the
grapes<00:04:42.560> are<00:04:42.770> looking<00:04:43.130> pretty<00:04:43.310> good<00:04:43.639> I<00:04:44.030> maybe

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
grapes are looking pretty good I maybe

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.590 
grapes are looking pretty good I maybe
have<00:04:45.050> got<00:04:45.290> them<00:04:45.470> a<00:04:45.530> little<00:04:45.710> bit<00:04:45.919> too<00:04:46.310> blue<00:04:46.880> so

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
have got them a little bit too blue so

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.120 
have got them a little bit too blue so
they're<00:04:47.780> a<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:47.990> bit<00:04:48.169> too<00:04:48.470> much<00:04:48.680> out<00:04:48.919> of<00:04:48.979> the

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
they're a little bit too much out of the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.490 
they're a little bit too much out of the
color<00:04:49.370> harmony<00:04:49.910> but<00:04:50.479> I'll<00:04:50.720> wait<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.139> decide

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
color harmony but I'll wait to decide

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.409 
color harmony but I'll wait to decide
what<00:04:51.800> i'm<00:04:51.919> doing<00:04:52.280> here<00:04:52.580> with<00:04:52.760> this<00:04:52.970> because<00:04:53.330> if

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
what i'm doing here with this because if

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.570 
what i'm doing here with this because if
I<00:04:53.540> don't<00:04:53.600> put<00:04:54.380> that<00:04:54.410> bowl<00:04:54.740> in<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:55.160> may<00:04:55.340> use<00:04:55.400> some

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
I don't put that bowl in I may use some

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.390 
I don't put that bowl in I may use some
of<00:04:55.910> that<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.240> little<00:04:56.389> bit<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.750> discord<00:04:57.400> so

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
of that is a little bit of a discord so

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.400 
of that is a little bit of a discord so
anyway<00:04:58.729> that's<00:04:58.940> my<00:04:59.150> thinking<00:04:59.570> process<00:04:59.900> when<00:05:00.380> I

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
anyway that's my thinking process when I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.070 
anyway that's my thinking process when I
go<00:05:00.590> through<00:05:00.800> with<00:05:01.040> this<00:05:01.520> or<00:05:01.790> when<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:02.660> would

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
go through with this or when I would

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.070 
go through with this or when I would
critique<00:05:03.760> another<00:05:04.760> artist<00:05:05.270> work<00:05:05.540> that's<00:05:05.840> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
critique another artist work that's the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.680 
critique another artist work that's the
kind<00:05:06.320> of<00:05:06.440> thing<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:06.889> look<00:05:07.220> for<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.729> I<00:05:07.820> talk<00:05:08.270> to

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
kind of thing I look for and I talk to

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.570 
kind of thing I look for and I talk to
you<00:05:09.500> know<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.830> artist<00:05:10.039> or<00:05:10.370> in<00:05:10.430> this<00:05:10.520> case

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
you know the artist or in this case

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.120 
you know the artist or in this case
myself<00:05:11.060> as<00:05:11.600> those<00:05:12.139> are<00:05:12.320> the<00:05:12.350> things<00:05:12.620> that<00:05:12.830> need

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
myself as those are the things that need

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.940 
myself as those are the things that need
work<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:14.030> when<00:05:14.660> I<00:05:14.690> would<00:05:15.200> be<00:05:15.470> going<00:05:15.680> through

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
work so when I would be going through

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.830 
work so when I would be going through
this<00:05:15.979> process<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.789> doing<00:05:16.910> this<00:05:17.180> painting<00:05:17.660> I

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
this process of doing this painting I

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.420 
this process of doing this painting I
would<00:05:18.289> maybe<00:05:18.440> grab<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:18.800> little<00:05:19.070> pad<00:05:19.220> of<00:05:19.340> paper

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
would maybe grab a little pad of paper

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.659 
would maybe grab a little pad of paper
and<00:05:19.699> I<00:05:19.820> jot<00:05:20.180> down<00:05:20.210> all<00:05:20.870> these<00:05:21.350> things<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:22.039> would

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
and I jot down all these things I would

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.640 
and I jot down all these things I would
notice<00:05:23.060> and<00:05:23.300> then<00:05:23.690> I'd<00:05:23.840> work<00:05:24.050> on<00:05:24.200> those<00:05:24.380> the

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
notice and then I'd work on those the

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.050 
notice and then I'd work on those the
next<00:05:24.950> time<00:05:25.070> I<00:05:25.100> went<00:05:25.340> back<00:05:25.520> to<00:05:25.700> work<00:05:25.850> on<00:05:26.000> the

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
next time I went back to work on the

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.969 
next time I went back to work on the
painting<00:05:26.539> on<00:05:26.690> this<00:05:27.169> particular<00:05:27.470> case<00:05:27.770> I'm

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
painting on this particular case I'm

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.190 
painting on this particular case I'm
gonna<00:05:28.100> have<00:05:28.190> a<00:05:28.220> video<00:05:28.610> but<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.780> kind<00:05:30.020> of<00:05:30.080> get

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
gonna have a video but you kind of get

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.350 
gonna have a video but you kind of get
the<00:05:30.260> idea<00:05:30.380> this<00:05:31.370> is<00:05:31.520> very<00:05:31.850> similar<00:05:32.120> to<00:05:32.240> the

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
the idea this is very similar to the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.270 
the idea this is very similar to the
videos<00:05:32.750> as<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:32.990> provide<00:05:33.350> my<00:05:33.380> classes<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.130> is

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
videos as I provide my classes this is

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.310 
videos as I provide my classes this is
maybe<00:05:34.490> a<00:05:34.550> little<00:05:34.760> bit<00:05:34.970> higher<00:05:35.479> resolution

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
maybe a little bit higher resolution

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.589 
maybe a little bit higher resolution
because<00:05:36.889> I<00:05:37.220> wanted<00:05:37.550> to<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:38.090> don't<00:05:38.330> have<00:05:38.479> to

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599
