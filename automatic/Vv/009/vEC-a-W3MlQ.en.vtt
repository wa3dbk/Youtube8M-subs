00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.510 
okay so this was just a quick look at
this<00:01:48.689> device<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.170> don't<00:01:49.350> know<00:01:49.409> how<00:01:49.590> exactly

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
this device I don't know how exactly

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.399 
this device I don't know how exactly
it's<00:01:51.119> gone<00:01:51.329> how<00:01:51.570> much<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.840> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.140> cost

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it's gone how much is going to cost

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.800 
it's gone how much is going to cost
exactly<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.670> be<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.390> sure<00:01:54.420> quite
