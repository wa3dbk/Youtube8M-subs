00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 if x exists in the natural numbers 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 union 0 unless you lose direct x 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:14.670
 exists in these numbers here is to say 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.300
 that xx exists for that we use a 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.000
 is in a this special means there is 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 in or belongs to the natural numbers 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.869
 union of 0 that is to numbers 0 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:33.390
 because we have 0 union 0 0 1 2 3 4 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.800
 and so all the rest 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.750
 ok wait what ugly symbol ok perfect and 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 then tell us what other kind of 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.500
 sets of numbers belongs xo what 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.670
 we refer to x and I forgot 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.120
 here put it to belongs 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.969
 ok very well now, look what if 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.550
 is there here then let's look at 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.370
 in all the other numbers now these 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.780
 natural numbers union 0 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.580
 we specify that if it is 0 because 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.920
 there are some people who say that the 0 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.509
 is contained in natural and other 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.940
 people who say that 0 is not 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.950
 contained in the natural ones so not 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.899
 let's get rid of problems and we better go 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.289
 to see the natural numbers without counting 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:21.470
 0 and in this case since we add the 0 and 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:25.149
 we hit the 0 to see x there are 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.130
 natural numbers natural numbers 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.539
 natural and good is that we can see or 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.069
 we can think to the natural numbers 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:37.810
 as two whole positive integers 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:40.060
 positive integers per se 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.610
 and this remember it because we had said 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.799
 that integers were all 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.039
 natural numbers that is to say all the 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.390
 integers that are positive on 0 and also 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.240
 all versions of the numbers 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.159
 natural negative so if I 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.110
 I look at the natural ones the natural ones 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:02.350
 are the numbers 1 2 3 4 and all the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.320
 others now if I want to ask myself or 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.229
 wait if I want to ask me if x 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.819
 it exists here good then realize that x 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.730
 can exist in any of these 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.000
 but it can also be 0 and if x can 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.459
 be 0 then it does not necessarily exist 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.440
 here there is a possibility that x 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:23.260
 is worth 0 and therefore we could not 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.090
 ensure that he is here then x not 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.269
 We can assure that there are natural 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.030
 ok now if we think about the integers if 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.950
 we think about the integers or that the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.209
 whole numbers are all numbers 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:43.900
 that look like dots minus three comma 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:46.060
 minus 2 minus 10 123 and all the rest 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.730
 Now I want you to realize that in 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.950
 this occasion if we can ensure that x 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.480
 is here and we can assure you that it is 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.239
 here because look here we are here 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.310
 containing all the numbers of the 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.640
 which can take a value x we are 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.250
 counting all these numbers 0 1 2 3 4 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.950
 and all the others therefore here yes 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.519
 I can assure that x is in the integers 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.700
 x is in the integers ok and let me 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.269
 put it like that x then it exists in the 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.970
 integers is to say in the integers very well 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.380
 will be x in the rational 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.600
 Well, we can also say of a 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.459
 very easy way that if x exists in the 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:28.330
 nationals because you remember that the 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.220
 The rationals are included 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.590
 the rationals are the numbers that are 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.560
 can see the way I trained in 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.260
 mind where myn are integers but 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.450
 all the natural numbers union in 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.420
 zero all this part of here we can 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.880
 see as a rational number because 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.730
 we can always divide them between one ok 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.890
 x if the rationals are x will be the 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.020
 irrational then in a very 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.490
 quick we can conclude that it is not 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.290
 in the rationals because there are the 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:58.240
 rational if the rationals are not 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.280
 are the professionals remember and 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.290
 we can also conclude that x is in 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.210
 the real numbers and I can also 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.610
 conclude a very fast way because if 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.620
 are the rationals are in the real 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.330
 remember that the real ones we had said 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.640
 that were the rational union the 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.780
 irrational therefore it is in the 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.780
 real and we have already finished
