which I like shaggy but there's a limit
and<00:00:16.940> for<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.270> reason<00:00:18.630> my<00:00:18.660> swoop<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:20.369> one

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

that you can see in all my pictures it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.550 
that you can see in all my pictures it
comes<00:00:22.859> right<00:00:23.100> across<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.640> face<00:00:24.320> right<00:00:25.320> through

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
comes right across my face right through

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
comes right across my face right through
here<00:00:25.939> is<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:28.439> very<00:00:28.740> hard<00:00:29.010> thing<00:00:29.070> for<00:00:29.310> stylists

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
here is a very hard thing for stylists

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.970 
here is a very hard thing for stylists
to<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:31.109> get<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.309> not<00:00:32.790> sure<00:00:32.850> why<00:00:33.980> but

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
to to get I think I'm not sure why but

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.069 
to to get I think I'm not sure why but
almost<00:00:35.399> always<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:35.940> want<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.570> start<00:00:36.870> off

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
almost always they want to start off

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.100 
almost always they want to start off
cutting<00:00:37.760> what<00:00:38.760> should<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.300> longest<00:00:39.780> part

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
cutting what should be the longest part

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.940 
cutting what should be the longest part
of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> swoop<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.989> they<00:00:42.989> start<00:00:43.350> cutting<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
of the swoop is they start cutting it

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.660 
of the swoop is they start cutting it
and<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.480> ends<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.670> like

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
and and it ends up like this like like

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.490 
and and it ends up like this like like
like<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.329> can<00:00:48.480> see<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.930> not<00:00:49.050> correct<00:00:49.969> so

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
like as you can see it is not correct so

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.660 
like as you can see it is not correct so
they<00:00:52.500> want<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.739> cut<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.010> here<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:53.550> it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they want to cut it here and then it

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.810 
they want to cut it here and then it
turns<00:00:54.000> into<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> bowl<00:00:55.190> looking<00:00:56.190> shape<00:00:56.550> on

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
turns into like a bowl looking shape on

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.880 
turns into like a bowl looking shape on
my<00:00:57.420> head<00:00:57.890> which<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.039> upsetting<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.890> after

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
my head which is upsetting and after

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
my head which is upsetting and after
getting<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.250> done<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.879> looking<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
getting that done and then looking in

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
getting that done and then looking in
the<00:01:03.449> mirror<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.960> being<00:01:04.439> kind<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> upset<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
the mirror and being kind of upset I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.620 
the mirror and being kind of upset I
decided<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.900> too<00:01:07.680> attached<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.250> my<00:01:08.369> hair

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
decided that I'm too attached to my hair

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
decided that I'm too attached to my hair
and<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:12.439> don't<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.490> lot<00:01:14.729> of

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
and I don't know I think that a lot of

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.410 
and I don't know I think that a lot of
us<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:16.220> we've<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.520> mean<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
us are we've I mean it's just a

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380 
us are we've I mean it's just a
collection<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:19.110> dead<00:01:19.790> cells<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.970> our<00:01:21.150> heads

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
collection of dead cells on our heads

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.530 
collection of dead cells on our heads
that's<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> hair<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:23.150> it's<00:01:24.150> there<00:01:24.390> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that's all that hair is it's there to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.609 
that's all that hair is it's there to
keep<00:01:24.570> our<00:01:24.869> heads<00:01:25.080> warm<00:01:25.580> when<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:26.729> cold<00:01:26.820> out

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
keep our heads warm when it's cold out

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.830 
keep our heads warm when it's cold out
to<00:01:28.619> protect<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> Sun<00:01:29.759> when<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> hot

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to protect it from the Sun when it's hot

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.940 
to protect it from the Sun when it's hot
out<00:01:32.090> just<00:01:33.090> does<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.299> lot<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> things<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.079> us<00:01:34.200> but

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
out just does a lot of things for us but

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.730 
out just does a lot of things for us but
I<00:01:35.189> think<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:36.329> far<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.659> appearance<00:01:37.500> goes

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I think that as far as appearance goes

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.330 
I think that as far as appearance goes
we<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.369> become<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:38.880> too<00:01:39.000> attached<00:01:39.390> so

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
we can become a little too attached so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
we can become a little too attached so
since<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.520> not<00:01:41.640> too<00:01:41.909> hot<00:01:42.090> or<00:01:42.119> cold<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.689> I

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
since it's not too hot or cold and I

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
since it's not too hot or cold and I
have<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.710> luxury<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.130> wearing<00:01:44.460> hats<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
have the luxury of wearing hats and

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.600 
have the luxury of wearing hats and
bandanas<00:01:45.570> if<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.200> need<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:47.540> I've<00:01:48.540> decided<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.610> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
bandanas if I need to I've decided to to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.550 
bandanas if I need to I've decided to to
cut<00:01:50.790> myself<00:01:50.939> off<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.840> hair<00:01:52.049> for<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.380> little

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
cut myself off of my hair for a little

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
decided to do this or I thought about

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.649 
decided to do this or I thought about
doing<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659

has nothing to do with me wanting to to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.510 
has nothing to do with me wanting to to
be<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.369> cool<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.210> don't<00:02:06.960> know<00:02:07.049> I'm<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.039> going

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
of relying on these dead cells to

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.709
