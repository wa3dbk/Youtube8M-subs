00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.460
 I will let you see the expense briefly 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.379
 I have done and also how much I spent 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.699
 I state that I have not bought that is not 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.260
 you will see just everything 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.970
 they lead a week because many 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.000
 I already had things in the fridge so I didn't 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.539
 But I bought them to get you more 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.960
 an idea let's say what I buy 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.710
 weekly then 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.329
 I usually do the shopping at eurospin 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.780
 conad a little mixed and then 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.699
 obviously also at the market and vi 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.290
 I show what I take from 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.610
 usually from eurospin and why anyway 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.260
 they have good prices and in short vi 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.180
 I show the products he has 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.850
 this usually then we start with 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.909
 the dates I usually find them at 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.190
 less than 6 euros per kilo and they are excellent 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:59.899
 for those who still hydrate lire in water 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.460
 and I use them in shakes especially 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.289
 let's say you eat the way it's not that 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.110
 just like it so much though rehydrated and 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:07.899
 milkshakes to sweeten are 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.470
 so these are excellent qualities 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:15.530
 then decree to my surprise today I have 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.509
 found that black rice if you do not 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.460
 in short cognitive invitation to try it 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.060
 because that is when you cook it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.159
 gave off a fantastic smell and 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.310
 obviously I want the shrimp 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.500
 how it is here but it can be seasoned in many 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.840
 kind ways with pumpkin mushrooms and peas 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 how you want it really is delicious and does 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:40.479
 contains a lot of calcium nutrients 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.479
 magnesium is a mini iron a mine 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.229
 then I always picked up eurospin and there 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.530
 I usually take legumes 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.960
 this time I took the chickpeas and dried chickpeas 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 also these here we say for the times in 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 which maybe I don't have them under cooked 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.610
 of two jars and then of almonds also 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.329
 I find them cheap because 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 else ah here I occasionally lithium e 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.989
 so I got some chocolate 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.360
 of ecuador these fondant also 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.370
 Fairtrade Fairtrade market does not 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.500
 contains only refined sugars 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.000
 brown sugar and it is very good 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.609
 obviously I eat little for every now and then 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.450
 I usually give him that little bit later 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.069
 I also take rice chanterelles there 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.470
 that I really liked these too 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.680
 are of organic farming and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.239
 piadine that made only with olive oil 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.739
 and then what else I got this from 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:39.010
 eurospin to date we have found in 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.310
 also offered from rice milk 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.019
 normally this organic milk is 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.870
 one euro and twenty if I'm not mistaken instead 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.910
 today it was more or less the port was 90 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.510
 cents so today we found 89 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:01.630
 in fact we have made a stock of it and 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:03.040
 are about 5 here are 2 4 6 8 10 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.660
 are 15 bottles 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.799
 so we have a nice supply 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.079
 rella and also soy milk usually 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:14.650
 if they take it, I always take it, but I do 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:17.620
 i take from eurospin and that's it 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.920
 what I got there and spent and I have 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:26.560
 spent spent spent at 30 wait for it not 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:28.510
 you see well I spent 36 euros I don't know if 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.560
 if I did not understand why it fails to 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.450
 to focus 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.049
 however I spent 36 euros buying 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.569
 we also say other little things for her 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.230
 home however mostly stuff from 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.819
 eating then I took some basil 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.019
 I know it's not time but I needed it 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.030
 to make a recipe I have to 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.220
 experiment and also the tomatoes that of 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.049
 I usually buy the market but I had a 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.209
 urgent and therefore I return I was there 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.579
 to the cross and I took them to the conad and I want 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.160
 to say I took the pores also to the conad 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.780
 you speak they are very good I always use them 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.150
 in almost all recipes above all 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.800
 in the chickpea farinata mentioned above 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.620
 I will show you the recipe 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.140
 then I took a bit of flaw pampering 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.420
 I also take this bio I know though 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.900
 now I didn't have time to go to the 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.780
 shop 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.360
 I took it seems so I always took it 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.310
 by eurospin a bit of oyster points 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.970
 made grilled with say a little 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.420
 of parsley and a little salt until they are 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.780
 exceptional 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.180
 the cashews these 15 meeting from lidl 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.010
 that they can do little enough 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.410
 I always take it from time to time when I have to 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.570
 I like vegetable cheese 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.500
 take them and now the part that most 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.880
 I prefer they were not always in a 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.680
 supermarket 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.710
 I don't remember if it was a discount store 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.920
 anyway and they had these bananas and 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.900
 it hurts that among other things below where art 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.750
 I read about other consumption that they should 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.370
 be quite biological and I have them 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.080
 find at 70 cents per kilo then 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.960
 they were all a little scattered in the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.270
 various departments so of the fruit and vegetable I 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.120
 I have gleaned all of them and we have them 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.840
 we took them are quite like 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.620
 see and can continue here and then 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.960
 we took some apples 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:20.160
 these golden always less than one euro 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.690
 if I'm not mistaken these here instead me 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.880
 they are taken by the peasant sail facts 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.560
 pay one euro per kilo 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.930
 avocado we don't make it big 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.850
 I use it but for once we take it 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.720
 this obviously made me mature 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:37.770
 because bananas are not ripe yet and then 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:40.620
 we also took a pineapple and then that 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.810
 other to harm then we took that 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.970
 they're hiding below 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.699
 will be a couple of pounds by itself a 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:51.360
 chilo of drinking so fair oh well next 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:54.840
 see you various onions potatoes that 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:58.470
 we take and nothing this is I wanted you 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.900
 to show the I spent in all calculation 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.440
 spent about 50 about fifty 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:08.639
 euros including also inclusive 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:11.130
 yes, in short, the cashews and I repeat this 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.740
 time I spent a little more consideration 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.010
 that I bought a lot of milk from 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:22.500
 rice is really so many trivial as 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:24.510
 you can see and I didn't care for anything 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.820
 to let you see this this expense of 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.880
 today it will undermine cody of god 's budget 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.040
