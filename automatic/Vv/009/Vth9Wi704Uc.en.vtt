our<00:01:25.119> idea<00:01:25.540> was<00:01:25.690> to<00:01:25.750> separate<00:01:26.320> them<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.670> what<00:01:27.820> we

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
our idea was to separate them so what we

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.960 
our idea was to separate them so what we
do<00:01:28.180> is<00:01:28.509> take<00:01:28.720> a<00:01:28.780> frame<00:01:29.140> like<00:01:29.440> this<00:01:29.680> one<00:01:29.940> and<00:01:30.940> we

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
do is take a frame like this one and we

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.120 
do is take a frame like this one and we
add<00:01:31.180> on<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:31.509> ceilings<00:01:31.960> floors<00:01:32.470> and<00:01:32.950> walls
