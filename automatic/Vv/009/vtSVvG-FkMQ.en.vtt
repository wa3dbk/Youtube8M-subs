increasing horsepower through

was<00:00:11.969> at<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> car<00:00:12.690> meet<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.530> wasn't<00:00:13.830> a<00:00:13.860> car

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
was at a car meet or it wasn't a car

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.760 
was at a car meet or it wasn't a car
meet<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.429> was<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.580> car<00:00:14.880> show<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:16.170> I<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.500> the

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
meet it was a car show but I was in the

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.779 
meet it was a car show but I was in the
kind<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.580> JDM<00:00:18.090> section<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.800> we're

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
kind of JDM section of it all and we're

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.050 
kind of JDM section of it all and we're
all<00:00:21.000> talking<00:00:21.210> about<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.109> this

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
all talking about I think is this

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.740 
all talking about I think is this
Integra<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.180> something<00:00:25.070> one<00:00:26.070> guy<00:00:26.250> says<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:27.180> got

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
Integra or something one guy says I got

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.050 
Integra or something one guy says I got
more<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.199> got<00:00:28.800> more<00:00:28.859> power<00:00:29.250> through<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.820> bigger

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
more I got more power through a bigger

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.810 
more I got more power through a bigger
sparkplug<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.320> everyone<00:00:32.279> started<00:00:32.669> laughing

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
sparkplug and everyone started laughing

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.930 
sparkplug and everyone started laughing
at<00:00:33.180> him<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:34.230> no<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.430> know<00:00:35.640> what<00:00:35.850> he

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
at him and no one really know what he

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.970 
at him and no one really know what he
was<00:00:36.030> talking<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.540> when<00:00:36.899> he<00:00:36.930> said<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.350> all

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
was talking about when he said that all

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
was talking about when he said that all
the<00:00:38.340> people<00:00:38.610> that<00:00:38.640> were<00:00:38.850> laughing<00:00:39.239> at<00:00:39.360> him

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the people that were laughing at him

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.319 
the people that were laughing at him
thought<00:00:40.050> Oh<00:00:40.079> Boober<00:00:40.829> sparkplug<00:00:41.550> means<00:00:41.879> bigger

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
thought Oh Boober sparkplug means bigger

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.540 
thought Oh Boober sparkplug means bigger
boom<00:00:43.670> he's<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:44.940> right<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.680> he's<00:00:47.039> he

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
boom he's actually right and he's he

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.430 
boom he's actually right and he's he
people<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:48.360> get<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:48.989> he's<00:00:49.140> talking

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
people didn't get what he's talking

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:49.850 
people didn't get what he's talking
about

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
about

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.490 
about
so<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:51.899> I'm<00:00:52.260> demonstrating

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
so how this is right I'm demonstrating

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.490 
so how this is right I'm demonstrating
on<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.070> scooter<00:00:53.600> it<00:00:54.600> actually<00:00:55.079> complete

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
on a scooter it actually complete

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
increases compression ratio assuming

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
increases compression ratio assuming
this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> stock<00:00:58.530> spark<00:00:58.920> plug<00:00:59.239> the<00:01:01.969> scooter

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
this is the stock spark plug the scooter

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.370 
this is the stock spark plug the scooter
comes<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:05.240> this<00:01:06.240> tiny<00:01:06.630> head<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
comes with and this tiny head the

comes with and this tiny head the
scooter<00:01:07.770> comes<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.880> not<00:01:08.939> really

scooter comes with this it's not really

scooter comes with this it's not really
a<00:01:09.390> huge<00:01:10.100> it<00:01:11.100> makes<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.490> huge<00:01:11.670> difference<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.390> you

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
a huge it makes a huge difference so you

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.990 
a huge it makes a huge difference so you
do<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> on<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.930> scooter<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.760> same

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
do it on a scooter you have the same

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.749 
do it on a scooter you have the same
length<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.570> thread<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.250> don't<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
length of thread I don't think you can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.100 
length of thread I don't think you can
just<00:01:17.939> put<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.150> longer<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.689> in<00:01:18.810> there<00:01:18.960> because

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
just put a longer one in there because

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.670 
just put a longer one in there because
you<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.189> hit<00:01:20.340> something<00:01:20.780> but<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> tap

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
you don't hit something but if you tap

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.060 
you don't hit something but if you tap
and<00:01:23.040> bore<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.420> have<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.689> I

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
and bore this out to have and I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.370 
and bore this out to have and I
professionally<00:01:26.070> assuming<00:01:26.520> don't<00:01:27.000> just<00:01:27.380> stick

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
professionally assuming don't just stick

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
professionally assuming don't just stick
a<00:01:28.409> tap<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.950> dice<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.130> great<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.729> sparkle

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
a tap and dice that great in the sparkle

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.280 
a tap and dice that great in the sparkle
cool<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:30.540> you're<00:01:30.689> gonna<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.990> metal

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
cool because you're gonna get metal

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.020 
cool because you're gonna get metal
shavings<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.829> your<00:01:31.979> engine<00:01:32.280> obviously<00:01:32.790> book

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
shavings in your engine obviously book

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
shavings in your engine obviously book
you're<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:34.020> increase<00:01:34.409> compression<00:01:35.009> by<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
you're gonna increase compression by a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.190 
you're gonna increase compression by a
lot<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.970> scooter<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.450> already<00:01:36.780> rated<00:01:36.930> at

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
lot and this scooter is already rated at

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.850 
lot and this scooter is already rated at
10<00:01:37.500> points<00:01:37.890> something<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.700> 1<00:01:38.990> so<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.470> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
10 points something to 1 so if I do this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
10 points something to 1 so if I do this
I'm<00:01:41.040> probably<00:01:41.159> gonna<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:41.520> up<00:01:41.909> having<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.450> run

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
I'm probably gonna end up having to run

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.050 
I'm probably gonna end up having to run
a<00:01:42.659> higher<00:01:42.990> octane<00:01:43.380> than<00:01:43.619> super<00:01:44.040> probably<00:01:44.880> race

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
a higher octane than super probably race

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
a higher octane than super probably race
fuel<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:47.729> note<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> scooters<00:01:48.960> top<00:01:49.170> speed<00:01:49.560> is

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
fuel and note the scooters top speed is

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.969 
fuel and note the scooters top speed is
like<00:01:49.979> 41<00:01:50.729> by<00:01:51.060> GPS

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
like 41 by GPS

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.490 
like 41 by GPS
start<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> box<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> I'm<00:01:55.200> just<00:01:55.380> gonna

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
start out of the box so I'm just gonna

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.889 
start out of the box so I'm just gonna
do<00:01:56.219> an<00:01:56.340> experiment<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.390> actually

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
do an experiment and I can actually

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.530 
do an experiment and I can actually
reach<00:01:58.079> top<00:01:58.380> speed<00:01:58.710> embarrassingly<00:01:59.540> without

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
reach top speed embarrassingly without

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.120 
reach top speed embarrassingly without
breaking<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:00.960> law<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.140> most<00:02:01.409> cases<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:03.020> yeah

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
breaking a law in most cases so yeah

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.039 
breaking a law in most cases so yeah
this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.310> increasing<00:02:06.030> compression<00:02:06.659> with

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
this is increasing compression with

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.050 
this is increasing compression with
spark<00:02:07.380> plugs<00:02:07.680> actually<00:02:08.280> has<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> meeting<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
spark plugs actually has a meeting and

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500 
spark plugs actually has a meeting and
it's<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.360> joke<00:02:11.030> people<00:02:12.030> get<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> wrong

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
it's not a joke people get the wrong

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.590 
it's not a joke people get the wrong
idea<00:02:12.930> when<00:02:13.230> some

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
idea when some

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.890 
idea when some
he<00:02:13.720> says<00:02:14.190> at<00:02:15.190> least<00:02:15.400> those<00:02:15.670> people<00:02:15.700> did<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.570> it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
he says at least those people did it it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.110 
he says at least those people did it it
actually<00:02:17.080> took<00:02:17.410> me<00:02:17.620> some<00:02:17.950> time<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.310> catch<00:02:18.850> on

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
actually took me some time to catch on

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.580 
actually took me some time to catch on
of<00:02:19.270> what<00:02:19.390> he<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.600> talking<00:02:20.020> about<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:22.260> yeah<00:02:23.260> I

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
of what he was talking about and yeah I

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.390 
of what he was talking about and yeah I
actually<00:02:23.740> did<00:02:24.100> some<00:02:24.250> research<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:26.400> knew

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
actually did some research and I knew

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.570 
actually did some research and I knew
you<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.540> people<00:02:28.900> shave<00:02:29.200> down<00:02:29.440> like<00:02:29.800> heads

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
you that people shave down like heads

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.760 
you that people shave down like heads
and<00:02:30.850> stuff<00:02:31.060> precision<00:02:31.750> work<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:32.230> those<00:02:32.410> kinds

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
and stuff precision work all those kinds

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.090 
and stuff precision work all those kinds
of<00:02:32.830> stuff

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
of stuff

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.540 
of stuff
but<00:02:34.560> it's<00:02:35.560> not<00:02:35.770> going<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.040> be<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.310> much

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
but it's not going to be that much

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.850 
but it's not going to be that much
increased<00:02:37.140> compression<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> car<00:02:38.650> engine

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
increased compression on a car engine

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.550 
increased compression on a car engine
because<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.550> a<00:02:39.580> bigger<00:02:39.820> head<00:02:40.470> there's<00:02:41.470> a

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
because you have a bigger head there's a

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.550 
because you have a bigger head there's a
lot<00:02:41.770> more<00:02:42.040> space<00:02:42.550> there<00:02:42.850> but<00:02:43.090> if<00:02:43.210> you<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
lot more space there but if you have a

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.050 
lot more space there but if you have a
v6<00:02:44.560> or<00:02:45.100> v8<00:02:45.130> that's<00:02:45.790> times<00:02:46.420> six<00:02:46.930> and<00:02:48.060> that'll

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
v6 or v8 that's times six and that'll

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.690 
v6 or v8 that's times six and that'll
add<00:02:49.240> up<00:02:49.390> to<00:02:49.570> make<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:50.020> noticeable<00:02:51.010> difference<00:02:51.400> I

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
add up to make a noticeable difference I

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.200 
add up to make a noticeable difference I
would<00:02:51.760> assume<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:53.640> difference<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.910> power

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210 
would assume a difference in the power

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.400 
would assume a difference in the power
and<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:57.130> might<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.750> run<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.780> bit<00:02:59.170> better

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
and you might have to run a bit better

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.800 
and you might have to run a bit better
fuel<00:02:59.740> like<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.520> you're<00:03:00.670> running<00:03:00.820> 87<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:01.690> your

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
fuel like if you're running 87 in your

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.960 
fuel like if you're running 87 in your
normal<00:03:01.960> car<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.830> one<00:03:02.980> part<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.310> run<00:03:03.430> super

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
normal car and one part to run super

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.620 
normal car and one part to run super
it's<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.630> doesn't<00:03:04.900> hurt<00:03:05.050> it's<00:03:05.350> good<00:03:05.500> for<00:03:05.680> me

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
it's it doesn't hurt it's good for me

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.660 
it's it doesn't hurt it's good for me
and<00:03:07.630> I'm<00:03:08.440> gonna<00:03:08.590> actually<00:03:08.950> be<00:03:09.250> doing<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.550> to

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
and I'm gonna actually be doing it to

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.160 
and I'm gonna actually be doing it to
the<00:03:09.760> scooter<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.390> we're<00:03:10.630> gonna<00:03:10.720> see<00:03:10.990> some

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
the scooter and we're gonna see some

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.350 
the scooter and we're gonna see some
after<00:03:11.500> numbers<00:03:11.860> through<00:03:12.370> GPS<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.150> I'll<00:03:13.210> make

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
after numbers through GPS and I'll make

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.110 
after numbers through GPS and I'll make
another<00:03:13.600> video<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:14.080> me<00:03:14.430> performing<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.880> task

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
another video of me performing the task

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960 
another video of me performing the task
I'll<00:03:16.750> pull<00:03:17.020> the<00:03:17.110> head<00:03:17.230> off<00:03:17.260> this<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.010> tap<00:03:18.760> and

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
I'll pull the head off this and tap and

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.620 
I'll pull the head off this and tap and
dine<00:03:19.120> out<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:20.650> we're<00:03:20.950> gonna<00:03:21.040> test<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:21.790> out<00:03:21.880> so

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
dine out and we're gonna test it out so

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.160 
dine out and we're gonna test it out so
thanks<00:03:23.200> for<00:03:23.350> watching<00:03:23.800> and<00:03:23.980> subscribe
