00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.699
 Welcome to a new episode of mine 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.699
 Ship TV 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.330

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.880
 pictures in her studio 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.770
 how would you like your art here 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.400
 you can describe pictures 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.720
 between representational and abstract 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.460
 mostly landscapes mostly 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.460
 there or remember landscapes 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.590
 You also have something with my ship 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.110
 3 to do 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.120
 on what they're working I'm working on a 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.489
 great pictures for the team three 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 something in eight parts is made around 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.350
 the total of one meter eight times 14 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.670
 92 meters was like many of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 There are eight parts in total now 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.200
 already finished five parts are ready and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.580
 at the sixth I work straight and one 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.580
 can this mathilde johansson here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.040
 we are now facing two of the total 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.690
 eight pictures are almost done 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.820
 and I think it's very impressive 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.130
 Roskow what exactly does the painting on 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.220
 the end of the painting is inspired by 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.230
 the journey of marco polo the end of 1300 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.000
 traveled from venice to china 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.830
 and what can one do on these two 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.320
 picture now here so see this 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.090
 Both parts represent the goal of China 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.130
 travel from marc o'polo and here to 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.350
 For example, you can see the palace of Kublai 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.240
 khan or as the book tells 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.340
 a bridge of soil between two 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.140
 cities and otherwise different 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.400
 Scenery impressions from China where we 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.530
 The picture hanging in the end on the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.150
 ship the picture hangs in the end 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.650
 two restaurants between one 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.360
 Asian number one Italian 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.130
 restaurant you can also suggest something 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.420
 say to the development process like that 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.850
 Picture ever emerged on the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.500
 finished canvas so I'm mine 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.690
 first read the book by marc 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.580
 o'polo some other research then 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.470
 trying to find different pictures 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.920
 to all the landscapes mentioned 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.930
 become 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.970
 then I put it together like that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.410
 Sketches you can see here, for example 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.410
 so can the piece stands out 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.390
 the picture is a word too special 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.160
 requirements 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.230
 what did they have to do with the material? 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.150
 of the picture pay attention to this 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.560
 I have requirements for acrylic 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.060
 decided on canvas because of this 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.860
 colors are very weather resistant and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.870
 also elastic make the hopefully 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.010
 everything with what the ship does and since 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.320
 when are you already working on that? 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.860
 paintings with all the preparations since 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.580
 may and rheine that all paint since 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.260
 mid August 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.790
 I thank them all for first time 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.010
 We gladly welcome you in today 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.720

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.250
