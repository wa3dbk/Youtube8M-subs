00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
modifications so the first thing was

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.390 
modifications so the first thing was
dryness<00:00:59.110> I've<00:01:00.110> struggled<00:01:00.440> with<00:01:00.590> dryness<00:01:00.950> on

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
dryness I've struggled with dryness on

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.760 
dryness I've struggled with dryness on
my<00:01:01.550> natural<00:01:01.880> hair<00:01:02.030> life<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.780> when<00:01:03.320> I<00:01:03.350> started

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
my natural hair life and when I started

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.350 
my natural hair life and when I started
this<00:01:03.920> regimen<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.580> know<00:01:04.670> it<00:01:04.879> would<00:01:04.970> take<00:01:05.119> time

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
this regimen I know it would take time

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.749 
this regimen I know it would take time
for<00:01:05.509> my<00:01:05.630> hair<00:01:05.840> to<00:01:06.020> become<00:01:06.140> hydrating<00:01:07.009> but<00:01:07.700> I

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
for my hair to become hydrating but I

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.420 
for my hair to become hydrating but I
reached<00:01:08.030> a<00:01:08.180> certain<00:01:08.360> point<00:01:08.689> in<00:01:09.340> doing<00:01:10.340> the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
reached a certain point in doing the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.120 
reached a certain point in doing the
regimen<00:01:10.759> where<00:01:11.000> I<00:01:11.030> felt<00:01:11.330> like<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:12.770> know<00:01:12.890> my

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
regimen where I felt like you know my

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.910 
regimen where I felt like you know my
hair<00:01:13.720> should<00:01:14.720> not<00:01:14.900> be<00:01:15.020> feeling<00:01:15.290> this<00:01:15.530> dry

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
hair should not be feeling this dry

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.359 
hair should not be feeling this dry
anymore<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:17.810> had<00:01:18.259> to<00:01:18.350> take<00:01:18.590> back<00:01:18.829> take<00:01:19.340> a

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
anymore and so I had to take back take a

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.140 
anymore and so I had to take back take a
step<00:01:19.670> back<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.150> really<00:01:21.550> pinpoint<00:01:22.550> the<00:01:22.700> areas

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
step back and really pinpoint the areas

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.940 
step back and really pinpoint the areas
in<00:01:23.330> the<00:01:23.480> regimen<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.140> I<00:01:24.200> felt<00:01:24.560> were

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
in the regimen that I felt were

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.940 
in the regimen that I felt were
contributing<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.850> my<00:01:26.000> dryness<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:26.900> one<00:01:27.680> was

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
contributing to my dryness and one was

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.170 
contributing to my dryness and one was
the<00:01:28.610> clay<00:01:29.000> step<00:01:29.300> I<00:01:29.570> was<00:01:30.200> using<00:01:30.440> bentonite<00:01:31.100> clay

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
the clay step I was using bentonite clay

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.120 
the clay step I was using bentonite clay
which<00:01:32.180> I<00:01:32.479> like<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.990> way<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.229> defines<00:01:33.650> my<00:01:33.920> hair

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
which I like the way it defines my hair

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.580 
which I like the way it defines my hair
and<00:01:34.430> makes<00:01:34.640> my<00:01:34.790> hair<00:01:35.000> clump<00:01:35.330> but<00:01:36.140> after<00:01:36.380> all<00:01:36.440> it

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
and makes my hair clump but after all it

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.860 
and makes my hair clump but after all it
rented<00:01:36.950> off<00:01:37.120> my<00:01:38.120> hair<00:01:38.420> would<00:01:38.690> feel<00:01:39.490> parched

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
rented off my hair would feel parched

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.710 
rented off my hair would feel parched
squeaky<00:01:41.870> stripped<00:01:42.880> overly<00:01:43.880> dry<00:01:46.720> unquenchable

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
squeaky stripped overly dry unquenchable

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.010 
squeaky stripped overly dry unquenchable
and<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:49.100> ended<00:01:49.850> up<00:01:49.970> switching<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.540> la<00:01:50.690> Sol

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
and so I ended up switching to a la Sol

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.899 
and so I ended up switching to a la Sol
clay<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.530> I've<00:01:51.620> had<00:01:51.830> better<00:01:52.070> success<00:01:52.400> with

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
clay and I've had better success with

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.740 
clay and I've had better success with
that<00:01:52.940> I<00:01:53.420> don't<00:01:53.780> feel<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:55.180> defines<00:01:56.180> and<00:01:56.420> clumps

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
that I don't feel it defines and clumps

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.380 
that I don't feel it defines and clumps
quite<00:01:57.049> as<00:01:57.290> well<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.620> the<00:01:57.740> bentonite<00:01:58.100> clay<00:01:58.390> but

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
quite as well as the bentonite clay but

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.680 
quite as well as the bentonite clay but
I'll<00:02:00.049> take<00:02:00.350> that<00:02:00.409> over<00:02:00.590> dryness<00:02:01.580> any<00:02:01.970> day<00:02:02.180> and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
I'll take that over dryness any day and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.310 
I'll take that over dryness any day and
then<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:05.090> other<00:02:05.270> part<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.600> my<00:02:05.750> hat<00:02:05.960> was<00:02:06.140> with

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
then the other part of my hat was with

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.280 
then the other part of my hat was with
the<00:02:06.500> gel<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:08.229> gave<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.440> gel<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.709> good<00:02:10.039> world<00:02:10.280> but

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
the gel I gave the gel a good world but

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.940 
the gel I gave the gel a good world but
gel<00:02:12.290> is<00:02:12.530> just<00:02:12.799> not<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.549> my<00:02:13.700> hair<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.769> could<00:02:15.769> not

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
gel is just not for my hair I could not

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.339 
gel is just not for my hair I could not
get<00:02:16.129> the<00:02:16.250> gel<00:02:16.549> to<00:02:16.580> behave<00:02:17.180> as<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> sealant<00:02:18.140> or

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
get the gel to behave as a sealant or

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.500 
get the gel to behave as a sealant or
protect<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.189> like<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.879> supposed<00:02:20.269> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
protect it like it's supposed to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.899 
protect it like it's supposed to
in<00:02:20.810> this<00:02:21.349> method<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.280> was<00:02:22.400> frustrating

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
in this method and that was frustrating

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.760 
in this method and that was frustrating
because<00:02:23.120> I<00:02:23.299> see<00:02:23.480> people<00:02:23.510> with<00:02:23.810> hair<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.620> like

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
because I see people with hair just like

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.710 
because I see people with hair just like
mine<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.250> are<00:02:25.340> using<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> gel<00:02:26.000> with<00:02:26.569> no

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
mine that are using the gel with no

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.940 
mine that are using the gel with no
problems<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.319> all

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
problems at all

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.430 
problems at all
but<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.670> jails<00:02:30.030> seem<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:30.630> drama<00:02:30.990> here<00:02:31.290> out

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
but the jails seem to drama here out

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.400 
but the jails seem to drama here out
even<00:02:31.800> more<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.940> had<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.390> right<00:02:33.420> cast<00:02:33.990> my

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
even more and I had the right cast my

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.250 
even more and I had the right cast my
hair<00:02:34.680> felt<00:02:35.040> exactly<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.270> way<00:02:36.420> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
hair felt exactly the way the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.830 
hair felt exactly the way the
instructions<00:02:37.890> described<00:02:38.520> but<00:02:39.330> then<00:02:39.600> with<00:02:39.750> my

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
instructions described but then with my

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.650 
instructions described but then with my
hair<00:02:40.110> dried<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:41.370> would<00:02:41.670> be<00:02:44.660> extremely

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
hair dried it would be extremely

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.790 
hair dried it would be extremely
vulnerable

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
vulnerable

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.790 
vulnerable
it<00:02:47.250> would<00:02:47.400> break<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.910> snap<00:02:48.330> easily<00:02:48.690> and<00:02:49.260> it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
it would break and snap easily and it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.890 
it would break and snap easily and it
was<00:02:49.920> just<00:02:50.360> ungodly<00:02:51.360> dry<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.830> did<00:02:53.130> try<00:02:53.400> using

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
was just ungodly dry and I did try using

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.720 
was just ungodly dry and I did try using
olive<00:02:54.900> oil<00:02:55.170> in<00:02:55.710> between<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.520> leave-in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
olive oil in between the leave-in

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.680 
olive oil in between the leave-in
conditioner<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:58.650> gel<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.340> it<00:03:00.060> helped<00:03:00.480> it

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
conditioner and the gel and it helped it

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.050 
conditioner and the gel and it helped it
helped<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.650> from<00:03:01.860> being<00:03:02.070> worse<00:03:02.280> than<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.730> would

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
helped it from being worse than it would

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.060 
helped it from being worse than it would
have<00:03:03.090> been<00:03:03.210> but<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.140> don't<00:03:04.440> feel<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.890> it

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
have been but I don't feel like it

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.340 
have been but I don't feel like it
really<00:03:05.280> helped<00:03:05.760> solve<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.780> problem<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.820> so

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
really helped solve the problem and so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.900 
really helped solve the problem and so
the<00:03:10.350> other<00:03:10.500> problem<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.190> had<00:03:11.490> is<00:03:11.520> when<00:03:11.880> I

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the other problem that I had is when I

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.060 
the other problem that I had is when I
would<00:03:12.210> because<00:03:13.020> I<00:03:13.140> used<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.410> olive<00:03:13.770> oil<00:03:13.860> when

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
would because I used the olive oil when

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.270 
would because I used the olive oil when
I'd<00:03:14.160> go<00:03:14.340> back<00:03:14.520> to<00:03:14.640> do<00:03:14.760> step<00:03:15.030> one<00:03:15.770> then<00:03:16.770> there

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
I'd go back to do step one then there

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.670 
I'd go back to do step one then there
would<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.670> film<00:03:18.120> on<00:03:18.300> my<00:03:18.450> hair<00:03:18.720> from<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
would be this film on my hair from the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.760 
would be this film on my hair from the
oil<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:21.180> gel<00:03:21.420> combined<00:03:21.900> together<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.590> I

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
oil and the gel combined together and I

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.470 
oil and the gel combined together and I
couldn't<00:03:23.070> get<00:03:23.220> it<00:03:23.310> off<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.970> baking<00:03:24.330> soda

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
couldn't get it off the baking soda

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.970 
couldn't get it off the baking soda
couldn't<00:03:24.900> get<00:03:25.020> it<00:03:25.140> off<00:03:25.290> in<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.590> apple<00:03:25.860> cider

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
couldn't get it off in the apple cider

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.630 
couldn't get it off in the apple cider
vinegar<00:03:26.930> couldn't<00:03:27.930> get<00:03:28.020> it<00:03:28.110> off<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:29.460> if

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
vinegar couldn't get it off and so if

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.520 
vinegar couldn't get it off and so if
you've<00:03:29.820> had<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.330> opportunity<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.110> research

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
you've had the opportunity to research

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.470 
you've had the opportunity to research
that<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:32.040> know<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.489> those<00:03:32.730> are<00:03:33.120> mild

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
that you know that those are mild

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.300 
that you know that those are mild
clarifiers<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:34.980> they<00:03:36.110> don't<00:03:37.110> do<00:03:37.320> the<00:03:37.560> best

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
clarifiers and they don't do the best

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.150 
clarifiers and they don't do the best
job<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.880> getting<00:03:39.239> a<00:03:39.330> lot<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.570> oil<00:03:39.930> off<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:40.890> I

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
job of getting a lot of oil off so I

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.100 
job of getting a lot of oil off so I
wasn't<00:03:41.580> getting<00:03:41.820> all<00:03:42.180> completely<00:03:42.720> off<00:03:42.900> my

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
wasn't getting all completely off my

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.020 
wasn't getting all completely off my
hair<00:03:43.380> until<00:03:43.650> step<00:03:44.010> three<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.550> clay<00:03:44.730> step

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
hair until step three the clay step

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.760 
hair until step three the clay step
that's<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.480> got<00:03:45.660> everything<00:03:46.170> off<00:03:46.320> my<00:03:46.530> hair

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
that's what got everything off my hair

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.670 
that's what got everything off my hair
but<00:03:47.760> because<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.120> had<00:03:48.360> a<00:03:48.390> film<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:49.020> my<00:03:49.170> hair<00:03:49.470> when

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
but because I had a film on my hair when

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.430 
but because I had a film on my hair when
I<00:03:49.709> would<00:03:49.920> go<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.130> cohosh<00:03:51.060> finger<00:03:51.810> detangle<00:03:52.320> and

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
I would go to cohosh finger detangle and

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.440 
I would go to cohosh finger detangle and
deep<00:03:52.680> condition<00:03:53.280> there<00:03:53.910> was<00:03:54.030> really<00:03:54.209> no

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
deep condition there was really no

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.300 
deep condition there was really no
uptake<00:03:54.930> of<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.230> conditioner<00:03:55.770> because<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
uptake of the conditioner because the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.420 
uptake of the conditioner because the
film<00:03:56.730> of<00:03:57.060> oil<00:03:57.269> on<00:03:57.660> my<00:03:57.840> hair<00:03:58.140> was<00:03:58.890> blocking<00:03:59.220> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
film of oil on my hair was blocking the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.690 
film of oil on my hair was blocking the
conditioner<00:04:00.060> from<00:04:00.540> uptaking<00:04:01.170> so<00:04:01.920> my<00:04:02.489> hair

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
conditioner from uptaking so my hair

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.000 
conditioner from uptaking so my hair

started to go backwards I started to

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.620

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
to frizz back out it's got to the point

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.350
