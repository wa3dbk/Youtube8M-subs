00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:15.809
 hello today we have a video 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:16.970
 valve cover vaz classic 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.300
 engine 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 why I decided to show it to you because 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 that many have a question about leakage 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.140
 oil from under the cap from under the filler 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.110
 water filler caps 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.829
 necks from under the cover between 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.100
 head and cover people buy change 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.530
 laying laying goes not for long 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.329
 begin to tighten the nuts begins 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:56.489
 instill even more then there is a thing in 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:01:01.859
 what's the point is that we have with time in 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.970
 the places where we press here lie 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.990
 triangular washers 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 such plates helicopters but over time 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 these places still falls from 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:22.680
 constriction mainly therefore this 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.030
 the plane bends this one itself 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.869
 plane 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.350
 bends here well presses in these 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.290
 places 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.729
 there is even a lack of gaskets with 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.090
 time laying sits down and starts 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:44.790
 Moscow Sofia is a way out 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.790
 Here is a piece of rail found on your case 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.159
 can someone find a piece of thick 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.290
 metal grade metal can 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.130
 metal plate with smooth 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:01.259
 of course we instruct the surface 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:05.369
 can it so about and the whole thing 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.450
 we pass taps with a hammer that is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.910
 align the plane 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.910
 We move on if we do not have enough 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.510
 dub right next as we pass with 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.720
 this side and this circle 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.550
 the whole cover were clear that the paint had 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.739
 us 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.070
 some places with prickly peel but here 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.130
 such a thing can be at the same time and cover 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:41.120
 repaint this color to you too 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.940
 like about 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.260
 oil filler cap and we 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:53.130
 we see here the spring antennae that is, how 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.730
 we would not press them and not spring 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.560
 You can take back to try to instruct 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.560
 neat wood 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.960
 although it is hardly possible to pester them 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.820
 drown a little bit so as not to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.710
 burst 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:17.400
 but basically we have this surface 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.710
 too we take leave somewhere 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.650
 neatly so that the cover itself does not play not 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:28.830
 vibrated and edges neatly 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.200
 start at the edge and squander over 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:36.300
 Slightly squander this side too. 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:42.180
 then we will have a cap here 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:46.320
 twists and better press well 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:50.970
 certainly see for yourself on the can 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.310
 should you buy a new cover this cover 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.989
 still fine therefore just squander 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.470
 We are setting this surface on 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.440
 bet and remove so she slipped a little 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:04.459
 without fanaticism then the cover we will have 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:09.390
 curl you feel more tightly and 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.020
 will keep butter and will be here 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.500
 as is usually the dirty surface behind 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.500
 olives 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.019
 Well, that's the video for today 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.000
 subscribe to my channel put 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.560
 class and 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.890
 likes to dislike 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.890
 see you all 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.620
