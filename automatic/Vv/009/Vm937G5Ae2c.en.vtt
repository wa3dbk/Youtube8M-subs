00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.850 
ends up being burned off for energy I'm
sure<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.810> rest<00:02:54.110> of<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.319> gets<00:02:54.410> stored<00:02:54.680> as

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
sure but the rest of it gets stored as

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.770 
sure but the rest of it gets stored as
glycogen<00:02:54.890> in<00:02:55.550> my<00:02:55.670> liver<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:55.970> my<00:02:56.360> muscles

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780

quick<00:02:57.530> science<00:02:57.769> lesson<00:02:58.220> for<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.400> guys

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
quick science lesson for you guys

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.180 
quick science lesson for you guys
glycogen<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.989> made<00:03:00.170> up<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.440> three<00:03:00.680> parts<00:03:01.010> water

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
glycogen is made up of three parts water

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.150 
glycogen is made up of three parts water
and<00:03:01.580> one<00:03:01.760> part<00:03:01.790> sugar<00:03:02.300> your<00:03:03.140> liver<00:03:03.440> can<00:03:03.920> store

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
and one part sugar your liver can store

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.350 
and one part sugar your liver can store
about<00:03:04.959> 100<00:03:05.959> 200<00:03:06.170> grams<00:03:06.709> of<00:03:07.040> glycogen<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.180> your

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
about 100 200 grams of glycogen and your

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.809 
about 100 200 grams of glycogen and your
muscles<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.959> store<00:03:09.230> another<00:03:09.500> 400<00:03:10.489> grams<00:03:10.640> of

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
muscles can store another 400 grams of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.309 
muscles can store another 400 grams of
glycogen<00:03:11.120> so<00:03:11.390> basically<00:03:11.840> you're<00:03:11.989> looking<00:03:12.080> at

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
glycogen so basically you're looking at

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.890 
glycogen so basically you're looking at
about<00:03:12.530> 2,000<00:03:13.280> maybe<00:03:13.340> 2,400<00:03:14.209> calories<00:03:14.390> worth

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
about 2,000 maybe 2,400 calories worth

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.289 
about 2,000 maybe 2,400 calories worth
of<00:03:15.380> sugar<00:03:15.680> stored<00:03:16.100> in<00:03:16.190> your<00:03:16.280> body<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.090> when<00:03:17.269> I

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
of sugar stored in your body now when I

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.319 
of sugar stored in your body now when I
do<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.510> 36<00:03:18.019> hour<00:03:18.200> fast<00:03:18.530> like<00:03:19.100> clockwork<00:03:19.400> my<00:03:20.090> body

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
do a 36 hour fast like clockwork my body

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.810 
do a 36 hour fast like clockwork my body
burns<00:03:20.720> that<00:03:20.959> off<00:03:21.079> between<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.530> 18<00:03:22.370> hour<00:03:22.489> mark

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
burns that off between the 18 hour mark

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.240 
burns that off between the 18 hour mark
and<00:03:23.120> definitely<00:03:23.480> between<00:03:23.840> that<00:03:24.709> and<00:03:24.739> maybe

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
and definitely between that and maybe

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.340 
and definitely between that and maybe
like<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> 22<00:03:25.940> hour<00:03:26.090> 24-hour<00:03:26.720> mark<00:03:26.959> I'm

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
like the 22 hour 24-hour mark I'm

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.080 
like the 22 hour 24-hour mark I'm
completely<00:03:27.829> tapped<00:03:28.100> out<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.459> glycogen<00:03:28.820> my

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
completely tapped out of glycogen my

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.120 
completely tapped out of glycogen my
glycogen<00:03:29.540> stores<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:29.989> empty<00:03:30.140> and<00:03:30.590> that's<00:03:30.920> one

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
glycogen stores are empty and that's one

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.250 
glycogen stores are empty and that's one
of<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.280> big<00:03:31.430> reasons<00:03:31.610> why<00:03:31.910> I<00:03:32.030> know<00:03:32.269> that<00:03:32.780> what

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
of the big reasons why I know that what

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.960 
of the big reasons why I know that what
I<00:03:33.290> gained<00:03:33.620> was<00:03:33.890> water<00:03:34.130> weight<00:03:34.370> and<00:03:34.400> not<00:03:34.640> fat

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
I gained was water weight and not fat

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.979 
I gained was water weight and not fat
because<00:03:35.360> if<00:03:35.540> my<00:03:35.750> glycogen<00:03:36.230> stores<00:03:36.590> are<00:03:36.920> empty

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
because if my glycogen stores are empty

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.090 
because if my glycogen stores are empty
because<00:03:38.989> I'm<00:03:39.140> doing<00:03:39.380> all<00:03:39.470> this<00:03:39.590> fasting

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
because I'm doing all this fasting

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.199 
because I'm doing all this fasting
there's<00:03:40.310> no<00:03:40.459> way<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.820> it<00:03:40.970> could<00:03:41.120> be

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
there's no way that it could be

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.569 
there's no way that it could be
overflowing<00:03:41.750> into<00:03:41.989> fat<00:03:42.260> reserves<00:03:42.470> which<00:03:43.430> is

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
overflowing into fat reserves which is

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.130 
overflowing into fat reserves which is
what<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.820> does<00:03:43.970> for<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> majority<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.780> people

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
what it does for the majority of people

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.810 
what it does for the majority of people
who<00:03:45.290> eat<00:03:45.470> too<00:03:45.650> many<00:03:45.739> carbs<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.340> don't<00:03:46.519> do<00:03:46.640> any

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
who eat too many carbs and don't do any

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.509 
who eat too many carbs and don't do any
exercise<00:03:47.329> to<00:03:47.600> offset<00:03:48.019> that<00:03:48.079> carb<00:03:48.500> intake<00:03:48.890> so

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
exercise to offset that carb intake so

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:50.530 
exercise to offset that carb intake so
don't<00:03:49.730> be<00:03:49.850> one<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.000> those<00:03:50.090> people

done that I've used myself as a guinea
pig<00:04:51.730> and<00:04:51.940> I've<00:04:52.150> use<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.450> process<00:04:52.690> of

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
pig and I've use the process of

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.630 
pig and I've use the process of
elimination<00:04:53.080> to<00:04:53.770> figure<00:04:54.010> out<00:04:54.130> what<00:04:54.310> works<00:04:54.520> and

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
elimination to figure out what works and

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.760 
elimination to figure out what works and
what<00:04:54.820> doesn't<00:04:55.090> for<00:04:55.390> me<00:04:55.480> and<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.320> that's<00:04:56.500> how<00:04:56.740> I

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
what doesn't for me and so that's how I

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.970 
what doesn't for me and so that's how I
knew<00:04:57.040> that<00:04:57.070> this<00:04:57.310> was<00:04:57.520> gonna<00:04:57.610> be<00:04:57.730> predictable

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
knew that this was gonna be predictable

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:02.070

worry about it so much if I can lose
four<00:05:05.860> and<00:05:05.980> a<00:05:06.010> half<00:05:06.040> pounds<00:05:06.640> overnight<00:05:06.910> in

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
four and a half pounds overnight in

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.370 
four and a half pounds overnight in
terms<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.750> water<00:05:07.930> weight

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
terms of water weight

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.350 
terms of water weight
so<00:05:08.770> can<00:05:09.010> you<00:05:09.040> we<00:05:09.400> can<00:05:09.580> store<00:05:09.790> up<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.940> four<00:05:10.270> to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
so can you we can store up to four to

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.960 
so can you we can store up to four to
six<00:05:10.570> pounds<00:05:10.720> of<00:05:10.930> water<00:05:11.110> in<00:05:11.590> our<00:05:12.070> bodies<00:05:12.490> any
