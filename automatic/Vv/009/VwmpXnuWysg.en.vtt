00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
 all hunter presses and in this video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.099
 show you how to get distilled 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.570
 water in industrial craft two experiments 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.670
 if smooth water is needed for 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.040
 refrigerant production and also on 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.839
 used in their work 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 steam generator to get down 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.640
 tinted water you need first 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 screen solar when removed, it is crafted 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760
 from glass 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.189
 the main body of the mechanism and 2 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.080
 universal liquid capsules after 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.550
 of how you crafted and installed it 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.830
 it will look like in this way 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.710
 when you right click on it 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.570
 we get into the internal interface 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.090
 here we have a cell where we lay 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.370
 water capsules if you put it here 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.350
 universal water capsule after 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.329
 using capsules from here it will be possible 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.980
 collect deserts 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.440
 here you can either empty capsules 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.410
 either empty universal capsule and when 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.590
 filled with distilled water 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.260
 you can pick them up from this cell 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.809
 simple water treatment process and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.290
 turning street kirov on will be very 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.750
 long so if you don't want so much 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.460
 wait a long time then you need 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.369
 use the second method of getting 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.350
 distilled water it is much faster 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.350
 for this you will need 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 any heat generators I use 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.100
 radioisotope because they are the most 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.060
 simple 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.630
 you will also need a fluid regulator 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 crafts and he from an iron shell empty 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.310
 Capsule electric motor 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.119
 electrical circuits and two iron shells 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.790
 then you need a steam generator 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 crafted iron hell 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:49.560
 copper boiler the boiler itself is painted from 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:53.659
 copper shell and heat sink more precisely 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.090
 heat wire from kraft steam generator 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.189
 after you set it up 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.999
 here are these squares with him 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.270
 touched 

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:04.819
 also so that u fluid regulator here 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.100
 This point touched him because 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:10.250
 that through the fluid regulator we will 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.940
 supply water to the steam generator and next to 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.340
 steam generator to put the condenser 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.400
 while the steam generator is running, it will 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.650
 heat the water turn it into steam this 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.480
 steam will get into the condenser here too 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.110
 here is the year formed distilled water 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.870
 if you get universal capsules 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.579
 or simple after you fill them 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.190
 here you can pick up either 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:36.220
 full capsules are simple either 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.680
 universal full capsules 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.910
 also you can put will improve them 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.190
 liquid ejector and 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.780
 distilled water will be pushed out 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.120
 in the direction you want 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.310
 either down and the wolf up or in all 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.799
 parties 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.049
 so for the operation of the capacitor is needed 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.120
 energy 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:59.129
 minimal for ivar so scandal 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.390
 the minimum for his work is 3 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.129
 unit maximum 128 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.120
 the more energy you give to those 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.870
 shelling work 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:15.239
 You can also use a special 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:19.459
 heat exchanger tray heatsink it 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.459
 done in order to speed up the process 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 distilling steam into water so now we 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:39.079
 connect to it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:51.109
 power supply we put thermal here 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:55.370
 items 1 2 here we need 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:59.379
 bring water so found here we connect 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.120
 put them in the fluid regulator a thousand 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:05.650
 so that the water immediately flowed and set 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:09.109
 here the capsule is all water now immediately 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.159
 Crosses in the steam generator waiting when he 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:15.139
 will heat up to the working temperature 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.940
 let's put it be 100 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.479
 defense 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.479
 here this one 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.710
 and now we just have to wait also 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.570
 still carried even water you can get in 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.810
 genetic steam generator and treatment 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.120
 not 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:38.620
 but you do not 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.630
 kinetic steam generator here in 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.330
 work time he will also generate 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.830
 scales and even water but about him i tell you 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.290
 I will tell in the next video 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.830
 because there is with him some 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:54.220
 lesson and here are just two simple ways 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.229
 first prize using solar thread 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:06.010
 or get carried is equal to water and 2 with 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:08.970
 using a condenser so heating with us 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.970
 leads quietly 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:18.520
 yes if you use steam generator 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.500
 water they drive then while working 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.820
 you will be formed the night and with 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.190
 time he breaks 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.310
 if same you use distilled 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.780
 water here then scale and you will not 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.780
 can use in the evening 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:44.260
 so let's go up one more 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.260
 beside 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:56.080
 that the process was much faster than heating 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.259
 exactly here 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:18.310
 on this yes that's gone steam here we see 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:20.520
 us once begins to appear if even 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.520
 water 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.770
 and now how 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.800
 here we have it filled that is bull 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.460
 1000 units of you automatically capsule 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.460
 will fill up 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.880
 take time capsule 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:11.660
 Here we have a capsule 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.080
 he waters here it is the second fastest 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:17.330
 I hope you get this water 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:19.370
 liked it all put huskies 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.610
 subscribe to my channel and see you soon 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.610
 meeting
