 opera 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.110
 tera 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.110
 U 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:30.789
 Yes. I'm developing a memo . 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:34.540
 Now what rpg is working as mobile ui designer 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:40.149
 I'm in charge of the mobile 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:42.399
 4 This year will be twelve years now With sand Seven-year interpreter will be doing the fifth year 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:48.250
 Are you 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:51.570
 Once the magnetic field of expertise I think there 's at least another portion to be in such a basic gatchwoya 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.259
 When such a part of me, but it now is putting the cursor over a short period of time 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.670
 I see and feel much in my daily life and these things are important. 

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:06.159
 I think that once I took the background, 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.369
 If you look at things like buildings and the environment and do the same things, 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.970
 I was happy. 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:17.259
 First of all, I do not have an institute in my case. 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.189
 I studied self-study. 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:25.600
 In addition to the degree of bowel little progress in the state at that time repeatedly bogoyo 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:30.100
 In practice it is now looking to get creative self for new games themselves 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.060
 It continues to look like the best tha good things do indeed interfere with some ui 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.590
 Well not play 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:40.150
 You have to master 4 basic arts first, then Photoshop and Max 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:44.560
 You need to make sure you have the right thing to do 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:47.490
 Finally we have sensors for commercial art because we have a situation technology 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.490
 You have to be sore. 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:56.150
 I made a game that I made 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.720
 Those who are sitting in my seat while going to work while I'm out in Zia 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:02.270
 I think I'm the most rewarding person in the game . 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.170
 Well, I can divide it into two big ones. 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.640
 During the development period, you'll want to 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.780
 When I have successfully expressed it, I feel most rewarding now. 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.390
 Finally, after finishing the game development , 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.870
 I showed you a good response to that 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.770
 When I write the response is good, it is the most brown 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.910
 Maybe now ingest rewarding job in the private waterfront Now the company has also worked a bit 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.440
 I think it's different . 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:34.640
 Now one of those small batches of individual work is rewarding when finished 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.910
 Now, the biggest bonus for the company is that the game 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:42.230
 This is the most rewarding time when it's released . 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:47.420
 Yes, it's middle of now. 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.160
 Maybe when old buildings are a minor or do this now elaborate on the game 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.820
 What 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.820
 Wow 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.680
 I am happy to work on a hard part. 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.970
 Graphic designers need a lot of creativity , 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.020
 I have it. 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:10.340
 But I like this job, and I have a lot of clothes now. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.620
 That's why I am enjoying the process. 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.890
 I was not going home. 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.130
 What seems to die so I thought I will live to tell this old 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:24.350
 It's not the same now. 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:29.000
 4 There is really a lot of physicality because there is reward, but this week 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:33.500
 Nearly three hours sleep on average 10 a day, we will soon open another 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:38.510
 It is imminent It is hobby of oneself that we think that there is not enough to play with 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:43.280
 When I am in my job as a teacher, 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:49.160
 Programmer Now that you have a lot of different parts , 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:53.450
 I guess it's a good idea to finish the game and get a lot of satisfied users 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.110
 If you think that it will develop, it will be a little harder and harder. 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.110
 I think 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.420
 It becomes a society that is required by society. 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:08.700
 The company you obtained does not require the same cut player. 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.019
 I present portfolio 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:17.400
 So understand the nature of the project you want to support the company and to create a project 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:21.209
 You have to figure out what game you want. 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.860
 And prepare the cut roots that match the atmosphere . 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:29.100
 Even if you meet someone with him, you can smile and give a favor to your opponent. 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.970
 Being a person will help you get a job. 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:38.190
 Go one better job graphically andoeyo nubyeo portfolio is now the first to fall 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.000
 I think that a lot of the increased amount of good as he is now satisfied because it 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.430
 Workpiece 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:50.220
 And I 'm a little boggling, but I can not even bet on it. 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:54.180
 Rather, it works by increasing the amount of multivalent his penalty factor because the yireonge 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.830
 If you are not satisfied with the chicken now, 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.680
 Do not you see it ? 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.770
 So now, rather than four sheep 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:05.820
 It's a satisfactory work, but it 's good to put it on . 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:08.490
 Now we know the areas they are good due diligence or casual variety of genres 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:12.570
 When you submit your portfolio, 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:16.099
 The choice will be broader. The more you try, the more you try . 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.099
 Nothing. 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.690
 No matter how well you look at the picture, our game is the planner's best 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.110
 If you write a proposal, 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:29.860
 The designer creates a picture 15 times more beautifully . 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:34.090
 That's what gives the programmer's doing now moved Returns 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.159
 If this collaboration does not work well for 3 bars , get a proposal letter saying that it is local. 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.460
 I'm going to do the same thing. 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:43.509
 If the client who created it did the same thing 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.250
 In addition, there is a lot of conversation in development studies, 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:49.449
 I think I have a lot 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:54.130
 What more do we only really talk about what botaemyeon 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:58.990
 It's simply because I like to play games, 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.580
 If you have been there for a while now, 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.380
 I think it's getting a little harder to do. 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:10.630
 I think it's a game, but since I'm an author, I like to play games. 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:14.800
 There are a lot of people who work through communication now, 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:17.289
 As I mentioned earlier stress it can also help in part and only simple 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.949
 I think it's all right to come out thinking 

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:26.800
 There are a lot of jobs called games . 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:30.409
 And I think what I'd better treat me in this regard and have such a hope 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:34.219
 There are a lot of people who are approaching now . 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:38.629
 I really enjoyed the game. 

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:42.289
 And if it's not me, I do not really have to do it. 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:47.749
 I really want you to approach me that way. 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:51.080
 It may or may not be a game , but what should not 

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:56.119
 I'm faced with a very difficult challenge. 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:07:00.769
 When you encounter these things, you can overcome it in the early days 

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:07.279
 It is a situation that can be solved when approaching such a mind that will work happily 

00:07:00.769 --> 00:07:12.879
 So I would like to ask you for a really good game. 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:12.879
 I want to find work because I want to enjoy it.
