strain<00:00:16.590> out<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.830> solids<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.609> here<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.910> have

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
strain out the solids so here we have

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.570 
strain out the solids so here we have
half<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.720> cup<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.960> sugar<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.380> two<00:00:19.590> boxes<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.310> the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
to add that to this so now our jam is

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.380 
to add that to this so now our jam is
boiling<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.430> where<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> can't<00:01:44.850> stir<00:01:45.060> down<00:01:45.240> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
boiling to where I can't stir down the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.270 
boiling to where I can't stir down the
bubbles<00:01:45.659> stirring<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:47.070> still

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
bubbles stirring and we're still

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
bubbles stirring and we're still
bubbling<00:01:47.579> so<00:01:48.119> now<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.360> time<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.540> yeah<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.990> add

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
bubbling so now it's time to yeah to add

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.960 
bubbling so now it's time to yeah to add
the<00:01:49.380> other<00:01:49.530> three<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> half<00:01:50.189> cups<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.729> sugar

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
the other three and a half cups of sugar

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.030 
the other three and a half cups of sugar
and<00:01:51.119> what's<00:01:51.450> got<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.320> important<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.920> keep

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
and what's got in it's important to keep

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.819 
and what's got in it's important to keep
whisking<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:54.240> because<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.960> otherwise<00:01:55.439> it's

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
whisking this because it otherwise it's

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
whisking this because it otherwise it's
just<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.640> clumpy<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.030> burn<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.570> the

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
just going to get clumpy and burn to the

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.929 
just going to get clumpy and burn to the
bottom<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.189> don't<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.579> let<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.700> get

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
bottom so you don't want to let it get

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.750 
bottom so you don't want to let it get
too

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
too

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.440 
too
control<00:02:01.270> here<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.790> Jan<00:02:04.030> because<00:02:04.180> we're

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
control here this Jan because we're

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.910 
control here this Jan because we're
using<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.720> low<00:02:04.960> sugar<00:02:05.260> pectin<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.770> we're

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
using the low sugar pectin and we're

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.190 
using the low sugar pectin and we're
using<00:02:06.070> so<00:02:06.400> much<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.880> two<00:02:07.000> packets<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.630> it<00:02:07.810> we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
using so much of it two packets of it we

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.350 
using so much of it two packets of it we
don't<00:02:08.470> need<00:02:08.710> to<00:02:08.950> bring<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> up<00:02:09.369> to<00:02:09.400> usual<00:02:10.119> Jam

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
don't need to bring it up to usual Jam

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.380 
don't need to bring it up to usual Jam
temperature<00:02:10.869> which<00:02:11.080> is<00:02:11.460> 220<00:02:12.460> degrees<00:02:12.760> 220

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
temperature which is 220 degrees 220

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.210 
temperature which is 220 degrees 220
degrees<00:02:13.690> is<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> is<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.440> boiling<00:02:14.680> point<00:02:15.010> at

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
degrees is it is the boiling point at

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.210 
degrees is it is the boiling point at
which<00:02:15.540> sugar<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.720> jam<00:02:16.990> gel<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.100> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
which sugar and jam gel and that's the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.710 
which sugar and jam gel and that's the
gel<00:02:18.430> stage<00:02:18.730> which<00:02:18.970> will<00:02:19.150> get<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.390> lovely

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
gel stage which will get to that lovely

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.050 
gel stage which will get to that lovely
consistency<00:02:20.410> we<00:02:20.590> consider<00:02:20.920> Jam<00:02:21.160> but<00:02:21.790> because

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
consistency we consider Jam but because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.940 
consistency we consider Jam but because
we<00:02:22.180> have<00:02:22.300> two<00:02:22.510> boxes<00:02:22.720> affected<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.530> four<00:02:23.710> cups

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
we have two boxes affected in four cups

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.040 
we have two boxes affected in four cups
of<00:02:24.070> sugar<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.520> this<00:02:24.640> watermelon<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.420> will<00:02:25.780> gel

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
of sugar to this watermelon it will gel

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.570 
of sugar to this watermelon it will gel
at<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.290> lower<00:02:26.470> temperature<00:02:26.740> we<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.370> have<00:02:27.460> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
at a lower temperature we just have to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.520 
at a lower temperature we just have to
get<00:02:27.670> this<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.180> high<00:02:28.330> boil<00:02:28.600> boil<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.350> for<00:02:29.470> a

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
get this up to a high boil boil it for a

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.650 
get this up to a high boil boil it for a
minute<00:02:29.770> and<00:02:29.890> pull<00:02:30.070> it<00:02:30.160> off<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:31.210> here<00:02:31.420> our<00:02:31.510> jam

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
minute and pull it off so here our jam

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.360 
minute and pull it off so here our jam
is<00:02:31.780> up<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.050> nice<00:02:32.260> rolling<00:02:32.560> boil<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.220> we're

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
is up to a nice rolling boil so we're

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.680 
is up to a nice rolling boil so we're
just<00:02:33.400> going<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> stir<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> little<00:02:34.120> bit<00:02:34.420> it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
just going to stir it a little bit it's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.750 
just going to stir it a little bit it's
got<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.960> timer<00:02:35.170> set<00:02:35.410> for<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> minute<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
got the timer set for a minute so

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.120 
got the timer set for a minute so
luckily<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.360> Jam<00:02:37.630> doesn't<00:02:37.990> need<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.440> cook

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
luckily this Jam doesn't need to cook

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.800 
luckily this Jam doesn't need to cook
for<00:02:39.310> all<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.610> long<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.540> don't<00:02:40.690> have

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
for all that long because we don't have

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.750 
for all that long because we don't have
to<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.140> all<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.260> way<00:02:41.410> up<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.680> 220<00:02:42.460> degrees

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
to get it all the way up to 220 degrees

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.730 
to get it all the way up to 220 degrees
like<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.090> usually<00:02:43.300> do<00:02:43.660> Jam<00:02:43.960> we<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.560> two

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
like you usually do Jam we have two

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.050 
like you usually do Jam we have two
boxes<00:02:45.130> of<00:02:45.280> pectin<00:02:45.460> in<00:02:45.730> there<00:02:45.880> we've<00:02:46.030> got

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
boxes of pectin in there we've got

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.970 
boxes of pectin in there we've got
enough<00:02:46.420> acid<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.900> where<00:02:47.440> it's<00:02:47.560> not<00:02:47.710> going<00:02:47.890> to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
enough acid to where it's not going to

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.360 
enough acid to where it's not going to
matter<00:02:48.390> okay<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.450> our<00:02:49.720> Jam<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.080> done<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:51.280> now

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
matter okay so our Jam is done so now

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.560 
matter okay so our Jam is done so now
we're<00:02:51.490> going<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.640> remove<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.030> pot<00:02:52.210> from<00:02:52.480> the

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
we're going to remove the pot from the

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.210 
we're going to remove the pot from the
heat<00:02:52.690> and<00:02:53.200> we're<00:02:53.410> going<00:02:53.530> to<00:02:53.560> let<00:02:53.680> it<00:02:53.740> sit<00:02:54.010> for<00:02:54.040> a

heat and we're going to let it sit for a

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.260 
heat and we're going to let it sit for a
few<00:02:54.250> minutes<00:02:54.430> because<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:54.910> see<00:02:55.060> all<00:02:55.150> that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
few minutes because you see all that

phone on the top you do not want foam in
your<00:02:57.340> Jam<00:02:57.610> so<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.660> need<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.990> let<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.170> stop

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
your Jam so you need to let it stop

those bubbles out of there and let them
come<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.070> the<00:03:06.160> top<00:03:06.370> see<00:03:07.330> how<00:03:07.480> it's<00:03:07.660> starting<00:03:07.780> to

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
come to the top see how it's starting to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.230 
come to the top see how it's starting to
already<00:03:08.290> kind<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.620> coagulate<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.520> there's<00:03:10.150> a

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
already kind of coagulate and there's a

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.699 
already kind of coagulate and there's a
thick<00:03:10.450> kind<00:03:10.630> of<00:03:10.720> slimy<00:03:10.990> foam<00:03:11.290> on<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.560> top

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
thick kind of slimy foam on the top

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.890 
thick kind of slimy foam on the top
we're<00:03:11.860> going<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.040> skim<00:03:12.340> that<00:03:12.520> off<00:03:12.660> we<00:03:13.660> want<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
we're going to skim that off we want to

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:14.970 
we're going to skim that off we want to
give<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.230> good<00:03:14.350> like<00:03:14.560> three<00:03:14.860> or<00:03:14.950> four

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
give it a good like three or four

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.880 
give it a good like three or four
minutes<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:16.060> get<00:03:16.239> all<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.870> bubbles<00:03:17.020> out<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.770> we

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
minutes to get all the bubbles out so we

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.400 
minutes to get all the bubbles out so we
have<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.040> nice<00:03:18.250> smooth<00:03:19.090> Jam<00:03:19.780> that<00:03:20.020> doesn't<00:03:20.260> have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
have a nice smooth Jam that doesn't have

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.979 
have a nice smooth Jam that doesn't have
like<00:03:20.620> these<00:03:20.800> white<00:03:21.459> yucky<00:03:22.420> looking<00:03:22.540> foamy

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
like these white yucky looking foamy

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.370 
like these white yucky looking foamy
things<00:03:23.290> in<00:03:23.500> them<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:24.450> very<00:03:25.450> important<00:03:26.080> step<00:03:26.230> in

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
things in them a very important step in

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.740 
things in them a very important step in
canning<00:03:26.770> it's<00:03:26.920> sanitation<00:03:27.760> and<00:03:27.970> sterilizing

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
canning it's sanitation and sterilizing

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.640 
canning it's sanitation and sterilizing
you<00:03:29.560> wash<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.190> dry<00:03:30.250> your<00:03:31.060> mason<00:03:31.989> jars<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.530> in

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
you wash and dry your mason jars and in

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.990 
you wash and dry your mason jars and in
this<00:03:32.739> case<00:03:32.980> we're<00:03:33.130> doing<00:03:33.160> Jam<00:03:33.489> so<00:03:33.670> we're<00:03:33.820> doing

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
this case we're doing Jam so we're doing

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.090 
this case we're doing Jam so we're doing
a<00:03:34.090> half<00:03:34.239> pint<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:35.020> then<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.500> put<00:03:35.680> those<00:03:35.800> jars

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
a half pint and then you put those jars

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.770 
a half pint and then you put those jars
in<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.400> pot<00:03:36.550> oh<00:03:36.580> it's<00:03:36.820> not<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> big<00:03:37.120> stockpot<00:03:37.570> that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
in a pot oh it's not a big stockpot that

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.090 
in a pot oh it's not a big stockpot that
shouldn't<00:03:38.140> line<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.320> bottom<00:03:38.440> scratched<00:03:38.860> up

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
shouldn't line the bottom scratched up

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.400 
shouldn't line the bottom scratched up
of<00:03:39.370> boiling<00:03:39.940> water<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.420> you<00:03:40.600> boil<00:03:40.870> that<00:03:40.989> for

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
of boiling water and you boil that for

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.290 
of boiling water and you boil that for
10<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:41.980> has<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.400> be<00:03:42.489> a<00:03:42.520> hard<00:03:42.760> boil<00:03:42.970> for<00:03:43.180> 10

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
10 then it has to be a hard boil for 10

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.699 
10 then it has to be a hard boil for 10
minutes<00:03:43.600> in<00:03:43.690> order<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.930> stand<00:03:44.170> it<00:03:44.320> properly

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
minutes in order to stand it properly

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.010 
minutes in order to stand it properly
sanitize<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.430> jars<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.120> then<00:03:46.720> we're<00:03:46.900> going

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
sanitize the jars and then we're going

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.900 
sanitize the jars and then we're going
to<00:03:47.080> pour<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.350> hot<00:03:47.530> jam<00:03:47.890> into<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.370> hot<00:03:48.550> jars

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
to pour the hot jam into the hot jars

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.729 
to pour the hot jam into the hot jars
and<00:03:49.330> then<00:03:49.810> they'll<00:03:49.989> go<00:03:50.140> into<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.410> water<00:03:50.650> bath

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
and then they'll go into a water bath

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.449 
and then they'll go into a water bath
which<00:03:51.070> we'll<00:03:51.220> see<00:03:51.400> later

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.440 

okay<00:03:54.459> so<00:03:54.520> we've<00:03:54.700> got<00:03:54.730> most<00:03:55.030> of<00:03:55.120> our<00:03:55.209> foam

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
okay so we've got most of our foam

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.150 
okay so we've got most of our foam
scraped<00:03:55.840> off<00:03:56.050> it<00:03:56.320> looks<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:56.620> lot<00:03:56.739> better<00:03:56.890> than

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
scraped off it looks a lot better than

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.560 
scraped off it looks a lot better than
it<00:03:57.250> did<00:03:57.280> before<00:03:57.400> there's<00:03:57.910> a<00:03:58.000> little<00:03:58.239> bit<00:03:58.360> left

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
it did before there's a little bit left

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:59.760 
it did before there's a little bit left
but<00:03:58.630> we<00:03:58.780> can<00:03:58.900> kind<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.080> get<00:03:59.200> around<00:03:59.440> that<00:03:59.650> while

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
but we can kind of get around that while

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.160 
but we can kind of get around that while
we're<00:03:59.890> doing<00:04:00.040> filling<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.940> char's<00:04:01.209> now<00:04:01.540> we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
we're doing filling the char's now we

we're doing filling the char's now we
have<00:04:02.320> to<00:04:02.440> remove<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.980> jars<00:04:03.250> from<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.850> boiling

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
have to remove the jars from the boiling

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.550 
have to remove the jars from the boiling
water<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:04.510> jars<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:04.870> been<00:04:04.989> boiling<00:04:05.200> at

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
water the jars have been boiling at

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.110 
water the jars have been boiling at
least<00:04:05.770> 10<00:04:06.010> minutes<00:04:06.040> now<00:04:06.459> so<00:04:06.640> they're<00:04:06.790> nice<00:04:06.880> and

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
least 10 minutes now so they're nice and

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.309

okay<00:06:51.139> so<00:06:51.199> we've<00:06:51.409> got<00:06:51.440> our<00:06:51.620> jars<00:06:52.460> in<00:06:52.729> the<00:06:52.789> water

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
okay so we've got our jars in the water

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.339 
okay so we've got our jars in the water
and<00:06:53.479> you'll<00:06:53.569> see<00:06:53.720> the<00:06:53.810> little<00:06:53.960> bubbles

00:06:54.339 --> 00:06:54.349 
and you'll see the little bubbles

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:55.749 
and you'll see the little bubbles
releasing<00:06:54.800> from<00:06:54.919> inside<00:06:55.250> that's<00:06:55.460> the<00:06:55.580> air

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 
releasing from inside that's the air

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.330 
releasing from inside that's the air
that's<00:06:56.419> releasing<00:06:56.750> as<00:06:57.020> it<00:06:57.169> heats<00:06:57.380> up<00:06:57.530> and<00:06:57.830> it's

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
that's releasing as it heats up and it's

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.770 
that's releasing as it heats up and it's
going<00:06:58.430> to<00:06:58.490> force<00:06:58.729> its<00:06:58.909> way<00:06:59.030> out<00:06:59.240> of<00:06:59.449> the<00:06:59.539> jars

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780 
going to force its way out of the jars

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.719 
going to force its way out of the jars
and<00:07:00.169> then<00:07:00.319> when<00:07:00.440> they<00:07:00.530> cool<00:07:00.800> it'll<00:07:01.430> suction

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:01.729 
and then when they cool it'll suction

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:03.010 
and then when they cool it'll suction
down<00:07:01.849> so<00:07:02.030> that<00:07:02.120> all<00:07:02.180> of<00:07:02.419> the<00:07:02.479> air<00:07:02.599> will<00:07:02.780> be<00:07:02.870> out

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:03.020 
down so that all of the air will be out

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.839 
down so that all of the air will be out
of<00:07:03.050> it<00:07:03.319> so<00:07:03.919> we've<00:07:04.039> got<00:07:04.190> them<00:07:04.280> in<00:07:04.430> there<00:07:04.610> so<00:07:04.819> now

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
of it so we've got them in there so now

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:06.010 
of it so we've got them in there so now
we're<00:07:05.150> just<00:07:05.180> going<00:07:05.389> to<00:07:05.419> put<00:07:05.599> the<00:07:05.690> lid<00:07:05.840> on<00:07:05.870> and

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
we're just going to put the lid on and

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.129 
we're just going to put the lid on and
let<00:07:06.380> it<00:07:06.560> cook<00:07:06.710> for<00:07:06.889> 10<00:07:07.310> minutes<00:07:08.000> and<00:07:08.599> then<00:07:09.020> when

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
let it cook for 10 minutes and then when
