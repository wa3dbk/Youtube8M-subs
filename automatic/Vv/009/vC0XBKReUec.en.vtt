00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.780
 hunt for you 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.730
 if anything happens the az editor 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.570
 Peter Dieckmann tried his luck in 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 Bad Camberg 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.220
 First of all, the bird's situation is on 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:30.770
 use multiple leaves later 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.790
 death cry of birdies still sound 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.790
 nothing is happening 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.250
 After half an hour, Peter changes 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.680
 the place is now on a seat 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.690
 under a power line around him 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.940
 around crops beats in front of him 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:01:02.570
 chop streaking that smells almost 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:01:05.059
 offspring also here yawning empty 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.979
 or not there for over half 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.260
 peter made a move 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:18.740
 female piece of deer of raubwild 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:20.450
 however, no trace can only be a hare 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.789
 do not resist democracy 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.240
 straight on master lamp comes up 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:25.240
 the seat too 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.260
 At the end of the evening it must be 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.480
 just fold 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.580
 The pulpit overlooking the soon to fall 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.530
 could seem ideal for the predatory 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:46.030
 hunting instruments change this time comes 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.030
 the rabbit suit for use 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.850
 Again, Peter lets the tormenting sounds 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.650
 resound 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.650
 but nothing happens 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.180
 Suddenly there is movement in the thing 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:27.350
 Badgers are leaving the forest and want to 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:29.090
 straight to the grain and there are 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.750
 the black and white already in the oat 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.750
 disappeared 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.480
 Yes 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.640
 due to the dwindling light tree 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.870
 Peter after half an hour from now 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.870
 it's off to the connection 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.400
 Lucky is the little MÃ¼nsterland 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.349
 bitch heidi with the partie 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.160
 the young dog is allowed after the connection 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:11.160
 looking for control 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.300
 prof 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.130
 sweat on the construction driveway leaves nothing 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.900
 to divine good 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.729
 lard you will hopefully not 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.729
 submerged in his dwelling 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.790
 but then the relief has the dog 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.870
 found the dax with a good page shot 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.870
 did not get far
