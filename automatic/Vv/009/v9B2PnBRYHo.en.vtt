add-on for Firefox and Safari which

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
add-on for Firefox and Safari which
might<00:00:39.780> help<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.739> along<00:00:40.829> too<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:41.370> I'm<00:00:41.460> not

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
might help it along too but I'm not

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.459 
might help it along too but I'm not
entirely<00:00:41.820> sure<00:00:41.969> anyway<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.629> would<00:00:43.140> recommend

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
entirely sure anyway I would recommend

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.279 
entirely sure anyway I would recommend
cream<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.219> 60fps<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:46.940> Ubisoft<00:00:47.940> says<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.539> 30

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
cream in 60fps so Ubisoft says that 30

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.889 
cream in 60fps so Ubisoft says that 30
frames<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.070> second<00:00:50.430> feels<00:00:51.270> more<00:00:51.480> cinematic

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
frames a second feels more cinematic

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.380 
frames a second feels more cinematic
than<00:00:52.170> 60<00:00:52.739> frames<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> second<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.730> they<00:00:54.180> even

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
than 60 frames a second and they even

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
than 60 frames a second and they even
claim<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.379> point<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.329> 60<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:58.440> that

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
claim that one point that 60 is not that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.869 
claim that one point that 60 is not that
great<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.129> comes<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.370> quality<00:00:59.579> of

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
great when it comes to quality of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
great when it comes to quality of
picture<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.449> image<00:01:00.829> there's<00:01:01.829> number<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
picture and image there's number of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.219 
picture and image there's number of
reasons<00:01:02.399> why<00:01:02.520> Ubisoft<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.329> definitely<00:01:03.809> wrong

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
reasons why Ubisoft is definitely wrong

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
reasons why Ubisoft is definitely wrong
for<00:01:04.530> one<00:01:04.650> thing<00:01:04.680> 60<00:01:05.309> frames<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> second<00:01:06.000> feels<00:01:06.180> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
for one thing 60 frames a second feels a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.719 
for one thing 60 frames a second feels a
lot<00:01:06.420> better<00:01:06.689> than<00:01:06.900> 35<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> second<00:01:07.770> definitely

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
lot better than 35 a second definitely

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.580 
lot better than 35 a second definitely
does<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.390> less<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.869> lag<00:01:10.110> input<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
does there's less like lag input you

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.010 
does there's less like lag input you
feel<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.790> game<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.090> looks<00:01:12.240> even<00:01:12.900> better

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
feel and the game just looks even better

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.170 
feel and the game just looks even better
with<00:01:13.170> 60<00:01:13.650> frames<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.950> second<00:01:14.250> I'm<00:01:14.369> sorry<00:01:14.610> it's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
with 60 frames a second I'm sorry it's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.240 
with 60 frames a second I'm sorry it's
just<00:01:15.240> really<00:01:15.930> sticks<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.530> me<00:01:16.710> some

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just really sticks out with me some

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.740 
just really sticks out with me some
people<00:01:17.369> say<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.880> looks<00:01:17.909> weird<00:01:18.330> or<00:01:18.600> too

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
people say that it looks weird or too

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.260 
people say that it looks weird or too
smooth<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.340> does<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> get<00:01:20.880> used<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.150> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
smooth but if it does you get used to it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
smooth but if it does you get used to it
really<00:01:21.360> quickly<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.080> can't<00:01:22.320> go<00:01:22.470> back<00:01:22.650> at

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
really quickly and you can't go back at

a<00:01:55.740> difference<00:01:56.189> between<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.670> two<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.030> I

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
a difference between the two so I

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.520 
a difference between the two so I
decided<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:57.750> video<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.200> further

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
decided to make this video to further

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.740 
decided to make this video to further
show<00:01:58.950> off<00:01:59.189> differences<00:02:00.090> between<00:02:00.240> various

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
show off differences between various

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.230 
show off differences between various
