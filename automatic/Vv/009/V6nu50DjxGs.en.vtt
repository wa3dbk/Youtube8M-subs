00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.569 
through and really what we're doing is
just<00:02:56.169> making<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.799> chain<00:02:57.519> one<00:02:57.879> in<00:02:58.150> each<00:02:58.780> loop

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
just making a chain one in each loop

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:02.360 
just making a chain one in each loop
dropping<00:03:00.579> off<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.939> last<00:03:01.150> two<00:03:01.540> loops<00:03:01.750> chain

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
dropping off the last two loops chain

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.080 
dropping off the last two loops chain
one<00:03:03.370> chain<00:03:04.239> one<00:03:04.510> chain<00:03:05.169> one<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.489> this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.790> what

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
one chain one chain one and this is what

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.030 
one chain one chain one and this is what
it<00:03:07.209> looks<00:03:07.389> like<00:03:07.569> on<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.810> back<00:03:08.109> and<00:03:08.530> it's<00:03:08.949> just

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
it looks like on the back and it's just

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.860 
it looks like on the back and it's just
completely<00:03:09.370> closed<00:03:10.239> up

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
completely closed up

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.939 
completely closed up
I<00:03:10.900> made<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:11.949> two<00:03:12.129> sizes<00:03:12.639> longer<00:03:13.379> and<00:03:14.379> I'm<00:03:14.680> using

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
I made it two sizes longer and I'm using

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:18.330 
I made it two sizes longer and I'm using
pony<00:03:15.519> beads<00:03:16.349> this<00:03:17.349> time<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.829> don't<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.099> to

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
pony beads this time you don't have to

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.170 
pony beads this time you don't have to
rotate<00:03:18.819> of<00:03:19.209> pony<00:03:19.480> beads<00:03:20.010> what<00:03:21.010> I'm<00:03:21.159> doing<00:03:21.699> I<00:03:21.939> am

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
rotate of pony beads what I'm doing I am

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.170 
rotate of pony beads what I'm doing I am
attaching<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.930> beads<00:03:23.139> over<00:03:23.889> the<00:03:24.489> tail<00:03:24.819> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
attaching the beads over the tail and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.629 
attaching the beads over the tail and
then<00:03:25.479> pulling<00:03:25.900> them<00:03:26.079> up<00:03:26.229> like<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.949> they<00:03:27.489> go

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 
then pulling them up like this they go

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.530 
then pulling them up like this they go
right<00:03:27.819> over<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.269> cord<00:03:29.909> you<00:03:30.909> can<00:03:30.939> put<00:03:31.299> them<00:03:31.389> as

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
right over the cord you can put them as

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.069 
right over the cord you can put them as
close<00:03:31.840> together<00:03:32.109> or<00:03:32.709> as<00:03:33.400> far<00:03:33.669> apart<00:03:33.900> once<00:03:34.900> you

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
close together or as far apart once you

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.589 
close together or as far apart once you
get<00:03:35.229> it<00:03:35.379> complete<00:03:35.859> and<00:03:36.189> tied<00:03:37.000> together<00:03:37.209> you

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
get it complete and tied together you

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.270 
get it complete and tied together you
can<00:03:37.900> rearrange<00:03:38.169> your<00:03:38.500> placement

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.890 

so<00:03:43.580> they're<00:03:43.790> just<00:03:44.030> slipping<00:03:44.420> on<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:45.220> outside

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.670 

just<00:03:51.900> like<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:54.050> but<00:03:55.050> I'm<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.440> go<00:03:55.590> on

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
just like that but I'm going to go on

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.790 
just like that but I'm going to go on
ahead<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.130> pull<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.460> yarn<00:03:56.670> through<00:03:56.790> I<00:03:57.800> want

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
ahead and pull the yarn through I want

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.470 
ahead and pull the yarn through I want
to<00:03:58.950> cut<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.880> I<00:03:59.910> don't<00:04:00.030> want<00:04:00.390> my<00:04:00.570> strands<00:04:01.050> to

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
to cut it but I don't want my strands to

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.370 
to cut it but I don't want my strands to
unravel<00:04:05.330> so<00:04:06.330> I'm<00:04:06.390> going<00:04:06.600> to<00:04:06.690> pull<00:04:06.960> this<00:04:07.140> on

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
unravel so I'm going to pull this on

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.980 
unravel so I'm going to pull this on
through<00:04:07.740> like<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.370> we<00:04:08.910> can<00:04:09.060> still<00:04:09.360> see<00:04:09.690> our

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
through like that we can still see our

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.650 
through like that we can still see our
three<00:04:10.290> strands<00:04:10.770> right<00:04:11.100> here<00:04:11.580> I'm<00:04:12.150> going<00:04:12.540> to

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
three strands right here I'm going to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.910 
three strands right here I'm going to
thread<00:04:12.960> my<00:04:12.990> needle<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:15.260> I'm<00:04:16.260> going<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.620> match

the loop like that then catch the middle

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
the loop like that then catch the middle
loop<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:41.070> then<00:04:41.280> catch<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.880> last<00:04:42.120> loop<00:04:43.580> I'm
