00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 
going to use granulated sugar here now

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.079 
going to use granulated sugar here now
you<00:00:36.530> could<00:00:36.949> use<00:00:36.980> castor<00:00:37.489> sugar<00:00:37.519> if<00:00:37.820> that's<00:00:37.970> all

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
you could use castor sugar if that's all

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:39.549 
you could use castor sugar if that's all
you've<00:00:38.239> got<00:00:38.269> but<00:00:38.600> I<00:00:38.629> would<00:00:38.839> advise<00:00:39.110> making<00:00:39.530> a

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
you've got but I would advise making a

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.320 
you've got but I would advise making a
special<00:00:39.890> trip<00:00:40.040> to<00:00:40.070> go<00:00:40.250> and<00:00:40.370> buy<00:00:40.489> it<00:00:40.519> granulated

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
special trip to go and buy it granulated

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.390 
special trip to go and buy it granulated
sugar<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:41.900> the<00:00:42.290> stuff<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.160> put

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
sugar is just the stuff that you put

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.290 
sugar is just the stuff that you put
into<00:00:43.519> your<00:00:43.610> tea<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:43.970> coffee

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
into your tea and coffee

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.970 
into your tea and coffee
it's<00:00:44.720> got<00:00:44.870> slightly<00:00:45.230> bigger<00:00:45.410> grains<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.890> it

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
it's got slightly bigger grains and it

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.340 
it's got slightly bigger grains and it
feels<00:00:46.280> grainy<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.480> reason<00:00:47.780> we're<00:00:47.900> using<00:00:47.930> this

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
feels grainy the reason we're using this

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.200 
feels grainy the reason we're using this
is<00:00:48.559> when<00:00:48.739> you<00:00:48.860> bite<00:00:49.129> into<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.640> biscuits<00:00:50.059> you

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
is when you bite into the biscuits you

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.969 
is when you bite into the biscuits you
get<00:00:50.420> sort<00:00:50.629> of<00:00:50.690> a<00:00:50.780> bit<00:00:50.930> more<00:00:51.080> of<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.229> crunch<00:00:51.530> and

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
get sort of a bit more of a crunch and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:54.490 
get sort of a bit more of a crunch and
I'm<00:00:52.400> going<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.699> beat<00:00:53.000> this<00:00:53.299> for<00:00:53.629> about<00:00:53.960> seven

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
I'm going to beat this for about seven

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.660 
I'm going to beat this for about seven
minutes<00:00:54.589> if<00:00:54.920> you're<00:00:55.040> doing<00:00:55.220> it<00:00:55.339> by<00:00:55.400> hands

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
minutes if you're doing it by hands

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.770 
minutes if you're doing it by hands
gonna<00:00:55.879> take<00:00:56.119> a<00:00:56.299> little<00:00:56.479> bit<00:00:56.629> longer

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.630 

while<00:01:03.379> that's<00:01:03.590> beating<00:01:03.829> we'll<00:01:04.280> just<00:01:04.430> get<00:01:04.549> on

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
while that's beating we'll just get on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.490 
while that's beating we'll just get on
with<00:01:04.670> mixing<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.180> dry<00:01:05.360> ingredients<00:01:05.479> I've<00:01:06.140> got

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500

with mixing the dry ingredients I've got
some<00:01:06.860> flour<00:01:07.159> here<00:01:07.460> and<00:01:07.700> I'm<00:01:08.690> going<00:01:08.840> to<00:01:08.900> sieve

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
some flour here and I'm going to sieve

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.890 
some flour here and I'm going to sieve
it<00:01:09.520> just<00:01:10.520> to<00:01:10.729> get<00:01:10.970> some<00:01:11.150> air<00:01:11.299> into<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.659> and<00:01:11.780> make

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
it just to get some air into it and make

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.480 
it just to get some air into it and make
sure<00:01:11.930> there<00:01:12.140> aren't<00:01:12.259> any<00:01:12.320> lumps<00:01:12.619> I've<00:01:13.310> got

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490

some cocoa here and then I've got a look
a<00:01:19.550> bit<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:19.759> baking<00:01:20.090> powder<00:01:20.240> here<00:01:20.680> so<00:01:21.680> into<00:01:22.369> a

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
a bit of baking powder here so into a

a bit of baking powder here so into a
large<00:01:22.670> bowl<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.450> stir<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.530> in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.109 

and<00:01:30.350> then<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.679> give<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:30.950> one<00:01:30.979> last<00:01:31.429> just<00:01:32.000> to

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
and then just give it one last just to

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.899 
and then just give it one last just to
make<00:01:32.270> sure<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.750> all<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.049> cocoa<00:01:33.439> flour<00:01:33.909> is

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
make sure that all the cocoa flour is

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.000 
make sure that all the cocoa flour is
really<00:01:35.539> well<00:01:35.719> mixed

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.410 

okay<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.070> that's<00:01:40.280> cream<00:01:40.670> until<00:01:40.970> it's<00:01:41.090> really

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
okay so that's cream until it's really

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.720 
okay so that's cream until it's really
really<00:01:41.780> light<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.080> creamy<00:01:42.320> looking<00:01:42.680> I've<00:01:43.430> got

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.300 
really light and creamy looking I've got
here<00:01:43.970> some<00:01:44.210> vanilla<00:01:44.480> extract

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
and then you need the yolk of one large

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.240 
and then you need the yolk of one large
egg<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.750> I've<00:01:54.990> eaten<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.590> egg<00:01:55.740> yolk<00:01:55.979> and

dough here the other half back in the
fridge<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:43.250> really<00:02:43.459> important<00:02:43.879> not<00:02:44.000> to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
fridge it's really important not to

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.190 
fridge it's really important not to
leave<00:02:44.239> it<00:02:44.299> out<00:02:44.510> at<00:02:44.659> room<00:02:44.750> temperature<00:02:44.870> because

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
leave it out at room temperature because

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.899 
leave it out at room temperature because
as<00:02:45.349> soon<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.590> you<00:02:45.650> do<00:02:45.799> that<00:02:45.829> it<00:02:46.099> gets<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.459> sticky

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
as soon as you do that it gets so sticky

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.789 
as soon as you do that it gets so sticky
within<00:02:47.180> literally<00:02:47.540> about<00:02:47.780> five<00:02:47.989> minutes<00:02:48.260> and

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
within literally about five minutes and

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.069 
within literally about five minutes and
you're<00:02:48.920> able<00:02:49.040> to<00:02:49.190> roll<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.720> okay<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.780> once

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
you're able to roll it okay so once

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.509 
you're able to roll it okay so once
you've<00:02:51.260> flattened<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.769> out<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.920> bit

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
you've flattened it out a bit

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.449 
you've flattened it out a bit
then<00:02:53.000> you<00:02:53.840> need<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> roll<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> is<00:02:55.159> quite

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
then you need to roll it and it is quite

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:05.199 
then you need to roll it and it is quite
hard<00:02:55.670> to<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:56.060> because<00:02:56.390> it's<00:02:56.720> very<00:02:56.780> chilled

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.630 

when<00:03:06.209> you've<00:03:06.330> gotten<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.140> about<00:03:07.519> half<00:03:08.519> a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
when you've gotten it to about half a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.570 
when you've gotten it to about half a
centimeter<00:03:09.150> say<00:03:09.440> you<00:03:10.440> peel<00:03:10.830> off<00:03:11.129> the<00:03:11.400> top

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
centimeter say you peel off the top

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.830 
centimeter say you peel off the top
layer<00:03:11.760> you'll<00:03:12.000> see<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.360> already<00:03:12.569> starting

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
layer you'll see it's already starting

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.140 
layer you'll see it's already starting
to<00:03:13.170> stick<00:03:13.410> slightly<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.849> such<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
to stick slightly so this is such a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.460 
to stick slightly so this is such a
sticky<00:03:15.629> day<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:15.959> it<00:03:16.019> doesn't<00:03:16.290> mean<00:03:16.349> the

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
sticky day but it doesn't mean the

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.470 
sticky day but it doesn't mean the

buttercream around the edge but remember
this<00:04:05.549> is<00:04:05.670> going<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.910> splodge<00:04:06.329> down<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.660> little
