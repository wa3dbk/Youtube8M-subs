00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.050

 We're listening to you 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.989
 so I chose the frank alliance 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:50.460
 leucate to pigalle the nine 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.300
 kingston the 12 a cars life serves the 5 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.059
 prince philip the perly of clermont the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.500
 8a ticos and three-quarter nat hockey 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 about your factory is a 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.530
 favored 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.049
 the frank alliance 100% success in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.840
 enghien she proved her form this winter 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.549
 on the hippodrome of pau now she 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.620
 remains loaded it does not worry you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.420
 all 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.100
 she is in her garden in enghien she 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.130
 ran three times she stalled 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.780
 as many podiums certainly she is 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.370
 loaded good she did a very good 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.760
 returned to Pau it is third in a 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.890
 quinté in my opinion she will confirm 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.010
 despite the fact that she wears the top 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.510
 weight and that's according to his mentor it's 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.430
 the court is simply 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.770
 so in addition she will be associated with 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.990
 plougasnou I wait for it plougasnou 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.250
 precisely geo cut and we will find 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.900
 fabrice archambault who was at the 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.880
 meeting of jonathan plouganou who we 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.080
 speak of frank alliance this is the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.480
 mii time of our field is the 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 listening 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:55.010
 jonathan mensah lyon tuesday in the ass 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:57.680
 and he's already done step and it's a 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.480
 race that calogero last year and 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.970
 who narrowly defeated his coffee liqueur 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.380
 alright there the third you a 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.170
 very difficult ground 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.020
 beautiful performance the only problem 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.480
 it was the 72 kg we know that in these 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.690
 races there it's always difficult 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:20.030
 precisely the perfume yeah I think 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.950
 that she is pretty much every 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.080
 bare grounds and what they provide for the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.450
 watch 4 did these movements well that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.390
 jump fast is good for his 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.800
 chocolates it's nice we saw it in 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.470
 a lot of enthusiasm for 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.690
 jean matte in great shape no we did it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.060
 understood he expects a good behavior 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.650
 wanted to contrast number 4 to pigalle who 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.599
 rest on a success in the price of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.099
 london to cagnes-sur-mer so a 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.470
 course that looks a lot like the one 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.510
 d'enghien he has already placed himself in this 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.560
 category associated with bertrand lestrade 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.480
 quite logical 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.849
 it's a very good chance 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.569
 despite his penalization of only and 11 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.280
 books so following his victory really 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.590
 casual to switch to an event 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.010
 cannois all their heads 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:06.689
 December 24 his mentor preferred this 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.469
 commitment another so that's the same 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.239
 think it's more continuity and 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.609
 in addition he specifies that it is a true 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.600
 left-handed so we 're really not afraid of 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.190
 Enghien course and 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.780
 for me it's really the opposition 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.310
 director france at allianz we will you 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.800
 trust between positions 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.910
 number 9 kingston of a horse that is 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.500
 not every day but who owns 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.450
 indisputable or nothing he will have for 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.930
 him one thing be a follower of the tracks 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.360
 heavy 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.920
 logically the ground will be heavy on 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.760
 beware Nathalie Desoutter knows in 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.190
 get the quintessence 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.600
 attention but that's it for him everything will be 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.150
 a field question but here we have it 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.540
 seen the track is supposed to be heavy 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.990
 so it's going to benefit him and he's very 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.200
 well at work according to his mentor and he 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.600
 must judge him on his perf of the mi 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.400
 December where he was ahead notably before 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.640
 cerisy gel that do not have the first 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.830
 came 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.510
 these flowers and so I think he can 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.920
 to be revealed in enghien okay we're going 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.990
 will buy it back we will retain it in any 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.990
 case in fourth position number 12 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.480
 a life of coaches is fun this winter 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.310
 to pau she just tweak her form to 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.910
 bordeaux it is rather well placed on 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.010
 the weight scale 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.900
 there again must be wary I think yes 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.360
 she proved her form during the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.510
 meeting Pau and she comes from 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.730
 confirm to the bouscat she will be in her 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.590
 category she is fit and her 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.600
 entourage rely on it there are 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.700
 a lot of entourage and a lot 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.470
 of entourage full trust enough 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.970
 logical is the return to enghien the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.710
 race is beautiful as we want to win 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.840
 it 's called down it should 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.730
 to be tight in any case if all 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.720
 horses do their value it's clear and 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.720
 finally in fifth position 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.840
 see number 5 prince philip 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.560
 it bothers me a little but we go in 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.720
 speak anyway it's a superb by 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.480
 enghien specialists a victory 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.470
 and three accessits in four attempts 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.880
 he just made a small come back to 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.020
 pornichet or at home what not I do 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.910
 will leave weekend it was very 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.890
 friendly the pornichet racecourse the 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.490
 horse isotopes good david cottin him 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.620
 will be associated 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.750
 we did not hurt too that's also 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.240
 logic of the ads yes it comes from 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.360
 refine your condition 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.259
 in a little flat race or that's it 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.490
 he gave it a little bit the 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:18.930
 batteries and he no longer has to do his 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.349
 evidence on the plateau de soisy 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.889
 and then finally he has already won there in 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.530
 more 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.360
 so here he is associated with david cottin 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.569
 I think he can surprise more 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.860
 a 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:34.349
 it's clear here and then I did not put 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.880
 that fifth in my selleck because 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:38.940
 be wary a little bit of the ground 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.409
 he never really ran annie 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.940
 gasnier in the heavy 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.659
 I have more trouble in here so 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.699
 maybe who will not know too much 

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:48.599
 we wait to see a guy do not know what 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.699
 I can surprise 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:52.039
 yes in gala be careful because you 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.270
 can we hold we will play the astonished 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.710
 omura be wary at last me including 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.599
 it's a horse that has some 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.800
 quality now we are not sure of 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.659
 his aptitude for a heavy ground 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.800
 so we'll know a little bit more after 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.690
 race whatever happens to the paper on 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.639
 can not remove never be the 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.900
