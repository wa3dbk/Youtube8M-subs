if you look at the way that the this
chord<00:00:05.259> lock<00:00:05.470> is<00:00:05.770> and<00:00:06.100> you<00:00:06.160> look<00:00:06.189> inside<00:00:06.640> you

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:07.149 
chord lock is and you look inside you

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.390 
chord lock is and you look inside you
can<00:00:07.330> see<00:00:07.600> that<00:00:07.839> there's<00:00:08.080> a<00:00:08.170> brass<00:00:08.559> roller<00:00:09.010> and

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
can see that there's a brass roller and

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.140 
can see that there's a brass roller and
there's<00:00:09.580> also<00:00:09.790> a<00:00:09.969> white<00:00:10.330> plastic<00:00:10.960> roller<00:00:11.259> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
there's also a white plastic roller and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.999 
there's also a white plastic roller and
looking<00:00:13.150> in<00:00:13.269> the<00:00:13.389> top<00:00:13.629> you<00:00:14.379> can<00:00:14.410> see<00:00:14.559> another

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:15.009 
looking in the top you can see another

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.070 
looking in the top you can see another
plastic<00:00:15.400> roller<00:00:15.969> and<00:00:16.299> there's<00:00:16.510> the<00:00:16.750> one<00:00:16.900> we

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
plastic roller and there's the one we

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.519 
plastic roller and there's the one we
just<00:00:17.110> saw<00:00:17.530> from<00:00:17.769> the<00:00:17.949> bottom<00:00:18.930> if<00:00:19.930> I<00:00:20.199> try<00:00:20.500> to

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
just saw from the bottom if I try to

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.189 
just saw from the bottom if I try to
thread<00:00:21.039> this<00:00:21.279> from<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:22.060> bottom<00:00:22.210> up<00:00:22.630> which

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:23.199 
thread this from the bottom up which

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.259 
thread this from the bottom up which
some<00:00:23.529> people<00:00:23.680> do<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.220> you<00:00:24.340> can<00:00:24.640> do<00:00:24.880> it<00:00:24.910> that

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
some people do and you can do it that

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.150 
some people do and you can do it that
way<00:00:25.449> but<00:00:25.510> I<00:00:25.779> find<00:00:26.170> that<00:00:26.289> that's<00:00:26.500> much<00:00:26.859> more

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
way but I find that that's much more

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.990 
way but I find that that's much more
difficult<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:29.230> can<00:00:29.410> see<00:00:29.710> this<00:00:29.980> roller<00:00:30.340> moving

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
difficult you can see this roller moving

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.229 
difficult you can see this roller moving
around<00:00:31.300> inside<00:00:31.689> there<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.610> if<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.850> have<00:00:34.059> the

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
around inside there so if I have the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.049 
around inside there so if I have the
cord<00:00:34.510> lock<00:00:34.690> set<00:00:35.590> like<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:36.190> and<00:00:36.610> I<00:00:36.730> try<00:00:37.030> to

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
cord lock set like this and I try to

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:38.910 
cord lock set like this and I try to
thread<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.629> can't<00:00:38.050> really<00:00:38.200> see<00:00:38.590> where<00:00:38.800> I'm

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
thread I can't really see where I'm

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.430 
thread I can't really see where I'm
going<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.610> I<00:00:40.300> certainly<00:00:40.660> don't<00:00:40.930> want<00:00:41.200> it<00:00:41.320> like

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
going and I certainly don't want it like

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.619 
going and I certainly don't want it like
this<00:00:41.500> because<00:00:42.129> the<00:00:42.250> roller<00:00:42.520> will<00:00:43.000> fall<00:00:43.329> down

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
this because the roller will fall down

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.209 
this because the roller will fall down
in<00:00:43.899> there<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.230> then<00:00:44.289> I<00:00:44.410> won't<00:00:44.680> be<00:00:44.800> able<00:00:44.829> to<00:00:45.070> get

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
in there and then I won't be able to get

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.790 
in there and then I won't be able to get
the<00:00:45.340> cord<00:00:45.640> in<00:00:45.879> so<00:00:46.719> what<00:00:46.930> I<00:00:46.960> like<00:00:47.260> to<00:00:47.440> do<00:00:47.590> is

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
the cord in so what I like to do is

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.670 
the cord in so what I like to do is
leave<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.340> off<00:00:48.579> of<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.000> board<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.629> then<00:00:50.500> go

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
leave it off of the board and then go

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.799 
leave it off of the board and then go
ahead<00:00:50.949> and<00:00:51.129> thread<00:00:53.760> I'm<00:00:54.760> going<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.239> take<00:00:55.510> the

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
ahead and thread I'm going to take the

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.830 
ahead and thread I'm going to take the
cord<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.559> comes<00:00:56.859> from<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> farthest<00:00:58.030> away

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
cord that comes from the farthest away

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.330 
cord that comes from the farthest away
and<00:00:59.230> I'll<00:00:59.949> put<00:01:00.190> it<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.399> the<00:01:00.579> large<00:01:00.850> opening<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
and I'll put it in the large opening and

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.200 
and I'll put it in the large opening and
I'm<00:01:03.760> going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:03.969> pull<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.360> up<00:01:04.480> and<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.700> can<00:01:06.940> see

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
I'm going to pull it up and I can see

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.420 
I'm going to pull it up and I can see
right<00:01:07.240> down<00:01:07.600> inside<00:01:08.140> there<00:01:08.770> now<00:01:08.980> if<00:01:09.100> this<00:01:09.220> was

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
right down inside there now if this was

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.580 
right down inside there now if this was
attached<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.180> board<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.630> would<00:01:10.840> be<00:01:11.020> very

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
attached to the board this would be very

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.000 
attached to the board this would be very
difficult<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:12.280> do<00:01:12.550> so<00:01:13.470> I'll<00:01:14.470> go<00:01:14.650> ahead<00:01:14.770> and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
difficult to do so I'll go ahead and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.880 
difficult to do so I'll go ahead and
poke<00:01:15.250> that<00:01:15.490> down<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.210> I<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.230> see<00:01:17.470> where<00:01:17.740> it's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
poke that down and I can see where it's

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.890 
poke that down and I can see where it's
coming<00:01:18.250> through<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:21.060> if<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.240> want<00:01:22.480> to<00:01:22.540> move<00:01:22.780> it

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
coming through and if I want to move it

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.990 
coming through and if I want to move it
into<00:01:23.080> a<00:01:23.230> different<00:01:23.320> slot<00:01:23.980> I<00:01:24.010> can<00:01:24.430> pull<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:24.700> back

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
into a different slot I can pull it back

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.110 
into a different slot I can pull it back
out<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.300> little<00:01:25.570> bit<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:27.100> can<00:01:27.310> actually<00:01:27.490> see

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.120 
out a little bit and I can actually see

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.450 
out a little bit and I can actually see
the<00:01:28.390> wires<00:01:28.660> through<00:01:29.170> here<00:01:29.530> too<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:33.280> have

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
the wires through here too if you have

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.520 
the wires through here too if you have
trouble<00:01:33.940> threading<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.930> might<00:01:35.170> want<00:01:35.410> to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
trouble threading this you might want to

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.960 
trouble threading this you might want to
melt<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.760> end<00:01:36.910> of<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.210> cord<00:01:37.660> with<00:01:37.900> a<00:01:37.930> lighter

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
melt the end of that cord with a lighter

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.210 
melt the end of that cord with a lighter
you<00:01:39.970> can<00:01:40.120> also<00:01:40.330> use<00:01:40.840> tweezers<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.740> grab<00:01:42.040> it

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
you can also use tweezers to grab it

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.250 
you can also use tweezers to grab it
these<00:01:42.490> are<00:01:42.700> our<00:01:42.850> stainless<00:01:43.240> steel<00:01:43.450> tweezers

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
these are our stainless steel tweezers

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.870 
these are our stainless steel tweezers
and<00:01:44.500> they<00:01:44.650> work<00:01:44.890> quite<00:01:44.920> well<00:01:45.460> for<00:01:45.760> this

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
and they work quite well for this

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.470 
and they work quite well for this
application<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.400> was<00:01:48.520> very<00:01:48.790> easy<00:01:49.120> and<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
application so it was very easy and you

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.780 
application so it was very easy and you
can<00:01:49.660> see<00:01:49.930> how<00:01:50.110> that<00:01:50.170> cord<00:01:50.740> goes<00:01:51.010> down<00:01:51.280> inside

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
can see how that cord goes down inside

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
can see how that cord goes down inside
there<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:54.310> see<00:01:54.550> -<00:01:54.880> as<00:01:55.090> I'm<00:01:55.300> pulling

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
there and you can see - as I'm pulling

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.650 
there and you can see - as I'm pulling
it<00:01:55.990> it's<00:01:56.140> not<00:01:56.350> locking<00:01:56.800> and<00:01:57.660> occasionally

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
it it's not locking and occasionally

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.510 
it it's not locking and occasionally
we'll<00:01:58.840> get<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.020> call<00:01:59.290> and<00:01:59.620> someone<00:01:59.830> will<00:02:00.100> say<00:02:00.130> my

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
we'll get a call and someone will say my

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.700 
we'll get a call and someone will say my
cord<00:02:00.820> lock<00:02:01.030> isn't<00:02:01.270> working<00:02:01.480> well<00:02:02.140> your<00:02:02.320> shade

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
cord lock isn't working well your shade

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.460 
cord lock isn't working well your shade
has<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.460> be<00:02:03.640> installed<00:02:04.360> or<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.990> an<00:02:05.110> upright

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
has to be installed or in an upright

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.339 
has to be installed or in an upright
position<00:02:05.760> you<00:02:06.760> must<00:02:07.030> also<00:02:07.270> have<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.690> weight<00:02:07.990> bar

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
position you must also have a weight bar

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.469 
position you must also have a weight bar
in<00:02:08.590> your<00:02:08.619> shade<00:02:09.039> in<00:02:09.250> order<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.729> have<00:02:09.910> this<00:02:10.119> lock

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
in your shade in order to have this lock

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.840 
in your shade in order to have this lock
so<00:02:11.170> even<00:02:11.470> if<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.710> have<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.100> up<00:02:12.220> like<00:02:12.430> this<00:02:12.670> you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
so even if I have it up like this you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.360 
so even if I have it up like this you
can<00:02:13.030> see<00:02:13.270> that<00:02:13.300> it's<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:14.290> moving<00:02:14.980> and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
can see that it's it's moving and

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.970 
can see that it's it's moving and
because<00:02:15.819> there's<00:02:16.000> no<00:02:16.269> weight<00:02:17.260> holding<00:02:17.830> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
because there's no weight holding it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.490 
because there's no weight holding it
back<00:02:18.190> there<00:02:18.519> isn't<00:02:18.790> any<00:02:18.909> resistance<00:02:19.629> so<00:02:20.290> again

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
back there isn't any resistance so again

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.820 
back there isn't any resistance so again
I'm<00:02:20.650> coming<00:02:20.920> through<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.640> large<00:02:21.879> opening<00:02:22.450> up

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
I'm coming through this large opening up

opening<00:04:10.850> you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.060> move<00:04:12.300> those<00:04:12.570> out<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.870> the

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
opening you can move those out of the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:26.220 
opening you can move those out of the
way<00:04:16.070> you<00:04:17.070> can<00:04:17.220> see<00:04:17.400> how<00:04:17.610> easy<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.239> slides<00:04:18.660> in

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.400 

there<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.070> is<00:04:30.300> so<00:04:31.300> I've<00:04:31.450> got<00:04:31.630> my<00:04:31.810> cord<00:04:32.170> lock

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
there it is so I've got my cord lock

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.700 
there it is so I've got my cord lock
threaded<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:34.090> now<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.480> can<00:04:34.840> go<00:04:34.990> ahead<00:04:35.020> and<00:04:35.560> get

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
threaded and now I can go ahead and get

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.210 
threaded and now I can go ahead and get
it<00:04:35.830> installed<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.730> board<00:04:37.620> much<00:04:38.620> easier

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
it installed on the board much easier

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.520 
it installed on the board much easier
than<00:04:39.520> if<00:04:39.670> I<00:04:39.850> were<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.180> try<00:04:40.330> to<00:04:40.420> do<00:04:40.690> that<00:04:40.930> already

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
than if I were to try to do that already

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:50.810 
than if I were to try to do that already
installed<00:04:42.460> on<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.760> board

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.240 

lay<00:04:51.480> it<00:04:51.660> out<00:04:51.780> make<00:04:52.230> sure<00:04:52.470> it's<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.860> way<00:04:52.980> that<00:04:53.190> I

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
lay it out make sure it's the way that I

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.240 
lay it out make sure it's the way that I
want<00:04:53.610> it<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.830> then<00:04:55.830> we'll<00:04:55.950> go<00:04:56.070> ahead<00:04:56.160> and

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
want it and then we'll go ahead and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.430 
want it and then we'll go ahead and
we'll<00:04:56.400> screw<00:04:56.700> it<00:04:56.820> down<00:04:57.050> you<00:04:58.050> want<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.290> make

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
we'll screw it down you want to make

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.260 
we'll screw it down you want to make
sure<00:04:58.470> when<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:59.010> do<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.430> too<00:04:59.730> that<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.030> pull

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
sure when you do this too that you pull

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.130 
sure when you do this too that you pull
the<00:05:00.420> cords<00:05:00.840> out<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.230> way<00:05:02.390> I'll<00:05:03.390> line<00:05:03.750> up<00:05:03.780> my

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
the cords out of the way I'll line up my

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:23.990 
the cords out of the way I'll line up my
marks

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.030 

and<00:05:25.000> there<00:05:25.210> you<00:05:25.330> go<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.780> want<00:05:26.380> to<00:05:26.470> point<00:05:26.620> out<00:05:26.800> too

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
and there you go I want to point out too

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.210 
and there you go I want to point out too
that<00:05:27.070> this<00:05:27.430> is<00:05:27.490> our<00:05:27.790> magnetic<00:05:28.390> bit<00:05:28.980> the<00:05:29.980> hex

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
that this is our magnetic bit the hex

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.810 
that this is our magnetic bit the hex
head<00:05:30.460> bit<00:05:30.730> that<00:05:31.150> works<00:05:31.620> really<00:05:32.620> well<00:05:32.820> holds

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
head bit that works really well holds

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.000 
head bit that works really well holds
that<00:05:33.970> screw<00:05:34.360> in<00:05:34.540> there<00:05:34.780> you<00:05:35.290> can<00:05:35.470> see<00:05:35.500> each

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
that screw in there you can see each

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.490 
that screw in there you can see each
cord<00:05:36.460> comes<00:05:36.850> through<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.180> separate<00:05:37.630> slot<00:05:37.990> here

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
cord comes through a separate slot here

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.220 
cord comes through a separate slot here
and<00:05:38.700> one<00:05:39.700> very<00:05:40.120> important<00:05:40.690> thing<00:05:40.840> I<00:05:40.960> want<00:05:40.990> to

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
and one very important thing I want to

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.500 
and one very important thing I want to
point<00:05:41.470> out<00:05:41.650> too<00:05:42.010> when<00:05:42.820> you<00:05:43.030> have<00:05:43.060> multiple

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
point out too when you have multiple

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.780 
point out too when you have multiple
cords<00:05:44.350> you<00:05:44.530> want<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.800> make<00:05:44.950> sure<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.580> they

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
cords you want to make sure that they

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.300 
cords you want to make sure that they
aren't<00:05:45.970> bunching<00:05:46.540> up<00:05:46.720> here<00:05:47.260> this<00:05:47.920> shade<00:05:48.160> is

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
aren't bunching up here this shade is

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.370 
aren't bunching up here this shade is
small<00:05:48.640> so<00:05:48.970> it's<00:05:49.150> not<00:05:49.330> an<00:05:49.540> issue<00:05:49.660> but<00:05:50.080> if<00:05:50.200> you

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
small so it's not an issue but if you

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.890 
small so it's not an issue but if you
had<00:05:50.650> several<00:05:51.460> cords<00:05:52.090> coming<00:05:52.390> through<00:05:52.720> this

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
had several cords coming through this

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.900 
had several cords coming through this
hole<00:05:53.230> you<00:05:53.590> want<00:05:53.770> to<00:05:53.890> make<00:05:54.010> sure<00:05:54.040> that<00:05:54.580> each

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
hole you want to make sure that each

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.210 
hole you want to make sure that each
cord<00:05:55.330> comes<00:05:55.660> through<00:05:55.990> nice<00:05:56.260> and<00:05:56.560> smooth<00:05:56.860> and

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
cord comes through nice and smooth and

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.700 
cord comes through nice and smooth and
before<00:05:58.150> I<00:05:58.180> go<00:05:58.450> any<00:05:58.480> further<00:05:58.900> I<00:05:59.080> want<00:05:59.410> to<00:05:59.530> pick

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
before I go any further I want to pick

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.420 
before I go any further I want to pick
my<00:05:59.920> shade<00:06:00.220> up<00:06:00.490> and<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:02.440> just<00:06:02.650> want<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:02.920> test<00:06:03.220> it

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
my shade up and I just want to test it

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.730 
my shade up and I just want to test it
out<00:06:03.580> and<00:06:03.970> again<00:06:04.840> I<00:06:04.870> want<00:06:05.140> to<00:06:05.200> point<00:06:05.380> out<00:06:05.530> that

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
out and again I want to point out that

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:07.710 
out and again I want to point out that
we've<00:06:05.920> got<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.280> orbs<00:06:06.700> on<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.060> bottom<00:06:07.480> and

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
we've got the orbs on the bottom and

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.170 
we've got the orbs on the bottom and
what's<00:06:07.870> great<00:06:08.050> about<00:06:08.170> these<00:06:08.830> is<00:06:09.130> that<00:06:09.580> after

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:10.180 
what's great about these is that after

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.450 
what's great about these is that after
you<00:06:10.300> get<00:06:10.510> your<00:06:10.660> cord<00:06:11.260> lock<00:06:11.530> in<00:06:11.860> and<00:06:12.160> you<00:06:12.190> get

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
you get your cord lock in and you get

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.610 
you get your cord lock in and you get
this<00:06:12.640> knotted<00:06:13.240> if<00:06:13.420> you<00:06:13.870> need<00:06:14.080> to<00:06:14.260> make<00:06:14.470> an

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
this knotted if you need to make an

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.590 
this knotted if you need to make an
adjustment<00:06:14.740> and<00:06:15.310> make<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.820> cord<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.330> little

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:16.600 
adjustment and make the cord a little

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.630 
adjustment and make the cord a little
longer<00:06:16.840> or<00:06:17.140> a<00:06:17.170> little<00:06:17.440> shorter<00:06:17.830> you<00:06:17.860> can<00:06:18.010> do<00:06:18.400> so

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
longer or a little shorter you can do so

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.050 
longer or a little shorter you can do so
with<00:06:19.150> the<00:06:19.330> orbs<00:06:19.780> very<00:06:20.080> easily<00:06:20.610> so<00:06:21.610> as<00:06:21.730> you<00:06:21.850> can

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
with the orbs very easily so as you can

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.660 
with the orbs very easily so as you can
see<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.690> cord<00:06:22.990> lock<00:06:23.140> operates<00:06:23.800> very<00:06:24.160> smoothly

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
see the cord lock operates very smoothly

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:29.070 
see the cord lock operates very smoothly
and<00:06:25.680> now<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.740> last<00:06:27.130> step<00:06:27.550> is<00:06:27.850> to<00:06:27.880> trim<00:06:28.840> my

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
and now the last step is to trim my

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.980 
and now the last step is to trim my
cords<00:06:29.560> so<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:29.920> they're<00:06:30.160> even<00:06:30.580> and<00:06:30.820> I<00:06:31.720> have<00:06:31.960> a

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
cords so that they're even and I have a

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.530 
cords so that they're even and I have a
lot<00:06:32.200> of<00:06:32.230> choices<00:06:32.830> as<00:06:33.040> far<00:06:33.310> as<00:06:33.490> using<00:06:33.760> a<00:06:34.150> cord

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
lot of choices as far as using a cord

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.590 
lot of choices as far as using a cord
condenser<00:06:34.750> or<00:06:35.470> a<00:06:35.950> different<00:06:36.370> type<00:06:36.610> of<00:06:36.640> cord

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
condenser or a different type of cord

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.220 
condenser or a different type of cord
tassel<00:06:38.200> and<00:06:38.580> we'll<00:06:39.580> go<00:06:39.730> ahead<00:06:39.820> and<00:06:40.030> we'll<00:06:40.390> lay

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:41.230 
tassel and we'll go ahead and we'll lay

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.030 
tassel and we'll go ahead and we'll lay
the<00:06:41.260> shade<00:06:41.680> back<00:06:42.010> down<00:06:42.340> and<00:06:43.590> I'm<00:06:44.590> going<00:06:44.770> to<00:06:44.800> cut

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:45.040 
the shade back down and I'm going to cut

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:51.950 
the shade back down and I'm going to cut

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.870 

I'll<00:06:52.960> cut<00:06:53.290> them<00:06:53.500> off<00:06:53.680> and<00:06:54.010> even<00:06:54.580> if<00:06:54.730> they're

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
I'll cut them off and even if they're

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:57.870 
I'll cut them off and even if they're
not<00:06:55.060> perfect<00:06:55.660> that's<00:06:55.990> fine<00:06:56.350> after<00:06:57.280> I<00:06:57.310> finish

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
not perfect that's fine after I finish

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.010 
not perfect that's fine after I finish
up<00:06:58.120> with<00:06:58.330> the<00:06:58.540> shade<00:06:58.870> when<00:06:59.200> we<00:06:59.320> get<00:06:59.530> the<00:06:59.710> the

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
up with the shade when we get the the

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.290 
up with the shade when we get the the
court<00:07:02.020> condenser<00:07:02.620> on<00:07:02.800> here<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.400> the<00:07:03.580> the<00:07:03.610> pull

then I can adjust the cords with the
orbs<00:07:07.870> and<00:07:08.050> that's<00:07:08.800> a<00:07:09.010> look<00:07:09.250> at<00:07:09.430> our<00:07:09.610> cord<00:07:10.000> locks
