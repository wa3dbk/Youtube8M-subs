00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
it likely as required but it dries out

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.380 
it likely as required but it dries out
the<00:02:04.049> loss<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.469> gets<00:02:04.829> quite<00:02:05.189> dry<00:02:05.490> in<00:02:06.119> the

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the loss actually gets quite dry in the

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
the loss actually gets quite dry in the
window<00:02:06.719> when<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> Sun<00:02:07.259> comes<00:02:07.469> out<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> I'll

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
whenever I think this has gone really

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.210 
whenever I think this has gone really
then<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.390> water<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:14.470> course<00:02:14.830> the<00:02:14.920> drains

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
then I water it of course the drains

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.010 
then I water it of course the drains
right<00:02:15.460> out<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.360> put<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:16.750> in<00:02:16.930> the

sort of planted the roots and last needs
and<00:03:36.130> I<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:36.400> water<00:03:36.610> them<00:03:36.880> as<00:03:37.030> required<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and I just water them as required a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.800 
and I just water them as required a
little<00:03:38.440> bit<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.950> moss<00:03:39.160> on<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.520> top<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:40.000> to

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
little bit of moss on the top just to

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.390 
little bit of moss on the top just to
keep<00:03:40.990> the<00:03:41.230> little<00:03:41.530> bit<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.709> moisture<00:03:41.830> on<00:03:42.160> the

keep the little bit of moisture on the

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.790 
keep the little bit of moisture on the
stock<00:03:42.670> I<00:03:42.940> don't<00:03:43.750> know<00:03:43.900> how<00:03:44.050> this<00:03:44.230> will<00:03:44.440> do<00:03:44.590> in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
stock I don't know how this will do in

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.460 
stock I don't know how this will do in
the<00:03:44.950> end<00:03:44.980> but<00:03:45.640> it's<00:03:46.510> an<00:03:46.630> experiment

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
the end but it's an experiment

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.980 
the end but it's an experiment
anyway<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.730> focus<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.240> today<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
anyway the focus for today is the

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.370 
anyway the focus for today is the
fragrant<00:03:50.410> orchid<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.750> I<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:53.080> wanted<00:03:53.290> to

share this with you
I<00:03:54.340> think<00:03:55.000> the<00:03:55.090> blossoms<00:03:55.540> will<00:03:55.690> fall<00:03:55.930> away<00:03:56.080> soon

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
I think the blossoms will fall away soon

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.850 
I think the blossoms will fall away soon
and<00:03:57.250> it's<00:03:58.240> been<00:03:58.420> three<00:03:58.690> months<00:03:58.840> and<00:03:59.170> once<00:03:59.709> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
happens naturally without cutting off

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.800 
happens naturally without cutting off
the<00:04:04.900> spike<00:04:05.170> and<00:04:05.880> maybe<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.270> plant<00:04:07.510> rest

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
the spike and maybe that the plant rest

the spike and maybe that the plant rest
for<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> while<00:04:09.150> and<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:10.959> what<00:04:11.140> happens<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.739> do

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
for a while and see what happens I do

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.699 
for a while and see what happens I do
