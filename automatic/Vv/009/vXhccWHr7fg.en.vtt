00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.529
 And there, folks, all jewelry, I'm complying 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.130
 the deal is a video of today I'm going 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.750
 show that my setup for you is the 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.720
 system that I'm using here to 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.080
 his practicality and soon I will be 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.140
 recording a video with my new setup 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.670
 with the new system there a system 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 much more practical a much more 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.790
 functional so I wanted you guys 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.890
 knowledge and systems because I think it's 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.219
 a question a lot of people how I 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.469
 I make a practical system with pedals, right? 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.500
 ready to stay with the 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.250
 tap dance and everything else then here what 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.340
 I'm using I'm using a 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.969
 Smell the fr the custom and sexual fr the show 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.539
 ball 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.299
 just use it small and practical here I am 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.670
 using a 50g zoom 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.280
 it has three functions here in my set a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 first one is tuner when I need and 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.070
 the nóis gate that is always activated and 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.340
 also compressor i leave it here 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.420
 to activate when necessary 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.420
 zoom ms 50g it passes through the boss 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 I think the key of mine that I divide my 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.650
 sound on two channels né between the channel 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.950
 clean and the drive channel on the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.500
 drive I'm using nig's s1 and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.840
 axis analogue of the axis 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.840
 so here is the sound I have this 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.969
 i 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.500
 i on channel b 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.520
 I have klink I'm using here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.430
 samp pretending to offend more 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 boss superstrings 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.900
 besides the ecoparque that is the delay 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.990
 dalaiensis then I have this one here 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.990
 on channel b in iu 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.600
 i and ii 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.900
 i 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.450
 and then with a step I can change the 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.450
 channel here 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.720
 on channel b I also have talk box 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.990
 that I use here in the channel also the 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:25.680
 which baobab on the stage is missing 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.989
 the other possibility that until then there 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.209
 I have the channel switch a &amp; e is the 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:36.300
 drive and channel b as talk box after 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.120
 of a signal back to the la in selector 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:44.190
 and it comes out to my reverb which is the deviation 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.870
 of verba digitech depending on the place 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.380
 that I will touch if the sun is too 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:58.739
 Dry I put it to give an ambience 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:04:00.480
 and that in the case here I think it's a 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:17.400
 I'm going to take a little 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:21.419
 just a little bit to smell 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.520
 coorpin and finally the loop station of the 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.400
 boss that I use for example in 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.140
 soundtrack that I do not want to see 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.160
 this sound amplifier how is the 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.880
 sound of the pea I fired the yew ups and 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.880
 I'll listen there 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.280
 the best 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.280
 ae 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:07.510
 so while the sound is going on 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.540
 Snow is playing alone I got there. 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.190
 in front of you, listen, how are you? 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.460
 leaving the guitar sound and 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.290
 equalize right beauty so that's how it is 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.280
 practically that 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:25.720
 before it is suitable for all channels 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.720
 here right uaw to and far ms I'm 50g 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.810
 using before the lines elektro then the al 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.830
 and it will work for both a channel 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.710
 as to the other 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.140
 the reverb and on the playstation also it 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:42.460
 is passing after the elektro lanús 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.990
 then it's the reverb in case it would 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.210
 direct connected 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.840
 I fought that I can record both 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:53.380
 each as channel 2 and channel a and 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:56.470
 I have my drive system and the 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.090
 channel bo clean system and the talk box 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.620
 I hope you liked it. 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:06.610
 explanation of the goods system 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:10.330
 so cool and soon I show that the 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:14.770
 fr controller is the one against hull 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:18.550
 city ​​that can be connected up to seven 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:21.040
 strings of each of different pedals is 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.110
 What am I going to use today? 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.760
 now I will disassemble and assemble here 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.350
 there in my other pedagogy 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:29.220
 I hope you have enjoyed staying with 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.220
 God and see you next time.
