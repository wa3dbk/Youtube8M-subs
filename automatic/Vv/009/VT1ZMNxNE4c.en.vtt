00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.000 
thinking worked better by at least
episode<00:06:28.440> 5<00:06:28.650> as<00:06:28.950> well<00:06:29.190> as<00:06:29.370> the<00:06:29.490> lag<00:06:29.690> so<00:06:31.010> yeah

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
episode 5 as well as the lag so yeah

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.950 
episode 5 as well as the lag so yeah
look<00:06:32.729> for<00:06:32.940> this<00:06:33.030> up<00:06:33.210> to<00:06:33.419> hopefully<00:06:33.570> improve<00:06:34.290> I

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 
look for this up to hopefully improve I

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.180 
look for this up to hopefully improve I
don't<00:06:36.960> want<00:06:37.110> way<00:06:37.200> to<00:06:37.260> improve<00:06:37.560> that<00:06:37.740> hold<00:06:37.979> on<00:06:38.160> I

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:38.190 
don't want way to improve that hold on I

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:39.469 
don't want way to improve that hold on I
didn't<00:06:38.580> want<00:06:38.700> to<00:06:38.729> do<00:06:38.910> this<00:06:39.120> just<00:06:39.360> because

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
didn't want to do this just because

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:41.030 
didn't want to do this just because
there's<00:06:39.780> not<00:06:39.870> many<00:06:40.140> people<00:06:40.440> here<00:06:40.770> and<00:06:40.890> then

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040 
there's not many people here and then

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.360 
there's not many people here and then
you<00:06:41.160> can't<00:06:41.370> see<00:06:41.580> so<00:06:41.820> many<00:06:41.910> stupid<00:06:42.240> people<00:06:43.370> but

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
you can't see so many stupid people but

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.219 
you can't see so many stupid people but
until<00:06:45.060> I<00:06:45.419> actually<00:06:45.690> trait<00:06:46.380> change<00:06:46.860> over<00:06:48.229> until

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
until I actually trait change over until

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.110 
until I actually trait change over until
I<00:06:49.289> actually<00:06:49.530> close<00:06:50.010> out<00:06:50.190> of<00:06:50.280> msn<00:06:50.669> this<00:06:50.880> will<00:06:51.030> be
