00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.470 

all<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.680> now<00:03:52.890> you<00:03:53.580> could<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.120> take<00:03:54.330> all

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
all right now you could just take all

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.470 
all right now you could just take all
those<00:03:54.600> things<00:03:54.870> in<00:03:55.049> hand<00:03:55.260> mix<00:03:55.560> them<00:03:55.830> but<00:03:56.480> they

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
those things in hand mix them but they

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.770 
those things in hand mix them but they
they<00:03:57.989> separate<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.680> oil<00:03:58.709> will<00:03:59.190> well<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
they separate the oil will well and the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.229 
they separate the oil will well and the
vinegar<00:04:01.170> will<00:04:01.350> separate<00:04:01.830> so<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.430> add<00:04:02.910> like<00:04:03.180> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
vinegar will separate so I add like a

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.259 
vinegar will separate so I add like a
teaspoon<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.959> salt<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.769> then<00:04:05.489> blend<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.090> and

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
teaspoon of salt and then blend it and

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.210 
teaspoon of salt and then blend it and
what<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.390> does<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:07.080> homogenized<00:04:07.769> is<00:04:07.980> this

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
what that does is it homogenized is this
