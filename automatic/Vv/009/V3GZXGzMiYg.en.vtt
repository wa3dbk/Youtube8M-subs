 I want you to see how to hold 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.119
 five cases of gold on mars 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.039
 are the last gold cases of the game 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.020
 so to put all five 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 crates can be recovered during 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.739
 free roaming the first by going to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.250
 right out of the oven you'll find it 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:39.120
 inside the first building you will find e 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:41.640

 within which you will find a lot of 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.739
 cash is a bit difficult to reach 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.840
 in fact a little confused about the place 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.220
 where he really was not in the final 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.409
 proven you will have to follow up on these 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:13.200
