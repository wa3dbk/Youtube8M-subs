 director of the company gem france for 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.910
 the exact company and I will talk to you 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.719
 today cleaning your 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.059
 sewing machine 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.369
 there are two types of operation 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.770
 on a sewing machine in the first place 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.500
 here a machine with a rotary hook 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 flat so a flat can and also 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.210
 other machines with a housing 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 cans 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.380
 we will talk about the machine with 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.880
 flat rotary hook for cleaning 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.239
 of a machine of this type you have 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.489
 need a small cleaning brush 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.950
 and a screwdriver possibly from a 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.170
 bomb of compressed air that we find 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.540
 for cleaning screens 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 of computers possibly if you 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.620
 have the vacuum cleaner next too why 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.719
 no first step you have to unscrew 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 the needle plate with the small 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:01:02.730
 screwdriver then provides you take out the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 bobbin and you remove the plate 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.140
 needle so you have to removed the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 capsule of the machine that is withdrawing 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.900
 easily see them you go 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.299
 can clean here with your little one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 brush all the fluff especially done 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.770
 by the fabric day fabric bike or other 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.750
 it is an essential cleaning after 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.880
 have cleaned your capsule you are passing 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.860
 at the replacement of this capsule and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.540
 the needle plate is played 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.280
 the advantage of this type of machine is 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.170
 that there is no greasing the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 Cleaning is almost every case 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.140
 Eight hours or 10 hours 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.090
 how to use your machine 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
 but of course it also depends on the type 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.439
 of fabric that you could use then 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.820
 velvet fabrics the fabric sponges 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.460
 tissues more at home in general 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 requires cleaning more often more 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.950
 fast now you know clean 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.840
 your machine 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 no reason why it is fouled
