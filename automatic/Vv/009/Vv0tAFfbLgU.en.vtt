that<00:01:41.390> I<00:01:41.479> liked<00:01:41.659> this<00:01:42.350> would<00:01:42.530> be<00:01:42.619> a<00:01:42.649> great

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
that I liked this would be a great

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.800 
that I liked this would be a great
racket<00:01:43.189> for<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.579> player<00:01:43.820> that<00:01:44.030> hits<00:01:44.179> purely<00:01:44.600> for

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
racket for a player that hits purely for

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.450 
racket for a player that hits purely for
depth

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460

Unser's<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.700> like<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.030> added<00:01:47.270> power<00:01:47.450> from<00:01:47.780> this

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
Unser's I like the added power from this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.029 
Unser's I like the added power from this
racket<00:01:48.259> but<00:01:48.439> it<00:01:48.530> does<00:01:48.649> not<00:01:48.770> match<00:01:49.009> the

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
racket but it does not match the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.010 
racket but it does not match the
versatility<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:49.939> my<00:01:50.179> racket<00:01:50.359> when<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.780> comes

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
versatility of my racket when it comes

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.069 
versatility of my racket when it comes
to<00:01:51.229> combining<00:01:51.409> spin<00:01:52.039> and<00:01:52.219> power<00:01:52.929> that's<00:01:53.929> what

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
to combining spin and power that's what

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.480 
to combining spin and power that's what
I<00:01:54.140> thought<00:01:54.350> about<00:01:54.500> this<00:01:54.710> new<00:01:54.890> racket

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
I thought about this new racket

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
court I felt this racket was a little

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.060 
court I felt this racket was a little
more<00:02:02.390> flexible<00:02:02.899> than<00:02:03.049> the<00:02:03.109> pure<00:02:03.350> storm<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
more flexible than the pure storm I

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.069 
more flexible than the pure storm I
still<00:02:04.670> love<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> feel<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.450> frame<00:02:05.689> on<00:02:05.960> all

of<00:02:06.200> my<00:02:06.350> shots<00:02:06.679> it<00:02:07.609> will<00:02:07.880> create<00:02:08.210> more<00:02:08.360> power

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
of my shots it will create more power

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.749 
of my shots it will create more power
but<00:02:09.379> then<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.739> will<00:02:09.890> sacrifice

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
but then you will sacrifice

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.110

the ball sits right in the middle of the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.119 
the ball sits right in the middle of the
strings<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.480> these<00:02:17.989> was<00:02:18.200> such<00:02:18.439> a<00:02:18.470> solid<00:02:18.950> feel

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129

the volleys overheads and serves it felt
the<00:02:22.159> same<00:02:22.450> remember<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.989> little<00:02:24.230> heavier

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the same remember it's a little heavier
