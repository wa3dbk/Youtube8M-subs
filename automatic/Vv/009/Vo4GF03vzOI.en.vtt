longer<00:03:20.360> usable<00:03:20.750> because<00:03:21.740> basically<00:03:22.070> we<00:03:22.700> went

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
longer usable because basically we went

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.150 
longer usable because basically we went

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
idea of bringing my iPod along with me

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.240 
idea of bringing my iPod along with me
because<00:03:27.170> I<00:03:27.230> didn't<00:03:27.410> think<00:03:27.440> I'd<00:03:27.650> get<00:03:27.770> that<00:03:27.980> wet

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
because I didn't think I'd get that wet

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.970 
because I didn't think I'd get that wet
but<00:03:29.120> we<00:03:29.270> had<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> like<00:03:29.720> carry<00:03:30.380> along<00:03:30.770> this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
but we had a like carry along this

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.680 
but we had a like carry along this
little<00:03:31.310> blow-up<00:03:31.640> boat<00:03:32.060> because<00:03:32.450> there<00:03:32.600> was

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.180 
card and all that thankfully the only
things<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.020> had<00:05:00.230> in<00:05:00.260> my<00:05:00.500> wallet<00:05:00.710> at<00:05:00.860> the<00:05:00.890> time

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
things I had in my wallet at the time

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.780 
things I had in my wallet at the time
were<00:05:01.370> like<00:05:01.580> five<00:05:02.060> bucks<00:05:02.920> my<00:05:03.920> credit<00:05:04.340> card<00:05:04.520> and

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
were like five bucks my credit card and

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.250 
were like five bucks my credit card and
then<00:05:04.940> I<00:05:05.000> don't<00:05:05.150> have<00:05:05.240> an<00:05:05.330> ID<00:05:05.450> or<00:05:05.750> anything<00:05:05.930> so<00:05:06.230> I

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
then I don't have an ID or anything so I

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.630 
then I don't have an ID or anything so I
basically<00:05:06.650> had<00:05:06.800> nothing<00:05:07.040> in<00:05:07.310> there<00:05:07.460> pretty

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:07.640 
basically had nothing in there pretty

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.970 
basically had nothing in there pretty
much<00:05:07.730> and<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.170> basically<00:05:09.440> I<00:05:09.560> get<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.710> new<00:05:09.830> credit

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
much and so basically I get a new credit

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.920 
much and so basically I get a new credit
card<00:05:10.160> go<00:05:10.580> through<00:05:10.790> that<00:05:10.910> little<00:05:11.150> hassle<00:05:11.660> and

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
