00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.790
 This Hello Fadi 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.790
 It is a quiz but it is a quiz 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.340
 From my standing position now 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.030
 22 whether there will be how much distance to the edge of the map 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.030
 Do you understand 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:36.990
 The can be seen from the map Well 1 terrain and buildings of the enemy, which is located spot of ally 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:41.980
 I think that there is such Maa various understood that installed object 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:44.110
 I do not know that it is at the height of a certain degree The second floor of the building 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.390
 Well beer Toka rooftop 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.390
 I do not know where it is at height 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.050
 Even though I know the case of a 1 M 2 ps 4 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:04.270
 Long turn on option turn 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.270
 You can see the human body like this and the scoreboard after uploading 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.360
 In this manner also it says to 100m away now 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.260
 3 In the map 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:25.660
 It does not appear 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.660
 It means that the enemy of the distance of 200 meters is not reflected 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.310
 You can only see enemies nearby 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.310
 Then it is correct 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.130
 In line with the enemy who is now 80 people away 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.130
 I will go back behind 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.260
 If you look at it while comparing with the right map 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:59.650
 100 meters ahead 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.650
 Well it is about say that I wonder if what looks or 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.290
 Let's go down a little 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.710
 If you hesitate 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.610
 I wonder if cattle 5 meters 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.610
 About but completely invisible 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.740
 I can not see it anymore 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.790
 So that a 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.860
 The correct answer is about 100 meters 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 Well what is reflected in the mini map 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.230
