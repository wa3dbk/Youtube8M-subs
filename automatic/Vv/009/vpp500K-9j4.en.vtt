00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 good guys from media had video from 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.560
 gt5 online here we are back in a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.700
 race and do not ask why it came out 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.799
 looking for in subscribers now what 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.090
 I understand we are back in a 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.090
 kind of tornado 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.060
 there were 99 9% of thousands dead 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 be subscribed in the head 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.890
 shit on me all good there's here a 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 kind of tornado as I say and the truth 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 that seems easy but it gives me the feeling 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.550
 that is not so easy and this is not why 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.219
 it's so easy since the answer as 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:39.420
 half plus cost enrolled is 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 trembling right now is closer to you 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.489
 you are putting vision only you know that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.230
 it seems that you are a subscriber of the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.260
 Pressure pressure is inside your 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260
 head 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.770
 on the bikes 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.500
 he did not have guys who had him or not 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:13.549
 they had clear it happens to me through karma 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.549
 I say I tried to press 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.220
 depression is subscriber uncle is that of 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.220
 true 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.910
 It has already reached or not 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.660
 but what are you doing why? why 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.660
 I'm alone in the race 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.260
 that is, it puts me in the race but it is 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.140
 minimum for there are two people 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.140
 please protest please to gifts 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:05.770
 of the mother career only 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.320
 only need to be sought the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.320
 vehicles and start giving forwards 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.200
 this is hard guys and if they want it 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.640
 make faster harder still 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.930
 then it is like an infinite loop 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.550
 because you want to do it fast because it goes 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.300
 last but suddenly gets almost 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.440
 then as to the head to know 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.440
 what is the career 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.080
 I see empty because'll throw me in 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.640
 where I do not know what they are doing but 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.680
 it's not like that what they're trying 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.930
 you can catch the point something so I'm going 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.840
 to keep trying to upload worth a little bit to 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:08.390
 little lithium because neither male 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:11.050
 It makes me go but again we go 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.050
 OK 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.770
 there is 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.220
 to you good now I have it I have it what 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.220
 I have it 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:39.040
 OMG 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:39.040
 come on come on come pedal car 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:56.420
 when I think that we are 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.450
 here back and I do not know what they are 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.400
 making them do god we are helping 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.140
 a hug to all view screens 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.099
 past climatic intake earthquake 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.099
 five confirmed in my life 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:20.320
 but what is happening 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:28.210
 5 I do not understand a subscriber 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.960
 why 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.150
 there is no margin of error for 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.400
 get to the first one here ok 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.230
 and it is true, or you prefer, as we read 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.090
 for the right, we're going to have a 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.320
 little crude the truth but good since 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.139
 want 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.270
 come on ok 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.539
 I'm starting it so Mary and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.539
 a little 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.789
 xbox live is a bit bad 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.330
 55 and suddenly you know if one starts 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:21.449
 that is a subject and does not appear in the 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:24.099
 marker is going to be a pretty funny 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.810
 funny wretched trained you know 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:28.180
 but now basic does more than points and 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.560
 down we do not have vouchers guys 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.930
 perspective and catch climbing also 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.790
 because they 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.810
 and half a mile of thousands of lives 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:41.030
 to the first but the point that is 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.040
 important to you as I have complete 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.410
 the race we go how many points we 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.000
 was missing bbva lacks short nights 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.290
 songs for it we can say 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.390
 that I have already sung because this continues 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.210
 her up 20 points is the brand but 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:58.690

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.690
 movie ghost writers 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.590

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.160
