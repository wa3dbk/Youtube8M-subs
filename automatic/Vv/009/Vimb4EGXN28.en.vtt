imagine it to be around two to three
minutes<00:01:39.250> long<00:01:39.490> that<00:01:39.820> is<00:01:40.000> pretty<00:01:40.330> much<00:01:40.509> how

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
minutes long that is pretty much how

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.840 
minutes long that is pretty much how
long<00:01:40.960> trails<00:01:41.259> are<00:01:41.500> nowadays<00:01:41.770> and<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.670> is

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
considered short and sweet I guess

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.139

finish the time will fly by with the

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:47.490 
finish the time will fly by with the
amount<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.479> fingers<00:01:46.780> they<00:01:46.899> will<00:01:47.080> show<00:01:47.259> it<00:01:47.410> in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.439 
awesome that would be or if you can
attach<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.709> turtle<00:03:45.250> with<00:03:45.459> Rico's<00:03:45.879> grappling

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:46.449

hook to like a seaplane or something and

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.849 
hook to like a seaplane or something and
then<00:03:48.849> just<00:03:49.090> fly<00:03:49.419> off<00:03:49.449> into<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.169> air<00:03:50.379> with<00:03:50.829> a

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859
