next quitting or something you pour it

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.550 
next quitting or something you pour it
in<00:03:16.799> water<00:03:17.040> pre<00:03:17.400> diluted<00:03:17.880> it's<00:03:18.870> not<00:03:19.079> rich<00:03:19.380> at

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
in water pre diluted it's not rich at

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.039 
in water pre diluted it's not rich at
all<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.739> saw<00:03:20.190> Doug's<00:03:20.489> chocolate<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.180> was<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.019> of

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
all I saw Doug's chocolate I was kind of

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.509 
all I saw Doug's chocolate I was kind of
expecting<00:03:22.500> more<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.829> Hershey's<00:03:23.280> flavor

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
expecting more like a Hershey's flavor

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.610 
expecting more like a Hershey's flavor

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
but don't get me wrong it's this is in

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.840 
but don't get me wrong it's this is in

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
fact I kind of like that lightness

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:27.740 
fact I kind of like that lightness

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
another another protein from a company

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.229 
another another protein from a company
called<00:03:34.230> Sid<00:03:34.829> tracks<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.250> nectar<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.730> first

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
it tastes awesome and then you kind of

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.380 
it tastes awesome and then you kind of
get<00:03:37.560> sick<00:03:37.799> of<00:03:37.829> the<00:03:37.950> sweetness<00:03:38.190> but<00:03:38.390> anyway

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
yeah it's it's uh tonight I was a little

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.310 
yeah it's it's uh tonight I was a little
scared<00:03:42.420> because<00:03:42.570> occasionally<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.200> get

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
scared because occasionally you get

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800 
scared because occasionally you get
these<00:03:43.470> these<00:03:43.769> all-natural<00:03:44.810> flavored

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
these these all-natural flavored

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.449 
these these all-natural flavored
products<00:03:46.320> and<00:03:46.500> they<00:03:46.560> don't<00:03:46.709> taste<00:03:46.890> good<00:03:47.160> but

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
products and they don't taste good but

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.370 
products and they don't taste good but
but<00:03:47.730> that's<00:03:47.820> not<00:03:48.000> bad<00:03:48.209> really<00:03:48.450> uh<00:03:48.630> from<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.260> guy

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
but that's not bad really uh from a guy

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.420 
but that's not bad really uh from a guy
who's<00:03:49.500> trying<00:03:49.620> on<00:03:49.829> different<00:03:49.890> proteins

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
who's trying on different proteins

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.849 
who's trying on different proteins
that's<00:03:51.120> pretty<00:03:51.359> good<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.780> think<00:03:52.230> that's<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.650> safe

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
that's pretty good I think that's a safe

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.069 
that's pretty good I think that's a safe
flavor<00:03:53.220> for<00:03:53.579> family<00:03:54.420> members<00:03:54.569> that<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> might

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079

have that you know don't even take
something<00:03:57.180> that's<00:03:57.239> regularly<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.930> don't<00:03:58.350> think

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560

3500 for AK per serving so you guys

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.399 
3500 for AK per serving so you guys
don't<00:04:56.819> know<00:04:56.969> or<00:04:57.300> AK<00:04:57.479> stands<00:04:57.750> for<00:04:57.960> oxidative

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
don't know or AK stands for oxidative

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:01.179 
don't know or AK stands for oxidative
radical<00:04:59.009> absorption<00:04:59.550> capacity<00:04:59.879> you<00:05:00.659> know

00:05:01.179 --> 00:05:01.189 
radical absorption capacity you know

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:03.800 
radical absorption capacity you know
supercalifragilistic<00:05:02.189> know<00:05:02.340> but<00:05:03.000> really

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
supercalifragilistic know but really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.969 
supercalifragilistic know but really
that's<00:05:03.900> just<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.229> it's<00:05:04.409> just<00:05:04.439> a<00:05:04.650> measure<00:05:04.860> of

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
that's just that it's just a measure of

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.760 
that's just that it's just a measure of
the<00:05:05.610> antioxidant<00:05:06.330> capacity<00:05:06.419> of<00:05:06.810> fruits<00:05:07.169> as<00:05:07.710> a

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
the antioxidant capacity of fruits as a

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.170 
the antioxidant capacity of fruits as a
general<00:05:08.159> rule<00:05:08.189> berries<00:05:08.699> are<00:05:08.819> always<00:05:09.029> going<00:05:09.120> to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
general rule berries are always going to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.330 
general rule berries are always going to
be<00:05:09.240> higher<00:05:09.509> they<00:05:09.750> have<00:05:09.870> thin<00:05:10.139> skins<00:05:10.500> the

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
be higher they have thin skins the

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.249 
be higher they have thin skins the
darker<00:05:11.759> of<00:05:11.909> fruit<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.270> more<00:05:12.629> antioxidants

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
darker of fruit is the more antioxidants

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.920 
darker of fruit is the more antioxidants
it<00:05:13.379> has<00:05:13.529> so<00:05:13.860> a<00:05:14.159> nice<00:05:14.580> blend<00:05:14.879> in<00:05:14.969> here<00:05:15.180> and<00:05:15.840> I

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
it has so a nice blend in here and I

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110 
it has so a nice blend in here and I
think<00:05:16.199> you<00:05:16.650> know<00:05:16.770> I<00:05:17.219> would<00:05:17.370> go<00:05:17.610> with<00:05:17.699> chocolate

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
think you know I would go with chocolate

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.519 
think you know I would go with chocolate
and<00:05:18.210> then<00:05:18.360> hopefully<00:05:18.509> this<00:05:18.659> tastes<00:05:19.080> good<00:05:19.169> I'll

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
and then hopefully this tastes good I'll

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.800 
and then hopefully this tastes good I'll
post<00:05:19.740> a<00:05:19.889> review<00:05:19.979> up<00:05:20.159> there<00:05:20.310> later<00:05:20.599> but<00:05:21.599> if<00:05:21.750> you
