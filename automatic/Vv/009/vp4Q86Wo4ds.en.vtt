00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 do not 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.620
 Now let's make a small adjustment 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:12.040
 colour 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.680
 let's go to correction adjustments 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.570
 selective and in selective correction you 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.420
 let's modify the green green is 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.120
 pretty yellowish let's make a 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.820
 try first how we see when I'm 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.920
 raising the greens in this chamber and 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.360
 in most of the green channel there is no 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.550
 green only there is a green very 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.280
 deep that is not bad that retouch a 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.960
 bit by the way because I leave it a 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.969
 little bit darker but where are we going to 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.690
 see the great modifications in the 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:43.449
 yellow when I get yellow 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.489
 the green is going up I'm not touching 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:49.210
 absolutely nothing else but the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:53.469
 lettuce now let's give it a little 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.949
 more said to get us better here 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.170
 red here are this would be pretty 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:04.360
 synthetic because we planted a little more 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:06.460
 down here now we can put blue and 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.280
 the opposite of blue is yellow 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.670
 I 'm going to put a tad of blue 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:17.320
 so that it takes a little bit of density and 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.670
 we also give it magenta or green because 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.319
 we give a little dot of green to support 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.190
 perfect let's modify now a 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:30.350
 little bit black a little bit more yellow 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.720
 so that we are more compensated 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.140
 we look before we look later and see 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.050
 how it is very easy to get the colors 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.760
 that we see in advertising simply 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.620
 with a little patience and knowing what 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.430
 tools to use we can get 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.670
 that this goes from yellowish to green 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 here we are going to name you as green 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.780
 lettuce does not need to put lettuce if 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.420
 we put green and we will be very clear 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.610
 which is the lettuce now I'm going to 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.799
 remove a small dominant we have 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:07.820
 at this point to do that layer of 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:11.480
 saturation and as we see here we have a 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.940
 little yellow and a little blue not 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.870
 we are interested in taking everything 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.989
 we are going to do is to paint relatively 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.900
 fast and without much consideration in these 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.640
 the areas with care we do not get to 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.819
 touch the lettuce but neither is it necessary 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.090
 that we eliminate all the value at one hundred 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.090
 one hundred 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:37.950
 perfect more or less is fine this is 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.930
 question of a little patience but 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870
 we are going to eliminate the mini bridge and 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.210
 all ways we do not use we adjust 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.500
 I'm going to put the screen in this 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.630
 visualization that is better to work 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.140
 display with windows and here what 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.750
 we have perfect whole screen 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.540
 Now what I'm going to do is correct 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.240
 slightly this tone this tone has 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.080
 excessive saturation because we 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:09.030
 we plant here and we invest only you 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.780
 let's remove in these points we're not going 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.740
 to remove in the whole brush image a 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.130
 little smaller 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:22.040
 and we remove these saturation points 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:24.319
 excessive that we have here very well 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.469
 as we see is more compensated here 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.799
 we have a yellowish dot is a 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:34.670
 color balance and we're going to high 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.439
 12 s in high lights we put a 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.930
 little bit of blue as we see when 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:42.620
 we put a little blue the deal is left 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.989
 more white and we also correct that 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.160
 small imperfection so let's do 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.190
 that 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.010
 let's correct this small dominant 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.900
 that we had here and we're going to put it in 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.570
 lighting is a little blue that 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.040
 touch where we play is not going to do 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:04.189
 nothing harmful about our image 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.099
 principle now we have an image 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.180
 quite more aggressive with a lot more 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.940
 volume now 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.700
 I'm going to make another layer of curves 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:17.459
 and we are going to give a little bit of volume this 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.470
 point when we upload this really I 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.340
 the saturation is going up 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:26.600
 luminosity and only investing 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.600
 we're going to scratch at that point 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.860
 now we are going to polish with correction 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.099
 selective the reds go to and the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.770
 selective correction and let's see what 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:48.400
 we can do with these reds if they 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.080
 we increase the black we increase the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:56.229
 intensity if we play with yellow 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:05:00.069
 we give them a less natural color in this 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.650
 case and another a little more pleasant 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.719
 because they are a tad more yellowish and 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.840
 the tomatoes if they have a mixture 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:12.099
 important yellow really are left 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:14.840
 rather better and here we go up a bit 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:18.290
 the Reds 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.160
 they said goes with the red the magenta goes with 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.020
 the green and the yellow goes with the blue 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.080
 we look at the color as we see we have 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.700
 a rather more intense color and quite 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.220
 more alive we will see the image at 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.710
 principle and the image now we see that 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.380
 there is a quite obvious modification 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.370
 of our g control image to create 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:43.300
 a group and retouch 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:44.710
 color or color just do not need 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.260
 that we specify so much this is 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.419
 basically the correction that we're going to 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.690
 perform in our image about the 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.690
 colour
