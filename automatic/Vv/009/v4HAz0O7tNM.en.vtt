and we're teaching students how to build

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.310 
and we're teaching students how to build
these<00:00:41.969> filters<00:00:42.390> because<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.989> going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> be

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
these filters because it's going to be

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:59.540 
these filters because it's going to be
good<00:00:43.440> practice<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.920> us<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.920> decided<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.430> do

something out of this it's been it's

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.300 
something out of this it's been it's
been<00:02:13.000> amazing<00:02:13.270> I've<00:02:13.630> actually<00:02:14.010> seen<00:02:15.010> how

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
been amazing I've actually seen how

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.270 
been amazing I've actually seen how
easily<00:02:15.880> could<00:02:16.330> catch<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:16.990> to<00:02:17.280> something

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
easily could catch on to something

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.260 
easily could catch on to something
that's<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.700> complicated<00:02:19.030> as<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.840> water<00:02:20.500> filter

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.730 

it's<00:02:25.270> like<00:02:25.480> smaller<00:02:25.720> than<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.050> gravel<00:02:26.620> on<00:02:26.710> the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
it's like smaller than the gravel on the

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.050 
it's like smaller than the gravel on the
very<00:02:26.950> bottom<00:02:27.070> finished<00:02:27.460> and<00:02:27.670> then<00:02:27.880> there's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
very bottom finished and then there's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.360 
very bottom finished and then there's
like<00:02:28.540> there's<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> metal<00:02:29.620> carrier<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.250> then

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
like there's a metal carrier and then

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.830 
like there's a metal carrier and then
there's<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.790> meadow<00:02:31.060> play<00:02:31.330> with<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.570> bunch<00:02:31.660> of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
there's a meadow play with a bunch of

there's a meadow play with a bunch of
holes<00:02:31.990> in<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:41.940> different<00:02:42.940> aspects<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.480> go

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
holes in it different aspects that go

into those physics as mechanical
engineering<00:02:46.990> there's<00:02:47.380> biology<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.280> they

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
engineering there's biology and they

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.430 
engineering there's biology and they
seem<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.850> understand<00:02:49.210> everything<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:50.260> that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
seem to understand everything so that

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.020 
seem to understand everything so that

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
make that gives me a lot more confidence

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.820 
make that gives me a lot more confidence
to<00:02:52.090> do<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.420> successful<00:02:52.960> in<00:02:53.080> Brazil<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.710> it's

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
to do the successful in Brazil so it's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.680 
to do the successful in Brazil so it's
been<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.040> great<00:02:54.250> experience<00:02:56.940> I'm<00:02:57.940> very<00:02:58.180> excited

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
been a great experience I'm very excited

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.940 
been a great experience I'm very excited
