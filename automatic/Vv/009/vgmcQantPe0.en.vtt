hi this is Kevin Gong and this is my
chess<00:00:03.480> tactics<00:00:03.689> video<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.440> skewers<00:00:05.390> so<00:00:06.390> in

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
chess tactics video on skewers so in

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.110 
chess tactics video on skewers so in
previous<00:00:07.140> videos<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.890> explained<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.639> forks

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
previous videos I explained what forks

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.870 
previous videos I explained what forks
and<00:00:09.360> pins<00:00:09.840> are<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:11.190> this<00:00:11.280> video<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.730> to

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and pins are and in this video on to

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.250 
and pins are and in this video on to
explain<00:00:12.240> skewers<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:14.219> skewers<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.330> very

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
explain skewers so skewers are very

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.800 
explain skewers so skewers are very
similar<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> pins<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:18.060> some<00:00:18.480> people<00:00:18.690> actually

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
similar to pins and some people actually

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.700 
similar to pins and some people actually
think<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.260> them<00:00:19.439> as<00:00:19.710> reverse<00:00:20.369> pins<00:00:21.619> so<00:00:22.619> I'm

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
think of them as reverse pins so I'm

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.640 
think of them as reverse pins so I'm
gonna<00:00:22.800> pin<00:00:23.130> usually<00:00:23.970> you'd<00:00:24.810> have<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.289> king

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
gonna pin usually you'd have the king

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.490 
gonna pin usually you'd have the king
being<00:00:26.099> behind<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.760> piece<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.840> you're

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
being behind the piece that you're

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
being behind the piece that you're
attacking<00:00:29.060> but<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> skewer<00:00:30.599> you're

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
attacking but in a skewer you're

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.110 
attacking but in a skewer you're
actually<00:00:31.859> attacking<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.399> king<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.969> there's

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
actually attacking the king and there's

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.720 
actually attacking the king and there's
another<00:00:33.390> piece<00:00:33.630> behind<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.200> king<00:00:34.489> so<00:00:35.489> here's

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
another piece behind the king so here's

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.590 
another piece behind the king so here's
a<00:00:35.790> simple<00:00:36.450> example<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.110> skewer

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.819 

if<00:00:40.020> white<00:00:40.559> brings<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.100> rook<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:42.239> h8<00:00:42.930> Czech

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
if white brings the rook to h8 Czech

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
if white brings the rook to h8 Czech
attacking<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.550> king<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.750> King<00:00:45.989> has<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.440> move

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
attacking a king the King has to move

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.529 
attacking a king the King has to move
out<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.520> you'll<00:00:47.730> notice<00:00:47.940> there's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
out of the way and you'll notice there's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.110 
out of the way and you'll notice there's
another<00:00:49.110> black<00:00:49.440> piece<00:00:49.680> behind<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.879> once

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
another black piece behind it so once

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.500 
another black piece behind it so once
the<00:00:51.300> King<00:00:51.510> moves<00:00:51.989> out<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:53.510> white

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the King moves out of the way then white

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
the King moves out of the way then white
can<00:00:54.539> take<00:00:54.870> that<00:00:55.050> piece<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.440> skewer<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> nice

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
can take that piece so skewer is a nice

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.849 
can take that piece so skewer is a nice
way<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> win<00:01:00.270> material<00:01:00.750> so<00:01:01.260> let's<00:01:01.440> look<00:01:01.620> at

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
way to win material so let's look at

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.479 
way to win material so let's look at
another<00:01:02.160> example

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
another example

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.789 
another example
now<00:01:05.489> skewers<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.210> can<00:01:06.360> do<00:01:06.450> skewers<00:01:06.900> with<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
now skewers you can do skewers with the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.899 
now skewers you can do skewers with the
long-range<00:01:08.369> pieces<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.500> rook<00:01:10.740> Bishop<00:01:11.640> or

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
long-range pieces the the rook Bishop or

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.160 
long-range pieces the the rook Bishop or
queen<00:01:13.880> so<00:01:14.880> let's<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.180> another<00:01:15.420> another<00:01:15.900> case

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
queen so let's look another another case

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.230 
queen so let's look another another case
and<00:01:16.530> usually<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.759> piece<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> you're

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and usually the piece that you're

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
and usually the piece that you're
attacking<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> opponent's<00:01:19.860> king<00:01:20.130> or

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
attacking is the opponent's king or

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.670 
attacking is the opponent's king or
queen<00:01:20.720> although<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:22.049> doesn't<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.560> be

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
queen although that doesn't have to be

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.830 
queen although that doesn't have to be
the<00:01:22.799> case<00:01:22.979> but<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:23.970> that's<00:01:24.390> often<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
the case but that's that's often the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.859 
the case but that's that's often the
case<00:01:24.990> for<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.290> skewer<00:01:26.210> so<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.600> again<00:01:27.720> you

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
case for a skewer so here again you

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.819 
case for a skewer so here again you
you've<00:01:28.350> got<00:01:28.970> rook<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.229> y<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.439> move<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> rook

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you've got rook and y can move the rook

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.130 
you've got rook and y can move the rook
up<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:33.020> h6<00:01:34.430> attacking<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:36.299> black<00:01:36.479> Queen<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
up to h6 attacking the black Queen and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.940 
up to h6 attacking the black Queen and
the<00:01:38.100> Queen<00:01:38.220> has<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> move<00:01:38.850> out<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.119> way<00:01:39.950> and

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
the Queen has to move out of the way and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
the Queen has to move out of the way and
there's<00:01:41.670> notice<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.270> no<00:01:42.450> way<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there's notice there's no way for the

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.389 
there's notice there's no way for the
Queen<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.560> get<00:01:43.860> out<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> way<00:01:44.360> and<00:01:45.360> still

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:46.399 
Queen to get out of the way and still

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.480 
Queen to get out of the way and still
protect<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.790> bishop<00:01:48.290> thanks<00:01:49.350> since<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
protect the bishop thanks since the the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.190 
protect the bishop thanks since the the
Queen<00:01:50.670> can't<00:01:50.939> move<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.450> c8<00:01:52.110> or<00:01:52.880> c4<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:55.020> let's

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
Queen can't move to c8 or c4 so let's

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.870 
Queen can't move to c8 or c4 so let's
say<00:01:55.409> moves<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.759> f5<00:01:57.119> then<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
say moves here to f5 then I can take the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.440 
say moves here to f5 then I can take the
bishop

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.720 

so<00:02:05.530> let's<00:02:06.530> look<00:02:06.620> at<00:02:06.800> another<00:02:07.010> example<00:02:07.220> in<00:02:07.640> this

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
so let's look at another example in this

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.780 
so let's look at another example in this
case<00:02:07.940> we're<00:02:08.750> going<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:08.930> have<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.200> Bishop

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
case we're going to have the Bishop

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.920 
case we're going to have the Bishop
execute<00:02:10.790> the<00:02:10.910> skewer<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:13.240> white<00:02:14.240> moves<00:02:14.480> Bishop

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
execute the skewer so white moves Bishop

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.970 
execute the skewer so white moves Bishop
to<00:02:15.430> c3<00:02:16.430> check<00:02:16.880> attacking<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.750> king<00:02:17.960> and<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
to c3 check attacking the king and the

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.350 
to c3 check attacking the king and the
Queen<00:02:19.250> is<00:02:19.640> behind<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.530> hmm<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.060> after<00:02:23.060> black

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
Queen is behind it hmm so after black

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.660 
Queen is behind it hmm so after black
moves<00:02:23.630> King<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.020> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.170> way<00:02:24.290> white<00:02:25.070> can<00:02:25.370> take

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
moves King out of the way white can take

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.340 
moves King out of the way white can take
the<00:02:25.790> Queen<00:02:26.620> okay<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:29.180> then<00:02:29.450> why<00:02:30.050> should<00:02:30.290> be

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
the Queen okay and then why should be

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.240 
the Queen okay and then why should be
able<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.560> win<00:02:30.680> that<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:35.150> next<00:02:35.810> let's<00:02:36.590> look<00:02:36.950> at<00:02:37.190> a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
able to win that so next let's look at a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.300 
able to win that so next let's look at a
case<00:02:37.610> where<00:02:38.620> you're<00:02:39.620> not<00:02:39.770> actually<00:02:40.130> attacking

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
case where you're not actually attacking

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.780 
case where you're not actually attacking
the<00:02:40.550> king<00:02:40.790> or<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:40.970> Queen<00:02:42.040> here<00:02:43.040> white<00:02:43.550> can

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
the king or the Queen here white can

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.370 
the king or the Queen here white can
skewer<00:02:44.210> blacks<00:02:44.900> rooks<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:47.240> can<00:02:48.200> move<00:02:48.290> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
skewer blacks rooks so I can move the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.950 
skewer blacks rooks so I can move the
bishop<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.920> c3<00:02:49.640> attacking<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.410> rook<00:02:51.560> on<00:02:51.860> f6

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
bishop to c3 attacking the rook on f6

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.740 
bishop to c3 attacking the rook on f6
there's<00:02:53.960> no<00:02:54.110> way<00:02:54.230> to<00:02:54.290> block<00:02:54.680> that<00:02:54.950> attack<00:02:55.130> so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
there's no way to block that attack so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.480 
there's no way to block that attack so
black<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:57.140> save<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.740> rook<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.130> need<00:02:58.310> to

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
black to save this rook would need to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.050 
black to save this rook would need to
move<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.940> out<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.210> way<00:03:00.100> but<00:03:01.100> there's<00:03:01.880> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
move it out of the way but there's the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.620 
move it out of the way but there's the
other<00:03:02.150> rook<00:03:02.420> behind<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:04.300> black<00:03:05.300> moves<00:03:05.540> our

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
other rook behind it so black moves our

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.850 
other rook behind it so black moves our
work<00:03:05.780> data<00:03:06.080> h6<00:03:06.830> then<00:03:07.510> white<00:03:08.510> can<00:03:08.840> take<00:03:09.709> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
work data h6 then white can take the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.920 
work data h6 then white can take the
rook<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.450> win<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.570> exchange<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:14.000> white<00:03:14.780> will

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
rook and win the exchange so white will

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.710 
rook and win the exchange so white will
end<00:03:15.110> up<00:03:15.230> trading<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.980> bishop<00:03:16.310> for<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.790> rook<00:03:19.720> so

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
end up trading the bishop for a rook so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.920 
end up trading the bishop for a rook so
kind<00:03:21.020> of<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.230> opposite<00:03:21.830> situation<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:23.720> this

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
kind of the opposite situation in this

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.890 
kind of the opposite situation in this
position<00:03:24.910> white<00:03:25.910> can<00:03:26.180> move<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.480> rook<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:27.760> f2

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
position white can move the rook to f2

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.710 
position white can move the rook to f2
attacking<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.410> bishop<00:03:30.560> on<00:03:30.920> f6<00:03:31.540> again<00:03:32.540> there's

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
attacking the bishop on f6 again there's

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.130 
attacking the bishop on f6 again there's
no<00:03:32.840> way<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.020> protect<00:03:33.350> or<00:03:34.239> block

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
no way to protect or block

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.810 
no way to protect or block
there's<00:03:36.530> no<00:03:36.650> way<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.830> protect<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.310> bishop<00:03:37.640> or

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
there's no way to protect this bishop or

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.199 
there's no way to protect this bishop or
block<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.870> attack<00:03:39.140> from<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.440> rook<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.550> if

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
block the attack from the rook so if

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.430 
block the attack from the rook so if
black<00:03:42.110> moves<00:03:42.140> the<00:03:42.560> bishop<00:03:42.800> away<00:03:44.050> Y<00:03:45.050> can<00:03:45.260> just

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
black moves the bishop away Y can just

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.699 
black moves the bishop away Y can just
take<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.550> bishop<00:03:46.730> behind<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:49.900> so<00:03:50.900> finally<00:03:51.260> I

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
take the bishop behind it so finally I

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.420 
take the bishop behind it so finally I
want<00:03:52.340> to<00:03:52.750> show<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:54.200> skewer<00:03:54.739> in<00:03:54.830> one<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.340> the

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
want to show a skewer in one of the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.690 
want to show a skewer in one of the
games<00:03:55.550> I've<00:03:55.910> played<00:03:55.940> online<00:03:57.400> and<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.520> actually

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
games I've played online and I actually

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.070 
games I've played online and I actually
searched<00:03:59.270> through<00:03:59.900> a<00:04:00.400> lot<00:04:01.400> of<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:02.180> think<00:04:02.600> all<00:04:03.050> of

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
searched through a lot of I think all of

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.070 
searched through a lot of I think all of
my<00:04:03.290> online<00:04:04.280> games<00:04:04.580> there's<00:04:05.000> about<00:04:05.239> 30<00:04:05.810> or<00:04:06.020> so

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:06.080 
my online games there's about 30 or so

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.860 
my online games there's about 30 or so
of<00:04:06.350> them<00:04:06.700> and<00:04:07.700> this<00:04:08.239> was<00:04:08.450> actually<00:04:08.600> the<00:04:08.840> only

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
of them and this was actually the only

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.590 
of them and this was actually the only
skewer<00:04:09.650> I<00:04:09.739> could<00:04:09.980> find<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:10.610> they're<00:04:11.330> not<00:04:11.450> as

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
skewer I could find so they're not as

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.400 
skewer I could find so they're not as
common<00:04:12.079> as<00:04:12.109> Forks<00:04:12.920> or<00:04:13.190> pins<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:15.320> know

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
common as Forks or pins but you know

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.890 
common as Forks or pins but you know
they're<00:04:15.620> no<00:04:16.489> less<00:04:16.760> valuable

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
they're no less valuable

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.920 
they're no less valuable
so<00:04:18.470> here<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:19.310> was<00:04:19.820> playing<00:04:19.970> black<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:20.690> it<00:04:20.900> was

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
so here I was playing black and it was

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.250 
so here I was playing black and it was
my<00:04:21.139> move<00:04:21.380> and<00:04:22.990> I'm<00:04:23.990> with<00:04:24.199> my<00:04:24.380> bishop<00:04:24.949> to<00:04:25.370> h6

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
my move and I'm with my bishop to h6

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.860 
my move and I'm with my bishop to h6
attacking<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.620> Queen<00:04:27.770> here<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.330> notice<00:04:29.720> that

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
attacking the Queen here and notice that

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.100 
attacking the Queen here and notice that
there's<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.139> Rick<00:04:30.350> behind<00:04:30.500> it<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.280> once<00:04:32.110> white

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
there's a Rick behind it so once white

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.030 
there's a Rick behind it so once white
moves<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.220> Queen<00:04:34.430> away<00:04:34.790> then<00:04:35.389> I<00:04:35.990> take<00:04:36.889> the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
moves the Queen away then I take the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.820 
moves the Queen away then I take the
rook<00:04:37.220> Whitney<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:37.970> exchange<00:04:39.220> okay<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.380> hope
