at the amount of trucks that are out
early<00:01:03.290> now<00:01:03.650> think<00:01:03.890> about<00:01:04.010> this<00:01:04.309> these<00:01:04.640> trucks

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
early now think about this these trucks

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.880 
early now think about this these trucks
are<00:01:05.150> out<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.479> three<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.930> six<00:01:06.170> weeks<00:01:06.260> early

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
are out there three to six weeks early

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.160 
are out there three to six weeks early
and<00:01:07.040> they<00:01:07.280> will<00:01:07.430> be<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:07.820> wouldn't<00:01:08.600> say<00:01:08.780> daily

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
and they will be I wouldn't say daily

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.230 
and they will be I wouldn't say daily
but<00:01:09.409> at<00:01:09.619> least<00:01:09.830> two<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.670> three<00:01:10.700> times<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:11.210> week

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
but at least two to three times a week

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.700 
but at least two to three times a week
now<00:01:11.570> this<00:01:11.690> is<00:01:11.810> going<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:11.990> add<00:01:12.140> on<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.560> road

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
now this is going to add on to the road

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.500 
now this is going to add on to the road
budget<00:01:13.100> for<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.310> fuel<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.880> overtime<00:01:14.240> for<00:01:14.420> the

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
budget for the fuel the overtime for the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.660 
budget for the fuel the overtime for the
crews<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.320> salt<00:01:15.619> all<00:01:15.830> these<00:01:16.010> types<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.400> things

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
crews the salt all these types of things

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.850 
crews the salt all these types of things
and<00:01:17.000> they're<00:01:17.659> going<00:01:17.780> to<00:01:17.840> be<00:01:17.960> later<00:01:18.170> out<00:01:18.409> into

you<00:02:00.499> know<00:02:00.619> look<00:02:00.859> at<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.100> picture<00:02:01.249> this<00:02:02.060> looks

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you know look at that picture this looks

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.429 
you know look at that picture this looks
very<00:02:02.450> similar<00:02:02.689> what<00:02:02.899> happened<00:02:03.200> in<00:02:03.259> Tennessee
