here

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.960 
here
it's<00:00:19.770> called<00:00:20.100> electron<00:00:20.850> Pro<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.730> it's<00:00:23.730> for

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
it's called electron Pro and it's for

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.820 
it's called electron Pro and it's for
the<00:00:24.090> 120s<00:00:25.019> our<00:00:25.760> helicopter<00:00:26.760> by<00:00:26.910> II<00:00:26.939> flight

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
the 120s our helicopter by II flight

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.009 
the 120s our helicopter by II flight
these<00:00:28.830> are<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> e<00:00:29.070> flight<00:00:29.460> batteries<00:00:30.060> now<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
these are the e flight batteries now I

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.020 
these are the e flight batteries now I
already<00:00:31.349> made<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> video<00:00:31.800> talking<00:00:32.309> about<00:00:32.730> some

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
already made a video talking about some

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.410 
already made a video talking about some
stuff<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.660> don't<00:00:33.750> want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.050> rehash<00:00:34.440> too<00:00:34.800> much

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
stuff so I don't want to rehash too much

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.119 
stuff so I don't want to rehash too much
but<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.540> reason<00:00:36.899> why<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.469> another

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
but the reason why I have another

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.400 
but the reason why I have another
battery<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.590> that<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.890> charger<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:42.410> that

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
battery is is that the charger here that

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.450 
battery is is that the charger here that
comes<00:00:43.739> with<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.719> leaf<00:00:45.719> light<00:00:46.050> blade<00:00:46.440> 120s<00:00:47.250> our

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
comes with the leaf light blade 120s our

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
comes with the leaf light blade 120s our
helicopter<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.379> same<00:00:49.620> charger

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
helicopter and this is the same charger

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.900 
helicopter and this is the same charger
that<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.700> comes<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.989> e<00:00:52.020> flight<00:00:52.500> blade

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
that also comes with the e flight blade

that also comes with the e flight blade
MCP<00:00:53.910> X<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.739> this<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> apply<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.520> both

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
MCP X and this is going to apply to both

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.770 
MCP X and this is going to apply to both
helicopters<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> both<00:00:58.170> batteries<00:00:58.859> now<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.210> had

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.120 
listening to horizon hobby saying to
charge<00:04:54.460> is<00:04:54.640> 0.7<00:04:55.570> amps<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.140> don't<00:04:56.560> charge<00:04:56.920> your

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
charge is 0.7 amps so don't charge your

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.050 
charge is 0.7 amps so don't charge your
if<00:04:57.370> light<00:04:57.810> 120<00:04:59.220> batteries<00:05:00.220> at<00:05:00.370> that<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.850> don't

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
if light 120 batteries at that and don't

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.530 
if light 120 batteries at that and don't
charge<00:05:01.450> your<00:05:01.660> MC<00:05:02.110> px<00:05:02.820> either<00:05:03.820> or<00:05:04.210> you're<00:05:04.390> going

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
charge your MC px either or you're going

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.140 
charge your MC px either or you're going
to<00:05:04.630> ruin<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.020> batteries<00:05:05.530> charge<00:05:05.920> them<00:05:06.070> at<00:05:06.190> 0.3

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
to ruin the batteries charge them at 0.3

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.840 
to ruin the batteries charge them at 0.3
amps<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:08.800> batteries<00:05:09.250> aren't<00:05:09.520> very<00:05:09.670> expensive

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
amps the batteries aren't very expensive

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.960 
amps the batteries aren't very expensive
guys<00:05:10.690> but<00:05:11.140> why<00:05:11.680> have<00:05:11.950> to<00:05:12.130> spend<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.550> money<00:05:12.700> if

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
guys but why have to spend the money if

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.080 
guys but why have to spend the money if
you<00:05:13.000> don't<00:05:13.240> have<00:05:13.420> to<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:15.430> like<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.730> said<00:05:15.970> this

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
you don't have to but like I said this

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.880 
you don't have to but like I said this
is<00:05:16.270> more<00:05:16.480> of<00:05:16.630> a<00:05:16.690> video<00:05:16.840> talking<00:05:17.290> about<00:05:17.530> this

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
is more of a video talking about this

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.920 
is more of a video talking about this
newer<00:05:18.190> battery<00:05:18.640> with<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:18.970> higher<00:05:20.010> C<00:05:21.010> rating

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
newer battery with the higher C rating

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.720 
newer battery with the higher C rating
more<00:05:22.930> or<00:05:23.020> less<00:05:23.200> than<00:05:23.470> talking<00:05:24.130> about<00:05:24.370> like<00:05:24.640> I

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
more or less than talking about like I

said<00:05:24.910> I<00:05:24.940> already<00:05:25.150> have<00:05:25.450> a<00:05:25.480> video<00:05:26.100> explaining

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
said I already have a video explaining

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.320 
said I already have a video explaining
about<00:05:27.490> the<00:05:27.760> 120s<00:05:28.450> are<00:05:28.690> in<00:05:28.810> the<00:05:28.900> problem<00:05:29.290> I<00:05:29.380> had

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
about the 120s are in the problem I had

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.510 
about the 120s are in the problem I had
so<00:05:31.330> anyways<00:05:31.840> it's<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.830> new<00:05:33.010> battery<00:05:33.250> out

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
so anyways it's a new battery out

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.420 
so anyways it's a new battery out
electron<00:05:34.300> Pro<00:05:34.690> it's<00:05:35.560> made<00:05:35.770> by<00:05:35.950> common-sense

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
electron Pro it's made by common-sense

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.120 
electron Pro it's made by common-sense
RC<00:05:38.580> check<00:05:39.580> them<00:05:39.760> out<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.800> maybe<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:41.950> like

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
RC check them out and maybe you like

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.950 
RC check them out and maybe you like
these<00:05:42.310> batteries<00:05:42.880> better<00:05:43.120> like<00:05:43.450> I<00:05:43.600> said<00:05:43.810> they

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
these batteries better like I said they

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.770 
these batteries better like I said they
have<00:05:44.170> a<00:05:44.200> better<00:05:44.710> discharge<00:05:45.340> NMC<00:05:45.850> you<00:05:46.480> get<00:05:46.630> more

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
have a better discharge NMC you get more

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.830 
have a better discharge NMC you get more
of<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:46.960> pop<00:05:47.230> and<00:05:47.440> a<00:05:47.500> burst<00:05:48.030> from<00:05:49.030> them<00:05:49.240> and<00:05:49.690> you

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
of a pop and a burst from them and you

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.500 
of a pop and a burst from them and you
got<00:05:49.990> the<00:05:50.140> power<00:05:50.320> when<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:50.680> need<00:05:50.710> it<00:05:51.510> anyways

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
got the power when you need it anyways

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.300 
got the power when you need it anyways
that's<00:05:52.780> all<00:05:52.960> I<00:05:52.990> got<00:05:53.290> to<00:05:53.470> say<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.740> hope<00:05:54.010> this
