00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.929
 room and yes

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.810
 This game is called Petra and we are going to 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.989
 see and settle this game a little 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.489
 what's called trier what's what 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.769
 Well, I do not know 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.730
 I only know that you have 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:42.440
 come on, you have to be a 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.210
 survivor do not give me agneaux is something 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.489
 from past centuries and well let's see 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.400
 How about we think it's not a game like that 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.860
 like black and white is not something like that 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.730
 curious is nice 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.730
 the pretty 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.850
 it's nice there's nothing here what happens 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.230
 is that as it is a little what you 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.790
 confuses a little what are the 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.510
 colors I do not see what this bee is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.510
 What's up 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.819
 that's why the boy let's see what it is 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:24.009
 we have to look for objects and look 

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:26.649
 it does not differentiate between the area with 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.509
 shadow and what is the same shade does not 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.329
 be the same object that translates the 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.850
 shadow ok let's see sunken ships 

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.800
 by 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.190
 pizango knows all this 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.280
 arrow that you can not see one of 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.280
 Water 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.700
 Busquets, I do it, well, we have to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.060
 look for not be some survivor or something 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.030
 or a chest 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.090
 worth coins we have to look for what is 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.400
 one a kind of survivors not 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.420
 because a little road 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:06.030
 come cif and avale 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:12.730
 It is worth worth unemployed with this for or not 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:19.750
 It's worth what I 'm reminded of a brother 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:22.080
 I do not know the two ways this seems 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.080
 what follows 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:30.170
 I have not seen anyone I have so bad 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.170

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.550

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.550
 a chest 32 coins 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.250
 and if I continue here I fall to the abyss 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.140
 black and white 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.960

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.210

 two videos if it's a channel crap if 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.459
 is that nobody gets the objects is that 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.060
