probably with some nice cooling
solutions<00:00:57.210> like<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> hyper<00:00:58.649> 212

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
solutions like you know the hyper 212

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.950 
solutions like you know the hyper 212
you<00:00:59.489> guys<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.820> get<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.120> nice<00:01:00.300> ever<00:01:00.510> come<00:01:00.750> on

you guys can get some nice ever come on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.219 
you guys can get some nice ever come on
that<00:01:01.170> uh<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.399> uses<00:01:02.760> 95<00:01:03.600> wats<00:01:03.989> now

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that uh and it only uses 95 wats now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.570 
that uh and it only uses 95 wats now
bear<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.439> mind<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.949> over<00:01:05.159> cock<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.460> will

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bear in mind if you do over cock it will

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.260 
bear in mind if you do over cock it will
use<00:01:05.729> more<00:01:06.000> but<00:01:06.600> yeah<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:07.020> 95<00:01:07.860> watches<00:01:08.310> more<00:01:09.210> than

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
use more but yeah I 95 watches more than

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
use more but yeah I 95 watches more than
enough<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.530> means<00:01:10.740> we<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
enough and that means we can also get a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.960 
enough and that means we can also get a
cheaper<00:01:11.640> past<00:01:11.850> advice<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:13.670> let<00:01:14.670> me<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.850> get

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
cheaper past advice so let me just get

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
cheaper past advice so let me just get
into<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.240> graphics<00:01:15.630> card<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.080> GP<00:01:16.560> iphone

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
into the graphics card for a GP iphone

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.390 
into the graphics card for a GP iphone
will<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.130> supply<00:01:17.640> radeon<00:01:18.150> r9<00:01:18.740> 270x<00:01:19.740> now<00:01:20.100> i<00:01:20.130> was

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
will be supply radeon r9 270x now i was

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.090 
will be supply radeon r9 270x now i was
thinking<00:01:20.729> about<00:01:20.909> going<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.420> 7870<00:01:22.409> because

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
thinking about going with a 7870 because

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.850 
thinking about going with a 7870 because
they<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.369> basically<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> same<00:01:24.119> thing<00:01:24.180> arm

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
they are basically the same thing arm

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.749 
they are basically the same thing arm
but<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.189> theory<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.299> 7870<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.950> couple

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
but in theory the 7870 is only a couple

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.600 
but in theory the 7870 is only a couple
quid<00:01:30.210> cheaper<00:01:30.840> um<00:01:31.110> from<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> place<00:01:32.159> i<00:01:32.340> found

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
quid cheaper um from the place i found

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.850 
quid cheaper um from the place i found
it<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> cheapest<00:01:33.720> 270x<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> cheap

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
it from the cheapest 270x and the cheap

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.050 
it from the cheapest 270x and the cheap
and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.900> cheapest<00:01:36.900> 7870<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.890> could<00:01:38.280> really

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and the cheapest 7870 I could really

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
and the cheapest 7870 I could really
much<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.869> make<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.229> um<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.890> big

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
much not really make a big um a big

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.969 
much not really make a big um a big
judgment<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.909> 140<00:01:42.540> pound<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.170> 7870

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
judgment is about 140 pound for a 7870

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.560 
judgment is about 140 pound for a 7870
and<00:01:44.630> 152-pound<00:01:45.630> for<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.200> 80<00:01:46.950> 270x<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> 270x

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and 152-pound for a 80 270x and the 270x

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.510 
and 152-pound for a 80 270x and the 270x
does<00:01:48.930> perform<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.409> slightly<00:01:49.890> bit<00:01:50.159> better<00:01:50.399> just

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
does perform a slightly bit better just

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.969 
does perform a slightly bit better just
because<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.149> UM<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:52.110> core<00:01:52.439> clocks<00:01:52.740> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
because of the UM the core clocks and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
because of the UM the core clocks and
the<00:01:53.159> overclock<00:01:53.549> spots<00:01:53.790> already<00:01:53.970> got<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the overclock spots already got this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.639 
the overclock spots already got this
particular<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.590> it's<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> supplier

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
particular one is the it's the supplier

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
know all the magic things but you guys

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.379 
know all the magic things but you guys
expect<00:03:28.340> from<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.549> high<00:03:28.700> in<00:03:28.760> mahwah<00:03:29.120> but<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.389 
expect from a high in mahwah but the

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:30.729 
expect from a high in mahwah but the
only<00:03:29.540> reason<00:03:29.599> I<00:03:29.870> got<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.109> forwards<00:03:30.650> because

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
only reason I got it forwards because

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.099 
only reason I got it forwards because
it's<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.519> comes<00:03:31.790> out<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.000> very<00:03:32.299> very<00:03:32.599> nice<00:03:32.780> cheap

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
it's it comes out a very very nice cheap

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.020 
it's it comes out a very very nice cheap
price<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.470> five<00:03:33.620> seven<00:03:33.950> pound<00:03:34.130> ten<00:03:34.489> pounds<00:03:34.849> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
price of five seven pound ten pounds I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.610 
price of five seven pound ten pounds I
it's<00:03:35.690> am3+<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.620> it<00:03:36.739> supports<00:03:36.829> both<00:03:37.430> our<00:03:38.620> our

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
it's am3+ so it supports both our our

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's am3+ so it supports both our our
CPU<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.489> it<00:03:40.730> has<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:41.060> has<00:03:41.870> one<00:03:42.079> pci<00:03:42.470> slot<00:03:43.130> for

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
CPU and it has a has one pci slot for

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.300 
CPU and it has a has one pci slot for
our<00:03:43.810> GPU<00:03:44.810> i<00:03:44.959> believe<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.410> pcs<00:03:45.799> tour<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.099> two

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
our GPU i believe the pcs tour is two

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.640 
our GPU i believe the pcs tour is two
point<00:03:46.549> oh<00:03:46.700> and<00:03:47.030> our<00:03:47.389> GPU<00:03:47.810> is<00:03:47.840> three<00:03:48.079> point<00:03:48.290> but

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
point oh and our GPU is three point but

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.170 
point oh and our GPU is three point but
that's<00:03:48.799> fine<00:03:48.980> guys<00:03:49.250> because<00:03:49.579> two<00:03:49.760> point<00:03:49.970> O<00:03:50.030> has

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
that's fine guys because two point O has

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.690 
that's fine guys because two point O has
not<00:03:50.389> even<00:03:50.480> been<00:03:50.720> fully<00:03:51.109> utilized<00:03:51.560> yet<00:03:51.829> it's

that's fine guys um we all really need
the<00:04:05.569> newest<00:04:06.169> and<00:04:06.500> best<00:04:06.919> all<00:04:07.910> right<00:04:08.329> has<00:04:08.599> a

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
the newest and best all right has a

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
ddr3 1066 and 1350 free but that's fine

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.900 
ddr3 1066 and 1350 free but that's fine
because<00:04:14.629> memory<00:04:15.500> of<00:04:15.799> ram<00:04:16.070> does<00:04:16.280> not<00:04:16.519> really

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
because memory of ram does not really

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.300 
because memory of ram does not really
make<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.180> difference<00:04:17.419> guys<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.079> gaming<00:04:18.410> it

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
make a difference guys and gaming it

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.920 
make a difference guys and gaming it
actually<00:04:19.579> doesn't<00:04:19.729> make<00:04:19.910> a<00:04:19.940> read<00:04:20.120> it<00:04:20.359> doesn't

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
actually doesn't make a read it doesn't

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.029 
actually doesn't make a read it doesn't
really<00:04:21.019> make<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.229> difference<00:04:21.440> of<00:04:21.590> anything

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:22.039 
really make a difference of anything

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.770 
really make a difference of anything
really<00:04:22.190> but<00:04:22.520> yeah

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
really but yeah

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.940 
really but yeah
okay<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:24.930> ask<00:04:25.050> for<00:04:25.230> on<00:04:25.350> my<00:04:25.500> phone<00:04:25.680> with

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
okay and ask for on my phone with

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.879 
okay and ask for on my phone with
crucial<00:04:26.389> are<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:28.080> cheapest<00:04:28.500> time<00:04:28.620> I<00:04:28.650> could

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
crucial are the cheapest time I could

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.760 
crucial are the cheapest time I could
probably<00:04:29.430> find<00:04:29.910> where's<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.780> it's<00:04:31.110> six<00:04:31.440> gigs

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
probably find where's the it's six gigs

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.480 
probably find where's the it's six gigs
it's<00:04:32.100> our<00:04:32.520> I<00:04:33.030> think<00:04:33.419> it's<00:04:33.570> yeah<00:04:34.410> free<00:04:34.889> up<00:04:35.190> two

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
it's our I think it's yeah free up two

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.940 
it's our I think it's yeah free up two
so<00:04:35.940> again<00:04:36.169> i'm<00:04:37.169> often<00:04:37.410> what<00:04:37.530> does<00:04:37.740> actually

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
so again i'm often what does actually

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.330 
so again i'm often what does actually
support<00:04:38.570> our<00:04:39.570> four<00:04:40.050> dimm<00:04:40.320> slots<00:04:40.500> or<00:04:40.860> that<00:04:41.040> what

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
support our four dimm slots or that what

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.520 
support our four dimm slots or that what
that<00:04:41.430> means<00:04:41.669> is<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:41.880> we<00:04:42.120> can<00:04:42.270> have<00:04:42.530> four

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
that means is that we can have four

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.080 
that means is that we can have four
extra<00:04:43.800> ram<00:04:44.220> slots<00:04:44.460> so<00:04:44.610> we're<00:04:44.730> going<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.910> fill

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
extra ram slots so we're going to fill

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.740 
extra ram slots so we're going to fill
up<00:04:45.230> we<00:04:46.230> have<00:04:46.350> them<00:04:46.530> with<00:04:46.740> two<00:04:46.919> gig<00:04:47.130> cards<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
up we have them with two gig cards and

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.980 
up we have them with two gig cards and
the<00:04:49.020> rama<00:04:49.200> is<00:04:49.350> ddr3<00:04:50.220> 1066<00:04:50.760> yes<00:04:51.600> i<00:04:51.750> know<00:04:51.810> i'm

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
the rama is ddr3 1066 yes i know i'm

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.090 
the rama is ddr3 1066 yes i know i'm
going<00:04:52.080> to<00:04:52.139> get<00:04:52.260> a<00:04:52.290> bit<00:04:52.530> of<00:04:52.590> hate<00:04:52.800> for<00:04:52.950> this

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
going to get a bit of hate for this

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.990 
going to get a bit of hate for this
because<00:04:53.660> it's<00:04:54.660> plain<00:04:55.320> basic<00:04:55.950> ramming<00:04:56.610> it's

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
because it's plain basic ramming it's

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.090 
because it's plain basic ramming it's
the<00:04:57.240> cheapest<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.840> guys<00:04:58.020> could<00:04:58.230> get<00:04:58.410> but<00:04:58.800> i
