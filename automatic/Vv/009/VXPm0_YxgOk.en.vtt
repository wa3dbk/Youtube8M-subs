00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
need and you can do it on both sides now

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.310 
need and you can do it on both sides now
if<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> come<00:00:30.210> down<00:00:30.359> here<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.230> go

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
if you come down here you can go

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
if you come down here you can go
underneath<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.700> where<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.940> collect

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
underneath and this is where you collect

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.990 
underneath and this is where you collect
all<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.690> your<00:00:34.050> potatoes<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.920> carrots<00:00:35.190> there's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
all of your potatoes and carrots there's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.970 
all of your potatoes and carrots there's
also<00:00:36.149> another<00:00:36.329> variation<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.649> I've<00:00:37.800> built

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
also another variation that I've built

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
also another variation that I've built
over<00:00:38.250> here<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> show<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> main

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
over here to show you the main

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.470 
over here to show you the main
difference<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.430> are<00:00:41.550> no<00:00:41.610> dispensers<00:00:42.300> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
difference is there are no dispensers on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.420 
difference is there are no dispensers on
the<00:00:42.570> sides<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.079> can<00:00:43.200> see<00:00:43.379> there's<00:00:43.980> Pistons

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the sides as you can see there's Pistons

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.700 
the sides as you can see there's Pistons
with<00:00:44.579> water<00:00:44.789> sources<00:00:45.120> instead<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.809> there's<00:00:46.649> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
with water sources instead and there's a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.590 
with water sources instead and there's a
lever<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.430> if<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:47.579> come<00:00:47.789> down<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.329> flip

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
lever here so if I come down and I flip

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.020 
lever here so if I come down and I flip
the<00:00:48.750> lever<00:00:48.950> then<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.160> Pistons<00:00:50.520> will<00:00:50.670> retract

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the lever then the Pistons will retract

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
the lever then the Pistons will retract
and<00:00:51.329> allow<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.570> water<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.899> come<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and allow the water to come out and it

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
and allow the water to come out and it
will<00:00:53.070> uproot<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> potatoes<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.180> push

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
will uproot all the potatoes and push

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
will uproot all the potatoes and push
them<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> center<00:00:55.770> just<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.070> before<00:00:56.600> so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
them into the center just like before so

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.930 
them into the center just like before so
as<00:00:57.750> we<00:00:57.899> wait<00:00:58.079> for<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.440> last<00:00:59.370> slow<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.910> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
as we wait for this last slow one to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.319 
as we wait for this last slow one to
come<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.620> I'll<00:01:01.620> turn<00:01:01.829> around<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:03.120> will

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
come in and I'll turn around and I will

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.670 
come in and I'll turn around and I will
hit<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.780> lever<00:01:04.559> again<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.760> water<00:01:05.970> will

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
hit the lever again and the water will

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.870 
hit the lever again and the water will
reside<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.010> obviously<00:01:08.220> replay<00:01:08.610> out<00:01:08.760> them

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
reside you can obviously replay out them

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.850 
reside you can obviously replay out them
again<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.990> I've<00:01:10.080> also<00:01:10.170> placed<00:01:10.560> water

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
again and then I've also placed water

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.670 
again and then I've also placed water
below<00:01:11.220> here<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> potatoes<00:01:13.200> or

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
below here so that the potatoes or

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.499 
below here so that the potatoes or
carrots<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.189> brought<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> end<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.420> I'm

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
carrots are brought to the end now I'm

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.700 
carrots are brought to the end now I'm
going<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.720> show<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.900> how<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.080> build<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.409> so

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
going to show you how to build it so

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.929 
going to show you how to build it so
I've<00:01:16.799> already<00:01:16.920> built<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.490> planting

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I've already built the to planting

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
I've already built the to planting
platforms<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.020> four<00:01:19.320> blocks<00:01:19.560> wide

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
platforms here they are four blocks wide

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
platforms here they are four blocks wide
by<00:01:20.610> 10<00:01:20.970> blocks<00:01:21.240> long<00:01:21.799> obviously<00:01:22.799> there's<00:01:23.009> two

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
by 10 blocks long obviously there's two

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
by 10 blocks long obviously there's two
of<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.700> for<00:01:23.759> each<00:01:23.970> side<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.689> you're

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
of them one for each side and you're

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
of them one for each side and you're
going<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.350> have<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> platform<00:01:25.710> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> middle

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
going to have a platform in the middle

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.700 
going to have a platform in the middle
so<00:01:27.119> start<00:01:27.420> by<00:01:27.540> building<00:01:27.659> up<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> tower<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so start by building up the tower in the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.370 
so start by building up the tower in the
middle<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.400> then<00:01:30.390> building<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> wall

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
middle there and then building a wall

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.690 
middle there and then building a wall
around<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:32.070> you're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.369> want<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.549> leave

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
around and you're going to want to leave

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.850 
around and you're going to want to leave
a<00:01:32.729> space<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.869> each<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.229> corners<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.799> the

to the back of the button and then

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.730 
to the back of the button and then
you're<00:03:09.930> going<00:03:10.020> to<00:03:10.110> want<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.350> build<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.620> same

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
you're going to want to build the same

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.040 
you're going to want to build the same
thing<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.220> other<00:03:11.250> side<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.960> build<00:03:12.960> it

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
thing on the other side and build it

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.260 
thing on the other side and build it
down<00:03:13.290> so<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.560> it<00:03:13.710> goes<00:03:13.800> on<00:03:14.010> top<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.520> this

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
down so that it goes on top of this this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.450 
down so that it goes on top of this this
wall<00:03:15.510> blocking<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.140> water<00:03:16.320> in<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:17.010> place

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
wall blocking the water in and place

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.820 
wall blocking the water in and place
another<00:03:17.490> block<00:03:18.060> at<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:18.270> end<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.709> can

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
another block at the end so that it can

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.420 
another block at the end so that it can
go<00:03:19.980> into<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.810> dispenser<00:03:21.810> at<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.050> other<00:03:22.170> end

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
go into the dispenser at the other end

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.050 
go into the dispenser at the other end
now<00:03:23.430> bring<00:03:24.240> redstone<00:03:24.750> along<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> line<00:03:25.410> here

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
now bring redstone along the line here

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.610 
now bring redstone along the line here
once<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.270> get<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.780> couple<00:03:28.140> blocks<00:03:28.320> down<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
once you get a couple blocks down the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.310 
once you get a couple blocks down the
side<00:03:29.010> you<00:03:29.640> want<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.910> place<00:03:30.060> a<00:03:30.090> repeater<00:03:30.320> so

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
side you want to place a repeater so

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.140 
side you want to place a repeater so
that<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.650> redstone<00:03:32.070> Paul's<00:03:32.340> will<00:03:32.610> last<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
that the redstone Paul's will last the

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.610 
that the redstone Paul's will last the
entire<00:03:33.240> length<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.900> then<00:03:34.230> you'll<00:03:34.380> want<00:03:34.410> the

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
entire length and then you'll want the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.380 
entire length and then you'll want the
redstone<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.340> continue<00:03:35.730> down<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.270> go

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
redstone to continue down and go

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.850 
redstone to continue down and go
directly<00:03:36.660> into<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.140> side<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.740> other

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
directly into the side of the other

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.530 
directly into the side of the other
dispenser<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.670> that<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.940> water<00:03:39.240> also

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
dispenser so that this water also

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.230 
dispenser so that this water also
dispensed<00:03:40.410> now<00:03:41.070> you<00:03:41.130> want<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.459> repeat<00:03:41.730> this<00:03:41.940> on

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
dispensed now you want to repeat this on

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.330 
dispensed now you want to repeat this on
the<00:03:42.600> other<00:03:42.780> side<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.440> that<00:03:43.650> both<00:03:43.950> sides<00:03:44.160> are

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
the other side so that both sides are

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.330 
the other side so that both sides are
going<00:03:45.170> again<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> few<00:03:46.440> blocks<00:03:46.680> down<00:03:46.830> you<00:03:47.160> want

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
going again a few blocks down you want

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.160 
going again a few blocks down you want
to<00:03:47.400> play<00:03:47.550> Sarah<00:03:47.820> puter<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.660> that<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> pulse

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
to play Sarah puter so that the pulse

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.500 
to play Sarah puter so that the pulse
can<00:03:49.380> last<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.740> entire<00:03:49.800> length<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.520> finish<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
can last the entire length and finish it

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.600 
can last the entire length and finish it
off<00:03:51.720> with<00:03:51.750> redstone<00:03:52.380> going<00:03:52.920> into<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.400> last

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
off with redstone going into the last

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.220 
off with redstone going into the last
dispenser<00:03:54.209> now<00:03:54.570> I'll<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.810> go<00:03:54.930> into<00:03:55.140> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
dispenser now I'll just go into the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.510 
dispenser now I'll just go into the
middle<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> next<00:03:56.220> thing<00:03:56.340> you're

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
middle here and the next thing you're

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.130 
middle here and the next thing you're
going<00:03:56.670> to<00:03:56.730> want<00:03:56.820> to<00:03:57.000> do<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.420> place<00:03:57.720> your<00:03:57.750> water

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
going to want to do is place your water

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140 
going to want to do is place your water
and<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> dispensers<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.820> now<00:03:59.880> that<00:03:59.910> I<00:04:00.090> have

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
and the dispensers so now that I have

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.630 
and the dispensers so now that I have
four<00:04:00.480> waters<00:04:00.840> I'll<00:04:01.020> place<00:04:01.200> one<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.830> each<00:04:02.459> of

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
four waters I'll place one in each of

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.910 
four waters I'll place one in each of
these<00:04:02.730> dispensers<00:04:03.330> in<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.600> corners<00:04:04.080> so<00:04:04.890> that

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
these dispensers in the corners so that

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.060 
these dispensers in the corners so that
the<00:04:05.220> water<00:04:05.400> will<00:04:05.790> uproot<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.930> crops<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.530> move

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
the water will uproot the crops and move

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.710 
the water will uproot the crops and move
it<00:04:08.160> into<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> middle<00:04:08.640> now<00:04:09.150> I'll<00:04:09.270> test<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.630> out

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
it into the middle now I'll test it out

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.470 
it into the middle now I'll test it out
by<00:04:09.840> pressing<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.290> button<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.239> why<00:04:12.239> didn't

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
by pressing the button and why didn't

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.210 
by pressing the button and why didn't
that<00:04:12.600> work<00:04:12.660> I<00:04:13.050> guess<00:04:13.410> it<00:04:13.590> helps<00:04:13.830> if<00:04:13.890> i<00:04:13.950> put<00:04:14.130> the

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
that work I guess it helps if i put the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.310 
that work I guess it helps if i put the
redstone<00:04:14.550> on<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:14.730> right<00:04:14.880> spot<00:04:15.120> let<00:04:15.989> me<00:04:16.140> move

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
redstone on the right spot let me move

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.930 
redstone on the right spot let me move
this<00:04:16.470> over<00:04:16.620> 1<00:04:16.890> so<00:04:16.919> that<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.580> button<00:04:17.850> is

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
this over 1 so that the button is

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.240 
this over 1 so that the button is
actually<00:04:18.299> giving<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.660> redstone<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.049> pulse<00:04:19.290> fix

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
actually giving the redstone a pulse fix

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.969 
actually giving the redstone a pulse fix
that<00:04:20.690> place<00:04:21.690> threads<00:04:21.989> going<00:04:22.049> on<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.590> now<00:04:22.770> let

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
that place threads going on and now let

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.890 
that place threads going on and now let
me<00:04:23.010> give<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.370> try<00:04:23.610> and<00:04:24.390> hopefully<00:04:24.780> it<00:04:24.840> will

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
me give this a try and hopefully it will

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.000 
me give this a try and hopefully it will
work<00:04:24.960> and

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
work and

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.100 
work and
we<00:04:27.160> go<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:28.060> water<00:04:28.240> flows<00:04:28.510> perfectly<00:04:28.780> in

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
we go and the water flows perfectly in

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:30.870 
we go and the water flows perfectly in
the<00:04:29.260> middle<00:04:29.560> so<00:04:30.160> we'll<00:04:30.370> press<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.670> button

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
the middle so we'll press the button

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.000 
the middle so we'll press the button
again<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.150> turn<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.510> off<00:04:31.660> and<00:04:31.890> it's<00:04:32.890> all

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
again to turn it off and it's all

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.470 
again to turn it off and it's all
working<00:04:33.250> now<00:04:33.550> you'll<00:04:33.910> want<00:04:34.060> to<00:04:34.120> come<00:04:34.300> down<00:04:34.420> to

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
working now you'll want to come down to

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.690 
working now you'll want to come down to
the<00:04:34.660> end<00:04:34.870> and<00:04:35.140> dig<00:04:35.650> your<00:04:35.830> trench<00:04:36.040> that<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.580> can

careful when you're doing this and make
sure<00:06:54.129> that<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.460> Pistons<00:06:54.849> are<00:06:54.970> set<00:06:55.210> up<00:06:55.330> so<00:06:55.360> that

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
sure that the Pistons are set up so that

00:06:55.599 --> 00:06:58.379 
sure that the Pistons are set up so that
the<00:06:55.750> water<00:06:56.710> source<00:06:57.159> will<00:06:57.460> be<00:06:57.610> a<00:06:57.639> block<00:06:58.060> higher

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
the water source will be a block higher

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:01.830 
the water source will be a block higher
than<00:06:58.690> the<00:06:58.900> della<00:06:59.860> grass<00:07:00.099> or<00:07:00.849> the<00:07:01.240> crop<00:07:01.479> sorry

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:01.840 
than the della grass or the crop sorry

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.960 
than the della grass or the crop sorry
so<00:07:02.500> that<00:07:02.620> the<00:07:02.740> water<00:07:02.949> is<00:07:03.069> falling<00:07:03.520> and<00:07:03.879> that

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:03.970 
so that the water is falling and that

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.939 
so that the water is falling and that
way<00:07:04.449> it<00:07:04.569> gets<00:07:04.659> its<00:07:04.870> full<00:07:05.110> eight<00:07:05.349> block<00:07:05.590> spread

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:05.949 
way it gets its full eight block spread

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:07.619 
way it gets its full eight block spread
now<00:07:06.639> you're<00:07:06.759> going<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:07.060> place<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.389> source

00:07:07.619 --> 00:07:07.629 
now you're going to place the source

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:09.629 
now you're going to place the source
block<00:07:07.900> and<00:07:08.199> very<00:07:08.470> quickly<00:07:08.770> cover<00:07:09.069> it<00:07:09.220> up<00:07:09.370> so

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 
block and very quickly cover it up so

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:12.149 
block and very quickly cover it up so
that<00:07:09.699> the<00:07:09.789> water<00:07:10.090> doesn't<00:07:10.180> fall<00:07:10.720> and<00:07:11.159> destroy

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
that the water doesn't fall and destroy

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.300 
that the water doesn't fall and destroy
your<00:07:12.520> your<00:07:13.240> redstone<00:07:13.539> wire<00:07:13.919> make<00:07:14.919> sure<00:07:15.069> this

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
your your redstone wire make sure this

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.100 
your your redstone wire make sure this
source<00:07:15.610> block<00:07:15.880> is<00:07:16.090> in<00:07:16.479> front<00:07:16.720> of<00:07:16.780> the<00:07:16.870> block

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
source block is in front of the block

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.839 
source block is in front of the block
where<00:07:17.470> the<00:07:17.590> piston<00:07:18.009> will<00:07:18.159> be<00:07:18.310> pulling<00:07:18.580> back

00:07:18.839 --> 00:07:18.849 
where the piston will be pulling back

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:21.180 
where the piston will be pulling back
again<00:07:19.810> place<00:07:20.050> the<00:07:20.080> water<00:07:20.440> and<00:07:20.650> quickly<00:07:20.949> cover

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
again place the water and quickly cover

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:25.020 
again place the water and quickly cover
it<00:07:21.400> and<00:07:21.520> then<00:07:22.360> come<00:07:22.690> down<00:07:22.870> here<00:07:23.909> destroy<00:07:24.909> the

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
it and then come down here destroy the

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.180 
it and then come down here destroy the
button<00:07:25.300> and<00:07:25.419> place<00:07:25.599> a<00:07:25.630> lever<00:07:25.960> so<00:07:26.710> you<00:07:26.860> can't

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:27.190 
button and place a lever so you can't

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.689 
button and place a lever so you can't
roll<00:07:27.430> the<00:07:27.580> Pistons<00:07:28.000> turn<00:07:28.720> them<00:07:28.900> off<00:07:29.050> and<00:07:29.699> I

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:30.699 
roll the Pistons turn them off and I

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.189 
roll the Pistons turn them off and I
guess<00:07:30.909> it<00:07:31.090> helps<00:07:31.360> if<00:07:31.479> you<00:07:31.659> connect<00:07:32.110> the

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
guess it helps if you connect the

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.580 
guess it helps if you connect the
redstone<00:07:32.969> there<00:07:33.969> you'll<00:07:34.150> see<00:07:34.360> the<00:07:34.870> Pistons

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:35.590 
redstone there you'll see the Pistons

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:38.010 
redstone there you'll see the Pistons
draw<00:07:35.770> back<00:07:36.009> and<00:07:36.400> the<00:07:37.150> water<00:07:37.419> will<00:07:37.599> fall<00:07:37.810> and

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:38.020 
draw back and the water will fall and

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.600 
draw back and the water will fall and
you'll<00:07:38.770> notice<00:07:39.099> that<00:07:39.129> the<00:07:39.340> water<00:07:39.520> is

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.610 
you'll notice that the water is

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.249 
you'll notice that the water is
following<00:07:40.180> a<00:07:40.240> block<00:07:40.419> and<00:07:40.599> spreading<00:07:40.960> the<00:07:41.050> full

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:41.259 
following a block and spreading the full

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.050 
following a block and spreading the full
eight<00:07:41.469> block<00:07:41.770> now<00:07:42.009> all<00:07:42.190> there<00:07:42.400> is<00:07:42.520> left<00:07:42.550> to<00:07:42.879> do
