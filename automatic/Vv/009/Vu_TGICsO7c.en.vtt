00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
methods of doing it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.279 
methods of doing it
however<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> principles<00:00:57.899> are<00:00:58.020> always

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
however the principles are always

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.990 
however the principles are always
staying<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.579> I'd<00:00:59.670> be<00:00:59.789> risk

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
staying there is one I'd be risk

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
staying there is one I'd be risk
protected<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:01.199> knuckles<00:01:01.559> protected<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.609> your

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
can t go far wrong let me show you how I

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.980 
can t go far wrong let me show you how I
was<00:01:10.950> taught

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.160 

so<00:01:17.990> starting<00:01:18.470> off<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:20.060> loop<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.870> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
so starting off with the loop and the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.590 
so starting off with the loop and the
stitching<00:01:21.620> on<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.950> inside<00:01:22.450> this<00:01:23.450> is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
stitching on the inside this is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.180 
stitching on the inside this is
important<00:01:24.080> because<00:01:24.170> when<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.560> finish<00:01:24.710> off<00:01:25.010> it

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
important because when you finish off it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.750 
important because when you finish off it
finish<00:01:25.430> it<00:01:25.550> off<00:01:25.640> nicely<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.890> go<00:01:28.070> few<00:01:28.460> times

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
finish it off nicely you go few times

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.790 
finish it off nicely you go few times
