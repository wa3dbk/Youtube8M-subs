00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
between polished choice and Wayne Goss

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.480 
between polished choice and Wayne Goss
and<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.150> is<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.360> beautiful<00:00:19.140> palette<00:00:19.800> full<00:00:20.220> of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
and it is a beautiful palette full of

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.880 
and it is a beautiful palette full of
matte<00:00:20.700> shadows<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.360> then<00:00:21.869> there<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> one<00:00:22.200> kind

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
matte shadows and then there is one kind

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
matte shadows and then there is one kind
of<00:00:23.100> shimmery<00:00:23.550> iridescent<00:00:24.390> color<00:00:24.570> added<00:00:25.020> to<00:00:25.199> it

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
of shimmery iridescent color added to it

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
of shimmery iridescent color added to it
but<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.800> think<00:00:26.010> they<00:00:26.100> did<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> great<00:00:26.699> job<00:00:26.730> of

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
but I think they did a great job of

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.870 
but I think they did a great job of
combining<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.960> warm<00:00:28.440> tones<00:00:28.770> and<00:00:29.070> cool<00:00:29.640> tone

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
combining some warm tones and cool tone

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.189 
combining some warm tones and cool tone
so<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.119> think<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.359> lot<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.689> different<00:00:31.080> people

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
so I think a lot of different people

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.200 
so I think a lot of different people
would<00:00:31.470> like<00:00:31.680> this<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.699> use<00:00:32.879> it

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
would like this and you can also use it

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.299 
would like this and you can also use it
to<00:00:33.239> create<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> lot<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> different<00:00:34.470> looks<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.860> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
to create a lot of different looks and I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.799 
to create a lot of different looks and I
was<00:00:35.430> surprised<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> even<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
was surprised but I even like the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.600 
was surprised but I even like the
eyeshadow<00:00:37.260> brush<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.739> comes<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> am

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
eyeshadow brush that comes with it I am

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.549 
eyeshadow brush that comes with it I am
not<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.820> biggest<00:00:39.180> fan<00:00:39.479> of<00:00:39.629> synthetic<00:00:40.170> eye

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
not the biggest fan of synthetic eye

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.680 
not the biggest fan of synthetic eye
shadow<00:00:40.920> brushes<00:00:41.220> but<00:00:41.970> this<00:00:42.089> one<00:00:42.269> does<00:00:42.449> a<00:00:42.479> good

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
shadow brushes but this one does a good

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.509 
shadow brushes but this one does a good
job<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.989> picking<00:00:43.379> up<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.860> lot<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> powder

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:44.519 
job of picking up a lot of the powder

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.520 
job of picking up a lot of the powder
and<00:00:44.850> then<00:00:44.909> it<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.210> places<00:00:45.659> it<00:00:45.690> nicely<00:00:46.019> along

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and then it just places it nicely along

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.070 
and then it just places it nicely along
the<00:00:46.739> lid<00:00:46.949> out<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.269> eyeshadows<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.900> own

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
the lid out of all the eyeshadows I own

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.469 
the lid out of all the eyeshadows I own
these<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.280> most<00:00:50.489> pigmented<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.330> would

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
these are not the most pigmented I would

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.149 
these are not the most pigmented I would
describe<00:00:51.570> them<00:00:52.019> more<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.409> like<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.680> soft

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
describe them more as like a soft

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.509 
describe them more as like a soft
pigmentation<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:54.900> so<00:00:55.519> blendable

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
pigmentation but they are so blendable

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.070 
pigmentation but they are so blendable
so<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:56.940> really<00:00:57.180> build<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.869> color

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
so you can really build up the color

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.350 
so you can really build up the color
without<00:00:58.409> fear<00:00:58.830> of<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.519> looking<00:01:00.089> patchy

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
without fear of like it looking patchy

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.200 
without fear of like it looking patchy
at<00:01:00.720> all<00:01:00.869> blends<00:01:01.530> really<00:01:01.799> effortlessly<00:01:02.580> and<00:01:02.879> my

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
at all blends really effortlessly and my

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
at all blends really effortlessly and my
go<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.479> look<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.900> what<00:01:04.049> I'm<00:01:04.140> wearing<00:01:04.320> today<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
go to look is what I'm wearing today and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.460 
go to look is what I'm wearing today and
I<00:01:05.400> start<00:01:05.729> off<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> color<00:01:06.510> tan<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I start off with the color tan in the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.039 
I start off with the color tan in the
crease<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.740> lightly<00:01:08.310> buffed<00:01:08.760> out<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.420> then

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
crease just lightly buffed out and then

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
crease just lightly buffed out and then
I<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.380> take<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.799> lightest<00:01:11.219> color<00:01:11.399> in<00:01:11.609> the

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
I will take the lightest color in the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.580 
I will take the lightest color in the
palette<00:01:11.909> which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> called<00:01:12.630> cream<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.409> will

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
palette which is called cream and I will

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.349 
palette which is called cream and I will
use<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.799> as<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> matte<00:01:14.640> highlight<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.240> it's

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
use that as a matte highlight and it's

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.330 
use that as a matte highlight and it's
just<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.539> very<00:01:15.750> natural<00:01:16.200> looking<00:01:16.859> highlight

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
just a very natural looking highlight

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.789 
just a very natural looking highlight

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.109 
and then probably my favorite shadow
which<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.340> funny<00:01:20.399> because<00:01:20.670> it's<00:01:20.969> the

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
which is kind of funny because it's the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.209 
which is kind of funny because it's the
one<00:01:21.299> that's<00:01:21.359> not<00:01:21.719> Matt<00:01:22.079> is<00:01:22.380> pink<00:01:22.740> sugar<00:01:22.890> and

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
wiggled it in a little bit and then I

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.149

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:36.869 
after I started doing this consistently

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:39.379 
after I started doing this consistently
I<00:04:37.529> just<00:04:38.099> have<00:04:38.249> noticed<00:04:38.580> my<00:04:38.639> skin<00:04:39.149> is<00:04:39.360> just

I just have noticed my skin is just
softer<00:04:40.049> overall<00:04:40.499> so<00:04:40.679> I<00:04:40.709> thought<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:41.009> was<00:04:41.129> a

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189 
softer overall so I thought that was a

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:43.249 
softer overall so I thought that was a
huge<00:04:41.610> benefit<00:04:42.089> to<00:04:42.149> dry<00:04:42.509> brushing<00:04:42.899> I'm<00:04:43.019> going
