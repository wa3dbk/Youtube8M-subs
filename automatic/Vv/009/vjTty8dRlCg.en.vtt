air<00:01:21.619> bubbles<00:01:21.979> can<00:01:22.070> form<00:01:22.130> is<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:23.119> put<00:01:23.479> the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
air bubbles can form is to put the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.770 
air bubbles can form is to put the
scribbles<00:01:24.679> face<00:01:25.460> down<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:25.909> tap<00:01:26.390> it<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.749> little

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
scribbles face down and tap it a little

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.440 
scribbles face down and tap it a little
bit<00:01:27.170> because<00:01:27.710> if<00:01:28.039> you<00:01:28.280> have<00:01:28.520> air<00:01:28.850> bubbles<00:01:29.210> and

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
bit because if you have air bubbles and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.840 
bit because if you have air bubbles and
you're<00:01:30.079> trying<00:01:30.409> to<00:01:30.590> squeeze<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.249> out<00:01:31.460> it<00:01:31.670> will

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
you're trying to squeeze it out it will

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.669 
you're trying to squeeze it out it will
pop<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.810> chocolate<00:01:33.170> drizzle<00:01:33.439> will<00:01:33.560> go

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
pop and the chocolate drizzle will go

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.639 
pop and the chocolate drizzle will go
everywhere<00:01:33.890> and<00:01:34.460> it<00:01:34.759> looks<00:01:34.969> really<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:36.259> looks

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
everywhere and it looks really it looks

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.450 
everywhere and it looks really it looks
really<00:01:37.130> weird<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.710> first<00:01:39.710> thing<00:01:39.859> you<00:01:39.979> do<00:01:40.130> would

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.489 
really weird so first thing you do would
be<00:01:40.609> to<00:01:40.640> tap<00:01:40.999> it<00:01:41.179> down<00:01:41.329> to<00:01:41.869> make<00:01:42.020> sure<00:01:42.109> all<00:01:42.350> the

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:42.499 
be to tap it down to make sure all the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:44.050 
be to tap it down to make sure all the
scribbles<00:01:42.890> go<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.159> bottom<00:01:43.310> I<00:01:43.609> like<00:01:43.909> to

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
scribbles go on the bottom I like to

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.899 
scribbles go on the bottom I like to
make<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:44.329> big<00:01:44.710> globs<00:01:45.710> of<00:01:45.979> chocolate<00:01:46.729> first

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
and after you make a glob like a circle

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.950 
and after you make a glob like a circle
here<00:01:51.759> slowly<00:01:52.759> but<00:01:53.210> evenly<00:01:53.719> pull<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:56.630> create

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
here slowly but evenly pull to create

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.989 
here slowly but evenly pull to create
that<00:01:57.170> string<00:01:57.560> like<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.799> and<00:01:58.310> this<00:01:58.850> one

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
that string like that and this one

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.459 
that string like that and this one
doesn't<00:01:59.149> look<00:01:59.270> very<00:01:59.359> good<00:01:59.630> because<00:02:00.079> I<00:02:00.170> did<00:02:00.350> it

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
doesn't look very good because I did it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:02.770 
doesn't look very good because I did it
really<00:02:00.740> slow<00:02:00.979> so<00:02:01.219> I'm<00:02:02.209> gonna<00:02:02.359> do<00:02:02.600> this<00:02:02.659> a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
really slow so I'm gonna do this a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.760 
really slow so I'm gonna do this a
little<00:02:02.990> faster<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.660> again<00:02:08.899> make<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.140> glob<00:02:09.470> here

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
little faster so again make a glob here

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.320 
little faster so again make a glob here
and<00:02:09.950> then<00:02:10.220> pull<00:02:10.430> out

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 

you

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
you

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
you
and<00:02:20.310> at<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.120> point<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.600> make<00:02:21.750> them

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
and at this point you can make them

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.370 
and at this point you can make them
either<00:02:22.140> shorter<00:02:22.740> or<00:02:25.520> even<00:02:26.520> bigger<00:02:27.140> if<00:02:28.140> you

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
either shorter or even bigger if you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
either shorter or even bigger if you
want<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:29.310> kind<00:02:29.520> of<00:02:29.550> miss<00:02:29.730> up<00:02:29.850> on<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.120> one

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
want and I kind of miss up on that one

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.700 
want and I kind of miss up on that one
if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.420> mess<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.900> little<00:02:31.080> bit<00:02:31.200> though<00:02:31.350> that

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
if you mess up a little bit though that

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.710 
if you mess up a little bit though that
will<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.890> fine<00:02:32.130> because<00:02:32.850> you're<00:02:33.330> gonna<00:02:33.480> fill

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
will be fine because you're gonna fill

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.230 
will be fine because you're gonna fill
up<00:02:33.810> those<00:02:33.960> gaps<00:02:34.020> later<00:02:34.610> so<00:02:35.610> now<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.210> have

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
up those gaps later so now that you have

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.560 
up those gaps later so now that you have
all<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:37.080> sides<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.770> your<00:02:37.860> box<00:02:38.460> filled<00:02:38.910> it's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
all the sides of your box filled it's

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.240 
all the sides of your box filled it's
time<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.020> fill<00:02:40.170> them<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:40.890> make<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
time to fill them in you can make this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.130 
time to fill them in you can make this
variation<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:41.970> any<00:02:42.150> way<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.660> but<00:02:42.870> this

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
variation in any way you like but this

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.650 
variation in any way you like but this
is<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.680> to<00:02:43.710> do<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:45.060> between<00:02:45.240> these

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
is what I like to do so in between these

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:46.400 
is what I like to do so in between these
two<00:02:45.870> globs

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
two globs

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.030 
two globs
I<00:02:46.470> always<00:02:46.770> put<00:02:47.690> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.780> like<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.110> medium<00:02:49.800> sized

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
I always put kind of like a medium sized

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.790 
I always put kind of like a medium sized
glob<00:02:50.370> right<00:02:50.550> there

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.250 

be<00:02:58.800> sure<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.040> not<00:02:59.370> leave<00:02:59.640> any<00:02:59.910> gaps<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:01.110> will

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
be sure to not leave any gaps so it will

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.900 
be sure to not leave any gaps so it will
look<00:03:01.410> really<00:03:01.650> realistic<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.490> it<00:03:02.610> looks<00:03:02.790> like

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
look really realistic so it looks like

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:12.510 
look really realistic so it looks like
it's<00:03:03.090> actually<00:03:03.240> all<00:03:03.780> dripping<00:03:04.200> down

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.320 

so<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.210> see<00:03:13.540> how<00:03:13.810> there's<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.640> weird<00:03:15.640> mark<00:03:16.000> over

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
so you see how there's a weird mark over

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.010 
so you see how there's a weird mark over
there<00:03:16.480> where<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.720> put<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.260> the<00:03:18.690> droplet<00:03:19.690> right

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
there where I put in the droplet right

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:21.450 
there where I put in the droplet right
there<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.380> see<00:03:20.560> how<00:03:20.710> there's<00:03:20.890> a<00:03:20.980> word<00:03:21.220> mark

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
there you see how there's a word mark

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.640 
there you see how there's a word mark
that<00:03:22.150> happened<00:03:22.540> because<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:23.110> was<00:03:23.260> a<00:03:23.290> small

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
that happened because there was a small

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.860 
that happened because there was a small
bubble<00:03:23.950> like<00:03:24.580> you<00:03:24.910> know<00:03:25.030> how<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.450> said<00:03:25.690> before

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
bubble like you know how I said before

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.230 
bubble like you know how I said before
in<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.290> first<00:03:27.040> step<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:27.970> are<00:03:28.060> air

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
in the first step that there are air

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.170 
in the first step that there are air
bubbles<00:03:28.270> in<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:28.960> so<00:03:29.890> when<00:03:30.520> an<00:03:30.760> air<00:03:31.000> bubble

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
bubbles in here so when an air bubble

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.090 
bubbles in here so when an air bubble
pops<00:03:31.600> while<00:03:31.990> you're<00:03:32.140> piping<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.620> that's<00:03:32.860> what

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
pops while you're piping it that's what

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.380 
pops while you're piping it that's what
happens<00:03:33.490> and<00:03:33.700> you<00:03:33.820> don't<00:03:34.000> want<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.240> to

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
happens and you don't want that to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.770 
happens and you don't want that to
happen<00:03:34.590> but<00:03:35.590> it's<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.160> little<00:03:36.370> mark<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.910> you

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
happen but it's a little mark and you

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.040 
happen but it's a little mark and you
can<00:03:38.050> cover<00:03:38.380> it<00:03:38.470> look<00:03:38.710> easier<00:03:39.250> but<00:03:39.580> if<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.870> get

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
can cover it look easier but if you get

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.510 
can cover it look easier but if you get
a<00:03:41.080> really<00:03:41.410> big<00:03:41.740> one

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
a really big one

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.910 
a really big one
like<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.240> do<00:03:43.540> sometimes<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.410> could<00:03:44.590> just<00:03:44.770> make

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
like I do sometimes you could just make

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.160 
like I do sometimes you could just make
the<00:03:45.130> droplets<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.670> chocolate<00:03:46.000> bigger<00:03:46.210> but<00:03:47.050> in

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
the droplets of chocolate bigger but in

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.890 
the droplets of chocolate bigger but in
order<00:03:47.410> to<00:03:47.590> cover<00:03:47.860> it<00:03:48.100> I<00:03:48.280> just<00:03:49.090> put<00:03:49.360> in<00:03:49.510> a<00:03:49.630> bigger

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
order to cover it I just put in a bigger

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.700 
order to cover it I just put in a bigger
droplets<00:03:50.350> just<00:03:51.220> like<00:03:51.340> that<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.700> cover<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.060> so

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
droplets just like that to cover it so

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.780 
droplets just like that to cover it so
don't<00:03:53.710> worry<00:03:53.950> if<00:03:54.040> you<00:03:54.130> make<00:03:54.250> any<00:03:54.430> mistakes

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
don't worry if you make any mistakes

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.660 
don't worry if you make any mistakes
here

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.910 

so<00:04:01.240> now<00:04:01.420> that<00:04:01.480> you're<00:04:01.870> done<00:04:02.580> check<00:04:03.580> for<00:04:04.210> any

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
so now that you're done check for any

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.240 
so now that you're done check for any
places<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.130> you<00:04:07.030> forgot<00:04:07.360> to<00:04:07.420> pipe<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.290> if

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
places that you forgot to pipe and if

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.120 
places that you forgot to pipe and if
there<00:04:09.490> is<00:04:09.730> no<00:04:10.140> pockets<00:04:11.140> then<00:04:11.650> there's<00:04:11.920> only

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
there is no pockets then there's only

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.160 
there is no pockets then there's only
one<00:04:12.400> more<00:04:12.520> step<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.819> do<00:04:12.940> at<00:04:13.450> times<00:04:13.810> when<00:04:14.020> you

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
one more step to do at times when you

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.170 
one more step to do at times when you
pipe<00:04:14.560> out<00:04:14.680> your<00:04:14.830> chequebook<00:04:15.250> cream<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:16.030> will

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
pipe out your chequebook cream it will

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.259 
pipe out your chequebook cream it will

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.530 
not always hang off the side like that
and<00:04:19.600> sometimes<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:21.070> will<00:04:21.160> be<00:04:21.220> patches<00:04:21.820> so

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
and sometimes there will be patches so

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.800 
and sometimes there will be patches so
to<00:04:22.600> avoid<00:04:23.200> that<00:04:23.260> with<00:04:23.650> cover<00:04:24.520> up<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:25.120> box<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
to avoid that with cover up the box the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.330 
to avoid that with cover up the box the
top<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.200> box<00:04:26.380> with<00:04:26.620> chocolate<00:04:27.010> drizzle

top of the box with chocolate drizzle

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.450 
top of the box with chocolate drizzle
but<00:04:27.850> only<00:04:28.060> at<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.419> edges<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.740> it<00:04:30.010> seems<00:04:30.250> like

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
but only at the edges so it seems like

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.760 
but only at the edges so it seems like
is<00:04:30.610> actual<00:04:31.270> chocolate<00:04:31.510> coming<00:04:32.110> out<00:04:32.260> from<00:04:32.620> the
