mouse but basically you just use your
Android<00:01:41.950> with<00:01:42.820> the<00:01:42.909> mouse<00:01:43.090> instead<00:01:43.450> of

Android with the mouse instead of
touching<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.229> have<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.620> normal<00:01:45.010> Mouse

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530

that's<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.850> what<00:02:53.850> they've<00:02:54.000> also<00:02:54.150> done<00:02:54.570> is

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
that's that what they've also done is

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.630 
that's that what they've also done is
the<00:02:55.140> gallery<00:02:55.560> has<00:02:55.709> been<00:02:55.920> really<00:02:56.250> slow<00:02:56.400> lately

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
the gallery has been really slow lately

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.680 
the gallery has been really slow lately
so<00:02:57.420> they've<00:02:58.160> made<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.340> load<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.060> little<00:03:00.570> bit

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so they've made it load a little bit

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:09.059 
so they've made it load a little bit
quicker<00:03:02.780> which<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:04.050> think<00:03:04.350> they've<00:03:04.560> succeeded

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.670 

yeah<00:03:09.700> so<00:03:10.120> those<00:03:10.629> are<00:03:10.810> some<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.140> features

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
yeah so those are some of the features

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.640 
yeah so those are some of the features
that<00:03:11.950> they've<00:03:12.370> had<00:03:12.599> it<00:03:13.599> still<00:03:14.140> has<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.620> same

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
that they've had it still has the same

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.209 
that they've had it still has the same
really<00:03:15.430> quick<00:03:15.760> fast<00:03:16.269> ADW<00:03:17.140> launcher<00:03:17.219> they

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:18.219 
really quick fast ADW launcher they

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:21.030 
really quick fast ADW launcher they
still<00:03:19.090> have<00:03:19.239> their<00:03:19.420> tips<00:03:19.780> that's<00:03:20.530> an<00:03:20.709> engine

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
still have their tips that's an engine

pretty fast so I was really happy that

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.580 
pretty fast so I was really happy that
CyanogenMod<00:03:31.689> came<00:03:31.900> out<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:32.349> this

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
CyanogenMod came out with this this

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.569 
CyanogenMod came out with this this
should<00:03:32.950> have<00:03:33.280> never<00:03:33.519> come<00:03:33.819> out<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.359> the

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
should have never come out for the

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.410 
should have never come out for the
Wildfire<00:03:37.889> and<00:03:38.889> they<00:03:39.579> actually<00:03:39.819> have<00:03:40.120> come<00:03:40.299> out

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.699 
Wildfire and they actually have come out
with<00:03:40.450> it<00:03:40.689> so<00:03:40.810> I'm<00:03:40.930> pretty<00:03:40.989> happy<00:03:41.290> about<00:03:41.409> that

let's see what I've got here I'm gonna
try<00:03:54.069> bubble<00:03:56.669> sure<00:03:58.049> instead<00:03:59.049> that<00:03:59.230> wallpaper

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
try bubble sure instead that wallpaper

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.589 
try bubble sure instead that wallpaper
let's<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.769> how<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:02.829> runs<00:04:03.180> it<00:04:04.180> runs<00:04:04.299> pretty

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
let's see how it runs it runs pretty

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.649 
let's see how it runs it runs pretty
good<00:04:07.349> yeah<00:04:08.349> so<00:04:08.709> pretty<00:04:09.220> impressive<00:04:09.480> you<00:04:10.480> can

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:10.659 
good yeah so pretty impressive you can

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:14.819 
good yeah so pretty impressive you can
pop<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.470> bubbles<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.510> everything<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:13.930> yeah

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
pop the bubbles and everything so yeah

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:15.899 
pop the bubbles and everything so yeah
it<00:04:15.040> works<00:04:15.250> real<00:04:15.519> good

00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:15.909 
it works real good

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:18.960 
it works real good
you<00:04:16.389> can<00:04:16.570> still<00:04:16.780> overclock<00:04:17.260> your<00:04:17.970> Android

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
you can still overclock your Android

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.409 
you can still overclock your Android
device<00:04:19.209> without<00:04:19.449> having<00:04:19.840> set<00:04:20.500> CPU<00:04:21.039> now<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:22.000> you

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
device without having set CPU now so you

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.680 
device without having set CPU now so you
go<00:04:22.570> to<00:04:22.659> settings<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:24.490> then<00:04:24.849> what<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.449> do<00:04:25.659> is

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
go to settings and then what you do is

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.180 
go to settings and then what you do is
you<00:04:26.080> go<00:04:26.349> to<00:04:26.789> CyanogenMod<00:04:27.789> settings<00:04:28.349> and<00:04:29.349> then

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
you go to CyanogenMod settings and then

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.830 
you go to CyanogenMod settings and then
you<00:04:30.490> should<00:04:30.820> have<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.449> performance<00:04:32.080> tab<00:04:32.889> and

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
you should have a performance tab and

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.200 
you should have a performance tab and
within<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:35.080> performance<00:04:35.770> tab<00:04:36.039> you<00:04:36.550> got<00:04:36.729> CPU

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
within that performance tab you got CPU

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.670 
within that performance tab you got CPU
settings<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.710> you<00:04:39.070> can<00:04:39.099> crank<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.669> up<00:04:39.789> -<00:04:40.680> well

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
settings and you can crank it up - well

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.480 
settings and you can crank it up - well
from<00:04:42.250> 5:28<00:04:42.909> mind<00:04:43.449> I<00:04:43.630> can<00:04:43.930> put<00:04:44.110> out<00:04:44.229> the<00:04:44.349> 768<00:04:45.250> and

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
from 5:28 mind I can put out the 768 and

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.270 
from 5:28 mind I can put out the 768 and
the<00:04:45.699> minimum<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.330> can<00:04:46.510> change<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.159> don't

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
the minimum you can change but you don't

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.200 
the minimum you can change but you don't
want<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.460> put<00:04:48.580> it<00:04:48.669> too<00:04:48.789> high<00:04:48.820> because<00:04:49.120> you

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
want to put it too high because you

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.460 
want to put it too high because you
don't<00:04:49.449> want<00:04:49.570> everything<00:04:50.169> running<00:04:50.380> too<00:04:50.650> hot

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
don't want everything running too hot

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.909 
don't want everything running too hot
yeah<00:04:53.470> so<00:04:54.270> well<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:56.020> reason<00:04:56.289> that<00:04:56.380> I<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:56.620> use

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
yeah so well the reason that I would use

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.180 
yeah so well the reason that I would use
that<00:04:57.510> CPU<00:04:58.510> overclocking<00:04:59.320> is<00:04:59.620> if<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.979> have<00:05:00.159> a

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
that CPU overclocking is if I have a

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.640 
that CPU overclocking is if I have a
game<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.639> I<00:05:00.669> want<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:00.909> play<00:05:01.080> or<00:05:02.080> an

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
game that I want to play or an

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.379 
game that I want to play or an
application<00:05:02.800> that<00:05:03.490> it's<00:05:03.729> just<00:05:03.940> not<00:05:04.090> fast

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
application that it's just not fast

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.540 
application that it's just not fast
enough<00:05:04.510> for<00:05:04.690> then<00:05:05.409> I'll<00:05:05.650> crank<00:05:05.889> up<00:05:06.099> the<00:05:06.280> CPU

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
enough for then I'll crank up the CPU

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.740 
enough for then I'll crank up the CPU
and<00:05:07.120> it<00:05:08.080> should<00:05:08.259> run<00:05:08.440> better<00:05:09.030> yeah<00:05:10.030> so<00:05:10.270> thanks

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
and it should run better yeah so thanks

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.090 
and it should run better yeah so thanks
