the Scorpion well that guy killed it but
it's<00:02:37.090> okay<00:02:37.390> but<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.470> pick<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:38.830> seat<00:02:39.070> with

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
it's okay but if you pick up seat with

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.400 
it's okay but if you pick up seat with
the<00:02:39.400> Amazon<00:02:39.910> i<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.780> hit<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.959> axe<00:02:41.290> down

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
the Amazon i actually hit the axe down

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.760 
the Amazon i actually hit the axe down
on<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.920> floor<00:02:42.130> when<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.120> her<00:02:43.480> case

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
on the floor when I do that for her case

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.840 
on the floor when I do that for her case
then<00:02:44.770> I<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:45.040> actually<00:02:45.280> start<00:02:45.459> me<00:02:45.670> laying

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
then I can actually start me laying

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.490 
then I can actually start me laying
really<00:02:46.120> quick<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.080> where<00:02:47.230> she<00:02:47.380> kind

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
really quick and this is where she kind

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900 
really quick and this is where she kind
of<00:02:47.590> shines<00:02:47.860> so<00:02:48.040> she<00:02:48.100> can<00:02:48.310> hit<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.490> big<00:02:48.730> Power

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
of shines so she can hit a big Power

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.699 
of shines so she can hit a big Power
Move<00:02:49.209> calm<00:02:49.660> boat<00:02:49.870> up<00:02:49.990> with<00:02:50.200> some<00:02:50.350> more<00:02:50.470> stuff

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
Move calm boat up with some more stuff

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.199 
Move calm boat up with some more stuff
and<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.070> think<00:02:51.310> this<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.520> also<00:02:51.670> similar<00:02:51.970> with

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
and I think this is also similar with

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.730 
and I think this is also similar with

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
the fighter and other melee classes such

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.550 
the fighter and other melee classes such
as<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:53.950> dwarf<00:02:54.160> as<00:02:54.340> well<00:02:54.490> yeah<00:02:55.150> so<00:02:55.720> with<00:02:56.230> this
