later has that extra beam just to get
covered<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.529> B<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.830> all<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.250> EDP<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
covered with that B is all about EDP is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.990 
covered with that B is all about EDP is

for months when it finally hit I says oh

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.910 
for months when it finally hit I says oh
you<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.959> came<00:03:11.170> in<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.350> mail<00:03:11.530> and<00:03:11.590> I<00:03:11.799> was

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
you know it came in the mail and I was

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.550 
you know it came in the mail and I was
so<00:03:12.040> excited<00:03:12.489> and<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.269> went<00:03:13.450> out<00:03:13.630> plugged<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.440> in

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
so excited and I went out plugged it in

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.640 
so excited and I went out plugged it in
so<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.829> light<00:03:15.070> came<00:03:15.280> on<00:03:15.420> then<00:03:16.420> I<00:03:16.450> had<00:03:16.840> figured

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
so the light came on then I had figured

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.430 
so the light came on then I had figured
out<00:03:17.890> that<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.820> not<00:03:19.120> even<00:03:19.390> going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.570> work<00:03:19.780> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
out that it's not even going to work the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.990 
out that it's not even going to work the
reason<00:03:20.769> why<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.070> doesn't<00:03:21.310> work<00:03:21.549> with<00:03:21.760> my

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
reason why it doesn't work with my

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.750 
reason why it doesn't work with my
system<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.600> because<00:03:22.870> it's<00:03:23.019> antiquated<00:03:23.400> so<00:03:24.400> if

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
system is because it's antiquated so if

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.720 
system is because it's antiquated so if
you<00:03:24.940> have<00:03:25.269> a<00:03:25.769> problem<00:03:26.769> such<00:03:27.040> as<00:03:27.070> I<00:03:27.310> had<00:03:27.519> where

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
you have a problem such as I had where

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.569 
you have a problem such as I had where
you<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> non<00:03:28.600> blade<00:03:29.079> system<00:03:29.829> ok<00:03:30.310> I'm<00:03:30.400> going

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
you have a non blade system ok I'm going

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.289 
you have a non blade system ok I'm going
back<00:03:30.820> to<00:03:31.000> the<00:03:31.090> blade<00:03:31.470> if<00:03:32.470> your<00:03:32.880> system<00:03:33.880> is<00:03:34.030> not

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
back to the blade if your system is not

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.650 
back to the blade if your system is not
played<00:03:34.570> compatible<00:03:35.260> that<00:03:35.500> car<00:03:36.340> link<00:03:36.609> is<00:03:37.329> not

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
played compatible that car link is not

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.360 
played compatible that car link is not
going<00:03:37.930> to<00:03:38.019> work<00:03:38.170> with<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.500> directly<00:03:38.739> and<00:03:39.160> make

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
going to work with it directly and make

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.190 
going to work with it directly and make
it<00:03:39.519> work<00:03:39.730> but<00:03:39.970> it'll<00:03:40.209> work<00:03:40.420> limited<00:03:40.989> in<00:03:41.049> one

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
it work but it'll work limited in one

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.990 
it work but it'll work limited in one
way<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:42.130> what's<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.459> point<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.820> having

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
way so really what's the point in having

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.120 
way so really what's the point in having
a<00:03:43.390> car<00:03:43.870> link<00:03:44.109> if<00:03:44.230> it<00:03:44.350> only<00:03:44.440> transmits<00:03:44.980> to<00:03:45.100> the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
a car link if it only transmits to the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.170 
a car link if it only transmits to the
car<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.489> it<00:03:45.549> doesn't<00:03:45.790> give<00:03:45.910> you<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.150> a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
car and it doesn't give you to a

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.610 
car and it doesn't give you to a
confirmation<00:03:46.480> -<00:03:47.320> E<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.560> pointless<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:49.620> you

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
confirmation - E is pointless so you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.800 
confirmation - E is pointless so you
know<00:03:50.739> with<00:03:51.040> with<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.489> new<00:03:51.609> up<00:03:51.820> phone<00:03:52.269> which
