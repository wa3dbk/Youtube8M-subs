 video card fans are not at all 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.980
 turns on and that means no load 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.320
 they make absolutely no noise 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.600
 only upon reaching a certain

 makes 165 you against 250 780 ti 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.940
 since the computer is not a playboy 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.860
 that RAM was installed 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.670
 so much that enough for most 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.250

 analogue of the same company with the interface 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.250
 the number of operations per second is also 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:50.150
 significantly more than a hundred thousand abs 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.370
 against 86,000 at the moment this one 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.250
 of the fastest solutions of this kind 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.979
 power supply class was selected with a margin 

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.700
 at 850 watts this is quality and 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.820
 relatively inexpensive corsair unit rm 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.960
 850 distinguished by its silence 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.729
 the fan does not turn on until it reaches 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.580
 40 percent
