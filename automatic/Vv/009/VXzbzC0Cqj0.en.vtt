applications but also to the content
inside<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> application<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:23.220> here<00:01:23.640> what<00:01:23.790> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
inside the application so here what you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.630 
inside the application so here what you
see<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.240> divided<00:01:24.750> into<00:01:24.840> three<00:01:25.290> layers<00:01:25.640> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
see it's divided into three layers the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520 
see it's divided into three layers the
first<00:01:26.880> layer<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.390> phone<00:01:27.780> which<00:01:27.990> has<00:01:28.229> an

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
first layer is the phone which has an

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
first layer is the phone which has an
access<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.040> all<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> fun<00:01:29.610> applications<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
access to all the fun applications so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.899 
access to all the fun applications so
just<00:01:30.810> by<00:01:31.020> swiping<00:01:31.350> my<00:01:31.680> finger<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.460> actually

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
just by swiping my finger i can actually

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.450 
just by swiping my finger i can actually
use<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.500> second<00:01:34.829> thing<00:01:34.920> in<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.189> diary

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
use it the second thing in the diary

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
use it the second thing in the diary
that<00:01:35.850> gives<00:01:36.540> me<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.810> access<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> all<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> PM

prediction<00:03:14.350> just<00:03:14.769> one<00:03:14.920> question<00:03:15.370> what<00:03:16.239> about

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
prediction just one question what about

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.470 
prediction just one question what about
the<00:03:16.690> support<00:03:17.290> did<00:03:17.709> languages<00:03:18.400> because<00:03:19.150> we're

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
the support did languages because we're

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.539 
the support did languages because we're
from<00:03:19.630> Hungary<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:21.130> would<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.370> problem

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
from Hungary and this would be a problem

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.009 
from Hungary and this would be a problem
for<00:03:21.760> us<00:03:21.910> we're<00:03:22.540> not<00:03:22.690> supporting

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
for us we're not supporting

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.270 
for us we're not supporting
unfortunately<00:03:23.709> we're<00:03:23.830> not<00:03:23.860> we're<00:03:24.250> not

supporting hungry right now we are

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.440 
supporting hungry right now we are
supporting<00:03:26.440> six<00:03:26.709> languages<00:03:27.100> were<00:03:27.450> supporting

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
supporting six languages were supporting

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.809 
supporting six languages were supporting
French<00:03:29.110> Italian<00:03:29.799> German

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
Spanish and Russian and of course

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.599 
Spanish and Russian and of course
English<00:03:33.280> which<00:03:33.519> is<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.269> default<00:03:35.249> so<00:03:36.249> this<00:03:36.489> is

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
English which is the default so this is

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.179 
English which is the default so this is
a<00:03:36.939> qwerty<00:03:37.749> keyboard<00:03:38.139> of<00:03:38.349> course<00:03:38.680> adapted

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 
a qwerty keyboard of course adapted

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.390 
a qwerty keyboard of course adapted
to<00:03:39.219> all<00:03:39.489> those<00:03:39.670> languages<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:41.349> even<00:03:42.310> though

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
to all those languages so even though

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.759 
to all those languages so even though
it's<00:03:42.579> pretty<00:03:42.849> much<00:03:43.030> small<00:03:43.389> i<00:03:43.689> can<00:03:44.590> actually

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
it's pretty much small i can actually

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.410 
it's pretty much small i can actually
the<00:03:45.040> prediction<00:03:45.609> even<00:03:45.819> though<00:03:45.969> i<00:03:45.999> didn't

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
the prediction even though i didn't

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.420 
the prediction even though i didn't
accurately<00:03:46.629> pressed<00:03:47.349> on<00:03:47.560> specific<00:03:48.069> letters

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
accurately pressed on specific letters

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.990 
accurately pressed on specific letters
it<00:03:49.260> allows<00:03:50.260> me<00:03:50.469> to<00:03:50.620> choose<00:03:50.889> from<00:03:51.790> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
it allows me to choose from the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.030 
it allows me to choose from the
suggested<00:03:52.870> words<00:03:53.200> here<00:03:53.349> so<00:03:53.560> it's<00:03:53.709> very<00:03:53.889> very

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
suggested words here so it's very very

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.309 
suggested words here so it's very very
easy<00:03:55.200> ok<00:03:57.209> stuff<00:03:58.209> like<00:03:58.389> and<00:03:58.569> when<00:03:59.200> you<00:03:59.290> have

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
easy ok stuff like and when you have

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.729 
easy ok stuff like and when you have
here<00:03:59.650> also<00:03:59.859> the<00:04:00.189> magnifier<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.290> you<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.499> at

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
here also the magnifier and you have at

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.690 
here also the magnifier and you have at
the<00:04:02.859> top<00:04:03.099> when<00:04:03.310> you're<00:04:04.829> going<00:04:05.829> up<00:04:06.129> you<00:04:06.340> can<00:04:06.519> see

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
the top when you're going up you can see

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.220 
the top when you're going up you can see
also<00:04:06.969> the<00:04:07.090> number<00:04:07.209> again<00:04:07.450> when<00:04:07.719> i'm<00:04:07.840> releasing

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
also the number again when i'm releasing

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.159 
also the number again when i'm releasing
my<00:04:08.650> finger<00:04:09.069> the<00:04:09.969> action<00:04:10.329> of<00:04:10.419> course<00:04:10.689> so

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
my finger the action of course so

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.670 
my finger the action of course so
everything<00:04:11.590> in<00:04:11.859> their<00:04:12.040> life
