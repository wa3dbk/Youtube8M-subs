really full-out

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.110

so<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.110> don't<00:04:41.380> mark<00:04:41.740> at<00:04:41.890> all<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.700> whole<00:04:42.850> time

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.370 
and that can help when I'm going to
speed<00:04:57.670> it<00:04:57.700> up<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.150> keep<00:04:58.300> everything<00:04:58.630> clean<00:04:59.110> as

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
I'm getting the speed for those of you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.290 
I'm getting the speed for those of you
that<00:05:02.080> might<00:05:02.800> not<00:05:02.830> be<00:05:03.070> taking<00:05:03.610> class<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.180> maybe

that might not be taking class and maybe
are<00:05:04.480> learning<00:05:04.900> from<00:05:05.170> our<00:05:05.290> tutorials<00:05:05.920> we<00:05:06.070> get<00:05:06.970> a

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
are learning from our tutorials we get a

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.610 
are learning from our tutorials we get a

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
lot of comments that are like I couldn't

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.770 
lot of comments that are like I couldn't
learn<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:09.010> in<00:05:09.130> ten<00:05:09.370> minutes<00:05:09.550> when<00:05:10.360> we<00:05:10.630> don't

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
learn it in ten minutes when we don't

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.150 
learn it in ten minutes when we don't
really<00:05:10.900> make<00:05:11.140> the<00:05:11.260> tutorials<00:05:11.740> so<00:05:11.890> that<00:05:12.040> you

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
really make the tutorials so that you

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.010 
really make the tutorials so that you
can<00:05:12.340> watch<00:05:12.550> it<00:05:12.790> one<00:05:12.970> time<00:05:13.210> and<00:05:13.510> learn<00:05:13.660> them

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
can watch it one time and learn them

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.750 
can watch it one time and learn them
most<00:05:14.410> of<00:05:14.590> those<00:05:14.710> routines<00:05:15.160> are<00:05:15.400> things<00:05:15.640> that

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
most of those routines are things that

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.960 
most of those routines are things that
we<00:05:16.540> taught<00:05:16.810> in<00:05:17.020> LA<00:05:17.350> around<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.190> country<00:05:18.700> in

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
we taught in LA around the country in

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.210 
we taught in LA around the country in
hours<00:05:19.840> sometimes<00:05:20.080> even<00:05:20.530> any<00:05:20.650> power<00:05:20.950> and<00:05:21.160> a

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
hours sometimes even any power and a

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.670 
hours sometimes even any power and a
half<00:05:21.400> class<00:05:21.730> so<00:05:22.090> we<00:05:22.420> do<00:05:22.630> them<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:22.930> 15<00:05:23.110> minutes

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
half class so we do them in 15 minutes

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.430 
half class so we do them in 15 minutes
but<00:05:24.040> you<00:05:24.460> have<00:05:24.670> to<00:05:24.820> go<00:05:24.970> back<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.600> watch<00:05:26.140> them

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
but you have to go back and watch them

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.560 
but you have to go back and watch them
several<00:05:26.950> times<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:27.550> go<00:05:27.700> over<00:05:27.910> each<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.270> count

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
several times and go over each a count

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.110 
several times and go over each a count
individually<00:05:29.230> when<00:05:29.620> it<00:05:29.740> gets<00:05:29.920> faster<00:05:30.220> you

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
individually when it gets faster you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.000 
individually when it gets faster you
have<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.540> dance<00:05:31.720> full<00:05:32.020> out<00:05:32.140> you<00:05:32.410> can't<00:05:32.710> dance

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
have to dance full out you can't dance

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.310 
have to dance full out you can't dance
sloppy<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:33.850> be<00:05:34.030> fast<00:05:34.330> at<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:34.750> same<00:05:34.780> time<00:05:35.170> you

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
sloppy and be fast at the same time you

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.470 
sloppy and be fast at the same time you
have<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.500> dance<00:05:35.770> really<00:05:36.160> strong<00:05:36.460> so<00:05:36.790> make<00:05:37.300> sure
