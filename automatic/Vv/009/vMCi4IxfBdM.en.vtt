00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.230
 hello, I am oscar quintero instructor 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.330
 national technical for the brand of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.560
 Chinese trucks and buses distributed by 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.560
 praco didacol colombia 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.230
 today we are going to talk about how to 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.810
 operation of nine boxes 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.040
 speeds milestones 61 09 and 82 09 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:01.530
 assembled in our hino trucks 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:01.530
 the 500 series for the fg ph and fm models 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.420
 the boxes where nine speeds 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.180
 they handle a high and low range pattern 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.890
 that we will write below the range 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.830
 low will activate when the switch 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.990
 of the lever move down and it 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.350
 will light the indicator on the board 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.390
 instruments with the figure of the turtle 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.159
 the high range will be activated when the 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.250
 lever switch move towards 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:29.020
 up and the indicator on the 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.479
 instrument panel with the figure of 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.190
 the hare on the lever we find 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.740
 the diagram with the change pattern of 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.649
 the box has seen the shaded areas 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.390
 with black color correspond to the 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.899
 marches that we will apply with the rank 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.869
 low or torture and the areas that appear 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:50.270
 in light color correspond to the controls 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.210
 that we will apply in high aller 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.079
 the reverse function should be used 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:59.869
 in the low range or turtle like the 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.780
 super march or great first that should be 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.149
 use only for extreme conditions like 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.620
 Mud char pus or steep earrings 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.780
 with enough cardboard 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.030
 for a correct operation of the street 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.760
 and so nine-speed will we make the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.430
 next way we confirm first the 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.080
 neutral position of the lever and the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.350
 command switch is in the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.300
 low range 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.490
 we learned the clutch pedal until the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.700
 background and we start the sequence of 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.700
 marches from first to fourth speed 1a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.600
 is the world 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.810
 third 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.390
 and fourth 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.130
 to pass the fourth fifth we oppress 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.380
 again the clutch pedal up 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.500
 the bottom and we raise the switch 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.960
 command to change high range 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.690
 we started the change sequence of the 5th 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:59.320
 8a 5a 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.450
 sixth seventh and eighth speed for 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.240
 reduce the gears we will apply the same 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.700
 operation but in descending 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.700
 seventh sixth 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.849
 together 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.230
 we wrote the clutch pedal up 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.560
 the background and we change rank high range 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.790
 Pub 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.060
 4a 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.819
 third 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.819
 second the first 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.230
 it is very important to take into account the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.410
 following precautions to avoid 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.690
 future damage to our gearbox 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:40.080
 when changing the low range selection 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.570
 high or high down the speed of 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.990
 vehicle must be less than or equal to 30 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.360
 kilometers per hour we should never move 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.180
 with the range selector lever 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.140
 changes in neutral position while the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.140
 vehicle is moving 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.160
 all right 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.050
 It is important that you remember the 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.140
 following points during the operation 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.170
 from your box and 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.330
 1 press the clutch pedal until the 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.340
 background whenever you are going to make a 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:14.300
 Gear shift as it is a box 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:17.090
 Fully synchronized 2 provided that 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.579
 is going to be a change of rank under high 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.130
 or vice versa the speed of the vehicle 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:24.620
 must be less than or equal to 30 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.840
 kilometers per hour do not forget that in the 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.090
 life of your box and your trips 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:33.130
 depends directly on the way 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:33.130
 management and operation of the ebro
