00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello to all this distribution is not a school 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.480
 times tartar pokerstars official school 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.150
 my name is this fury I am an appraiser 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 hands and coach for a multi-layered tournament in 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.250
 this school today we will disassemble 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.550
 sent to pokerstarter users 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.600
 distribution of the hand analysis section and we will 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.109
 disassemble it on bluff three 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.269
 a barrel 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.140
 i.e. bluff 3 flop bets 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:32.189
 black hole so we start we were given 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 dissident unsuited we open up 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.770
 worth adding so what exactly 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.350
 meaning bluff 3 bar or consists precisely in 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.300
 that we will see why 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.879
 situation is beneficial in order to 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.530
 put the bluff third barrel they 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.969
 because just bluffing 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 opened ready and got wrought little 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.640
 smooth in this situation, it is important to evaluate 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.410
 Spector call opponent given that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 opponent calls the small blind more often 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.629
 the whole spectrum seeks his hands 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 pocket pairs and tongue with hands somehow 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.159
 strong broadway combinations sometimes 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.770
 some kind of strong connector especially 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.770
 if it's a weak player then range and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.000
 vocals can be even wider here we are 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.759
 got this school 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.110
 king high that is a flop with a king and 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:29.430
 the situation is already good because what he 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.509
 such a board we need quite often 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.460
 knock out aix hands and lowest 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.740
 pocket pairs but it will happen 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.630
 not yourself, and yet your opponent is small 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.140
 the blinds play against the cats and our 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 spectrum 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.360
 for the opponent is also expanded in his eyes 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.540
 so more often than not we will have here 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280
 He therefore put that is unlikely we 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.200
 let's confine ourselves to one barrel at a time 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.829
 only on the flop that is to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.920
 knock out 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.509
 here aces xc combinations pocket pairs 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.869
 It will take at least my opinion on 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.399
 morality 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.040
 especially if you come by when and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.719
 suitable cards on the turn he also we 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.829
 we will put it unsuitable for that 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.290
 to kill that sex 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.179
 and usually aces circle the spectrum 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.179
 Opponent quite a lot of combinations 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.209
 so we bet the flop and as I have 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.510
 spoke to the actors the opponent continues 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.470
 to call well besides on the fleet still 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.300
 there is a possible flush draw 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.519
 Now you need to understand how what hands 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.319
 aspects remain and opponent on river 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.239
 after we set twice 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.760
 by their actions narrowed Spector 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.640
 opponent and pay attention to what 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.709
 one of the nicest cards came out at home 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.959
 so that we can bluff and 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.700
 the third bar when i it turns out 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.799
 opponent's spectrum remained only to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.590
 video from the hand counting ex because 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:52.410
 they would manifest themselves because it is also 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.590
 the flush draw on the board would not show 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.970
 yourself on the flop or on the turn so 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:04.620
 opponent here the range of hands consists of to 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.700
 roller servants they drove flush draw ladies 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.170
 x hands who least flush draw and 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.190
 handheld school desks fours building 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.959
 sevens eight nine also have 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.870
 some flush draws that didn't get there 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.190
 there is for example there 10 years 79 another 89 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.780
 thatâ€™s why we should now 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.380
 calculate count 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.359
 combinations it is clear that in the game it will be 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.590
 strength is hard but during the analysis of the hands we 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:37.200
 we can after the game session we can 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.260
 much faster to do such calculations in 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.310
 head 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.860
 rather you and so it turns out that we 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:51.060
 we put 3 well the third barrel it is clear he 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.850
 should be let's say the size of the bet should 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.160
 be such that the opponent did not want to 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.380
 hide us that is rather big and 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.310
 small because big bet more often 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:04.080
 will opponent more often will doubt 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.510
 that we have some kind of strong arm 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.210
 there is but we can somehow make a mistake with 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.210
 bet size and give your opponent 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:14.940
 some extra information box 2 800 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.800
 in general she is practically without 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.700
 informative that is a little more than 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.739
 floor bank and 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:25.290
 something they can not say for him 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:28.320
 such here and we found the rate we generate 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.220
 34 percent fold equity is so much 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.430
 fold equity we need to have against 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:38.010
 opponent's range ie how many hands 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.440
 he probably folds this case 2 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.620
 800 divided by 8,145 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.750
 this is 3 by 4 percent i.e. 34 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.270
 percent need to have at least for 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.640
 that our bluff was math 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.370
 with math with zero math 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.890
 waiting turns out and we 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.780
 but I already counted the amount before the distribution 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.840
 opponent combinations in special 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.700
 program and I can say how much 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.190
 combinations we can reset 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.870
 that is, from its total 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:10.050
 combinations that were on the river 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.930
 81 combination we can reset 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.630
 37 combinations, that is , we divide the matrix 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.380
 at 81 and it turns out that the actual 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.730
 fold equity 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:23.460
 we have 45.6 percent this 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:28.410
 means this is the proportion of the hands of the opponent spectrum 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:32.780
 which with which he is on the river with a very 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:35.520
 high probability of parting as 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:40.600
 there was a nasty card on the river as a whole 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.970
 we show quite strong actions 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:47.380
 this is how we are 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.270
 found that a third of 3 bluff rate 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.860
 here will have a positive 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.930
 expectation and in general 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.530
 quite successfully at a distance we 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:59.080
 reach more often ended opponent 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.630
 threw out his hand that is, we hit like 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.580
 once in that part of the spectrum with which he 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:07.350
 ready to part 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.350
 the analysis is over all the successes found
