summertime occasionally some poison ivy
or<00:01:23.570> something<00:01:24.440> will<00:01:24.650> sprout<00:01:25.010> up<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:34.750> roughly

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750

at<00:01:36.050> night<00:01:36.200> my<00:01:36.380> 10<00:01:36.620> foot<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.040> tarp<00:01:37.280> that<00:01:37.340> I<00:01:37.580> can

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
at night my 10 foot in tarp that I can

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.390 
at night my 10 foot in tarp that I can
find<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:38.180> it<00:01:38.270> came<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.600> these<00:01:38.720> two<00:01:38.960> bunches

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
find and it came with these two bunches

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.700 
find and it came with these two bunches
which<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.610> really<00:01:41.060> handy<00:01:41.240> because<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:42.110> you<00:01:42.560> can

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
which is really handy because it you can

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.470 
which is really handy because it you can
roll<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.040> up<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:43.280> keep<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:46.460> sized<00:01:46.850> up<00:01:47.240> it

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
roll it up and keep it all sized up it

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.530 
roll it up and keep it all sized up it
easy<00:01:47.840> to<00:01:48.080> grab<00:01:48.350> it<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:48.800> everything<00:01:49.540> here's

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
easy to grab it and everything here's

underneath<00:01:53.150> the<00:01:53.420> tree<00:01:53.690> now<00:01:54.620> the<00:01:55.610> reason<00:01:55.970> that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
underneath the tree now the reason that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.210 
underneath the tree now the reason that
I<00:01:56.180> started<00:01:56.630> doing<00:01:56.720> this<00:01:57.020> was<00:01:57.470> basically<00:01:57.770> to

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
I started doing this was basically to

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.720 
I started doing this was basically to
keep<00:01:58.400> my<00:01:58.550> rope<00:01:58.870> clean<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.250> also<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.550> I

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
keep my rope clean and also like I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.490 
keep my rope clean and also like I
mentioned<00:02:01.760> earlier<00:02:02.350> occasionally<00:02:03.350> you'll

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
mentioned earlier occasionally you'll

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.920 
mentioned earlier occasionally you'll
have<00:02:04.030> poison<00:02:05.030> ivy<00:02:05.120> or<00:02:05.390> something<00:02:05.720> on<00:02:05.840> the
