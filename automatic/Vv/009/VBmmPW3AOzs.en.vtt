feature them in my videos and the fact

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.950 
feature them in my videos and the fact
of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> matter<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> some<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> rides

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
of the matter is that some of the rides

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.200 
of the matter is that some of the rides
that<00:00:46.200> would<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.649> number<00:00:46.980> seven<00:00:47.370> number<00:00:47.820> ten

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that would be number seven number ten

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.420 
that would be number seven number ten
whatever<00:00:48.750> are<00:00:49.170> some<00:00:49.590> parks<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.160> simply

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
whatever are some parks that simply

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
whatever are some parks that simply
don't<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.940> enough<00:00:51.120> attention<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.289> I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
don't get enough attention and so I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.080 
don't get enough attention and so I
don't<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.739> enough<00:00:53.010> images<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.820> feature

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
don't have enough images to feature

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
don't have enough images to feature
those<00:00:54.420> rides<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.260> video<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.039> instead<00:00:56.190> of

those rides in the video so instead of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.729 
those rides in the video so instead of

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
having an incomplete video I have simply

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.040 
having an incomplete video I have simply
shortened<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> make<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> top<00:01:00.180> five<00:01:00.570> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the renegade at Valley Fair in Minnesota

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.899 
the renegade at Valley Fair in Minnesota

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this was the last new coaster that

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
this was the last new coaster that
Valleyfair<00:01:12.479> added<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.229> added<00:01:13.500> in

Valleyfair added and it was added in
2007<00:01:14.460> what's<00:01:15.240> cool<00:01:15.390> about<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.750> ride<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
2007 what's cool about this ride is that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.899 
2007 what's cool about this ride is that
it<00:01:16.350> really<00:01:16.500> interacts<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.490> terrain<00:01:17.880> of

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
it really interacts with the terrain of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.060 
it really interacts with the terrain of
the<00:01:18.090> park<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:19.140> goes<00:01:19.290> out<00:01:19.470> through<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the park and it goes out through the

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.920 
the park and it goes out through the
trees<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.210> hard<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> get

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
trees and so it's really hard to get

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.380 
trees and so it's really hard to get
images<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.740> video<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.490> ride<00:01:23.759> because<00:01:24.360> a

ten and if prowl is in the top ten then

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.320 
ten and if prowl is in the top ten then
you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.209> expect<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> next<00:02:12.870> week

about<00:02:25.540> this<00:02:25.810> coaster<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.830> entire

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
about this coaster is that the entire

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.720 
about this coaster is that the entire
first<00:02:27.610> drop<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:27.990> enclosed<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.470> massive<00:02:30.280> tunnel

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
first drop is enclosed a massive tunnel

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.970 
first drop is enclosed a massive tunnel
encompasses<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:32.170> was<00:02:32.260> initially<00:02:32.590> done

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
encompasses it that was initially done

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.580 
encompasses it that was initially done
so<00:02:33.340> that<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.610> wouldn't<00:02:33.940> make<00:02:34.030> as<00:02:34.270> much<00:02:34.510> noise

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
so that it wouldn't make as much noise

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.020 
so that it wouldn't make as much noise
however<00:02:35.590> really<00:02:35.890> as<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.550> ride<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.880> makes

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
however really as to the ride it makes

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.940 
however really as to the ride it makes
it<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.210> lot<00:02:37.420> more<00:02:37.570> unique<00:02:38.050> as<00:02:38.320> far<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:38.890> know

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
it a lot more unique as far as I know

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.040 
it a lot more unique as far as I know
this<00:02:39.250> is<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> only<00:02:39.640> wooden<00:02:40.150> coaster<00:02:40.600> to<00:02:40.810> do

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.110 
this is the only wooden coaster to do
that<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.530> believe<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.040> tunnel<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.490> also<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
that I believe this tunnel is also the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.510 
that I believe this tunnel is also the
longest<00:02:43.390> tunnel<00:02:43.960> on<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> roller<00:02:44.800> coaster<00:02:44.920> this

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520

is a really fast GCI lots of bank turns
it's<00:02:49.870> really<00:02:50.440> cool<00:02:50.710> number<00:02:51.310> two<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.820> the

feature a station fly by that means that

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.680 
feature a station fly by that means that
the<00:02:59.590> coaster<00:02:59.980> actually<00:03:00.430> enters<00:03:00.940> the<00:03:01.300> station

the<00:03:51.160> United<00:03:51.520> States<00:03:51.760> and<00:03:51.940> probably<00:03:52.180> one<00:03:52.690> of

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
the United States and probably one of
