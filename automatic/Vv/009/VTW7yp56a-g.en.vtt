00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
teaspoon or so into each mold and just

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.069 
teaspoon or so into each mold and just
wipe<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.729> sides<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.450> it's<00:02:06.570> nice

want<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.190> sort<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.430> release<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.660> seal<00:02:33.990> around

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
want to sort of release that seal around

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.950 
want to sort of release that seal around
each<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.210> just<00:02:36.210> pop<00:02:36.420> them<00:02:36.630> out<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.900> you

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
and that's going to form the basis for

half circles out I just like to sit them

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.760 
half circles out I just like to sit them
back<00:02:45.660> in<00:02:45.900> there<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.650> give

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
back in there and that's just to give

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.560 
back in there and that's just to give
them<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.130> bit<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> support<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.390> we're

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
pressure because we don't actually want

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.820 
pressure because we don't actually want
to<00:03:47.580> squeeze<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:48.000> candy<00:03:48.360> melt<00:03:48.540> into<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.530> sort

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
on top so it's going to hold that

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.660 
on top so it's going to hold that
unmelted<00:03:55.470> melt<00:03:55.860> in<00:03:56.010> place<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.430> give<00:03:56.520> us<00:03:56.580> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
nice flat bottom so I'm going to squeeze

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.060 
nice flat bottom so I'm going to squeeze
once<00:03:59.700> all<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.180> way<00:04:00.300> around<00:04:00.860> without<00:04:01.860> putting

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
once all the way around without putting

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.070 
once all the way around without putting
too<00:04:02.310> much<00:04:02.400> pressure<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:03.030> then<00:04:03.720> I'm<00:04:03.840> not

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
too much pressure and then I'm not

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.900 
too much pressure and then I'm not
squeezing<00:04:04.530> now<00:04:04.860> I'm<00:04:05.070> just<00:04:05.280> taking<00:04:05.670> the<00:04:05.730> bag

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
squeezing now I'm just taking the bag

squeezing now I'm just taking the bag
just<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.240> level<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.690> all<00:04:06.810> off<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.320> I'm<00:04:07.800> just

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
just to level it all off so I'm just

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.160 
just to level it all off so I'm just
sort<00:04:08.220> of<00:04:08.280> redistributing<00:04:09.150> that<00:04:09.540> chocolate<00:04:09.990> so

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170

it<00:04:10.260> goes<00:04:10.380> right<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.920> edges<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.790> that<00:04:11.880> silicon

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it goes right the edges of that silicon

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.020 
it goes right the edges of that silicon
mould<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.230> then<00:04:13.800> kind<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.459> bring<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.700> in<00:04:14.940> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
mould and then kind of bring it in a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.760 
mould and then kind of bring it in a
little<00:04:15.240> bit<00:04:15.330> over<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.780> unmelted<00:04:16.170> melt<00:04:16.590> and

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
little bit over the unmelted melt and

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.320 
little bit over the unmelted melt and
that's<00:04:17.310> going<00:04:17.520> to<00:04:17.580> give<00:04:17.670> us<00:04:17.790> that<00:04:17.910> really<00:04:18.090> nice

and<00:04:58.960> sealing<00:04:59.350> it<00:04:59.440> up<00:05:02.850> for<00:05:03.850> this<00:05:03.970> fun<00:05:04.240> you<00:05:04.480> want

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
and sealing it up for this fun you want

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.240 
and sealing it up for this fun you want
to<00:05:04.780> cut<00:05:04.930> off<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.260> little<00:05:05.290> bit<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.680> a<00:05:05.830> smaller

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
to cut off a little bit of a smaller

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.950 
to cut off a little bit of a smaller
corner<00:05:06.790> than<00:05:06.940> what<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.210> did<00:05:07.390> for<00:05:07.420> the<00:05:07.720> other

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
corner than what you did for the other

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.430 
corner than what you did for the other
bag<00:05:08.500> so<00:05:09.340> it's<00:05:09.910> quite<00:05:10.120> small<00:05:10.570> quite<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:11.230> bit

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
bag so it's quite small quite a bit

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.350 
bag so it's quite small quite a bit
smaller<00:05:11.740> and<00:05:11.950> when<00:05:12.490> I<00:05:12.550> squeeze<00:05:13.000> it<00:05:13.150> out<00:05:13.270> you

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
smaller and when I squeeze it out you

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.090 
smaller and when I squeeze it out you
can<00:05:13.510> see<00:05:13.540> there<00:05:13.900> that's<00:05:14.050> about<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.530> size<00:05:14.710> line

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
can see there that's about the size line

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.460 
can see there that's about the size line
that<00:05:15.340> we're<00:05:15.460> getting<00:05:15.550> out<00:05:15.850> of<00:05:16.000> it<00:05:16.120> now<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:17.320> do

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
that we're getting out of it now to do

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.500 
that we're getting out of it now to do
our<00:05:17.590> main<00:05:18.040> body<00:05:18.520> line<00:05:18.790> and<00:05:18.940> this<00:05:19.030> is<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.240> first

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
our main body line and this is the first

our main body line and this is the first
thing<00:05:19.660> we're<00:05:19.810> going<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.990> do<00:05:20.110> it's<00:05:20.620> better<00:05:20.950> off

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
thing we're going to do it's better off

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.920 
thing we're going to do it's better off
if<00:05:21.340> you<00:05:21.400> don't<00:05:21.580> try<00:05:21.790> to<00:05:21.850> be<00:05:22.060> too<00:05:22.300> precise<00:05:22.690> the

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
if you don't try to be too precise the

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:24.900 
if you don't try to be too precise the
slower<00:05:23.260> you<00:05:23.500> go<00:05:23.680> the<00:05:23.710> wobbler<00:05:24.340> it's<00:05:24.520> going<00:05:24.790> to

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
slower you go the wobbler it's going to

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.790 
slower you go the wobbler it's going to
be<00:05:25.060> so<00:05:25.630> turn<00:05:25.840> it<00:05:25.870> onto<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:26.290> side<00:05:26.500> that<00:05:26.680> you

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 
be so turn it onto the side that you

be so turn it onto the side that you
want<00:05:26.830> I<00:05:27.130> want<00:05:27.340> the<00:05:27.430> head<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.700> go<00:05:27.970> here<00:05:28.390> to<00:05:28.600> cover

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
want I want the head to go here to cover

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.510 
want I want the head to go here to cover
up<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.050> little<00:05:29.290> air<00:05:29.410> pocket<00:05:29.800> so<00:05:30.250> I'm<00:05:30.370> going

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
up that little air pocket so I'm going

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.820 
up that little air pocket so I'm going
to<00:05:30.580> go<00:05:30.670> across<00:05:30.880> like<00:05:31.180> this<00:05:31.540> whenever<00:05:32.200> we<00:05:32.530> paint

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
to go across like this whenever we paint

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.440 
to go across like this whenever we paint
on<00:05:33.070> chocolate<00:05:33.490> or<00:05:33.670> whenever<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:33.970> pipe<00:05:34.270> on

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
on chocolate or whenever I pipe on

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.630 
on chocolate or whenever I pipe on
anything<00:05:34.660> I<00:05:34.960> try<00:05:35.230> to<00:05:35.290> start<00:05:36.280> about<00:05:36.490> a

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
anything I try to start about a

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.760 
anything I try to start about a
centimeter<00:05:37.090> or<00:05:37.210> so<00:05:37.270> before<00:05:37.990> and<00:05:38.230> finish<00:05:38.590> about

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
centimeter or so before and finish about

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.100 
centimeter or so before and finish about
a<00:05:38.830> centimeter<00:05:39.250> or<00:05:39.340> so<00:05:39.430> after<00:05:39.940> kind<00:05:40.480> of<00:05:40.630> stops

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
a centimeter or so after kind of stops

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.020 
a centimeter or so after kind of stops
me<00:05:41.260> getting<00:05:41.530> speed<00:05:41.920> wobbles<00:05:42.370> along<00:05:42.700> the<00:05:42.880> way

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.030 
me getting speed wobbles along the way

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
me getting speed wobbles along the way
so<00:05:43.900> I'm<00:05:44.380> just<00:05:44.740> going<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.070> start<00:05:45.850> squeezing

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
so I'm just going to start squeezing

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.650 
so I'm just going to start squeezing
straight<00:05:47.620> across<00:05:47.800> look<00:05:48.610> at<00:05:48.760> that<00:05:48.910> the<00:05:49.300> slower

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
straight across look at that the slower

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.780 
straight across look at that the slower
you<00:05:49.870> go<00:05:49.900> as<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:50.470> said<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.950> more<00:05:51.250> likely<00:05:51.640> you<00:05:51.730> are

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
you go as I said the more likely you are

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:53.820 
you go as I said the more likely you are
to<00:05:51.880> get<00:05:52.090> speed<00:05:52.330> wobbles<00:05:52.690> pick<00:05:53.410> it<00:05:53.530> straight<00:05:53.800> up

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
to get speed wobbles pick it straight up

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.950 
to get speed wobbles pick it straight up
turn<00:05:54.820> it<00:05:54.880> around<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.510> you've<00:05:55.690> got<00:05:55.810> that

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
turn it around and you've got that

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.750 
turn it around and you've got that
beautiful<00:05:56.200> straight<00:05:56.710> line<00:05:56.890> and<00:05:57.400> take<00:05:57.550> it<00:05:57.670> from

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
beautiful straight line and take it from

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.000 
beautiful straight line and take it from
me<00:05:57.910> I'm<00:05:58.090> not<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.360> best<00:05:58.510> piper<00:05:58.930> so<00:05:59.260> it's<00:05:59.650> it's

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
me I'm not the best piper so it's it's

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.980 
me I'm not the best piper so it's it's
pretty<00:06:00.280> easy<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:01.150> get<00:06:01.270> a<00:06:01.300> straight<00:06:01.600> line<00:06:01.810> if

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
pretty easy to get a straight line if

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.410 
pretty easy to get a straight line if
you<00:06:02.080> do<00:06:02.170> it<00:06:02.290> that<00:06:02.440> way<00:06:02.940> now<00:06:03.940> you<00:06:03.970> want<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.270> take

you do it that way now you want to take

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.020 
you do it that way now you want to take
