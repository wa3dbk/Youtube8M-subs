00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of one thing that the size of images

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.230 
of one thing that the size of images
used<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.969> comparison<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:04.379> same<00:01:05.240> let's

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
used for comparison is the same let's

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.889 
used for comparison is the same let's
now<00:01:06.780> add<00:01:07.790> two<00:01:08.790> images

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.819 

that<00:01:15.899> will<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:17.670> before<00:01:17.880> after<00:01:18.240> images<00:01:18.869> for

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
that will be the before after images for

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:27.109 
that will be the before after images for
comparison<00:01:21.500> ensure<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.679> sizes<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:25.939> upload<00:01:26.939> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
comparison ensure the sizes and upload a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:36.370 
comparison ensure the sizes and upload a
set<00:01:31.429> so<00:01:32.429> now<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:33.179> one<00:01:33.659> set<00:01:33.929> of<00:01:34.140> two<00:01:35.069> images

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
set so now we have one set of two images

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:44.359 
set so now we have one set of two images
let's<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:38.039> the<00:01:38.189> same<00:01:38.429> for<00:01:39.979> another<00:01:40.979> set<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:43.369> will

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
let's do the same for another set I will

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.050 
let's do the same for another set I will
show<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:45.590> it<00:01:46.590> fast<00:01:47.250> forward<00:01:49.759> similar<00:01:50.759> steps

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
show it it fast forward similar steps

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.819 
show it it fast forward similar steps
repeated<00:01:51.539> and<00:01:53.750> here<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.929> have<00:01:55.140> two<00:01:55.619> sets<00:01:57.829> to

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
repeated and here we have two sets to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.609 
repeated and here we have two sets to
include<00:01:59.489> in<00:01:59.789> one<00:02:00.000> slider<00:02:02.929> here<00:02:03.929> you<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.259> the
