pretty<00:03:01.640> nice<00:03:01.940> lens<00:03:02.270> on<00:03:02.510> the<00:03:02.570> front<00:03:02.600> here<00:03:03.110> this

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
pretty nice lens on the front here this

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.410 
pretty nice lens on the front here this
is<00:03:04.070> what<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.220> initially<00:03:04.880> broke<00:03:05.180> at<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
is what I initially broke at the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.270 
is what I initially broke at the
beginning<00:03:05.750> because<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.680> actually<00:03:06.950> fell<00:03:07.130> from

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
beginning because it actually fell from

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.900 
beginning because it actually fell from
a<00:03:07.340> tripod<00:03:07.670> and<00:03:08.240> hit<00:03:08.600> the<00:03:08.690> ground<00:03:08.990> and

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
a tripod and hit the ground and

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.790 
a tripod and hit the ground and
shattered<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.060> pins<00:03:11.360> holding<00:03:11.810> in<00:03:11.990> there<00:03:12.200> so

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
shattered the pins holding in there so

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.380 
shattered the pins holding in there so
kind<00:03:13.100> of<00:03:13.190> something<00:03:13.490> to<00:03:13.640> watch<00:03:13.790> out<00:03:14.060> for<00:03:14.090> I

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
kind of something to watch out for I

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.500 
kind of something to watch out for I
guess<00:03:15.580> so<00:03:16.580> as<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.790> can<00:03:16.880> see<00:03:16.940> here<00:03:17.300> we've<00:03:17.480> got
