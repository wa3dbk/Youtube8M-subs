 very good androids today we have with 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.480
 us a product from the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.480
 Auque dotcom company is about this 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.420
 bluetooth speaker one speaker or the 20 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.150
 023 it is a 5 watt speaker 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.890
 we can play music to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.320
 through bluetooth with our 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.779
 mobile device or through a cable 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.850
 of jack of 3 5 millimeters 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 we go with the unboxing and review of this 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:34.920
 device we start this video 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.410
 Unpacking the product comes in 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.260
 a box then a good presentation of 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.090
 this we can not complain we cover them 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.070
 is this little cap and we 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.770
 we found with another cardboard box what 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.989
 we open this part and we already uncover and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 we are in the foreground with the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.980
 loudspeaker tucked into a small bag you 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.140
 let's leave here for 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.379
 we removed this small stage of cardboard 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.079
 we are in one of the buildings 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.539
 a bag with a jack jack cable 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.390
 3.5 millimeters and the other cable is treated 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.210
 of a micro web usb cable 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.650
 to be able to charge this speaker for another 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.900
 side we find a small 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.810
 instruction manual in which we are going 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.210
 to have a quick guide to use for this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 speaker let's go with a speaker that 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.060
 is what really interests us we are going to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.060
 check out is over here 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.180
 and we removed the sachet from the speaker 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.580
 the first thing that we find in this 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.899
 Av brand device that is this 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.820
 small hole that many of you 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.939
 you wonder what it really serves 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.159
 It is used to place a tablet in the 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.440
 top of this speaker in a 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.149
 principle is intended for an ipad already 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.759
 that carries this small hole in the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.310
 which can we give the home button of the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.530
 ipad in this case not only serves for the 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.750
 ipad but also for tablets 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.119
 Android or also for devices 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.009
 mobiles that are android or also for 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.110
 iphones in the central part we 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.149
 we found with this little button in a 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100
 Metallic color which will serve us 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.229
 both to give the play as for 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.819
 pause as for the answer of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.549
 calls in case we have it 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.380
 connected and call us at some point 

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:14.799
 we have a speaker here and over here 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.209
 another that later we will check 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.030
 if we flip the device we 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.160
 we found braces that call 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.260
 here speaker breaker which is going to 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.790
 serve to place the device in 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.250
 a basis as is this case in this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.360
 stone and we will not have any problem 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.670
 for the 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.560
 for example if it falls backwards or some 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.390
 problem of these but the truth is that 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.520
 it holds up pretty well thanks to this 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.040
 small plastic we also meet 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.470
 with the switch off on to turn on 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.900
 or turn off the device the cable the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.490
 auxiliary cable connector for 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.130
 connect the 3.5 minijack cable 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.010
 millimeters and on the right side we 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.000
 we found the microusb connector for 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.000
 charge the device 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.500
 to match the speaker of the brand 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.810
 auque and models 20 0 23 through 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.640
 Bluetooth with our device what 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.490
 let's do is going to be turn it on 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.980
 first let's turn on the switch 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.020
 that he carries in the back so he 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.110
 we put on 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.750
 we wait for him to play that sound 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.230
 put the bluetooth icon here to see if 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.140
 you can see it there we have an icon of 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.690
 bluetooth which it indicates that 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.370
 the bluetooth connection is active and we 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.060
 we have to go to our device 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.900
 mobile to look for the 20 023 here already what 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.700
 we have 20 023 we are linking like this 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.250
 that we will wait to be the one who 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.320
 connects and is connected and now what 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.480
 let's do is going to be play a 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.780
 any song for example this 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.780
 same 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.940
 yes 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:39.120
 in case you want to connect it through 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.950
 of the 3.5 mm minijack cable that 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.140
 comes inside the box what 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.670
 let's do is going to be turn on the 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.670
 device turn on the speaker 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.930
 we wait for him to play this sound and 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.700
 we connect the 3.5 mini jack 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.020
 millimeters in the green jack connector 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:01.380
 play in the next sound and we 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.270
 show here aux ar and show us aux 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.580
 so now we only have left 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.440
 connect the other end to our 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.020
 device by which we are going to 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:13.180
 play our music so in 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.310
 this case we connect it to one plus one 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.750
 it is already connected and only we 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.750
 will be left to play 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.840
 we come to the conclusions of this 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:44.750
 speaker 20 023 of the company boom and 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.580
 dotcom a speaker that really meets 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.319
 with what he promises his five watts of 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.449
 audio will provide us with a quality 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:53.330
 of awesome sound and we're going to 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:55.880
 Enjoy even up to about 34 hours 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.880
 of listening to music followed ie 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:01.280
 we can listen to music for about 34 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:03.259
 hours nonstop so we'll just 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.860
 charge for another hour and a half or 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:08.780
 less and we will enjoy those 34 hours 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.330
 completely as I tell you the quality 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.180
 audio is exceptional and we have the 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.949
 Advantage of carrying 2 audio inputs 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.710
 one through bluetooth and another one 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:21.169
 through the 3.5 mm jack cable 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.210
 that he carries in the back of this 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.310
