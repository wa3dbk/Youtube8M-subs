it's the number of times a player gets a
hit<00:05:23.610> compared<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.180> number<00:05:24.419> of<00:05:24.449> times<00:05:24.629> he

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
hit compared to the number of times he

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.809 
hit compared to the number of times he
gets<00:05:24.960> up<00:05:25.139> exactly<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:26.430> you<00:05:26.520> can<00:05:26.550> make

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
gets up exactly and you can make

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.520 
gets up exactly and you can make
prediction<00:05:27.389> with<00:05:27.539> that<00:05:27.690> number<00:05:28.080> but

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
prediction with that number but

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.379 
prediction with that number but
baseball's<00:05:28.949> lots<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.280> data<00:05:29.520> not<00:05:29.849> just<00:05:29.909> batting

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
baseball's lots of data not just batting

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:32.689 
baseball's lots of data not just batting
averages<00:05:30.750> for<00:05:31.379> instance<00:05:31.740> Carlos<00:05:32.129> Beltran's<00:05:32.610> a

switch hitter

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.869

which means he bats lefty and righty

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:36.589 
which means he bats lefty and righty
very<00:05:36.150> good

game with this data you can make good

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.070 
game with this data you can make good
guess<00:05:57.810> about<00:05:58.110> what<00:05:58.380> may<00:05:58.650> happen<00:05:59.690> but<00:06:00.690> how<00:06:00.900> can

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.300 
all that data help me catch a foul ball
well<00:06:03.960> by<00:06:04.050> keeping<00:06:04.319> records<00:06:04.710> we<00:06:04.949> know<00:06:05.099> that<00:06:05.280> a

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
well by keeping records we know that a

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.309 
well by keeping records we know that a
right-handed<00:06:05.879> batter<00:06:06.090> will<00:06:06.330> probably<00:06:07.050> hit<00:06:07.259> a

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
right-handed batter will probably hit a

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.890 
right-handed batter will probably hit a
foul<00:06:07.620> ball<00:06:07.650> on<00:06:08.129> the<00:06:08.370> first<00:06:08.610> base<00:06:08.819> side<00:06:08.879> and<00:06:09.330> a

foul ball on the first base side and a
left-handed<00:06:10.349> batter<00:06:10.500> will<00:06:10.710> probably<00:06:11.069> hit<00:06:11.159> a

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
left-handed batter will probably hit a

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:13.399 
left-handed batter will probably hit a
ball<00:06:11.430> down<00:06:11.880> the<00:06:11.969> third-base<00:06:12.180> line<00:06:12.479> how<00:06:13.199> can

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:13.409 
ball down the third-base line how can

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:16.129 
ball down the third-base line how can
you<00:06:13.469> be<00:06:13.590> so<00:06:13.770> sure<00:06:14.210> it's<00:06:15.210> not<00:06:15.360> a<00:06:15.419> guarantee<00:06:15.900> but

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
you be so sure it's not a guarantee but

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.990 
you be so sure it's not a guarantee but
it's<00:06:16.530> a<00:06:16.560> good<00:06:16.710> guess<00:06:16.919> here's<00:06:17.669> a<00:06:17.729> batting

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000
