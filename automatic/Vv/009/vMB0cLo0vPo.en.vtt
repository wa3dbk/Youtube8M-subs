00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
at this point uh and so maybe there's

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.590 
at this point uh and so maybe there's
something<00:02:36.430> I'm<00:02:36.610> missing<00:02:36.640> about<00:02:36.970> quoting<00:02:37.480> from

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.870 
in the Bible I mean to me I don't care
whether<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.590> guy<00:03:23.739> saying<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.400> believes<00:03:24.670> it<00:03:24.850> I

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
whether the guy saying it believes it I

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.850 
whether the guy saying it believes it I
don't<00:03:25.150> care<00:03:25.299> people<00:03:25.600> listening<00:03:26.230> believe<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.709> I

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
don't care people listening believe it I

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.350 
don't care people listening believe it I
don't<00:03:27.220> think<00:03:27.280> religion<00:03:27.760> should<00:03:27.790> anything<00:03:28.239> to

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
don't think religion should anything to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.330 
don't think religion should anything to
do<00:03:28.480> with<00:03:28.510> our<00:03:28.750> public<00:03:29.110> discourse<00:03:29.380> so<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.190> think

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
do with our public discourse so I think

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.520 
do with our public discourse so I think
it's<00:03:30.549> a<00:03:30.610> little<00:03:30.880> disingenuous<00:03:31.320> really<00:03:32.320> doing

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's a little disingenuous really doing

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.110 
it's a little disingenuous really doing
a<00:03:32.590> lot<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.739> things<00:03:32.980> out<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.220> religious<00:03:33.910> fervor

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
a lot of things out of religious fervor

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.400 
a lot of things out of religious fervor

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
so he's just throwing that in there to

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.380 
so he's just throwing that in there to
give<00:03:35.560> some<00:03:35.830> meat<00:03:36.070> I<00:03:36.250> suppose<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.060> some<00:03:37.299> of
