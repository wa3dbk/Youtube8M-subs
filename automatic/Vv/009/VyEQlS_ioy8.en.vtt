00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.590 

these<00:02:14.890> two<00:02:15.070> questions<00:02:15.130> are<00:02:15.760> foundational<00:02:16.540> to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
these two questions are foundational to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.930 
these two questions are foundational to
my<00:02:16.750> project<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:18.070> first<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.550> how<00:02:18.730> do<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
my project the first one is how do I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.460 
my project the first one is how do I
make<00:02:19.060> pictures<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.660> photography<00:02:20.260> that

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
make pictures of the photography that

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.840 
make pictures of the photography that
can<00:02:20.560> develop<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.100> relationships<00:02:21.670> I'm

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
can develop the relationships I'm

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.760 
can develop the relationships I'm
interested<00:02:22.330> in<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.050> secondly<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.650> more

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
interested in and secondly and more

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.810 
interested in and secondly and more
broadly<00:02:24.010> what<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.640> photography<00:02:25.000> now<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:26.820> guess

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
broadly what is photography now I guess

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
broadly what is photography now I guess
for<00:02:28.060> me<00:02:28.090> it's<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.690> know<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.480> all<00:02:31.660> work

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
for me it's you know it's it is all work

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.290 
for me it's you know it's it is all work
I'm<00:02:32.080> done<00:02:32.440> I'm<00:02:33.040> familiar<00:02:33.250> with<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.760> know<00:02:33.820> and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
I'm done I'm familiar with I know and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.120 
I'm done I'm familiar with I know and
it's<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.660> dull<00:02:35.020> work<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.530> I<00:02:35.560> feel<00:02:35.830> like<00:02:35.860> I've

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it's all dull work that I feel like I've

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.010 
it's all dull work that I feel like I've
been<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.430> community<00:02:36.820> with<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:36.970> long<00:02:37.330> time<00:02:37.570> so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
been in a community with a long time so

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350 
been in a community with a long time so
it's<00:02:38.200> uh<00:02:38.470> it's<00:02:38.800> hard<00:02:39.280> for<00:02:39.580> me<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.730> say<00:02:39.880> exactly

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
it's uh it's hard for me to say exactly

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.090 
it's uh it's hard for me to say exactly
how<00:02:40.540> I<00:02:40.570> would<00:02:40.900> my<00:02:41.170> work<00:02:41.380> could<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.620> positioned

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
how I would my work could be positioned

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.900 
how I would my work could be positioned
against<00:02:42.370> someone<00:02:42.730> else's<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.600> I<00:02:44.910> think

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
against someone else's but it's I think

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.490 
against someone else's but it's I think
that<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.360> whole<00:02:46.540> thing<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:46.810> felt<00:02:47.110> like<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.260> big

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
that this whole thing is felt like a big

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.320 
that this whole thing is felt like a big
conversation<00:02:48.100> for<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> long<00:02:48.370> time

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.680 

it's<00:02:55.720> an<00:02:55.810> ongoing<00:02:55.960> conversation<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.600> one<00:02:58.600> of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
it's an ongoing conversation and one of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.540 
it's an ongoing conversation and one of
the<00:02:58.750> beautiful<00:02:59.110> things<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.710> it<00:03:00.010> makes<00:03:00.400> a

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
the beautiful things I think it makes a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.400 
the beautiful things I think it makes a
lot<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> sense<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.570> would<00:03:01.720> call<00:03:01.870> us<00:03:01.930> sort

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
lot of sense that you would call us sort

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.680 
lot of sense that you would call us sort
of<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.590> movement<00:03:02.800> or<00:03:03.130> a<00:03:03.160> group<00:03:03.490> but<00:03:04.180> within<00:03:04.360> each

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
of a movement or a group but within each

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.810 
of a movement or a group but within each
person's<00:03:05.170> individual<00:03:05.710> art<00:03:05.950> practice<00:03:06.490> there's

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
person's individual art practice there's

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.150 
person's individual art practice there's
maybe<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.150> hairs<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.810> cross<00:03:08.050> over<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.680> the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
maybe a hairs the cross over but the

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.360 
maybe a hairs the cross over but the
embodiment<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.420> project<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:12.040> really

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
embodiment of the project I think really

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.700 
embodiment of the project I think really
turns<00:03:12.970> out<00:03:13.120> quite<00:03:13.390> differently<00:03:13.470> so<00:03:14.470> there<00:03:14.590> can

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
turns out quite differently so there can

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.320 
turns out quite differently so there can
almost<00:03:14.860> be<00:03:15.100> an<00:03:15.190> aspect<00:03:15.580> where<00:03:15.850> there's<00:03:16.120> like

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
almost be an aspect where there's like

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.930 
almost be an aspect where there's like
similar<00:03:17.280> conversations<00:03:18.280> we're<00:03:18.460> having<00:03:18.760> or

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
similar conversations we're having or

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.460 
similar conversations we're having or
similar<00:03:19.450> things<00:03:19.660> we're<00:03:19.870> trying<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.200> say<00:03:20.410> but

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
similar things we're trying to say but

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:30.670 
similar things we're trying to say but
our<00:03:20.950> route<00:03:21.190> to<00:03:21.430> get<00:03:21.580> there<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:22.630> different

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.590 

so<00:03:31.680> it's<00:03:31.800> great<00:03:31.920> to<00:03:32.010> see<00:03:32.130> my<00:03:32.610> work<00:03:33.210> with<00:03:33.450> my

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
