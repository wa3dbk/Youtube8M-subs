00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.130
 cars in order to drop tomorrow to 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.259
 team working there to give a whim 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.899
 end in the car will do every day 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.909
 concentrated on completing the day 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.670
 the best way possible if everything 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.600
 to run well, we have a good chance of 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.600
 do a good job to the end 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.649
 the guys are looking like cars that give a 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.179
 Come in here with us, the staff. 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.709

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.160
 car ready for tomorrow 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:18.220
 long and difficult day as the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.200
 his day within the 336 special long and 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.269
 It's very difficult, I already prefer more 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.760
 harder than the stones is 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.440
 comfortable in the game spoke and tomorrow 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.299
 It starts with the donuts so I think 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.299
 people take off a little more now 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.230
 We'll go back for a bit of dune. 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.680
 feared dunes of fiambalÃ¡ always a 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.260
 critical region in relation to soft sand 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.880
 high temperature then we continue 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.520
 walking more or less in this condition 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.800
 leaving today dry river and something 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.450
 and there in the second week of 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.090
 rally in staying at atacama the people 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.790
 They really do not desert much sand. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.870
 owner and there is another face that the rally dakar 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.870
 It will take until the end.
