disappointing<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.870> say<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.080> least<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.739> that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
disappointing to say the least and that

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.710 
disappointing to say the least and that
was<00:03:23.160> mainly<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.640> reason<00:03:23.760> why<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.060> didn't<00:03:24.390> play

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
was mainly the reason why I didn't play

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.210 
was mainly the reason why I didn't play
it<00:03:24.780> because<00:03:24.989> who<00:03:25.170> doesn't<00:03:25.260> love<00:03:25.620> Star<00:03:25.950> Wars

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
it because who doesn't love Star Wars

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.300 
it because who doesn't love Star Wars
but<00:03:27.019> so<00:03:28.019> if<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.560> turns<00:03:28.739> out<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:29.010> be<00:03:29.040> an<00:03:29.190> awesome

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
but so if it turns out to be an awesome

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.680 
but so if it turns out to be an awesome
games<00:03:29.670> and<00:03:29.910> I'll<00:03:30.000> ten<00:03:30.180> definitely<00:03:30.510> check<00:03:30.660> it

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
games and I'll ten definitely check it

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.810

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
means that they got a little bit of

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.250 
means that they got a little bit of
extra<00:05:16.520> time<00:05:16.820> but<00:05:17.060> dead<00:05:17.180> space<00:05:17.450> 2<00:05:17.780> has<00:05:18.230> been

extra time but dead space 2 has been

this<00:05:21.200> year<00:05:21.590> we<00:05:21.740> will<00:05:21.770> not<00:05:22.070> be<00:05:22.130> seeing<00:05:22.490> it<00:05:22.760> the

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
this year we will not be seeing it the

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.580 
this year we will not be seeing it the
holiday<00:05:23.510> season<00:05:23.540> like<00:05:24.080> I<00:05:24.260> originally

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
holiday season like I originally

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.190 
holiday season like I originally
expected<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.550> I<00:05:26.000> am<00:05:26.150> sad<00:05:26.510> because<00:05:26.780> of<00:05:26.960> this

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
expected and I am sad because of this

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.930 
expected and I am sad because of this
but<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.860> extra<00:05:28.100> time<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.430> they<00:05:28.550> take<00:05:28.730> will

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
but the extra time that they take will

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.530 
but the extra time that they take will
probably<00:05:29.300> be<00:05:29.420> used<00:05:29.690> to<00:05:29.990> make<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:30.860> game<00:05:31.010> better

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:31.540 
probably be used to make the game better

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.850 
probably be used to make the game better
spend<00:05:32.540> some<00:05:32.690> more<00:05:32.780> development<00:05:33.350> time<00:05:33.500> on<00:05:33.710> it

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
spend some more development time on it

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.590 
spend some more development time on it
to<00:05:34.190> be<00:05:34.310> honest<00:05:34.640> I<00:05:34.760> don't<00:05:34.820> know<00:05:35.030> how<00:05:35.180> long<00:05:35.390> they

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
to be honest I don't know how long they

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600 
to be honest I don't know how long they
were<00:05:35.660> in<00:05:35.990> development<00:05:36.710> I<00:05:36.800> mean<00:05:36.950> it's<00:05:37.130> us<00:05:37.340> from

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
were in development I mean it's us from

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.250 
were in development I mean it's us from
the<00:05:37.730> little<00:05:38.420> bit<00:05:38.660> of<00:05:38.750> things<00:05:38.990> that<00:05:39.140> we've

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
the little bit of things that we've

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:40.960 
the little bit of things that we've
already<00:05:39.440> seen<00:05:39.710> it's<00:05:39.890> looking<00:05:40.250> pretty<00:05:40.490> awesome

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
already seen it's looking pretty awesome

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.750 
already seen it's looking pretty awesome
so<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:41.480> may<00:05:41.720> come<00:05:41.960> out<00:05:42.080> early<00:05:42.620> next<00:05:42.650> year<00:05:43.040> they

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:43.760 
so it may come out early next year they

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.180 
so it may come out early next year they
also<00:05:43.970> might<00:05:44.390> who<00:05:44.840> knows<00:05:44.870> what<00:05:45.410> push<00:05:45.830> it<00:05:45.980> back

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
also might who knows what push it back

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.310 
also might who knows what push it back
all<00:05:46.460> the<00:05:46.790> way<00:05:46.880> until<00:05:47.060> October<00:05:47.750> next<00:05:48.110> year

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
all the way until October next year

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.090 
all the way until October next year
which<00:05:48.740> would<00:05:48.950> be<00:05:49.180> ridiculously<00:05:50.180> long<00:05:50.480> um<00:05:51.100> but

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
which would be ridiculously long um but

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.740

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
years since dead space one came out they

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.510 
years since dead space one came out they
might<00:05:56.810> go<00:05:57.170> three<00:05:57.560> years<00:05:57.830> that's<00:05:58.040> a<00:05:58.130> bit<00:05:58.310> long

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
might go three years that's a bit long

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.400 
might go three years that's a bit long
for<00:05:58.550> a<00:05:58.790> development<00:05:59.300> cycle<00:05:59.630> especially<00:06:00.170> for
