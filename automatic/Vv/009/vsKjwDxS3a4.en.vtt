00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.250
 at this time of the year a delicious surplus can really taste and 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.530
 with a ready-made vegetable mix you could see this in a recipe with 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.589
 handshakes and sweet potato ready 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.999
 first two thirds and clegg different sweet potatoes in equal cubes 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.029
 You could see this as a fair alternative to regular potatoes 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.390
 key and some dyke color our over dish 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.550
 when everything is cut, let the potato cubes cook in light 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.579
 salted water 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.559
 meanwhile we can bake the hamburgers in a frying pan let them some 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.220
 get a nice tan from each side for minutes 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.870
 you do not have to completely beacon the meat because it will soon be added to the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:39.770
 oven 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.290
 among the hamburgers new life at sea a crowd of vegetables when we go first 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.290
 five the cut and students and the garlic dust in some butter 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.950
 if they start to look like glasses you can and examine the flowers 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.460
 it ensures that our salehs will soon be able to bind 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.300
 I don't see all the vegetable milk in the cooking pot and will probably stay until you 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.880
 get a smooth and bound sauce let the sauce also simmer to the 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.630
 Flowers tasted for legal get away 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.850
 now I don't feel the deep-frozen broccoli in the sauce 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.970
 if I sneaked broccoli florets cauliflower florets room 6 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.000
 it is a ready-made mix that imbues the text make a club 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.950
 our sweet potatoes are now also happy 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.510
 this is the clothes 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.070
 we also start the curry a little extra to taste with nutmeg pepper and salt 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 all components of our surpluses are not ready so we can do everything 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 layers no time at the bottom the broccoli comes nothing with sauce 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.290
 on top of that, hamburgers shoved nicely next to each other to squeeze every hamburger a bit 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.770
 get deeper into the ground so that you get a nice roads that seem like layers 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.460
 finally make the last layer with this type of mashed potatoes 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.600
 oven dish is also possible but we have an extra touch to it 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 with a special amcor view 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.770
 we first make hazelnuts that we mean afterwards because the job 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.440
 come this Japanese panic more x I score calm a coarser structure 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.379
 ground when a fair that makes our winter surplus look completely ordinary 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.379
 another 40 minutes in the oven and we can sit at the table 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.090
 we think and emperor karelpark almost past a brown bread specialty beer it 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
