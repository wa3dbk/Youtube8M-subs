don't matter I don't have anything I but
can<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.020> see<00:02:06.400> it's<00:02:07.400> got<00:02:07.580> four<00:02:07.880> connections<00:02:08.569> on

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
can you see it's got four connections on

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.580 
can you see it's got four connections on
it<00:02:08.929> and<00:02:09.580> most<00:02:10.580> cameras<00:02:11.090> only<00:02:11.690> work<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.140> stereo

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
it and most cameras only work in stereo

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.880 
it and most cameras only work in stereo
so<00:02:12.980> you<00:02:13.040> can't<00:02:13.430> use<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.810> but<00:02:14.810> this<00:02:15.290> adapter

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
so you can't use that but this adapter

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.100 
so you can't use that but this adapter
which<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.189> about<00:02:16.400> 9<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.700> 10<00:02:17.060> bucks<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.599> Amazon

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
which is about 9 of 10 bucks on Amazon

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.710 
which is about 9 of 10 bucks on Amazon
here<00:02:18.650> or<00:02:19.640> cheaper<00:02:20.299> you<00:02:21.170> use<00:02:21.379> just<00:02:22.040> that<00:02:22.189> plug

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
here or cheaper you use just that plug

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.390 
here or cheaper you use just that plug
into<00:02:24.160> your<00:02:25.160> unit<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.349> know<00:02:27.349> which<00:02:28.040> in<00:02:28.220> my<00:02:28.370> case

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
into your unit you know which in my case

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.500 
into your unit you know which in my case
would<00:02:29.000> be

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
would be

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.619 
would be
a<00:02:29.569> mic<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:32.330> then<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:34.299> got<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:35.329> bit<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.569> a

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
a mic and then I got a bit of a

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.500 
a mic and then I got a bit of a
convoluted<00:02:36.140> system<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:36.980> I'm<00:02:37.790> recording<00:02:38.390> on

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510
