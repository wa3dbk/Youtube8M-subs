00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 thomas so we end up for this 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.960
 episode 8 after almost a month 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.639
 of absence on youtube so I already 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 excuse me so I could not do 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.000
 videos for already two weeks because 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.309
 that I had a wifi interruption 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.190
 that is, down there was a thunderstorm 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 and cougar wifi grilled and then he 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.430
 there was the patent to be reviewed so that's 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.070
 for that I could not see two videos 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.230
 and yesterday as a con I made a video 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 except that I registered and I had 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 forgot to activate the microphone so blow 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.170
 I made a video where I commented 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
 I commented for nothing that there 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.969
 did not have the lesson pathways he was not making 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.010
 see them so it's gone we go in my 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.540
 city ​​so if you hear noises 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.370
 motorcycle behind it's nothing it's my 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.629
 brother he's trying to repair his motorcycle so 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 we will discover if the new 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.320
 day because I logged in yesterday 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.289
 and I saw that they had abraham 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.670
 lincoln and characters there is a 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 suit for lice so that's so we 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.570
 go see them so part of it does so 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 buy fireworks good we go 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.490
 touch sent so I think this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 video we will last a lot of time so 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.030
 I hope you do not go too much 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.439
 bored then they lie on the sim 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.479
 only me I go more enormously because 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.540
 that it really starts to get drunk at 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.400
 after a while I think you too 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.270
 or for a moment I have the gel is super 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.439
 but we do not get tired quickly enough I'm 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.020
 commenting but I hope that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:35.610
 I activated the microphone because I 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.189
 will pass for a con so here it is 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.909
 must no longer stay a lot of people to 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.799
 send them buy fireworks 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.030
 so if you see tahiti bob wander 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.890
 a game made on purpose to leave it because 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.299
 that it's always a character in 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.470
 more in the city then vaud the ain so 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.140
 everyone is on the way to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.250
 buy fireworks so we go 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 go to picket markets 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.420
 ok so we Auxerre 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.560
 So, if we're already doing a little 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:14.010
 part and that's so we wait for them there 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.480
 are all so we had in 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.810
 meanwhile i'm going to show you this is the 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.240
 little house here so what is 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.970
 really what in well at valves of 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.840
 lincoln and then we had his fires 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 when you get used to it 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.730
 it's good so it's pretty so hop I 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.160
 will show you for after so I know 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.260
 that he's not is not finished not even from 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:42.959
 all finished so it's not serious 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.860
 So we're going to go 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:48.920
 people I forget but it's not 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.170
 serious that it's going to come back 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:56.459
 so here we go back so I'm going 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.590
 may also be doing videos on a 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.600
 other game so do not hesitate to 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.550
 the comments another game you 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.610
 like good and where you want 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.670
 I make videos 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.230
 if it's a free game that pays for it 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.430
 there is not a looseness son he is 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.360
 paying I could have it anyway 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.519
 but a pretty good game and to whom would undermine 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.940
 called to whom would it please many 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.620
 bah people and then I am strong of 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.480
 gameplay on the game that will have the most 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.980
 votes 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.920
 so that's it so I think it's going to be 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.959
 finish in the mission so here is so 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.280
 maybe you'll hear some britons 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.799
 because the ipad would not surprise me 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.420
 that he moves 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.299
 so that's the night restaurant so 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.340
 I was waiting for it too, we will put it here 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.890
 so cold that I go without my city and 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.360
 that I go back times that I put everything back 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.650
 flat what I do beautiful 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.970
 constructions because there is a little 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.640
 put anyhow in them 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.579
 buildings so that's with rex barnard 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.269
 so I have everything for July 4th 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.299
 today is the 2nd of July took 2 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:03.060
 even crinkle Wednesday more per year so 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.850
 so that's my port so it's not 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.350
 over at all when you see I have everything 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.470
 done in range but I put that to 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.450
 the snatch completely larache once that 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.350
 I improve it later I do not know 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.780
 when but I improved it that's for sure 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.000
 then here is nothing new in my 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:25.280
 city ​​once again in passing a 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.490
 little bug that it happens often 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 in the simpson the building that has 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:34.550
 completely teleport a piece of 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.620
 buildings that teleported so 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.100
 saw again we will go see 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:44.780
 cities so I had unsaid things in mind 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.150
 I had charlot 333333 the mifid spirit and 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.010
 after with figures lasri field 35 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.970
 38 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.180
 so these are two cities that I have 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:56.630
 normally not presented and that I saw 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.070
 that they were good and body and they 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.010
 have reason to mouth and villa are 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.510
 pretty pretty so his town of springfield 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.030
 35 38 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.760
 he makes videos on youtube but I 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.840
 know more what's his name so game 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.820
 may put one in the description 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.560
 if java find him for you 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.660
 make a few more subscribers on youtube 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.900
 so youtube 27 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.340
 so he has 27 subscribers so if I put the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.660
 name in the description do not hesitate 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.700

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.030

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.640
 so we'll see them the city of charlot 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.650
 333333 which also to a city ​​enough 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.970
 nice but there are a lot of holes it's 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:35.060
 that's a pity said otherwise it's there 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:37.330
 the games you so I know of the 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:42.860

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:55.300
 So here is his city is super nice I 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:57.710
 find the cohesion there is symmetry 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.780
 that's it that's it's mouth too 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:03.860
 it's super nice after you have parking 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:07.130
 with the power plant who have really big big 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.470
 tony so he scored well so he got there 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.870
 the buildings that cost the most expensive 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:13.310
 and the most beautiful he really took the 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.040
 care to work for the masters 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:18.020
 pretty pretty places so here too there 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.890
 behind houses all the same 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:25.010
 that's super pretty and then he did his 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:28.180
 repetition of three times then there a 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:31.639

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:34.180
 to repeat the same words but it's not 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.560
 serious 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.180
 so that's no longer and though in the 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.680
 next updates but a lot of 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.229

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:05.449
