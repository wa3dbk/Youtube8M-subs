run<00:01:15.150> into<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.600> once<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> run<00:01:16.170> into<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:17.009> will

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
run into it once you run into it it will

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.359 
run into it once you run into it it will
say<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.939> know<00:01:18.030> $10,000<00:01:18.930> added<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
say you know $10,000 added and to do the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.710 
say you know $10,000 added and to do the
glitch<00:01:20.580> part<00:01:20.939> all<00:01:21.119> you're<00:01:21.270> gonna<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
glitch part all you're gonna want to do

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.840 
glitch part all you're gonna want to do
is<00:01:21.930> switch<00:01:22.290> characters<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.610> switch<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
is switch characters you can switch to

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.429 
is switch characters you can switch to
whoever<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.720> you're<00:01:24.869> not<00:01:24.960> playing<00:01:25.140> as

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
whoever you know you're not playing as

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.590 
whoever you know you're not playing as
obviously<00:01:25.890> I'm<00:01:26.549> just<00:01:26.759> speeding<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.299> part

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
obviously I'm just speeding up this part

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
obviously I'm just speeding up this part
so<00:01:28.110> there<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.500> Michaels<00:01:28.950> switch<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.310> him<00:01:29.490> let

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so there is Michaels switch to him let

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
so there is Michaels switch to him let
him<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.030> his<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.390> thing<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.320> going

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
him do his little thing then we're going

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
him do his little thing then we're going
to<00:01:31.500> switch<00:01:31.680> back<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:32.280> Franklin<00:01:32.729> who's<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to switch back to Franklin who's in the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.630 
to switch back to Franklin who's in the
ocean<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> there<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:34.920> again

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
ocean and there it is again

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.950 
ocean and there it is again
so<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> can<00:01:36.090> do<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.240> over<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.659> over<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
so you can do this over and over and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
so you can do this over and over and
keep<00:01:37.409> doing<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.890> keep<00:01:38.040> getting<00:01:38.159> $12,000<00:01:39.000> no

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
keep doing and keep getting $12,000 no

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.580 
keep doing and keep getting $12,000 no
actually<00:01:39.509> like<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> said<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.560> this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
actually like I said you can do this

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.469 
actually like I said you can do this
without<00:01:40.829> scuba<00:01:41.490> gear<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.000> once<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
without scuba gear because once you

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.179 
without scuba gear because once you
switch<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> different<00:01:43.350> character<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.070> will

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
switch to a different character it will

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
switch to a different character it will
actually<00:01:44.399> replenish<00:01:44.939> your<00:01:45.240> your<00:01:45.750> breathing

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
actually replenish your your breathing

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.469 
actually replenish your your breathing
bar<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.189> problem<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.700> finding<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.299> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
bar but the problem is finding it is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.940 
bar but the problem is finding it is
gonna<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> little<00:01:49.170> bit<00:01:49.259> difficult<00:01:49.439> if<00:01:49.829> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
gonna be a little bit difficult if you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.740 
gonna be a little bit difficult if you
don't<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.399> what<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.180> also<00:01:51.540> really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
don't do it what this is also really

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.300 
don't do it what this is also really
cool<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.110> if<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.320> come<00:01:52.530> right<00:01:52.860> over<00:01:52.890> here<00:01:53.159> to
