00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.370
 Bruchsal under the spell of the vampires 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.799
 on the 24th of September the musical will be performing on the grand pianos of the city center 

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.199
 Author Johann Günther gave us an insight before the performance 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.199
 behind the scenes 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:17.619
 this is one thing passed between the 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.019
 he is the idea for the present of the premiere 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.650
 So I started four years ago 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.730
 to write in one piece 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.939
 Kuntz 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 then last year in October had a new world premiere in Landau 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.210
 after a seven-month break, the musical started on 23 September in the third 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.180
 relay 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.390
 although the goal in Bern bothers 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 it can not be compared to dancing the vampires or Dracula 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.890
 As a central theme, the power is in the foreground 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.330
 they dedicate themselves to the topic they have personal experiences with it 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.920
 made 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.140
 It started when I drive in Munich and I realized that I was 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.649
 was never the great singer 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.000
 and it was not enough for the big lead, but I noticed 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.870
 Dirk Oelmann in the theaters or in the musicals the turn 1 hour of the hand 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.950
 distributed 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.440
 and then it was just so that neither spent the lingering made there 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.090
 you can really try hard 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.730
 just cool guys. "In the first sentence, I thought he was old about this topic 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.650
 Everybody knows every team leader makes everyone live around the topics 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.750
 delivered 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.340
 and inviolable my team has 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.510
 the cast members were selected from more than 200 applicants during the casting 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.590
 no one would pay a salary on the spot or backstage 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.250
 Nevertheless, all were with the whole heart countless Saturdays 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 partially sacrificed even more than twelve hours were needed 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 Dr there 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 before percent or 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
 there 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.159
 Yes 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.410
 there we go 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.410
 my dad keeps me going 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:15.980
 is the mood 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.459
 with honorary actors better but unlike other productions 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:21.879
 I think she is better 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.479
 it is around 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:26.909
 and more and more Indians in production is where you really play every day 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.279
 then you spool what car brand to work finished the people come all 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.199
 Voluntarily you liked to look for this good cause 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.169
 and around 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.049
 there is already the voices of others 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:41.239
 the hours before the performance are a stressful time especially for the mask 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.069
 It takes about 45 minutes for a person with US troops to arrive before five 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.799
 Turning late into a vampire with High Court turns you on 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.799
 for a real theater experts brought into the team 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.859
 finally he had to be provided by the Berlin primer 

00:02:57.679 --> 00:03:00.679
 the contours become the shadows 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:04.739
 deposited Hohmann Umbria 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.909
 Emphasize facial features 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.659
 we work around and around the theater I am interested in the capsule 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.799
 Amateur theater grosser still loser »Skis write also Schalke 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:19.159
 and all the work will be done right now, not me myself somewhere 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.629
 dominate 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.029
 even if I include people there 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.159
 so know what they can ask for 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:31.089
 what is exaggerated and unnatural from close up will be on stage - 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:32.679
 Culture can be seen 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.189
 with the proceeds of the musical children in need of assistance in Sudan 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.189
 supports 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.760
 Legion could become aware of their situation through a movie 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.959
 this topic especially at heart 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.969
 I've got Albert Schweitzer before 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.389
 So one in the big I believe in that Miss and thus for 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.969
 Albert Schweitzer played them 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.790
 Giessen Mensch Albert Schweitzer and he also has one 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.099
 Foundation has founded with his work with his victory 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.459
 has theirs 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.969
 to quasi-there Lambaréné founded judge up to pop so that made 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.969
 pulls or DAK had secondly stop whoever thought that can 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:10.949
 Music write ton to good ATeKa the Swiss but St what can I do 300 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.439
 Objects Stamer 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.480
 own orchestra made-to-measure costumes of professional lighting and 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.419
 sound equipment 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.359
 that the ensemble consisted largely of amateurs during the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.779
 Performance has been at least 2 already aware 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:27.769
 Many of them have joined the Schanzer training dance training 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:29.760
 acting 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.569
 exchanged so many but optimized overall 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:35.960
 through the many rehearsals nearly 50 dance daily program 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.090
 is it sense then that some people are civilian 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.090
 professional 30 can activate 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.710
 so far is the speech 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.160
 Fri. 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.969
 H 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.499
 while Aigner 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:18.379
 even after the performance in the Bruchsal Civic Center together both before and 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:20.870
 also behind the stage only bright faces 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.789
 May be set to individual 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.029
 the team leader made a spare wheel 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.639
 In the theater is always the nightmare that they are actually the result 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:30.749
 his 

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.300
 we have a tight 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.919
 the proceeds from making the CAS in Lausanne what then than the small ones 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.770
 that was enough yesterday 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:41.319
 thanks 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.339
 the trainer 

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:47.699
 There Marcel Schäfer is there for good reason as a central event 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:48.089
 has been 

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.859
 after five years, has wished to film with starting on Tuesday 

00:05:52.859 --> 00:05:54.490
 released again 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.270
 that was the only construction site 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.809
 but it is over 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.369
 excellent as well as very good idea 

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:04.169
 the result is different 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:07.469
 the harmony and above all the informal charm of the whole 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.809
 let play 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:11.849
 definitely worth it 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:14.460
 So I would come again at any time 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.099
 and there's enough opportunity 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.159
 He wants to do that for the next three months in the region 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:21.400
 on road 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.360
 after two appearances at the Pforzheim CongressCentrum in October, this will now be 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.529
 to be seen in the Ittlinger Stadthalle for November 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:31.899
 In December, the Bruchsal Civic Center will once again host the 

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.539
 be scary-beautiful tragedy
