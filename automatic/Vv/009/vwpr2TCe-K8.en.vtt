00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
hello and welcome to SSD performance

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.510 
hello and welcome to SSD performance
test<00:00:02.370> number<00:00:02.669> two<00:00:02.879> with<00:00:03.179> Grand<00:00:03.449> Theft<00:00:03.570> Auto<00:00:03.689> 5

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:04.520 
test number two with Grand Theft Auto 5

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.970 
test number two with Grand Theft Auto 5
all<00:00:05.520> right<00:00:05.670> so<00:00:05.790> I'm<00:00:05.879> just<00:00:06.120> gonna<00:00:06.720> load<00:00:07.620> another

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
all right so I'm just gonna load another

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.410 
all right so I'm just gonna load another
say<00:00:08.250> game<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.610> see<00:00:08.760> how<00:00:08.880> long<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.150> takes<00:00:09.330> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
say game to see how long it takes to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.959 
say game to see how long it takes to
load<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> story<00:00:09.990> murder<00:00:10.610> did<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.700> try<00:00:11.910> to

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
load the story murder did you try to

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.810 
load the story murder did you try to
start<00:00:12.210> loading<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.630> game<00:00:12.780> at<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> same<00:00:13.230> time

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
start loading the game at the same time

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.820 
start loading the game at the same time
so<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.000> game<00:00:15.299> has<00:00:15.330> actually<00:00:15.960> been<00:00:16.109> optimized

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
so this game has actually been optimized

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.670 
so this game has actually been optimized
to<00:00:17.340> load<00:00:17.550> both<00:00:17.910> off<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.420> disk<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.869> hard<00:00:19.439> drive

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
to load both off the disk and hard drive

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.480 
to load both off the disk and hard drive
at<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.039> same<00:00:20.189> time<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> basically<00:00:22.490> they're

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
at the same time so basically they're

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.040 
at the same time so basically they're
assuming<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.180> you're<00:00:24.300> gonna<00:00:24.480> be<00:00:24.660> buying<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
assuming that you're gonna be buying the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.870 
assuming that you're gonna be buying the
physical<00:00:25.439> disk<00:00:25.650> for<00:00:25.830> this<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.189> then

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
physical disk for this and then

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.910 
physical disk for this and then
installing<00:00:27.359> an<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.720> kick<00:00:27.930> portion<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.590> then

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
installing an a kick portion and then

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
installing an a kick portion and then
your<00:00:29.250> console<00:00:29.609> will<00:00:29.760> be<00:00:29.939> reading<00:00:30.240> both<00:00:30.420> off

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
your console will be reading both off

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.330 
your console will be reading both off
your<00:00:30.810> hard<00:00:31.019> drive<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.769> disk<00:00:31.949> at<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.189> same

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
your hard drive and the disk at the same

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.220 
your hard drive and the disk at the same
time<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.300> way<00:00:33.450> we<00:00:33.660> all<00:00:33.809> get<00:00:33.930> enough

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
time that way we all get enough

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
time that way we all get enough
bandwidth<00:00:34.649> in<00:00:34.829> total<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.670> all<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> assets

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
bandwidth in total for all the assets

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700 
bandwidth in total for all the assets
and<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> game<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.840> loading<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.320> you're

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and the game to be loading as you're

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
and the game to be loading as you're
driving<00:00:37.860> around<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.370> crazy<00:00:39.410> basically<00:00:42.290> here

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
driving around like crazy basically here

00:00:43.290 --> 00:01:01.279 
driving around like crazy basically here
we<00:00:43.350> go<00:00:59.000> for<00:01:00.000> some<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:00.329> he's<00:01:00.539> gone<00:01:00.750> taken

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
we go for some reason he's gone taken

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.869 
we go for some reason he's gone taken
out<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> bike<00:01:01.920> which<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.460> didn't<00:01:02.760> actually

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
out the bike which I didn't actually

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.870 
out the bike which I didn't actually
remember<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.510> still<00:01:03.989> had

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:27.800 

let's<00:01:11.880> try<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.180> change<00:01:12.360> character<00:01:26.810> not

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
let's try and change character not

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.980 
let's try and change character not
sleeping<00:01:28.410> at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> wheel<00:01:28.680> in<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> random<00:01:29.580> place

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
sleeping at the wheel in a random place

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.060 
sleeping at the wheel in a random place
that's<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.110> she<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.410> cool<00:01:31.620> how<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that's it she really cool how that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.850 
that's it she really cool how that
happens<00:01:32.340> random<00:01:32.880> events<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.860> it's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
happens random events just it's

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.290 
happens random events just it's
pointless<00:01:35.130> as<00:01:35.370> they<00:01:35.460> may<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.120> change

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
pointless as they may be as you change

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.750 
pointless as they may be as you change
character<00:01:37.040> all<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.190> I<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.580> get<00:01:38.700> some

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
character all right I see if I get some

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.940 
character all right I see if I get some
speed<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.330> this<00:01:39.390> car<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.170> not<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.410> fastest

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
speed in this car it's not the fastest

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.780 
speed in this car it's not the fastest
occurrence<00:01:41.370> it's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.730> pretty<00:01:42.060> good<00:01:42.180> handling

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
occurrence it's a pretty good handling

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.940 
occurrence it's a pretty good handling
well<00:01:44.790> as<00:01:45.120> you<00:01:45.870> know<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.440> are<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> digital

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
well as you know there are the digital

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.270 
well as you know there are the digital
copies<00:01:47.310> as<00:01:47.520> well<00:01:47.580> or<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:49.320> you're<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> 360<00:01:50.010> owner

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
copies as well or if you're a 360 owner

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.910 
copies as well or if you're a 360 owner
you<00:01:50.730> may<00:01:50.880> also<00:01:51.060> opt<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.570> try<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> install<00:01:52.410> the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
you may also opt to try and install the

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.990 
you may also opt to try and install the
other<00:01:53.010> discs<00:01:53.550> as<00:01:53.760> well

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
other discs as well

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
other discs as well
no<00:01:54.600> usually<00:01:54.870> I<00:01:55.080> prefer<00:01:55.230> to<00:01:55.560> do<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.830> so<00:01:55.980> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
no usually I prefer to do that so that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.320 
no usually I prefer to do that so that
you<00:01:56.130> don't<00:01:56.340> have<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.610> sound<00:01:56.910> of<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.090> disc

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
you don't have the sound of the disc

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.610 
you don't have the sound of the disc
spinning<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:57.840> crazy<00:01:57.870> while<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.470> playing

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
spinning like crazy while you're playing

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.440 
spinning like crazy while you're playing
let's<00:01:59.520> just<00:01:59.670> see<00:01:59.790> if<00:01:59.850> there's<00:02:00.000> any<00:02:00.090> mission

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
let's just see if there's any mission

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.890 
let's just see if there's any mission
objectives<00:02:00.870> that<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.080> can<00:02:01.260> go<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
objectives that I can go to but in this

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.870 
objectives that I can go to but in this
game<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.410> actually<00:02:04.710> turns<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.340> at<00:02:05.670> least

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
game it actually turns out that at least

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.430 
game it actually turns out that at least
from<00:02:06.060> some<00:02:06.210> sample<00:02:06.630> videos<00:02:06.900> I've<00:02:07.110> seen<00:02:07.140> out

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
from some sample videos I've seen out

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.590 
from some sample videos I've seen out
there<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.190> game<00:02:08.399> cannot<00:02:08.820> actually<00:02:09.000> keep<00:02:09.390> up

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
there the game cannot actually keep up

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.480 
there the game cannot actually keep up
with<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.020> loading<00:02:10.440> entirely<00:02:10.920> off<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.280> hard

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
with a loading entirely off the hard

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.790 
with a loading entirely off the hard
drive<00:02:11.760> which<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.450> pretty<00:02:12.810> much<00:02:12.960> why<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.260> decided

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
drive which is pretty much why I decided

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.320 
drive which is pretty much why I decided
that<00:02:13.920> Grand<00:02:14.220> Theft<00:02:14.370> Auto<00:02:14.489> 5<00:02:14.940> would<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
that Grand Theft Auto 5 would be a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.240 
that Grand Theft Auto 5 would be a
really<00:02:15.690> good<00:02:15.930> test<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.560> see<00:02:16.739> whether<00:02:17.010> or<00:02:17.160> not

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
really good test to see whether or not

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820 
really good test to see whether or not
