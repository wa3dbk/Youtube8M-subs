00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.029
 today is a particularly important day for tomtom 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.219
 we had an event 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.080
 mika European tour where we invited our best part of the best 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.070
 European journalists have presented our strategic plan 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.429
 only yesterday we released the results of the first kurt 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:28.710
 which have seen great growth over the previous year despite 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.529
 the market is in slight decline 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.930
 tomtom managed to compensate for this market loss with the 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.960
 diversification on some segments that will be strategic for the next 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.320
 dumb future 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.600
 one in all car mottos segment where we have grown 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.960
 the over two hundred percent thanks to the agreements signed with the major ones 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.410
 car manufacturers such as fiat toyota here now 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.570
 together with them we were able to offer integrated solutions for the user 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.440
 where we have brought our technology is our software 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.390
 within individual cars 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.260
 rugby regarding market stoppage 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.430
 suggestion cons 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.220
 is commanded despite there being a downturn we were able to increase 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.310
 our market shares coming almost in Italy to have 60% 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.210
 today the predominant reason was the launch of the wait services 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.920
 or a sim integrated into the browser to change the experience of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.750
 user navigation 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.760
 we started from simple navigation a path to give me 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.340
 today we will be able to offer a 360 degree solution that is beyond 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.390
 have software 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.630
 within the browser will be included real-time services such as 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:47.650
 traffic 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.679
 the conditions of all points of interest 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:53.740
 gasoline prices and much more 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.720
 but the most important thing is definitely the traffic service in 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:58.610
 real time 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.720
 system federation according to vodafone 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.810
 will provide the most accurate and most accurate data available at this time 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.919
 In circulation 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.979
 we will finally see these products in Italy around September 

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.349
 they will have an affordable price for the user but above all the real one 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.319
 What's new from an economic point of view is that tomtom has decided to make it free 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.989
 for the first year 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.419
 the online service 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:31.189
 this will allow the user to experience these services 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.379
 and judge at the end of a year whether to renew a - 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.379
 the service offered 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.049
 the focus is on navigation for which ton tuna will develop other products on the other hand 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.459
 out of navigation, however, as the market rightly pointed out 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.149
 evolves the competitors are different 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:56.169
 tomorrow they could be called a good eye 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:01.179
 so for tomtom it is fundamental to diversify offering services 

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:04.919
 so our goal will be to first diversify we are 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:06.019
 already doing 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.780
 in the world 8 deaths in the world within the meaning 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 through the acquisition of tele atlas but especially within the la pin 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.699
 possibility of offering new services that will attract new users 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:22.019
 if they can expand the market again 

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:31.309
 absolutely, according to our point of view the two things are the antithesis 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.459
 are two user experiences 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.319
 completely different 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.789
 it is clear that the experience on pnd 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:40.160
 offers the best 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.140
 the best navigation system in any situation not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.329
 we believe 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.499
 that it could be a threat to release on a smartphone 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:56.430
 a chip set gps I have an integrated map that is occasional use 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.239
 pedestrian therefore linked to those who walk and in each case every 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.769
 really rare 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.049
 while for what concerns the experience of the pnd offer 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.739
 Reform of services in the form of traffic in the form of a mate 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.209
 a completely different experience for the end user
