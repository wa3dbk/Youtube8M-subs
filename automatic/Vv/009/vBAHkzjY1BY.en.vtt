00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 girls all pressing you two 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.550
 I believe the promised video fibers as 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.070
 once laid out a video when i was 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.580
 wound up in general will be large curls 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.730
 such big sex just don't know the mountains 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.380
 hour league write where we will do 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.170
 large lacquer would deal with mascara 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 who can use curlers 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.330
 the basis of all this is solely what 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.000
 need to pour the hair will be away from the face and not 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.560
 it is important with what shall we say since the drug is not 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.420
 with what technique will it be? 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.680
 do it like it's woken up in this 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.149
 there will be an iron or it will be a curling all 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.980
 no matter the principle is obtained 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.030
 the same locks are important so that they are 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.280
 cock interrupts power 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.969
 my gosh i 'm talking about heats up these 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.910
 Jacques I will apply to my hair now I will apply 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.230
 a little bit of oil on the tip is not enough 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.480
 so that they do not cut so I do not know 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 many say that someone cooks it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 spoils the hair that's when I apply oil 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 Before this, someone says the opposite 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.020
 does not spoil but my hair does not spoil 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.299
 do not split and when I did not cut my hair 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 a year and a half the frame has not split 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.110
 so draw your own conclusions I'm all on 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 own let's say so we study cash 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.790
 I leaned on I leave the iron at 190 degrees 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.840
 from the ideal temperature to 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.400
 my hair did n't spoil in order 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.860
 there is a need for its average temperature 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 which helps me for curling hair 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.409
 she will need a comb quickly 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.409
 brush hair 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.510
 when I start stupor rear 3 then 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.610
 turn already to the strand could street i 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.780
 I'll probably speed up the video to make it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.780
 everything was much faster 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 all each main this part too all 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.580
 the rest should be like, well, in general, all 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.800
 as they are twisted the main thing that they 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.690
 lay neatly the main part 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.710
 the latter is important for and so that 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:17.250
 it was not to the contrary on behalf letgo 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:19.260
 so the hour so let's say a little bit 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.890
 under fill because me it is not yet 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.890
 very out 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.950
 that's the main thing that it is thank God we were 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.840
 the main thing that it all lay under 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.360
 so that waves 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.770
 they, on the contrary, departed from this person 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.240
 side to be done exactly the same 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.240
 nothing changes 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:18.319
 Now you need to make out all this hair 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.960
 oh navarat sorted it out with your fingers 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:24.530
 neatly so as not to unravel here simply 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.520
 exactly 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.520
 disassemble 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.510
 and here's how you can see immediately the effect of such 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:42.220
 that hair, they do not age on behalf of the other way around 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:44.470
 they try to crawl away from the shorter they 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.220
 try to be on behalf of that is they go 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.620
 backwards 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.330
 waves in not only hairstyle very 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.190
 suitable because of the form in principle 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.510
 this business long enough to be in 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.510
 convenient place is natural to me 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:58.360
 long habit I used to do it 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:00.460
 baths and near the mirror and if it is a matter of 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:02.050
 familiar place without a camera and this 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.660
 It turns out well, minutes to the world on 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.670
 ten to fifteen is the maximum but 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.080
 that the hair is alive as if they do not need 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.180
 already spraying varnishes than i am yet 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.440
 previously 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.480
 sprayed with mousse that showed you 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.060
 your when then nowhere how would they 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:19.960
 keep all day and then tomorrow 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:22.510
 they will surely still hold this 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.370
 Basically, all of your interviewed you show 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.470
 because well, in general, everything is extreme 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.280
 simple and this has long been told 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.960
 but I donâ€™t know such a hairstyle 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.700
 suitable because I like hair 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.040
 how are they laid in large curls 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.490
 nor do they get confused 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.860
 You can easily comb their friend 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.960
 so I do not know that she also liked 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.790
 I see great as it seemed 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.729
 the main thing again I explain what you need 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.470
 spinning strands from your face that's why you 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.720
 all I wanted to show you, I hope 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.460
 that you liked in all very much 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.460
 I love everybody and kisses
