00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
it and the only way we can do it fast is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
it and the only way we can do it fast is
using<00:01:11.520> our<00:01:11.610> creativity<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> came<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
osu i felt the exact same went that way

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.660 
osu i felt the exact same went that way
about<00:01:15.810> osu<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.620> us<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.130> reach<00:01:17.460> our

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
about osu for us to really reach our

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.000 
about osu for us to really reach our
full<00:01:17.880> potential<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.840> got<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> be<00:01:19.229> creative<00:01:19.710> you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
full potential we got to be creative you

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680 
full potential we got to be creative you
could<00:01:20.190> get<00:01:20.340> yourself<00:01:20.490> twisted<00:01:21.210> up<00:01:21.360> where<00:01:21.570> you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 
could get yourself twisted up where you

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.330 
could get yourself twisted up where you
lose<00:01:21.840> immediately<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.070> kind<00:01:23.220> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
lose immediately so you got to kind of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.010

is still out there I've never seen
anything<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> before<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.450> matter<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
anything like it before it's a matter of

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.899 
anything like it before it's a matter of
fact<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.200> think<00:01:37.260> I've<00:01:37.590> proven<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.040> my<00:01:38.340> left

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
fact I think I've proven that my left

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.480 
fact I think I've proven that my left
side<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.210> much<00:01:39.540> stronger<00:01:39.810> than<00:01:39.960> my<00:01:40.170> right<00:01:40.320> side

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
side is much stronger than my right side

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.600 
side is much stronger than my right side
but<00:01:41.490> fresh<00:01:42.270> paint<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.930> fresh<00:01:43.350> young<00:01:43.770> students

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
but fresh paint and fresh young students

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.290 
but fresh paint and fresh young students
is

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
is

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.940 
is
stop<00:01:45.480> getting<00:01:45.660> you<00:01:45.900> better<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.770> to

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
stop getting you better and I got to

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.310 
stop getting you better and I got to
know<00:01:46.980> my<00:01:47.250> fellow<00:01:47.520> students<00:01:48.090> very<00:01:48.330> well<00:01:48.720> indeed

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
know my fellow students very well indeed

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.770 
know my fellow students very well indeed
but<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.100> think<00:01:50.370> I<00:01:50.460> took<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.820> high<00:01:50.970> road<00:01:51.000> most<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
but I think I took the high road most of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.570 
but I think I took the high road most of
the<00:01:51.870> students<00:01:52.290> were<00:01:52.440> down<00:01:52.680> low<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:52.980> i<00:01:53.340> was

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
the students were down low and i was

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.910 
the students were down low and i was
actually<00:01:54.450> i<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:55.080> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.350> more<00:01:55.500> comfortable

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
actually i was a little more comfortable

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.500 
actually i was a little more comfortable
I<00:01:56.250> think<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.550> twister<00:01:56.880> game<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.150> really<00:01:57.270> good

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
I think the twister game is really good

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.390 
I think the twister game is really good
because<00:01:57.660> it's<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.230> bright<00:01:58.650> and<00:01:58.680> colorful<00:01:59.310> in

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
because it's so bright and colorful in

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.590 
because it's so bright and colorful in
it<00:01:59.520> really<00:01:59.790> attract<00:02:00.090> people<00:02:00.390> let's<00:02:00.540> see

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it really attract people let's see

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.210 
it really attract people let's see
what's<00:02:00.780> going<00:02:00.960> on<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.560> I<00:02:01.590> think<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.950> shows

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
what's going on so I think that shows

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.460 
what's going on so I think that shows
creativity
