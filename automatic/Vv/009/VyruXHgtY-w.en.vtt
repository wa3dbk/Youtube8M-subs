the<00:00:53.789> same<00:00:54.180> thickness<00:00:54.710> so<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:55.920> going<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> use

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309

scratch<00:01:01.859> building<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.080> that's<00:01:04.080> why<00:01:04.290> i

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
scratch building and that's why i

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.410

closed I was going to have it open but

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.570 
closed I was going to have it open but
you<00:02:46.870> know<00:02:46.989> there's<00:02:47.260> no<00:02:47.380> interior<00:02:47.800> or<00:02:48.190> anything

like<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.530> figure<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.430> not<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.269> pose

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
like that the figure it's not in a pose

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.309 
like that the figure it's not in a pose
where<00:02:52.959> I<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.709> know<00:02:53.830> I<00:02:54.360> thought<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.600> was

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
where I you know I thought it was

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.860 
where I you know I thought it was
designed<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.920> be<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.610> hatch<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:58.330> I<00:02:58.630> just

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
designed to be in the hatch so I just

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.580 
designed to be in the hatch so I just
decided<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.950> close<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.690> yeah<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.200> gun<00:03:02.410> on

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
decided to close it but yeah the gun on

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.080 
decided to close it but yeah the gun on
the<00:03:02.709> back<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.340> placed<00:03:04.019> what<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.049> do<00:03:05.170> is<00:03:05.620> I

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the back is so placed what I do is I

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:13.410 
the back is so placed what I do is I
glue<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.450> piece<00:03:08.440> of<00:03:08.860> sprue<00:03:09.780> onto<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:12.420> turret

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
glue a piece of sprue onto the turret

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.120 
glue a piece of sprue onto the turret
that<00:03:13.630> way<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.810> can<00:03:14.140> use<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.260> as<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> handle<00:03:14.980> when

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
that way I can use it as a handle when

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.729 
that way I can use it as a handle when
I'm<00:03:15.250> painting<00:03:15.959> and<00:03:16.959> then<00:03:17.200> when<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.380> time<00:03:17.709> to
