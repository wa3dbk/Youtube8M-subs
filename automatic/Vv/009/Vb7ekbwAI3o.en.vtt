00:00:09.149 --> 00:00:13.199
 who knows this concept with critics who are aggressive animals and also 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.070
 attackers coming forward 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 then we sell poorly in the interview with Jorge Quarry who is a specialist in 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.240
 animal behavior mainly in relation to 20 goals he will show everything 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.240
 this is just a myth 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.609
 until then 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.600
 Ana 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.800
 she 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.070
 rose 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.080
 the animal agency 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.860
 eliete correct behaviors and attitudes and behaviors 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.720
 now his major work aimed at critics bothered him with people 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.020
 sometimes they have been 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.550
 some comments about these dogs that are actually wonderful 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.080
 They painted a beast a best assassin episode bothered a lot and I wanted to 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.409
 really look deep know and know the history of pitbulls 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.229
 is a very old breed in the 19th century is to such animals were not used 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.229
 to be able to contain all 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.650
 the cow is well because of a very great stress it had a 'very taste' 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.630
 more accurate then what happened were created bubenik hid combat 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.290
 ever 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.060
 these good nature 10 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.990
 with an historical ace genetic selection was really turned to oni 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.670
 bad that what to perform this type of work the hardest thing is you 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.270
 find aggressive pitibul 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.230
 is the today is not an animal chalk of the police and nor as security by 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.110
 just do not be a watchdog 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.460
 so he has a predilection for combat but really aggressiveness that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.140
 is very scarce owner of all this race told the person will choose the animal if 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 Does it matter that you are a puppy? 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.530
 hai temperament of the corner quite the opposite 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.169
 one case with the other 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.589
 with formed character is the ones will not have surprises in the future if he is a 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.759
 dog that 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.409
 you need to be careful and aggressive you will know how will it be 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.629
 so until the end of his life as the puppy when it comes to you 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.089
 arrives with in two pages 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.360
 What is the name of an Indian there? 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 what yesterday's data from this dog 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.120
 passed to him in the other was the company was taken in blank that is called 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.899
 character 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.390
 This was the thesis that she was going down. She was with her mother. 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.319
 would be filled by it 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.579
 and what actually happens when you take him home that was the thesis 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.829
 responsibility of the person here what led in many times the person leaves the 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.310
 dog at ease 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.250
 to him it fills these lines that to inb we go his puppy jarrat the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.449
 spoiled brat dog that destroys very good you adopt 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:05.530
 an adult animal the fidelity of your animal 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.190
 is with your person is much greater because he is receiving a 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.360
 thing and he does not want to give it up anyway. 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.379
 disrupt the relationship to the south 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.069
 especially those vehicles that are now abandoned the demand of these 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.079
 extremely large animals are abandoned are generally abandoned 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.919
 and suffer there I think that the greatest atrocities we can imagine and 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:30.499
 when we find these animals are really deplorable in the 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:34.229
 zoonoses control center together with the veterinarian we question some 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:35.799
 animals then 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.239
 we start running after adopters the pitbull is not a dog 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.800
 Anyone has to be prepared because they have a strong dog. 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.180
 is an extremely determined bunch extremely intelligent person who goes 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.380
 adopting a pit bull has to undergo a rigorous screening 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.970
 and from there we can put some animals back, I go 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.670
 introduce you 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.969
 the one with this that elisabeth's mother 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.549
 she was obeyed by the thugs was back there when to rescue this version 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.120
 move more you have eight I have 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.119
 I never had any problems and never imagined the good people 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.369
 they will be kept 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.050
 it was the crime plate 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.729
 the program brings to the really 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.180
 when it is created to attack 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 I'll have a charge but here at the zoo's office. 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:28.449
 the money but the queries consultations last for the dogs patients here are 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.159
 beliefs but always accompanied by their owners is a pity 

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.470
 so more than really brings me work that brings a lot of difficulty 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.709
 really its owners usually people that I got here it has a 

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:42.709
 Friend phobia problem 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.120
 he is suffering some traumann more generally they are related to 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.270
 theft of the owner then sometimes he arrives tired work arrives sad 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.940
 I call attention when he comes home and applies all this feeling to the animal. 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.630
 or she is so fragile that she gives the information to the dog 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.270
 he must take care of her entrance and we grow and fishing seag need does the 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.650
 who wants to take care of the person does not let anyone touch 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.020
 dogs are very large facility of partial interpretation to be 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.389
 human being is collecting rubbish when he cheerfully expresses this much through 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.800
 of the consed time dog is perceived then the person who arrives 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.350
 sad with a very large frequency, it certainly brings instability 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.729
 for the dog that speaks, we run a very serious risk of 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:34.960
 pilgrims territory 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.219
 You buy a decision too. 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:41.419
 It's a job that I do dog training for kids who have 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:42.730
 special needs 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.110
 I just realized that people even had an interest in the case but were afraid 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.639
 that the animal on behalf of the special child 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.430
 did something 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.600
 and from there I came across a huge amount of dogs a center 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.180
 of control of zoonoses 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.400
 I'm hiring a new one full of love to give 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.270
 and children who had a very great need to have a little time 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.969
 integral 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:07.950
 my best to each will have ball 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.990
 is a pit bull that high from a dog already very famous already 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.990
 with respect to snacks the people who have their dogs 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.889
 To castrate your animals from these the animal loses at home has no need to 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.650
 put more pitbulls 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.090
 on the street is everyone thinks it's cool there has a litter 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.569
 only the next you 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:31.069
 you get one or two because you wanted to have only that 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.199
 rest that will happen they will end up stopping at the street repaired appeals 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:40.219
 so I think responsibility means that the request of the moment thank you very much 

00:06:40.219 --> 00:06:43.279
 reside sit the 5th 

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:46.020
 in her 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.020
 Paulo 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:51.340
