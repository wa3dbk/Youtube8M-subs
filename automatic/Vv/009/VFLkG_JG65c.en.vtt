that's gonna last for a while and given
that<00:02:45.340> i've<00:02:45.640> already<00:02:45.819> predicted<00:02:46.540> or<00:02:46.840> stated

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
that i've already predicted or stated

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.699 
that i've already predicted or stated
that<00:02:47.890> i<00:02:48.190> think<00:02:48.250> Bryan<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.569> Randy<00:02:49.629> won't<00:02:50.530> win

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
the tag team titles I don't think Dean

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.869

Ambrose<00:02:53.560> is<00:02:53.769> going<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.190> lose<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.579> United

Ambrose is going to lose the United
States<00:02:55.060> Championship<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:56.290> when<00:02:56.680> they

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
States Championship I think when they

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.849 
States Championship I think when they
lose<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.160> titles<00:02:58.500> they're<00:02:59.500> going<00:02:59.590> to<00:02:59.680> lose<00:02:59.799> it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:02:59.859

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
Ambrose apart from his rematch with Kofi

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.180 
Ambrose apart from his rematch with Kofi
Kingston<00:03:23.109> this<00:03:23.260> is<00:03:23.380> his<00:03:23.530> first<00:03:23.769> title<00:03:24.040> defense

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
Kingston this is his first title defense

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.240 
Kingston this is his first title defense
against<00:03:25.230> somebody<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.950> former

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
against somebody that's not the former

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.039 
against somebody that's not the former
champion<00:03:27.609> so<00:03:27.730> pretty<00:03:28.150> much<00:03:28.269> his<00:03:28.510> second<00:03:28.930> title

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
champion so pretty much his second title

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.780 
champion so pretty much his second title
defense<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:30.220> think<00:03:30.430> it's<00:03:30.519> gonna<00:03:30.609> be<00:03:30.760> a

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
defense and I think it's gonna be a

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.089 
defense and I think it's gonna be a
successful<00:03:31.299> one<00:03:31.599> I<00:03:31.870> think<00:03:32.500> we<00:03:32.560> have<00:03:32.590> big<00:03:32.919> plans

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
successful one I think we have big plans

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.610 
successful one I think we have big plans
for<00:03:33.430> the<00:03:33.489> shield<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.090> I'm<00:03:34.930> hoping<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.349> shield

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
for the shield and I'm hoping the shield

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.650 
for the shield and I'm hoping the shield
last<00:03:35.919> I<00:03:36.129> know<00:03:36.190> right<00:03:36.700> now<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.879> shield<00:03:37.269> is<00:03:37.480> no

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
last I know right now the shield is no

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.599 
last I know right now the shield is no

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.970 
longer undefeated talk about that a
little<00:03:39.910> more<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.590> taxing<00:03:41.590> title<00:03:41.859> match

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.080 
make too much sense because you know of
course<00:04:05.530> all<00:04:05.859> of<00:04:05.919> these<00:04:06.220> shield<00:04:06.489> members<00:04:06.849> will

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
course all of these shield members will

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.089 
course all of these shield members will
be<00:04:07.209> after<00:04:07.449> John<00:04:07.690> Cena<00:04:08.139> but<00:04:08.590> then<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.829> could<00:04:08.980> do

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:09.099 
be after John Cena but then you could do

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.129 
be after John Cena but then you could do
the<00:04:09.220> whole<00:04:09.430> thing<00:04:09.459> more<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.599> know<00:04:10.720> they<00:04:10.930> all

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
the whole thing more you know they all

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.659 
the whole thing more you know they all
want<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.530> win<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.829> championship<00:04:11.859> so<00:04:12.549> they

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
want to win the championship so they

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.220 
want to win the championship so they
might<00:04:12.970> go<00:04:13.209> after<00:04:13.449> each<00:04:13.480> other<00:04:13.720> and<00:04:13.930> that<00:04:14.049> could

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
might go after each other and that could

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.039 
might go after each other and that could
start<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:15.340> ends<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.090> shield's<00:04:16.479> but<00:04:16.660> now

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
start the ends of the shield's but now

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.020 
start the ends of the shield's but now
when<00:04:17.260> I'm<00:04:17.349> going<00:04:17.680> to<00:04:17.889> off-topic<00:04:18.070> i<00:04:18.609> can<00:04:18.820> i<00:04:18.970> can

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
when I'm going to off-topic i can i can

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.969 
when I'm going to off-topic i can i can
see<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:20.169> know<00:04:20.260> why<00:04:20.410> this<00:04:20.470> match<00:04:20.739> was<00:04:20.949> made

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
see you know why this match was made

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.149 
see you know why this match was made
although<00:04:21.459> i<00:04:21.579> really<00:04:22.150> didn't<00:04:22.330> expected<00:04:23.159> that's

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
although i really didn't expected that's

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.010 
although i really didn't expected that's
because<00:04:24.400> i<00:04:24.490> didn't<00:04:24.669> expect<00:04:24.760> anything<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:25.750> come

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
because i didn't expect anything to come

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.610 
because i didn't expect anything to come
out

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
out

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.920

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
of the one-on-one match Cain had with

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.689 
of the one-on-one match Cain had with
Dean<00:04:29.110> Ambrose<00:04:29.500> it<00:04:29.889> was<00:04:30.070> a<00:04:30.100> non-title<00:04:30.430> match

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699 
Dean Ambrose it was a non-title match

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:32.640 
Dean Ambrose it was a non-title match
and<00:04:31.000> that<00:04:31.030> match<00:04:31.750> ended<00:04:32.320> in<00:04:32.350> his

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650

qualification in favor of Cain and I

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.520 
qualification in favor of Cain and I
really<00:04:37.000> didn't<00:04:37.180> expect<00:04:37.510> being<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.960> u.s.<00:04:38.320> title

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
really didn't expect being a u.s. title

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.040 
really didn't expect being a u.s. title
shot<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:39.040> come<00:04:39.220> out<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.810> unexpect<00:04:40.810> came

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
shot to come out of that unexpect came

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.580 
shot to come out of that unexpect came
to<00:04:41.940> honestly<00:04:42.940> ever<00:04:43.210> challenge<00:04:43.900> for<00:04:44.290> the<00:04:44.380> US

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
to honestly ever challenge for the US

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.520 
to honestly ever challenge for the US
Championship<00:04:45.240> well<00:04:46.240> maybe<00:04:46.449> not<00:04:46.660> ever<00:04:46.900> but<00:04:47.080> I

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
Championship well maybe not ever but I

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.140 
Championship well maybe not ever but I
didn't<00:04:47.740> expect<00:04:47.800> him<00:04:48.160> to<00:04:48.310> challenge<00:04:48.639> the<00:04:48.910> US

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
didn't expect him to challenge the US

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.580 
didn't expect him to challenge the US
Championship<00:04:49.720> at<00:04:49.870> this<00:04:50.050> point<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.410> time

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
Championship at this point in time

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.000 
Championship at this point in time
especially<00:04:51.130> when<00:04:51.610> he's<00:04:51.760> just<00:04:52.290> he<00:04:53.290> just<00:04:53.320> ended

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
especially when he's just he just ended

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.270 
especially when he's just he just ended
or<00:04:54.460> not<00:04:54.820> he<00:04:55.180> didn't<00:04:55.419> end<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.720> but<00:04:55.990> he<00:04:56.440> just<00:04:56.680> lost

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
or not he didn't end it but he just lost

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.150 
or not he didn't end it but he just lost
the<00:04:57.729> tag<00:04:58.180> team<00:04:58.360> titles<00:04:58.680> against<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.770> shield

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
the tag team titles against the shield

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.610 
the tag team titles against the shield
so<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.490> thought<00:05:00.729> he<00:05:00.820> was<00:05:00.910> gonna<00:05:01.060> be<00:05:01.270> maybe<00:05:01.479> if<00:05:02.470> he

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
so I thought he was gonna be maybe if he

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.960 
so I thought he was gonna be maybe if he
was<00:05:02.740> gonna<00:05:02.800> be<00:05:02.979> involved<00:05:03.250> with<00:05:03.490> the<00:05:03.610> shield<00:05:03.850> I

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
was gonna be involved with the shield I

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.250 
was gonna be involved with the shield I
thought<00:05:04.150> he<00:05:04.270> was<00:05:04.419> gonna<00:05:04.570> be<00:05:04.750> involved<00:05:04.960> in

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
thought he was gonna be involved in

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.990 
thought he was gonna be involved in
maybe<00:05:05.440> some<00:05:05.710> non-title<00:05:06.130> matches<00:05:06.580> with<00:05:06.789> them

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
maybe some non-title matches with them

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.110 
maybe some non-title matches with them
or<00:05:07.620> another<00:05:08.620> tag<00:05:08.979> team<00:05:09.220> title<00:05:09.550> shots<00:05:09.820> under

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
or another tag team title shots under

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.420 
or another tag team title shots under
tag<00:05:10.510> team<00:05:10.750> title<00:05:11.110> rematch<00:05:11.380> against<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
tag team title rematch against the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.310 
tag team title rematch against the
shield<00:05:12.669> but<00:05:13.030> one<00:05:13.750> on<00:05:13.870> one<00:05:13.990> year's
