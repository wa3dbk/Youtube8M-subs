00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:06.520
 Today is after d 1 It is Tsukamoto 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.140
 I 'm Kaijima 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:14.410
 Pattern 5 later k 1 came out 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:17.080
 Though it is 2 It is that the first place child 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:24.970
 Picture book intends meet you and Do Gurafikka 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:32.080
 There is a big title , so this is the dismantling new book and dismantling the construction with the new show 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:37.100
 It was dissected as in the present but I'm such that the contents are visible say 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.380
 It is impossible for ordinary architecture to be outside and inside and inside the wall 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.840
 I can not see it at the same time 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.470
 It is such a book that is connected by one drawing 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:53.090
 In general, the problem it means that what Fu to people to behave 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:59.120
 Problem then I mean make to what the wind or assemble the building to what the wind 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 Well it Toka rooftops of problems building from it say what is in the town How so 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.979
 From 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:08.180
 But this kind of city space of the problem is I'm such not be told to separate and grouts 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.740
 The place to be in our best monitoring Well it 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.880
 Not separate but all related after high rise 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.040
 I saw something interesting in the whole 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 There Well architectural Ano 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.100
 There is room for such things as creativity or wisdom 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 What a world or world 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.409
 See at once that sort of is all because the thing there is a feeling that Ikunda make up 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.580
 In the form 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:44.110
 I started to write drawings 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 I used only the house in the last used app version 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:55.300
 Fortunately there are many small buildings, so most of the buildings 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:59.600
 A small building from being cured in about 1/30 white in a plane white in the cross-sectional 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.250
 Though it began also there that Tteyuu what positive can be expressed way because 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:11.510
 Was making in the middle of doing this is by the use Nino how 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:14.180
 If you express it including public architecture or open space etc, then that is the case 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.560
 Than not enough in the two-page spread 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.940
 like this 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.710
 Does not it I bellows fold factored into it this Well then after this what Te do you say 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.930
 There huh 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:29.620
 Jara' Te of more full folding 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.850
 Do you say it is more formal and dynamic 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.920
 The thing that that daring cross section Perth 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.050
 that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.840
 I think it's supposed to be enjoyable One of the reasons why you made this 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.360
 that 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:52.370
 I hope that everyone can experience the pleasure of writing drawings 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:57.530
 I think that the drawing style has changed a lot because the computer came in 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:59.290
 In in're also using no talk themselves to say that the actual Do not use that handle 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.550
 But that 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.900
 That computer 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.490
 To technology 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.569
 Do not leave it alone 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.330
 So Well once in also may be referred to write a claw fun the 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:18.760
 That still intact 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:24.950
 I thought that I wanted to try a method that could be continued 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:27.160
 But in that way I can control what I thought once more freely 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:34.390
 Drawing expression is possible 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:38.050
 What comes into view whether it still put something where or went up the accuracy in the bone surface 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:43.240
 Keep writing while thinking about that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:45.400
 With drawings such as that I can think of something different again again 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.080
 Of the dialogue stand drawings 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.890
 A conversation 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:57.290
 I hope you'll enjoy it and it's the best part of that design, and it's fun to write drawings 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:01.240
 I think so 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:04.000
 How long does this actually take to store ? 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.330
 To finish a piece of picture 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.550
 Well it took about 3 months 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:13.690
 Great variety of processes 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.810
 Every time I go along with everyone and say 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:23.140
 I'm going to check and heal and go home though 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:29.569
 However, the time to do it is still in some sense the length of time 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:33.679
 That wrote the day by that involved the anti-long very long to those referred to as Well one of the drawings 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:37.339
 Can you say that a person is definitely a trace of that thought 

00:04:33.679 --> 00:04:42.349
 It's Nuiru going very left of your impression 

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:43.729
 The corner angle of the nail is still quite physical work even though it is using quite a computer 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.880
 True to Fu say that it 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.969
 There is very to say that went superimposed time 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.470
 I think it is a good experience 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:59.600
 The rebirth of the person who wrote 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.290
 It seems to be a variety of people in Higashinaka It appears in various places where there are no people in it 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.980
 Because 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.449
 What if everyone doing so you are Mase coming proceed their own 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.689
 No work to write that long drawing 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.840
 Naturally I think of things like time after all 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:19.110
 That's why 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.110
 I did not use it, did you have the third one? 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:33.020
 Yes, the third one is over there 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:34.940
 Like a bad school 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:40.150
 There is a story 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.150
 Thank you very much.
