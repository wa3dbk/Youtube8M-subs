canon eos 5d mark ii before we start

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.680 
canon eos 5d mark ii before we start
we're<00:00:36.100> going<00:00:36.190> to<00:00:36.250> run<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.580> target<00:00:37.120> setup<00:00:37.480> to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
we're going to run the target setup to

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.049 
we're going to run the target setup to
make<00:00:37.840> sure<00:00:38.020> that<00:00:38.199> target<00:00:38.949> is<00:00:39.100> in<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.670> correct

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
make sure that target is in the correct

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.689 
make sure that target is in the correct
place<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:41.170> we<00:00:41.379> can<00:00:42.070> see<00:00:42.250> here<00:00:42.430> that<00:00:42.460> we<00:00:42.610> get

00:00:42.689 --> 00:00:42.699 
place and we can see here that we get

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.310 
place and we can see here that we get
the<00:00:42.820> green<00:00:43.030> tick<00:00:43.269> that<00:00:43.480> means<00:00:43.720> that<00:00:43.989> we<00:00:44.140> have<00:00:44.290> a

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
the green tick that means that we have a

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.590 
the green tick that means that we have a
high<00:00:44.559> degree<00:00:44.769> of<00:00:44.949> confidence<00:00:45.190> in<00:00:45.850> our<00:00:46.180> test

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
high degree of confidence in our test

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.899 
high degree of confidence in our test
results<00:00:47.199> at<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.440> end<00:00:47.620> so<00:00:48.550> it's<00:00:48.699> always<00:00:48.820> worth

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
results at the end so it's always worth

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.549 
results at the end so it's always worth
running<00:00:49.269> the<00:00:49.479> target<00:00:49.870> setup<00:00:50.140> before<00:00:50.290> you

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
running the target setup before you

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.930 
running the target setup before you
start<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.800> we're<00:00:53.949> now<00:00:54.040> going<00:00:54.250> to<00:00:54.370> start<00:00:54.729> the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
start so we're now going to start the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.250 
start so we're now going to start the
fully<00:00:55.930> automatic<00:00:56.530> calibration<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.519> our<00:00:57.670> lens

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
fully automatic calibration of our lens

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.469 
fully automatic calibration of our lens
this<00:00:59.260> is<00:00:59.320> a<00:00:59.739> hands-free<00:01:00.519> mode<00:01:00.640> so<00:01:01.180> we're<00:01:01.360> not

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:01.479 
this is a hands-free mode so we're not

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.939 
this is a hands-free mode so we're not
going<00:01:01.629> to<00:01:01.659> have<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.989> touch<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.350> camera<00:01:02.500> during

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
going to have to touch the camera during

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:05.730 
going to have to touch the camera during
the<00:01:03.040> test<00:01:03.250> all<00:01:03.519> Pokal<00:01:04.420> will<00:01:04.629> be<00:01:05.140> controlling

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
the test all Pokal will be controlling

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.080 
the test all Pokal will be controlling
the<00:01:05.799> camera<00:01:05.950> for<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.400> whole<00:01:06.580> of<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:06.820> test

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the camera for the whole of the test

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.450 
the camera for the whole of the test
until<00:01:07.570> we<00:01:08.049> get<00:01:08.229> a<00:01:08.260> value<00:01:08.500> at<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:09.159> end<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:12.250> pho

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
until we get a value at the end so pho

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.670 
until we get a value at the end so pho
Cal<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.790> now<00:01:12.940> taking<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.450> series<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.870> shots<00:01:14.320> and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
Cal is now taking a series of shots and

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.149 
Cal is now taking a series of shots and
is<00:01:14.920> controlling<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.700> AF<00:01:16.030> micro<00:01:16.479> adjustment

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
is controlling the AF micro adjustment

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.590 
is controlling the AF micro adjustment
so<00:01:18.159> we<00:01:18.340> don't<00:01:18.579> need<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.850> worry<00:01:19.000> about<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:19.360> at

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
so we don't need to worry about that at

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.469 
so we don't need to worry about that at
all<00:01:19.810> at<00:01:20.469> pho<00:01:20.950> Cal<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.280> going<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.490> make<00:01:22.270> sure

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
all at pho Cal is going to make sure

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.209 
all at pho Cal is going to make sure
that<00:01:22.509> we<00:01:22.780> get<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> correct<00:01:23.380> value<00:01:23.560> at<00:01:24.009> the<00:01:24.100> end

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
that we get the correct value at the end

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:29.249 
that we get the correct value at the end
of<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:24.520> test<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:28.299> as<00:01:28.420> we<00:01:28.570> can<00:01:28.719> see<00:01:28.780> on<00:01:29.109> this

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
of this test so as we can see on this

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.120 
of this test so as we can see on this
graph<00:01:29.619> here<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:30.100> are<00:01:30.130> homing<00:01:30.670> in<00:01:30.789> on<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
graph here we are homing in on the

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.760 
graph here we are homing in on the
fine-tune<00:01:33.130> value<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:35.049> few<00:01:35.259> moments<00:01:35.439> we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
fine-tune value and in a few moments we

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.550 
fine-tune value and in a few moments we
should<00:01:35.979> get<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.399> result<00:01:37.270> that<00:01:37.390> we<00:01:37.600> can<00:01:37.810> set<00:01:38.109> into

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
should get a result that we can set into

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.690 
should get a result that we can set into
the<00:01:38.680> camera<00:01:39.130> automatically<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> we<00:01:45.369> can<00:01:45.520> see

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
the camera automatically so we can see

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.389 
the camera automatically so we can see
the<00:01:46.109> calculated<00:01:47.109> value<00:01:47.859> for<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.130> micro

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
the calculated value for the micro

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.789 
the calculated value for the micro
adjustment<00:01:48.850> is<00:01:49.030> plus<00:01:49.570> seven<00:01:49.960> so<00:01:50.439> we<00:01:50.530> can<00:01:50.679> hit

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
adjustment is plus seven so we can hit

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.039 
adjustment is plus seven so we can hit
yes<00:01:51.100> here<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:52.119> will<00:01:52.270> set<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.659> value<00:01:52.929> in

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
yes here and that will set the value in

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.359 
yes here and that will set the value in
the<00:01:53.140> camera<00:01:53.499> so<00:01:53.649> we<00:01:53.679> don't<00:01:53.920> need<00:01:54.039> to<00:01:54.189> remember

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
the camera so we don't need to remember

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.429 
the camera so we don't need to remember
to<00:01:54.609> do<00:01:54.729> anything<00:01:54.939> we<00:01:55.840> get<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> little<00:01:56.229> message

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 
to do anything we get a little message

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.370 
to do anything we get a little message
to<00:01:56.670> tell<00:01:57.670> us<00:01:57.789> that<00:01:57.939> we<00:01:58.090> have<00:01:58.240> set<00:01:58.749> that<00:01:59.200> value

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
to tell us that we have set that value

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.459 
to tell us that we have set that value
to<00:01:59.799> plus<00:02:00.249> seven<00:02:00.850> in<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.149> camera<00:02:01.509> we<00:02:02.079> can<00:02:02.229> now

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:02.469 
to plus seven in the camera we can now

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:04.770 
to plus seven in the camera we can now
save<00:02:03.219> this<00:02:03.460> as<00:02:03.729> a<00:02:03.789> report<00:02:04.270> so<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.539> we<00:02:04.630> can

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
save this as a report so that we can

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.279 
save this as a report so that we can
