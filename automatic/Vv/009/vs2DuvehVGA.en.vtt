these<00:00:53.820> o2<00:00:54.030> sockets<00:00:54.750> actually<00:00:55.230> help<00:00:55.440> quite<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
these o2 sockets actually help quite a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.330 
these o2 sockets actually help quite a
bit<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:57.989> see<00:00:58.350> it's<00:00:58.559> specially<00:00:58.920> designed

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
bit you can see it's specially designed

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.520 
bit you can see it's specially designed
to<00:01:00.000> accommodate<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.899> wires<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> o2

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
to accommodate the wires on the o2

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.729 
to accommodate the wires on the o2
sensor<00:01:02.100> by<00:01:02.430> having<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.820> open<00:01:03.180> side<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.739> you

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
sensor by having this open side and you

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.410 
sensor by having this open side and you
can<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.070> use<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> ratchet<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.820> remove<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.240> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
can just use a ratchet to remove it in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.469 
can just use a ratchet to remove it in
some<00:01:06.659> cases<00:01:07.220> using<00:01:08.220> these<00:01:08.549> type<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:08.939> sockets

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
some cases using these type of sockets

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
some cases using these type of sockets
are<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> only<00:01:10.290> way<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> actually<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> o2

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
are the only way to actually get the o2

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.730 
are the only way to actually get the o2
sensor<00:01:11.700> out<00:01:11.960> now<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.020> don't<00:01:13.290> need<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.439> lift

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
sensor out now you don't need to lift

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
sensor out now you don't need to lift
your<00:01:13.890> vehicle<00:01:14.340> but<00:01:15.030> we<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.110> it's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
your vehicle but we do just so it's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
your vehicle but we do just so it's
easier<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> show<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:16.939> here<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:17.970> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
easier to show you here is the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.730 
easier to show you here is the
downstream<00:01:18.810> o2<00:01:19.140> sensor<00:01:19.439> we're<00:01:19.560> going<00:01:19.680> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
downstream o2 sensor we're going to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
downstream o2 sensor we're going to
change<00:01:19.950> today<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:21.960> start<00:01:22.110> off

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
change today and you want to start off

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.179 
change today and you want to start off

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
by just spraying it with some

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.520 
by just spraying it with some
penetrating<00:01:23.700> oil<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.750> letting<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.080> sit<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
penetrating oil and letting it sit for a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.460 
penetrating oil and letting it sit for a
