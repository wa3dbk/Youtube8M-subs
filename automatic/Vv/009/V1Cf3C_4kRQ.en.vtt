mini figures that have not yet seen from

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.700 
mini figures that have not yet seen from
the<00:00:25.350> cells<00:00:25.590> lining<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.130> set<00:00:26.400> because<00:00:26.670> for

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
the cells lining the set because for

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.600 
the cells lining the set because for
1299<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.960> its<00:00:30.960> main<00:00:31.320> set<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.650> features<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.130> tenon

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
1299 so its main set of features a tenon

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
1299 so its main set of features a tenon
which<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.480> some<00:00:33.809> pretty<00:00:34.320> basic<00:00:34.559> in

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
which is some pretty basic in

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
which is some pretty basic in
construction<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.640> does<00:00:35.820> feature<00:00:36.030> for<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
construction it does feature for the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.580 
construction it does feature for the
bracket<00:00:37.500> pieces<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.370> might<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> useful<00:00:38.940> for

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
bracket pieces that might be useful for

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.209 
bracket pieces that might be useful for
builders<00:00:40.590> or<00:00:41.510> into<00:00:42.559> making<00:00:43.559> spaceships<00:00:44.040> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
builders or into making spaceships and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.670 
builders or into making spaceships and
whatnot<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.239> go<00:00:45.390> where<00:00:45.539> these<00:00:45.750> are<00:00:45.930> quite

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
whatnot I go where these are quite

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
whatnot I go where these are quite
useful<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.670> again<00:00:47.789> they<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.090> very

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
useful but then again they are very

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.340 
useful but then again they are very
cheap<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:48.930> think<00:00:49.170> so<00:00:50.840> most<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.020> time<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
cheap and I think so most of the time I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.130 
cheap and I think so most of the time I
just<00:00:52.379> kind<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> been<00:00:52.949> there<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.489> then<00:00:54.140> feel

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
just kind of been there and then feel

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340 
just kind of been there and then feel
your<00:00:55.320> feet<00:00:56.129> three<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:57.000> new<00:00:57.420> one<00:00:58.140> by<00:00:58.289> two

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
your feet three of these new one by two

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.130 
your feet three of these new one by two

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.480 
these sound handles for the plaster so
let's<00:01:37.860> take<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.280> how<00:01:38.340> well<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> works

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
let's take a look at how well it works

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
let's take a look at how well it works
so<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> am<00:01:41.729> very<00:01:41.759> impressed<00:01:42.329> by<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.590> faster

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so I am very impressed by this faster

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.230 
so I am very impressed by this faster
because<00:01:45.799> number<00:01:46.799> one<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.130> shoots<00:01:47.340> very<00:01:47.520> far<00:01:47.820> so

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
because number one is shoots very far so

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.289 
because number one is shoots very far so
I<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:49.110> put<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.409> Box<00:01:49.759> all<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.090> back<00:01:51.240> here

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
I can put the Box all the way back here

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.929 
I can put the Box all the way back here
as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.020> see<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.619> it'll<00:01:52.920> easily<00:01:53.549> go

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
as you can see in then it'll easily go

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.060 
as you can see in then it'll easily go
there<00:01:54.149> with<00:01:54.930> no<00:01:55.049> problems<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.619> can<00:01:55.740> hear

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
there with no problems as you can hear

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.359 
there with no problems as you can hear
that<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.490> makes<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.939> pretty<00:01:57.780> loud<00:01:58.049> noise<00:01:58.369> which

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
that it makes a pretty loud noise which

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.100 
that it makes a pretty loud noise which
means<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.759> is<00:02:00.000> hitting<00:02:00.299> with<00:02:00.479> enough<00:02:00.840> speed

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
means that is hitting with enough speed

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.819 
means that is hitting with enough speed
to<00:02:01.939> cause<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.119> impact<00:02:03.509> but<00:02:03.719> somehow<00:02:04.439> not

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
to cause some impact but somehow not

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.260 
to cause some impact but somehow not
enough<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:06.140> tip<00:02:07.140> over<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.469> minifigure

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
enough to tip over a minifigure

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.870 
enough to tip over a minifigure
I<00:02:09.500> think<00:02:10.500> Lego<00:02:10.830> will<00:02:11.040> have<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> have<00:02:11.400> more

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
I think Lego will have to have more

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.660 
I think Lego will have to have more
weight<00:02:12.210> on<00:02:12.540> these<00:02:13.350> one<00:02:13.620> by<00:02:13.650> one<00:02:13.950> round<00:02:14.370> points

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
weight on these one by one round points

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.460 
weight on these one by one round points
but<00:02:14.850> that's<00:02:15.390> not<00:02:15.600> a<00:02:15.660> major<00:02:15.900> complaint<00:02:16.350> I

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
but that's not a major complaint I

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.130 
but that's not a major complaint I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
functional shoots fire as a mango that

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.650 
functional shoots fire as a mango that
out<00:02:21.930> like<00:02:22.200> along<00:02:23.040> with<00:02:23.220> these<00:02:23.310> rulers

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
out like along with these rulers

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.870 
out like along with these rulers
distance<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.980> let's<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.220> start<00:02:26.760> achieving

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
distance and let's not start achieving

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.770 
distance and let's not start achieving
these<00:02:27.540> flip<00:02:28.020> fire<00:02:28.170> missiles<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> anyways

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
these flip fire missiles so anyways

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600

let's<00:02:31.050> go<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> mini<00:02:32.040> figures<00:02:32.340> which

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
let's go on to the mini figures which

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.340 
let's go on to the mini figures which
are<00:02:32.940> probably<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.570> highlight<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.320> show
