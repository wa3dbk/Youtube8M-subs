grinders<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> bigger<00:00:16.440> grinder

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
grinders a bigger grinder

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.290 
grinders a bigger grinder
like<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.670> 5<00:00:18.060> or<00:00:18.330> 7<00:00:18.570> inch<00:00:18.869> should<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.199> awesome<00:00:20.300> but

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
like a 5 or 7 inch should be awesome but

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.029 
like a 5 or 7 inch should be awesome but
since<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.750> don't<00:00:21.810> have<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.109> I'm<00:00:22.439> using<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.800> four

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
since I don't have one I'm using a four

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.400 
since I don't have one I'm using a four
and<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> half<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> cutoff<00:00:23.910> wheel<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and a half with the cutoff wheel and a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.519 
and a half with the cutoff wheel and a
four<00:00:25.680> inch<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> grinding<00:00:26.789> disc<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.720> to

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
four inch with a grinding disc and to

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
four inch with a grinding disc and to
speed<00:00:28.769> up<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.039> process<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:31.050> take

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
speed up the process what I do is I take

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.549 
speed up the process what I do is I take
the<00:00:31.349> cut-off<00:00:31.619> wheel<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.050> put<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> bunch<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
the cut-off wheel and put a bunch of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.630 
the cut-off wheel and put a bunch of
slit<00:00:34.860> in<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:36.329> lip<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.129> come<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.430> from

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
slit in the lip and then come in from

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
slit in the lip and then come in from
the<00:00:38.760> side<00:00:39.590> this<00:00:40.590> way<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:42.390> cut<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.809> each

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the side this way and cut off each

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.250 
the side this way and cut off each
little<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.270> makes<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.629> see<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.840> cut

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
little two it makes you see a cut

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.690 
little two it makes you see a cut
through<00:00:46.410> less<00:00:46.590> material<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.370> goes<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
through less material and it goes a lot

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690 
through less material and it goes a lot
faster<00:00:48.350> then<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.649> take<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:49.890> 4<00:00:50.579> inch

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
faster then I just take my 4 inch

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.560 
faster then I just take my 4 inch
grinder<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.809> smooth<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:53.570> I'm

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
grinder and smooth it all down I'm

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
grinder and smooth it all down I'm
trying<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.899> get<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.140> smooth<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.649> housing

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
trying to get it smooth to the housing

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
trying to get it smooth to the housing
on<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.489> side<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.969> that<00:00:57.000> when<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.449> does<00:00:57.629> hit<00:00:57.809> on

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
on this side so that when it does hit on

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.510 
on this side so that when it does hit on
rocks<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.530> stuff<00:00:58.739> it'll<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.129> slide<00:00:59.489> right

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
rocks and stuff it'll just slide right

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.880 
rocks and stuff it'll just slide right
off<00:01:00.140> that's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.379> idea

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
off that's the idea

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.570 
off that's the idea
they<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.699> make<00:01:03.680> shave<00:01:04.680> kits<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.220> these<00:01:05.400> where

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
they do make shave kits to these where

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.310 
they do make shave kits to these where
you<00:01:05.670> cut<00:01:05.939> off<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> whole<00:01:06.390> bottom<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> axle

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you cut off the whole bottom of the axle

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.460 
you cut off the whole bottom of the axle
and<00:01:07.470> weld<00:01:07.950> in<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.270> flat<00:01:09.270> plate<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.350> to

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and weld in a flat plate and you have to

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
and weld in a flat plate and you have to
shave<00:01:10.710> your<00:01:11.090> ring<00:01:12.090> gear<00:01:12.330> but<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.900> didn't<00:01:13.260> want

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
shave your ring gear but I didn't want

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
shave your ring gear but I didn't want
to<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.619> into<00:01:13.830> all<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:13.950> nonsense<00:01:14.390> so<00:01:15.390> I'm

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
to get into all that nonsense so I'm

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620 
to get into all that nonsense so I'm
just<00:01:15.689> cutting<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> lip<00:01:16.619> down<00:01:17.119> it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.360> lot

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
just cutting the lip down it's not a lot

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.350 
just cutting the lip down it's not a lot
and<00:01:20.390> quarter<00:01:21.390> maybe<00:01:21.720> half<00:01:22.020> an<00:01:22.200> inch<00:01:22.350> or<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
and quarter maybe half an inch or so and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
and quarter maybe half an inch or so and
it<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.869> differs<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.470> different<00:01:25.770> places

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
it really differs in different places

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
it really differs in different places
but<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:27.540> any<00:01:27.689> little<00:01:27.990> bit<00:01:28.140> will

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but I think any little bit will

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.160 
but I think any little bit will
definitely<00:01:28.740> help<00:01:29.450> make<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.570> thing<00:01:30.810> less<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
definitely help make this thing less of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.179 
definitely help make this thing less of
an<00:01:31.259> anchor<00:01:31.939> so<00:01:32.939> yeah<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.840> doing

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
an anchor so yeah that's what I'm doing

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.420 
an anchor so yeah that's what I'm doing
more<00:01:35.189> videos<00:01:36.290> come<00:01:37.290> soon<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.220> farther

been doing it it doesn't take that much
time<00:02:00.740> that<00:02:01.740> may<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:01.950> spent

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050 
time that may be spent

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.380 
time that may be spent
hmm<00:02:04.050> I<00:02:04.580> don't<00:02:05.580> know<00:02:05.640> I'd<00:02:05.760> say<00:02:05.940> maybe<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.240> half

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
hmm I don't know I'd say maybe a half

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.120 
hmm I don't know I'd say maybe a half
hour<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.900> far<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.560> already<00:02:07.710> got<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.950> half

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
hour so far on this I already got a half

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.930 
hour so far on this I already got a half
