over again but probably probably the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.880 
over again but probably probably the
bigger<00:02:55.030> issues<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:55.959> cost<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.709> kind

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
bigger issues is the cost it can be kind

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.280 
bigger issues is the cost it can be kind
of<00:02:56.920> expensive<00:02:57.130> to<00:02:57.430> eat<00:02:57.550> this<00:02:57.820> way<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.390> they

extended period of time your caloric
needs<00:03:05.410> increase<00:03:06.190> you're<00:03:07.150> going<00:03:07.300> to<00:03:07.360> find<00:03:07.630> that

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
needs increase you're going to find that

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.229

don't<00:03:10.780> exactly<00:03:11.080> match<00:03:11.489> your<00:03:12.489> needs<00:03:12.700> at<00:03:13.000> the

don't exactly match your needs at the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.030 
don't exactly match your needs at the
time<00:03:13.150> especially<00:03:13.780> once<00:03:14.410> you've<00:03:14.530> been<00:03:14.680> out<00:03:14.800> for

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040

a<00:03:15.100> while

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
a while

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.160 
a while
yeah<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> serving<00:03:16.390> side<00:03:16.600> of<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:16.840> can<00:03:17.019> be<00:03:17.140> a

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
yeah the serving side of this can be a

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.680 
yeah the serving side of this can be a
bit<00:03:17.380> awkward<00:03:17.890> and<00:03:18.519> hard<00:03:19.000> to<00:03:19.090> match<00:03:19.300> right

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
bit awkward and hard to match right

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.620 
bit awkward and hard to match right
right<00:03:20.080> exactly<00:03:20.230> right<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.730> final<00:03:22.239> way<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.390> eat

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
right exactly right the final way to eat

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.690 
right exactly right the final way to eat
on<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.840> trail<00:03:23.110> is<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.980> make<00:03:24.130> your<00:03:24.280> own<00:03:24.340> food

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
on the trail is to make your own food

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.970 
on the trail is to make your own food
and<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.300> is<00:03:25.420> essentially<00:03:25.959> where<00:03:26.620> you

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
and this is essentially where you

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.530 
and this is essentially where you
prepare<00:03:27.370> your<00:03:27.519> food<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.180> you<00:03:28.300> normally

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
prepare your food like you normally

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.660 
prepare your food like you normally
would<00:03:28.690> at<00:03:28.900> home<00:03:28.930> maybe<00:03:29.890> make<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.310> pieces

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
would at home maybe make the pieces

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.130 
would at home maybe make the pieces
smaller<00:03:31.000> you<00:03:31.239> don't<00:03:31.390> want<00:03:31.540> big<00:03:31.720> chunks<00:03:31.750> of

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
smaller you don't want big chunks of

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.720 
smaller you don't want big chunks of
anything<00:03:32.530> when<00:03:32.739> you're<00:03:32.890> preparing

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
anything when you're preparing

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.720 
anything when you're preparing
backpacking<00:03:34.330> food<00:03:34.570> and<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:35.560> afterwards<00:03:36.459> you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
backpacking food and then afterwards you

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.509 
backpacking food and then afterwards you
stick<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.330> the<00:03:37.510> dehydrator<00:03:38.050> trays<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.650> you

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
stick it on the dehydrator trays and you

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.759 
stick it on the dehydrator trays and you
dry<00:03:39.760> it<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.180> then<00:03:40.690> you<00:03:40.870> take<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.200> on<00:03:41.320> the<00:03:41.500> trail

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
dry it and then you take it on the trail

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.509
