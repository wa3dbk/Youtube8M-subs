00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
I want to use it as long as I can so

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.429 
I want to use it as long as I can so
what<00:01:17.280> happened<00:01:17.580> um<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.840> was<00:01:19.049> his<00:01:19.200> personal

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
what happened um it was his personal

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160 
what happened um it was his personal
vehicle<00:01:19.830> right<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.939> as<00:01:21.150> he<00:01:21.330> died<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.960> vehicle

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
vehicle right so as he died the vehicle

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
vehicle right so as he died the vehicle
had<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.070> respawn<00:01:23.490> for<00:01:23.820> him<00:01:24.030> because<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.450> i

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
had to respawn for him because it i

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.969 
had to respawn for him because it i
think<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.020> damaged<00:01:25.530> or<00:01:25.680> something

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
think it was like damaged or something

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.640 
think it was like damaged or something
probably<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.810> guess<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.350> going

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
probably this is what my guess is going

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.480 
probably this is what my guess is going
out<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.009> UM<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> literally<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.220> saw<00:01:32.340> my

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
out to UM so I literally you just saw my

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.789
