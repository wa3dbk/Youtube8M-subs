00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.072
 Welcome to Metabolism TV your source of correct information on the metabolism 

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:27.119
 and health. Listen! You have to drink something and sometimes you get a little tired of the water. 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.659
 I am Frank SuÃ¡rez specialist in obesity and metabolism, I want to tell you today that 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:42.809
 options to take, to accompany the food during the day that is not pure water, actually 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.989
 is that when it comes to losing weight, when it comes to improving metabolism, the best thing is 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.190
 the water and you know, we use a formula where you say "how much does my body weigh?" 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.670
 divided by 16 if it is in pounds, if you weigh 160 pounds you divide by 16 and you get 10 glasses 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.890
 of water per day, each bottle of these are like 2 glasses so you get 5 bottles. 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.560
 If it is in kilos then you say "I weigh so many kilos and I divide it by 7 and those are the glasses 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.420
 of water I need "so I weigh 70 kilos I divide it by 7 then they touch me 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.502
 10 glasses of water a day. Now, water is paramount because water increases your metabolism 

00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:21.970
 but a thousand in a hundred, you are going to want to take something that is not water something that has flavor, 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 the perfect one is that you drink a lot of water so that your metabolism rises and you can lose weight, 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 and I improved your skin, let me tell you to improve until the sexual life improves the water, that's 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.450
 in the book out there but anyway, let's talk a little bit because they asked us 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.020
 in Metabolism TV, they asked us some questions, what things can be used as alternatives 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.380
 the water? Let's talk a little bit about that, quickie. Look, an alternative is that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.270
 You can make a lime or lemon juice depending on what you call it in your country, right? 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:58.660
 You drink a glass of water, pour some lime or lemon as you call over there 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:06.979
 If you have cold water better, right? He throws his water, what's wrong? this is very low in 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:14.880
 carbohydrates and well healthy and natural, to sweeten it can use something like "splenda" 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.200
 and if you like you can use the "stivia" which is something more natural right? That would be something 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.360
 as an alternative, a juice made, a soft drink made with lime or lemon and water 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 and an artificial or natural sweetener, whatever you want, that's an alternative. 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.890
 I'm going to give you another, this is one that I invented when I was losing weight, there was a 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.510
 At that moment where I was well chubby I was 60 pounds more, 60 pounds more were like 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.500
 25 kilos was because I got involved in this metabolism and I call him 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.842
 "La metirita" the little lie is this look, I drink water truth, and I spend all day 

00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:59.730
 drinking water but there comes a time when I want to take another little thing that is different, 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.700
 one of the things that I like the most is, in Puerto Rico we say Chinese juice, in other 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.900
 countries call it the correct name that is orange juice, orange, it's orange 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.050
 true? The Chinese as we say in Puerto Rico or orange as it is said with 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.350
 the correct name in other countries, because it is tasty, it is natural sweet but it has a 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.370
 problem is very high in carbohydrates, a glass, a glass of these with Chinese juice or 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.450
 of orange has 26 grams of carbohydrates, 26 grams of carbohydrates is very much. 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.990
 In fact for a diabetic when a diabetic drinks a glass of these orange juice 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.810
 or Chinese juice, the sugar will climb to rise up because it is very strong in 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.672
 carbohydrates, what I do is that I prepare a little lie, a little lie because what 

00:03:43.672 --> 00:03:47.959
 I want is the flavor, then what I have done, I do a little bit, what do I know? 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:57.590
 a quarter, a third, and the rest I fill it with water and now I have a 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:05.110
 lie, the little lie is that they were 26, 27 grams of carbohydrates was reduced to 8 or 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:11.040
 9 grams of carbohydrates, now this has a minimal impact on glucose and insulin 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.060
 of my body therefore will help me lose weight, so there are some alternatives, 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.160
 It can be the juice of lime or lemon, it can be the little lie, the little lie you can 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.690
 do with something else, you can make a juice of anything else, make sure that the juice 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.800
 that you buy is not that commercial type juice that you put inside a thing called 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.289
 "Corn syrupel" corn syrup here in the United States that is terrible, everything sweeten 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.650
 with the damned corn, that is make sure it is some natural juice that does not have 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:51.800
 no extra sweetener added for you to make your little lie and get it low 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:57.499
 in carbohydrates and you can continue to enjoy losing weight and improve health, you know 

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.459
 what? The truth always triumphs.
