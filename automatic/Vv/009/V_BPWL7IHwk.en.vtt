panzergrenadier is making the way across
the<00:01:38.130> shrub<00:01:38.790> line<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.020> see<00:01:40.200> again<00:01:40.440> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the shrub line so you can see again the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.910 
the shrub line so you can see again the
blended<00:01:40.920> turf<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.520> well<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.360> shrubs<00:01:42.920> with

blended turf as well as the shrubs with
sort<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.150> de<00:01:45.869> branchy<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.650> I<00:01:46.680> was

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
sort of the de branchy look that I was

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.030 
sort of the de branchy look that I was
going<00:01:47.010> for<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.390> whole<00:01:48.510> board<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.040> sheer

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
going for and the whole board is a sheer

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.500 
going for and the whole board is a sheer
balance<00:01:50.430> between<00:01:50.549> realism<00:01:50.970> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
balance between realism and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.960 
balance between realism and
functionality<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.470> playability<00:01:52.830> so<00:01:53.280> that's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
functionality and playability so that's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.520 
functionality and playability so that's
kind<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.299> I'm<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.540> try<00:01:54.630> attempting

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
kind of what I'm going to try attempting

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.890 
kind of what I'm going to try attempting
to<00:01:55.650> achieve<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.070> board<00:01:56.310> anyways<00:01:56.869> here<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
to achieve at the board anyways here is

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.170 
to achieve at the board anyways here is
the<00:01:58.320> pawn<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> have<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> as<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.150> see

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
the pawn that I have and as you can see

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.740 
the pawn that I have and as you can see
the<00:02:00.479> texture<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.920> pond<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.580> actually<00:02:03.540> made

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
the texture of the pond is actually made

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.520 
the texture of the pond is actually made
to<00:02:03.930> simulate<00:02:04.350> ways<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.860> well<00:02:05.540> as<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:07.020> blue

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
to simulate ways as well as the blue

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 
to simulate ways as well as the blue
underlay<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.819> fish<00:02:09.209> silhouettes

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
underlay with the fish silhouettes

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.050 
underlay with the fish silhouettes
that's<00:02:10.619> kind<00:02:10.769> of<00:02:10.799> a<00:02:10.890> neat<00:02:11.039> neat<00:02:11.610> feature<00:02:11.849> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
that's kind of a neat neat feature the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.509 
that's kind of a neat neat feature the
board<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.420> my<00:02:12.480> favorite<00:02:12.810> parts<00:02:13.019> anyways

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
board one of my favorite parts anyways

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.420 
board one of my favorite parts anyways
so<00:02:14.519> make<00:02:14.700> our<00:02:14.819> way<00:02:14.909> across<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.920> again

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
so make our way across here just again

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.220 
so make our way across here just again
more<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.819> shrubland<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.629> just<00:02:18.989> bring<00:02:19.110> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
more of the shrubland and just bring you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.940 
more of the shrubland and just bring you
down<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:20.849> kind<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.209> more<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.510> a

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
down so you can get kind of a more of a

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.000 
down so you can get kind of a more of a
angle

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
angle

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.009 
angle
of<00:02:23.129> what<00:02:23.610> up<00:02:23.730> what<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> model<00:02:24.480> would<00:02:24.569> see<00:02:24.780> so

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
of what up what a model would see so

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.080 
of what up what a model would see so
again<00:02:25.709> he'll<00:02:26.189> in<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.430> background<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:26.939> nice

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
again he'll in the background a nice

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.470 
again he'll in the background a nice
pond<00:02:27.709> through<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.799> trees<00:02:29.069> there<00:02:29.370> here's<00:02:30.360> an

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
pond through the trees there here's an

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.119 
pond through the trees there here's an
avid<00:02:30.750> record<00:02:31.049> via<00:02:31.260> chol<00:02:31.470> as<00:02:31.560> well<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:31.980> just

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
avid record via chol as well and I just

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.300 
avid record via chol as well and I just
put<00:02:32.340> him<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.879> simulate<00:02:33.299> how<00:02:34.230> the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
put him here to simulate how the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.589 
put him here to simulate how the
vehicles<00:02:35.310> actually<00:02:35.670> blend<00:02:35.939> into<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.390> shrub

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
vehicles actually blend into the shrub

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.569 
vehicles actually blend into the shrub
so<00:02:36.780> he's<00:02:36.930> got<00:02:37.140> some<00:02:37.319> shrubs<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.829> them<00:02:38.010> as<00:02:38.400> well

so he's got some shrubs on them as well
as<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.819> ground<00:02:39.030> cover<00:02:39.239> it's<00:02:39.599> kind<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.870> neat

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
as the ground cover it's kind of a neat

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.860 
as the ground cover it's kind of a neat
feature<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:41.640> I'll<00:02:41.909> just<00:02:42.060> sorry<00:02:42.629> I<00:02:42.659> pain

like to include in most of my boards and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.069 
like to include in most of my boards and
there<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.519> a<00:02:56.549> little<00:02:56.790> plug<00:02:57.090> that<00:02:57.359> oh<00:02:57.420> how<00:02:57.810> well

looking at there sitting on top of the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.800 
looking at there sitting on top of the
grass<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.310> right<00:03:20.970> down<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.359> it<00:03:21.510> where<00:03:21.659> they

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
grass there right down in it where they

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.240 
grass there right down in it where they
should<00:03:21.989> be<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.349> here's<00:03:23.340> an<00:03:23.459> apple<00:03:23.579> orchard<00:03:23.909> here

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
should be I here's an apple orchard here

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.229 
should be I here's an apple orchard here
some<00:03:26.250> Panther<00:03:26.519> thinking<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:26.879> way<00:03:26.970> through

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
some Panther thinking the way through

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.409 
some Panther thinking the way through
here's<00:03:28.049> just<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.609> crop<00:03:29.609> row<00:03:29.790> encroaching<00:03:30.180> on

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
here's just a crop row encroaching on

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.869 
here's just a crop row encroaching on
the<00:03:30.510> board<00:03:30.720> as<00:03:31.160> well<00:03:32.160> as<00:03:32.250> some<00:03:32.400> hay<00:03:32.579> stocks

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
the board as well as some hay stocks

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.470 
the board as well as some hay stocks
this<00:03:33.599> fields<00:03:33.989> actually<00:03:34.410> been<00:03:34.590> cut<00:03:34.889> down<00:03:35.480> you

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
this fields actually been cut down you

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.710 
this fields actually been cut down you
can<00:03:36.599> see<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> variation<00:03:37.169> in<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.590> color<00:03:37.709> there

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
can see the variation in the color there

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.539 
can see the variation in the color there
so<00:03:39.720> one<00:03:39.989> part<00:03:40.230> is<00:03:40.319> actually<00:03:40.440> even<00:03:40.769> began<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.430> be

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
so one part is actually even began to be

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.180 
so one part is actually even began to be
harvest<00:03:42.060> and<00:03:42.329> of<00:03:43.199> course<00:03:43.440> they've<00:03:43.680> stack<00:03:44.010> that

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
harvest and of course they've stack that

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
harvest and of course they've stack that
up<00:03:44.250> into<00:03:44.699> into<00:03:45.690> hay<00:03:45.840> piles<00:03:46.819> and<00:03:47.819> so<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.269> pan

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
up into into hay piles and so the pan

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
let down at the ground level shot there

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.250 
let down at the ground level shot there
can<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.290> see<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.829> RT<00:04:05.449> into<00:04:06.449> the<00:04:07.019> plugged

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
can you see the RT into the plugged

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.550 
can you see the RT into the plugged
areas<00:04:08.599> again<00:04:09.599> making<00:04:10.049> her<00:04:10.230> way<00:04:10.349> up<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
areas again making her way up to the

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.930 
areas again making her way up to the
hilltop<00:04:10.980> all<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.549> trees<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.909> been

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
hilltop all the trees have been

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.210 
hilltop all the trees have been
magnetized<00:04:12.419> as<00:04:12.900> well<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.409> they're<00:04:13.980> easily

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
magnetized as well so they're easily

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.899 
magnetized as well so they're easily
removable<00:04:15.500> I'll<00:04:16.500> just<00:04:16.829> take<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> tree<00:04:17.729> out<00:04:17.880> here

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
removable I'll just take a tree out here

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:22.460 
removable I'll just take a tree out here
so<00:04:18.389> you<00:04:18.479> can<00:04:18.630> see<00:04:19.729> and<00:04:20.930> there<00:04:21.930> you<00:04:22.019> go<00:04:22.079> there's

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
so you can see and there you go there's

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.320 
so you can see and there you go there's
the<00:04:22.620> magnets<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.250> there's<00:04:23.520> a<00:04:23.669> unit<00:04:23.970> hiding

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
the magnets and there's a unit hiding

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.659 
the magnets and there's a unit hiding
underneath<00:04:24.659> there<00:04:24.990> conveniently<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:25.830> then

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
underneath there conveniently and then

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.230 
underneath there conveniently and then
I'll<00:04:26.760> just<00:04:26.909> place<00:04:27.120> that<00:04:27.150> tree<00:04:27.570> back<00:04:27.810> in<00:04:29.240> into

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
I'll just place that tree back in into

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.940 
I'll just place that tree back in into
the<00:04:30.360> magnet

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
the magnet

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.580 
the magnet
and<00:04:31.070> there<00:04:31.340> we<00:04:31.460> go<00:04:31.900> that's<00:04:32.900> just<00:04:33.020> convenience

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
and there we go that's just convenience

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.370 
and there we go that's just convenience
with<00:04:33.710> gameplay<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:35.030> speaking<00:04:35.900> of<00:04:35.990> hiding

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
with gameplay and speaking of hiding

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.990 
with gameplay and speaking of hiding
down<00:04:36.560> into<00:04:36.950> the<00:04:37.040> trees<00:04:37.340> you<00:04:37.640> should<00:04:37.820> check

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
down into the trees you should check

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.510 
down into the trees you should check
that<00:04:38.150> this<00:04:38.300> was<00:04:38.570> out<00:04:38.750> here<00:04:39.080> and<00:04:39.950> he'll<00:04:40.250> give

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
that this was out here and he'll give

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.880 
that this was out here and he'll give
you<00:04:40.820> sort<00:04:41.390> of<00:04:41.540> what<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> model<00:04:42.260> would<00:04:42.410> be<00:04:42.560> seeing

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
you sort of what a model would be seeing

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.980 
you sort of what a model would be seeing
if<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.190> was<00:04:43.310> looking<00:04:43.550> at<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.760> board<00:04:44.000> so<00:04:44.210> as<00:04:44.600> you

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
if it was looking at the board so as you

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.540 
if it was looking at the board so as you
can<00:04:45.110> see<00:04:45.320> it<00:04:45.410> looks<00:04:45.500> good<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.280> next

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
can see it looks good to have the next

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.160 
can see it looks good to have the next
four<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.830> background<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.510> adds<00:04:50.510> to<00:04:50.840> the<00:04:50.960> game

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
four and background and adds to the game

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.820 
four and background and adds to the game
as<00:04:51.350> well<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:51.890> I<00:04:52.840> so<00:04:53.840> they'll<00:04:53.990> really<00:04:54.290> uh<00:04:54.410> no

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
as well so I so they'll really uh no

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.570 
as well so I so they'll really uh no
further<00:04:54.860> ado<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.520> guess<00:04:55.880> that's<00:04:56.150> just<00:04:57.580> that's

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
further ado I guess that's just that's

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.940 
further ado I guess that's just that's
the<00:04:58.730> board<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.210> nutshell<00:04:59.530> there's<00:05:00.530> there's

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
the board in a nutshell there's there's

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.550 
the board in a nutshell there's there's
a<00:05:01.040> lot<00:05:01.190> more<00:05:01.220> features<00:05:01.520> look<00:05:01.910> at<00:05:02.120> but<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.600> think

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
a lot more features look at but I think

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.710 
a lot more features look at but I think
it'd<00:05:03.650> give<00:05:03.800> you<00:05:03.920> a<00:05:04.010> nice<00:05:04.250> overview<00:05:04.580> and<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.360> did

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
it'd give you a nice overview and I did

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.420 
it'd give you a nice overview and I did
mention<00:05:05.900> about<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.320> plugs<00:05:06.560> earlier<00:05:06.980> and<00:05:07.400> I

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.190
