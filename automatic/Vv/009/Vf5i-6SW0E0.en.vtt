just leave a comment right now and
pretty<00:00:31.949> much<00:00:32.210> what<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.630> mission<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:35.030> when

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
pretty much what this mission is when

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.630 
pretty much what this mission is when
you<00:00:36.120> kill<00:00:36.480> people<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:37.230> get<00:00:37.590> points<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.190> you

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
you kill people you get points and you

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.310 
you kill people you get points and you
have<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.059> get<00:00:39.360> down<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> zero<00:00:39.960> points

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
have to get down to zero points

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.290 
have to get down to zero points
obviously<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:40.920> start<00:00:41.340> out<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.550> 30,000

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
obviously and you start out with 30,000

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.299 
obviously and you start out with 30,000
so<00:00:42.809> like<00:00:42.930> each<00:00:43.110> kill<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.649> goes<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> little

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
so like each kill it goes down a little

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.180 
so like each kill it goes down a little
bit<00:00:44.460> more<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.660> recommend<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.739> either

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
bit more and I recommend that you either

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.729 
bit more and I recommend that you either
keep<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.910> scar<00:00:48.180> or<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.840> another<00:00:49.440> assault

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
keep the scar or get another assault

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
keep the scar or get another assault
rifle<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.309> personally<00:00:50.610> hate<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> scar<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.539> I

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
kind of a camping spot doesn't matter I

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.010 
kind of a camping spot doesn't matter I
no<00:01:10.619> cambies<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.369> noobs<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:12.090> mean<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.510> yeah

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
no cambies for noobs I mean like yeah

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.859 
no cambies for noobs I mean like yeah
but<00:01:13.350> whatever<00:01:14.060> this<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.330> like<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> best<00:01:15.689> way

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
but whatever this is like the best way

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.359 
but whatever this is like the best way
to<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.350> mission<00:01:16.500> done<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.070> it's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
to get the mission done and it's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.700 
to get the mission done and it's
probably<00:01:17.610> most<00:01:17.850> easy<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> easiest<00:01:19.530> way

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
probably most easy it's the easiest way

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
probably most easy it's the easiest way
to<00:01:19.770> get<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.009> done<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:21.619> so<00:01:22.619> eventually<00:01:22.979> he

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to get it done and so eventually he

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
to get it done and so eventually he
moves<00:01:23.640> up<00:01:23.820> into<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.240> hallway<00:01:24.500> you'll<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.799> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
moves up into the hallway you'll see and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
moves up into the hallway you'll see and
he<00:01:26.220> goes<00:01:26.400> prone<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.850> he<00:01:27.000> takes<00:01:27.270> out<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> guys
