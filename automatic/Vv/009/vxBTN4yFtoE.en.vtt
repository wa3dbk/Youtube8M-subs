00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you want and I wanted a ten and a half

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.940 
you want and I wanted a ten and a half
turn<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> motor<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.650> pretty

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
turn so this is the motor it's pretty

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.100 
turn so this is the motor it's pretty
it's<00:02:52.490> actually<00:02:52.820> how<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.150> look<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:53.690> actually

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
it's actually how to look it's actually

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.490 
it's actually how to look it's actually
got<00:02:55.150> it<00:02:56.150> has<00:02:56.360> solder<00:02:56.900> tabs<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:57.320> they're

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
got it has solder tabs but they're

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.670 
got it has solder tabs but they're
actually<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.770> plug<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.780> when<00:02:59.780> I<00:02:59.810> pull<00:03:00.500> that<00:03:00.530> out

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
actually a plug so when I pull that out

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.430 
actually a plug so when I pull that out
I'll<00:03:01.460> show<00:03:01.700> you<00:03:01.760> but<00:03:02.510> this<00:03:02.690> actually<00:03:03.200> I'm

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
I'll show you but this actually I'm

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.200 
I'll show you but this actually I'm
quite<00:03:03.650> impressed<00:03:04.160> this<00:03:04.310> is<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:05.260> revention<00:03:06.260> s

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
quite impressed this is the revention s

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.330 
quite impressed this is the revention s
electronic<00:03:08.210> speed<00:03:08.420> controller<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:10.130> comes

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
electronic speed controller it comes

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.520 
electronic speed controller it comes
with<00:03:10.489> a<00:03:10.520> free<00:03:10.760> USB<00:03:11.090> cable<00:03:12.280> program<00:03:13.280> card<00:03:13.640> and

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
with a free USB cable program card and

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.590 
with a free USB cable program card and
one<00:03:15.530> thing<00:03:15.709> I'm<00:03:15.860> quite<00:03:16.130> impressed<00:03:16.459> about<00:03:16.600> I'll

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
one thing I'm quite impressed about I'll

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.740 
one thing I'm quite impressed about I'll
just<00:03:17.900> zoom<00:03:18.260> in<00:03:18.650> so<00:03:18.980> you<00:03:19.010> fee<00:03:19.330> it's<00:03:20.330> actually

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
just zoom in so you fee it's actually

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.370 
just zoom in so you fee it's actually
Wi-Fi<00:03:21.470> and<00:03:21.830> Bluetooth<00:03:22.550> compatible<00:03:23.270> so<00:03:23.959> for

have the option sorry you can't see the
part<00:03:36.800> numbers<00:03:37.130> too<00:03:37.340> well<00:03:37.820> there<00:03:38.090> but<00:03:38.330> those

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
part numbers too well there but those

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.240 
part numbers too well there but those
are<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.110> part<00:03:39.350> numbers<00:03:39.770> if<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:39.950> can<00:03:40.160> see<00:03:40.370> them

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
are the part numbers if you can see them

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.220 
are the part numbers if you can see them
yeah<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.280> can<00:03:43.670> actually<00:03:43.850> program<00:03:44.510> it<00:03:44.750> through

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
yeah you can actually program it through

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.949 
yeah you can actually program it through
your<00:03:45.590> smart<00:03:45.920> phone<00:03:46.239> which<00:03:47.239> i<00:03:47.390> think<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.900> a

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
your smart phone which i think is a

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.670 
your smart phone which i think is a
pretty<00:03:48.050> freakin<00:03:48.650> cool<00:03:48.680> idea<00:03:49.510> but<00:03:50.510> let's<00:03:50.810> have

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
pretty freakin cool idea but let's have

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:01.309 
pretty freakin cool idea but let's have
a<00:03:51.739> quick<00:03:52.070> let's<00:03:52.550> open<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:53.000> up

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.410 

all<00:04:02.319> righty<00:04:02.469> so<00:04:02.859> I'll<00:04:03.819> just<00:04:04.000> turn<00:04:04.150> that<00:04:04.299> around

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
all righty so I'll just turn that around

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.050 
all righty so I'll just turn that around
say<00:04:04.750> here<00:04:04.959> we<00:04:05.140> have<00:04:05.760> electronic<00:04:06.760> speed

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
say here we have electronic speed

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.000 
say here we have electronic speed
controller<00:04:10.349> I'm<00:04:11.349> actually<00:04:11.530> quite<00:04:11.859> impressed

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
controller I'm actually quite impressed

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.080 
controller I'm actually quite impressed
with<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.609> because<00:04:12.900> because<00:04:13.900> some<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:15.819> comes

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
with it because because some it comes

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.129 
with it because because some it comes
with<00:04:16.449> a<00:04:17.130> Deans<00:04:18.130> plug<00:04:18.519> which<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.509> a<00:04:19.539> big<00:04:19.810> thumbs

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
with a Deans plug which is a big thumbs

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.779 
with a Deans plug which is a big thumbs
up<00:04:20.289> in<00:04:20.500> my<00:04:20.620> book<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:22.320> here<00:04:23.320> are<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:24.100> plugs<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
up in my book and here are the plugs I

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.580 
up in my book and here are the plugs I
mentioned<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.449> you<00:04:25.479> to<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:25.960> earlier

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
mentioned to you to you earlier

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.580 
mentioned to you to you earlier
these<00:04:27.400> actually<00:04:27.910> plug<00:04:28.240> into<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.110> side<00:04:29.320> of<00:04:29.380> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
these actually plug into the side of the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.730 
these actually plug into the side of the
motor<00:04:30.270> now<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> motor<00:04:31.720> actually<00:04:32.050> does<00:04:32.440> have

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
motor now the motor actually does have

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.469 
motor now the motor actually does have
these<00:04:32.979> plugs<00:04:33.310> already<00:04:33.639> on<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.150> we<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.449> to

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
these plugs already on it so we have to

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.839 
these plugs already on it so we have to
pull<00:04:34.810> those<00:04:34.990> out<00:04:35.259> so<00:04:36.250> I<00:04:36.280> could<00:04:36.430> put<00:04:36.550> these<00:04:36.669> ones

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
pull those out so I could put these ones

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.140 
pull those out so I could put these ones
on<00:04:38.639> but<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:41.050> you<00:04:41.590> switch<00:04:41.860> with<00:04:42.280> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
on but you have you switch with the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.960 
on but you have you switch with the
setup<00:04:43.539> button<00:04:45.930> obviously<00:04:46.930> your<00:04:47.699> resistors

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
setup button obviously your resistors

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.870 
setup button obviously your resistors
there's<00:04:49.690> your<00:04:50.039> sense<00:04:51.039> sensor<00:04:51.820> port<00:04:52.800> comes<00:04:53.880> it

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
there's your sense sensor port comes it

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.570 
there's your sense sensor port comes it
comes<00:04:55.479> with<00:04:55.570> double-sided<00:04:55.990> tape<00:04:56.169> already<00:04:56.590> so

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
comes with double-sided tape already so

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.730 
comes with double-sided tape already so
yeah<00:04:57.789> that's<00:04:58.509> the<00:04:59.009> speed<00:05:00.009> controller<00:05:00.340> haven't

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
yeah that's the speed controller haven't

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.040 
yeah that's the speed controller haven't
hooked<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:02.919> up<00:05:03.010> yet<00:05:03.280> so<00:05:06.510> there's<00:05:07.510> not<00:05:07.659> much<00:05:07.840> to

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
hooked it up yet so there's not much to

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.110 
hooked it up yet so there's not much to
go<00:05:08.199> on<00:05:08.229> it<00:05:08.560> but<00:05:08.860> it's<00:05:09.039> a<00:05:09.400> a<00:05:10.560> has<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.800> 40<00:05:12.460> air<00:05:12.729> burst

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
go on it but it's a a has a 40 air burst

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.870 
go on it but it's a a has a 40 air burst
current<00:05:14.010> I'm<00:05:15.010> not<00:05:15.130> sure<00:05:15.280> the<00:05:15.430> continuous

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
current I'm not sure the continuous

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.330 
current I'm not sure the continuous
current<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:17.669> okay<00:05:18.669> so<00:05:18.729> now<00:05:19.210> this<00:05:20.169> is<00:05:20.470> the<00:05:20.710> free

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
current is okay so now this is the free

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.460 
current is okay so now this is the free
USB<00:05:21.880> cable<00:05:23.010> so<00:05:24.010> I'm<00:05:24.370> guessing<00:05:24.760> you<00:05:24.880> hook<00:05:25.180> this

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470 
USB cable so I'm guessing you hook this

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.710 
USB cable so I'm guessing you hook this
into<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:27.820> program<00:05:28.330> card<00:05:30.090> I'm<00:05:31.090> assuming<00:05:31.570> I'm

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
into the program card I'm assuming I'm

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.379 
into the program card I'm assuming I'm
not<00:05:32.020> an<00:05:32.139> expert<00:05:32.500> because<00:05:33.130> I<00:05:33.370> I've<00:05:33.639> only<00:05:33.909> just

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
not an expert because I I've only just

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.469 
not an expert because I I've only just
I<00:05:34.570> only<00:05:35.169> just<00:05:35.380> received<00:05:35.560> it<00:05:35.889> this<00:05:35.979> morning<00:05:36.479> so

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
I only just received it this morning so

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:43.080 
I only just received it this morning so
yeah<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.960> is<00:05:38.020> the<00:05:39.060> program<00:05:40.060> card<00:05:42.060> when<00:05:43.060> it

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
yeah this is the program card when it

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.680 
yeah this is the program card when it
comes<00:05:43.419> with<00:05:43.840> a<00:05:45.780> few<00:05:46.780> minor<00:05:47.050> little<00:05:47.289> some<00:05:48.070> space

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
comes with a few minor little some space

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.360 
comes with a few minor little some space
double<00:05:49.690> sided<00:05:49.870> tape<00:05:50.080> cable<00:05:50.620> ties<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.889> shrink

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
double sided tape cable ties and shrink

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.140 
double sided tape cable ties and shrink
tubing<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:52.750> most<00:05:53.349> importantly<00:05:53.889> it<00:05:54.729> comes

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
tubing and most importantly it comes

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.940 
tubing and most importantly it comes
with

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.780 

the<00:05:59.950> instruction<00:06:00.820> manual<00:06:01.590> now<00:06:02.590> like<00:06:02.920> I<00:06:03.070> say<00:06:03.310> in

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
the instruction manual now like I say in

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:07.560 
the instruction manual now like I say in
load<00:06:04.180> these<00:06:04.770> unboxing<00:06:05.770> videos<00:06:06.070> read<00:06:06.570> the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
load these unboxing videos read the

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.530 
load these unboxing videos read the
manual<00:06:07.960> I<00:06:08.670> did<00:06:09.670> believe<00:06:09.940> it<00:06:10.090> does<00:06:10.240> come

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
manual I did believe it does come

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.080 
manual I did believe it does come
pre-programmed<00:06:11.260> so<00:06:12.220> we<00:06:12.550> can't<00:06:12.790> be<00:06:12.880> just

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
pre-programmed so we can't be just

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.640 
pre-programmed so we can't be just
plug-and-play<00:06:13.300> but<00:06:13.900> if<00:06:14.110> you<00:06:14.230> want<00:06:14.380> to<00:06:14.440> change

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
plug-and-play but if you want to change

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.780 
plug-and-play but if you want to change
settings<00:06:14.950> I<00:06:15.370> do<00:06:16.000> recommend<00:06:16.360> you<00:06:16.600> have<00:06:17.500> a<00:06:17.560> look

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
settings I do recommend you have a look

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.970 
settings I do recommend you have a look

adjustable<00:06:55.660> timing<00:06:56.550> now<00:06:57.550> here<00:06:57.790> are<00:06:57.940> the<00:06:57.970> plugs

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
adjustable timing now here are the plugs

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.650 
adjustable timing now here are the plugs
I<00:06:58.480> was<00:06:58.630> mentioning<00:06:59.430> so<00:07:00.430> these<00:07:00.850> are<00:07:01.120> actually

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
I was mentioning so these are actually

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.600 
I was mentioning so these are actually
plugs<00:07:02.020> that<00:07:04.260> can<00:07:05.260> actually<00:07:05.560> pull<00:07:05.740> out<00:07:05.920> I<00:07:06.190> can

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
plugs that can actually pull out I can

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.440 
plugs that can actually pull out I can
actually<00:07:06.850> pull<00:07:07.030> it<00:07:07.120> out<00:07:07.240> at<00:07:07.330> the<00:07:07.420> moment

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.450 
actually pull it out at the moment

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.230 
actually pull it out at the moment
because<00:07:08.100> they're<00:07:09.100> in<00:07:09.220> quite<00:07:09.460> tight<00:07:09.820> but<00:07:10.090> yeah

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
because they're in quite tight but yeah

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.980 
because they're in quite tight but yeah
so<00:07:10.540> I<00:07:13.080> plenty<00:07:14.080> of<00:07:14.140> cooling<00:07:14.440> holes<00:07:15.780> can't<00:07:16.780> makes

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
so I plenty of cooling holes can't makes
