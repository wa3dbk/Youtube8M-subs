00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.410
 Shimano is probably 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.870
 best known manufacturer of foot pedals 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.549
 It is important to know that not all 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.430
 Shimano products compatible with each other 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.949
 are basically there at shimano 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.849
 two different standards the spd 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.349
 standard and the s &amp; p dsl standard 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.570
 klickpedale klickpedale and klietz 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.669
 after spd standard are not there 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.720
 Compatible with the products after S &amp; P 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.400
 dsl standard 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.260
 they differ in that 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.079
 connection mechanism and in the 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.030
 predominant fields of application spdsl 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.850
 Products are designed for racing bikes 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.280
 spd products for trekking wheels and 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.500
 mountain bikes which additionally confusing 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.750
 It is possible that these two standards 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.130
 each have their own name for their own 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.900
 have quality levels 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.700
 so there is for the spd system 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.920
 designation such as xt or xtr where xtr 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.890
 high quality is about more money 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.830
 costs as x-th for the shimano spd sl 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.470
 system there are terms like 105 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.710
 ultegra or grace being ultegra 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.020
 High quality is as 105 and Jurassic ace 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.860
 higher quality than ultegra the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 quality levels xt and ultegra or xtr 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.950
 and blu rays are about 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.200
 comparable 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.909
 so much for clarification of terms in schumann 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.770
 products much more important than 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.530
 different quality levels and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.630
 standards, however, is the question 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.480
 what requirements and needs 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.030
