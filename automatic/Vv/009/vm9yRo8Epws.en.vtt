00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.830
 good hello to all youtube friends i am 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.549
 to wish the 98 and today I bring you a 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.420
 small review of an application called 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.000
 run manager prof 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.350
 what this application is 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500
 application consists of good 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.480
 operation of android mobiles 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:27.859
 well at the top we have the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 clear title can not miss that and below 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.360
 where it says active and I have the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.150
 option for more memory but there are 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.270
 several options as more balanced 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:41.300
 Free memory and multitasking game 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.060
 intensive intensive multiple by default 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.520
 and customized the balanced for the 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.770
 daily user of the sandro mobiles more 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.040
 Free memory is for the ram 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.100
 do not fill up more multitasking you can 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.640
 say that he manages to run chiapas apps 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.980
 both 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.650
 the intensive game is to play 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 those games that need their 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 android mobile the ram and the silala do not 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.860
 fill them 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.380
 multitalent is as its name says it is 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.539
 to run many apps at once 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.200
 the default I imagine is the one 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.969
 bring the custom application 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.549
 is for those used that you like 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.380
 Apply this customize the 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.439
 operation of this application 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.360
 well the option of extra we have to apply 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.210
 in the boot locks the launcher 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:41.009
 free memory clean drugs in 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.530
 web size vga web files 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.890
 death information I recommend them 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:52.150
 select the option to apply first 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.580
 at the start so that all 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.580
 everything you have selected is in 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.860
 fast working 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.160
 the blanchett block to prevent 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.940
 unexpected beginnings and release memories 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.300
 to free the memory the ram 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.610
 clean them cachet drap or release clean 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.810
 rather the cache of the pages the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.810
 web size 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:22.380
 is for the maximum size of what can 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.360
 occupy an application in ram good as 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.650
 to observe I have a maximum you 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:32.510
 you can calculate it true 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.329
 a certain size could be said and good 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.150
 that is already a matter of one 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:41.180
 once they select the size they 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.310
 ask for a reboot but confirm and ready 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.700
 your android mobile are working 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.730
 the web files you could say that 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.670
 increases ram memory but actually 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.299
 do not increase it eye people I'm 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.050
 saying it does not really increase it is a 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.540
 file that remain on the sd card 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.930
 what is this file for? 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.370
 games rather for those games that 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:15.380
 need too much memory this is the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:18.620
 same game grab this swap file or 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:22.550
 this file and just grab it 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.430
 that he lacks of ram good memory 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.770
 this would be all I say goodbye 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:35.140

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.140
