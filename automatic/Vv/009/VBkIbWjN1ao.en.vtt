what we've been served is a real
shortened<00:00:39.450> version<00:00:39.870> sometimes<00:00:40.770> even<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.190> vine

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
shortened version sometimes even a vine

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490

video<00:00:41.790> most<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> videos<00:00:43.140> that<00:00:43.170> use

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
video most of the videos that use

dropping<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> minute<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.879> 28<00:00:45.329> seconds

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
dropping is like a minute in 28 seconds

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
dropping is like a minute in 28 seconds
it<00:00:46.620> wouldn't<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:46.980> such<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.280> problem<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> fan

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it wouldn't be such a problem to a fan

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.389 
it wouldn't be such a problem to a fan
like<00:00:48.480> myself<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:49.200> they<00:00:49.440> were<00:00:49.500> longer<00:00:49.860> videos

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
like myself if they were longer videos

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.420 
like myself if they were longer videos
like<00:00:51.149> if<00:00:51.300> he<00:00:51.420> was<00:00:51.449> dropping<00:00:51.870> four<00:00:52.559> episodes<00:00:53.219> of

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
like if he was dropping four episodes of

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520 
like if he was dropping four episodes of
equals<00:00:53.850> three<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.329> actually<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.260> env

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
equals three and actually have env

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
equals three and actually have env
equals<00:00:56.100> three<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.610> don't<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.000> most<00:00:57.300> people

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
equals three I don't think most people

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.389 
equals three I don't think most people
would<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> problem<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> fact<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
would have a problem but the fact that

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
would have a problem but the fact that
it's<00:00:59.640> only<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.210> bar<00:01:00.449> video<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.170> he's

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's only one bar video that he's

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.799 
it's only one bar video that he's
reviewing<00:01:01.739> now<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> an<00:01:03.270> issue<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
reviewing now it's a bit of an issue and

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
reviewing now it's a bit of an issue and
if<00:01:04.470> ray<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:04.920> paying<00:01:05.250> attention<00:01:05.369> if<00:01:05.970> he<00:01:06.119> looks
