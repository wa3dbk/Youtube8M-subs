00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the past we're really determined by an

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.440 
the past we're really determined by an
arms<00:00:52.470> race<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> was<00:00:53.610> based<00:00:53.880> on<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> lot<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
arms race and that was based on a lot of

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.049 
arms race and that was based on a lot of
situations<00:00:55.340> probably<00:00:56.340> limitations<00:00:56.880> of<00:00:56.970> the
