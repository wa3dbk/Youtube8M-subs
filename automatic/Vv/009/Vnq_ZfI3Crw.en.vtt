00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.450
 Good, I just installed the eight 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:14.059
 sds in the ark of noé 12345678 né 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.059
 such painting samsung to colonel 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.520
 the two cables connected at the time 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:29.060
 cute and such arrived alone I'm going 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:35.460
 prepare the king of now recognized 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:44.600
 all ssds 840 prone 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:44.600
 The second step is to create the 2007 King 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:01:00.500
 level of the January 10 performance river 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:05.220
 the space will be in 1960 gigas not to mess 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.530
 that the right volume now a setback of 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 Let's meet now and do the following 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.600
 let's prepare the machine to install the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.600
 Windows 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.720
 only loses who is reading the round of the 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.650
 time nor pitch pten for 30 seconds 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.650
 more or less, right 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.520
 already found 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:50.330
 894 GB of disk space is because 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.330
 a little bit right 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.359
 the system is not 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.620
 the last title of the future 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:20.150
 with a taboo title 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:20.150
 I do not know how to drink and that's it. 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.100
 good after riding my now show 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.040
 results for you, right? 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.520
 we ran tests every test I gave 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.390
 type has long been a methodology for 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:44.590
 show some numbers than this network 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:52.340
 is able to do in the first one the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.230
 crystal martin 2745 reading and 3,006 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.560
 of writing 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.830
 here is mine I used a small file o 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.500
 result to be dependent even on the 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.180
 cache 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.940
 it means that if you increase the size 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:12.560
 of the file is the result would lead the people 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:18.350
 it's that high so oo ssd 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:23.270
 he and mine is here showed me 3425 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:31.269
 reading 3332 honey too much 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.269
 strong now by hearing the result was 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:38.989
 2253 read and 2,500 writing dowry 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.100
 and now here 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:48.970
 this one is pretty interesting 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.970
 team dodô mark el ss by eli lilly 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:00.320
 it was transfer 4593 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:05.600
 I still do not know if it's the limit 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.820
 this set also won the motherboard 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:12.019
 I'm using is the geni that area 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.230
 here she is she uses the pci interface 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.320
 express 2.0 né 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.560
 probably if I switch to a 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.700
 platform v 77 the result will be a 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:28.450
 little better on better than better 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.560
 People are going to go from there later, right? 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.430
 after which are also the tests 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.650
 preliminary 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.260
 the way that I have here analyze more 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.670
 some results to later give a 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.660
 final verdict right 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.160
 if that rate was the highest rate I 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.520
 I could reach you 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.310
 you can improve even more 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.580
 regardless of my 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.150
 logical that believing 4s does not 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.330
 substantial gain mainly on the 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.520
 writing 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 after another windows is not yet 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.220
 optimized 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.470
 The way the law is I just put it 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.050
 motherboard drives the drivers of 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.570
 video and ran these tests 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.180
 it is logical that it is still possible to use 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.060
 enough to be able to leave 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.180
 round or going to people to analyze and 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.140
 It is then we can kind dalva and said 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.730
 that we can expect from this set 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.120
 It's more to kill the curiosity of the galley. 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.190
 huh 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:39.700
 the performance of 8s of 5 840 itself 128 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:41.920
 samsung in network in reserve and then the 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.550
 people will continue to add this 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:49.600
 transfer to reach the 16 I 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:51.790
 I intend to mount until I have a machine 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.890
 That's it for now, that's mine. 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.690
 results are to leave my I go 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.500
 posting here on the new youtube channel 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.810
 or at the company's criminal coffee forum 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.440
 deed was worth again and even 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.440
 own galley
