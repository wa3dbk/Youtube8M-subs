the way you avoid that there's only one

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.030 
the way you avoid that there's only one
way<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> avoid<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.540> ratings<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.920> be

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
way to avoid it ratings have to be

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.380 
way to avoid it ratings have to be
paramount<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.570> a<00:02:22.040> top<00:02:23.040> priority

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
paramount they have to be a top priority

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.730 
paramount they have to be a top priority
over<00:02:24.390> everything<00:02:24.570> in<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.110> game<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.650> this

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
over everything in the game for this

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.600 
over everything in the game for this
game<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:25.980> be<00:02:27.080> balanced<00:02:28.080> if<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.950> ratings<00:02:29.160> don't

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
game to be balanced if the ratings don't

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.700 
game to be balanced if the ratings don't
matter<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.300> have<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.990> know<00:02:31.110> teams<00:02:31.440> but

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
matter and you have you know teams but

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.320 
matter and you have you know teams but
bad<00:02:31.920> if<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.400> Denver<00:02:32.850> looking<00:02:33.180> like

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
bad if you have Denver looking like

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.770 
bad if you have Denver looking like
Seattle<00:02:33.870> on<00:02:33.990> defense<00:02:34.940> what<00:02:35.940> will<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.570> they

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
Seattle on defense what will you they

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.240 
Seattle on defense what will you they
did<00:02:36.990> get<00:02:37.140> better<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.410> offseason<00:02:37.710> our<00:02:37.920> defense

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
did get better in offseason our defense

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.980 
did get better in offseason our defense
so<00:02:38.370> maybe<00:02:38.520> I<00:02:38.580> said<00:02:38.820> that's<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.150> bad<00:02:39.330> case<00:02:39.570> if<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
so maybe I said that's a bad case if you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.780 
so maybe I said that's a bad case if you
have<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.200> Dallas<00:02:40.470> Cowboys<00:02:40.860> who<00:02:41.070> had<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.220> you

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
have the Dallas Cowboys who had a you

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.940 
have the Dallas Cowboys who had a you
know<00:02:41.820> wanted<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.300> historic<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.530> know<00:02:43.650> bad

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
know wanted a historic you know bad

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.390 
know wanted a historic you know bad
defenses<00:02:44.610> looking<00:02:45.210> like<00:02:45.360> Seattle<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.840> defense

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
defenses looking like Seattle on defense

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.680 
defenses looking like Seattle on defense
then<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.550> means<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.910> ratings<00:02:48.240> don't<00:02:48.420> matter

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
then that means the ratings don't matter

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.110 
then that means the ratings don't matter
so<00:02:49.260> other<00:02:50.130> than<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.400> if<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.850> get<00:02:50.940> that

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
so other than that if they can get that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.430 
so other than that if they can get that
right<00:02:51.330> yeah<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.750> game<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.050> looking<00:02:52.260> good<00:02:52.380> but

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
right yeah the game is looking good but
