here at e3 we announced the xbox elite

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:15.369 
here at e3 we announced the xbox elite
wireless<00:00:11.379> controller

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.510 

what<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.470> did<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.859> we<00:00:16.890> took<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.220> basic

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
what we did was we took the basic

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640 
what we did was we took the basic
controller<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:17.939> have<00:00:18.090> today<00:00:18.240> add<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.529> it

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
controller we have today add it on to it

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.510 
controller we have today add it on to it
and<00:00:19.800> improve<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:22.039> think<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> first

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
and improve this I think the first

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.700 
and improve this I think the first
comment<00:00:23.970> i<00:00:24.210> always<00:00:24.480> get<00:00:24.599> is<00:00:24.810> it's<00:00:25.020> heavier<00:00:25.289> and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
comment i always get is it's heavier and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.890 
comment i always get is it's heavier and
it<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.130> most<00:00:26.730> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.939> things<00:00:27.180> we've<00:00:27.390> added<00:00:27.630> our

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
it is most of the things we've added our

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
it is most of the things we've added our
steel<00:00:28.169> when<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.710> add<00:00:28.829> these<00:00:29.039> higher<00:00:29.220> quality

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
steel when you add these higher quality

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.030 
steel when you add these higher quality
parts<00:00:30.090> you're<00:00:30.629> going<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.840> add<00:00:30.960> weight<00:00:31.200> this

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
parts you're going to add weight this

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.680 
parts you're going to add weight this
controller<00:00:32.489> you're<00:00:32.850> not<00:00:33.000> breaking<00:00:33.210> it's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
controller you're not breaking it's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
controller you're not breaking it's
built<00:00:33.960> tough<00:00:34.200> it's<00:00:34.469> built<00:00:34.710> strong<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.460> it's

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
built tough it's built strong and it's

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.880 
built tough it's built strong and it's
not<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.510> we're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:37.230> back<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.379> when<00:00:37.860> we

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
not going to we're going back to when we

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.740 
not going to we're going back to when we
working<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.309> pros<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> top-level<00:00:39.180> gamers

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
working with pros and top-level gamers

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.600 
working with pros and top-level gamers
people<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.110> put<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> series<00:00:40.800> hours<00:00:41.190> one

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
people that put in the series hours one

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
people that put in the series hours one
of<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> biggest<00:00:42.000> complaints<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of the biggest complaints is there's a

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
of the biggest complaints is there's a
wear<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.770> issue<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.699> competing<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
wear out issue when I was competing I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.910 
wear out issue when I was competing I
would<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.660> through<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> controller<00:00:46.350> every

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
would go through a controller every

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.740 
would go through a controller every
three<00:00:47.160> months<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.730> wear<00:00:47.970> and<00:00:48.090> tear<00:00:48.210> from<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
three months the wear and tear from the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
three months the wear and tear from the
analog<00:00:49.050> sticks<00:00:49.470> would<00:00:49.829> just<00:00:50.130> make<00:00:50.460> your

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
analog sticks would just make your

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.550 
analog sticks would just make your
controller<00:00:51.030> really<00:00:51.360> grind<00:00:51.720> around<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.410> edges

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 
controller really grind around the edges

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.100 
controller really grind around the edges
so<00:00:53.310> your<00:00:53.460> analog<00:00:53.760> stick<00:00:54.120> wouldn't<00:00:54.450> be<00:00:54.540> able<00:00:54.630> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
so your analog stick wouldn't be able to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
so your analog stick wouldn't be able to
like<00:00:55.290> have<00:00:55.470> that<00:00:55.620> smooth<00:00:55.980> transition<00:00:56.640> when

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
like have that smooth transition when

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
like have that smooth transition when
you're<00:00:56.880> aiming<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.270> someone<00:00:57.630> what<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.079> did<00:00:58.290> was

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you're aiming at someone what we did was

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.130 
you're aiming at someone what we did was
we<00:00:58.620> actually<00:00:58.770> inserted<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> low<00:00:59.850> friction

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
we actually inserted this low friction

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.710 
we actually inserted this low friction
material<00:01:01.140> into<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.950> top<00:01:02.130> housing<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:03.329> when

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
material into the top housing that when

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.479 
material into the top housing that when
mixed<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.259> steel<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.250> almost

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
mixed with the steel you get almost

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.910 
mixed with the steel you get almost
nowhere<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.450> feel<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> buttery<00:01:07.590> smooth

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
nowhere the feel is a buttery smooth

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.630 
nowhere the feel is a buttery smooth
feel<00:01:09.590> when<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.619> first<00:01:10.890> started<00:01:11.280> using<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
feel when I first started using the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.760 
feel when I first started using the
controller<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.329> was<00:01:12.509> a<00:01:12.540> bit<00:01:12.750> skeptical<00:01:13.140> once<00:01:13.649> I

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
controller I was a bit skeptical once I

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
controller I was a bit skeptical once I
gave<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> shot<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.610> realized<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:15.600> big<00:01:15.869> an

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
gave it a shot I realized how big an

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
gave it a shot I realized how big an
advantage<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:16.979> give<00:01:17.159> me<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.969> do<00:01:18.329> so

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
advantage it would give me you can do so

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.690 
advantage it would give me you can do so
much<00:01:18.840> with<00:01:18.899> it<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.229> map<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:19.979> many<00:01:20.159> buttons<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
much with it and map so many buttons a

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.550 
much with it and map so many buttons a
different<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.209> there's<00:01:21.600> no<00:01:21.899> controller<00:01:22.350> out

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
different way there's no controller out

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.340 
different way there's no controller out
there<00:01:22.770> like<00:01:22.920> this<00:01:23.189> there<00:01:23.789> will<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.509> xbox

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
there like this there will be a xbox

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.319 
there like this there will be a xbox
elite<00:01:25.530> adjustability<00:01:26.280> application<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
elite adjustability application that

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.819 
elite adjustability application that
will<00:01:27.630> come<00:01:27.899> with<00:01:28.079> this<00:01:28.109> would<00:01:28.649> be<00:01:28.709> something

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
will come with this would be something

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.679 
will come with this would be something
that<00:01:28.979> works<00:01:29.219> on<00:01:29.459> your<00:01:29.490> console<00:01:30.179> and<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.539> can

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
that works on your console and you can

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.300 
that works on your console and you can
directly<00:01:31.020> communicate<00:01:31.499> with<00:01:31.649> it<00:01:31.770> that<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.219> how

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
directly communicate with it that is how

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
directly communicate with it that is how
you'll<00:01:32.490> remap<00:01:32.999> the<00:01:33.270> controller<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:34.170> will<00:01:34.259> be

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you'll remap the controller you will be

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
you'll remap the controller you will be
able<00:01:34.469> to<00:01:34.619> adjust<00:01:35.009> your<00:01:35.310> ATX<00:01:35.670> why's<00:01:35.850> your

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
able to adjust your ATX why's your

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
able to adjust your ATX why's your
digital<00:01:36.359> inputs<00:01:36.749> your<00:01:36.929> deep<00:01:37.109> as<00:01:37.289> your<00:01:37.469> bumpers

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
digital inputs your deep as your bumpers

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.139 
digital inputs your deep as your bumpers
your<00:01:37.950> triggers<00:01:38.249> will<00:01:38.429> all<00:01:38.579> be<00:01:38.789> able<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.029> be

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
your triggers will all be able to be

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.699 
your triggers will all be able to be
remapped<00:01:39.539> we<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.170> actually<00:01:40.319> store

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709 
remapped we will actually store

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:42.709 
remapped we will actually store
everything<00:01:41.039> on<00:01:41.249> the<00:01:41.369> controller<00:01:41.759> itself<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
everything on the controller itself it's

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:44.330 
everything on the controller itself it's
not<00:01:42.869> stored<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.289> the<00:01:43.380> console<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.069> means

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
not stored in the console which means

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.849 
not stored in the console which means
there's<00:01:44.789> no<00:01:44.909> lag<00:01:45.149> anything<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.139> adjust<00:01:46.560> in

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
there's no lag anything you adjust in

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.949
