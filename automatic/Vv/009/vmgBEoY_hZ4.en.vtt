00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.440
 the usb has spread through virtually 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.660
 all electronic devices 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.460
 one of the easiest to interconnect different strands oudeh transferred 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.959
 from side to side 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:15.010
 now with 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.560
 sbt will change and gain even more speed 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:29.399
 today you can state 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:31.699
 everyone has heard of the accident 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.090
 this acronym became famous for having practically all the devices that 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.160
 can be connected to a computer or to one of its ports 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.250
 but if it means your universe good 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.370
 a free translation portal would be universal ' 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.260
 and usb connections are traditionally identified as excessive 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.680
 but because we are coming back to talk about something that has already become so common 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480
 remember that the accident will change what will change a lot 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.590
 probably the sp you have on your computer nowadays is the sp2 point 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.019
 zero 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.609
 it hit the market in April 2000 and replaced the first version is to know 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:14.690
 a little that had already reached the market four years earlier in 1996 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.290
 the difference between them 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.290
 basically speed while the first ones were able to transmit 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.490
 modest 12 megabits per second, the 2 point version 0 can already 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.420
 transmit 480 megabits at speed enough to traffic 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.670
 pictures and even videos 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.920
 only speed is never too much 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.180
 that the new version comes to prove the sbt three points were achieved 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 transmit up to 5 gigabits per second 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 ten times more 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.470
 if the human being always wants more 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.790
 Then we used to feel what we are looking for 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.280
 resolution the photos then any 32 mega 64 half 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.710
 was enough 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.220
 only today 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.580
 technology makes us suffer mokai definitive tb 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.350
 and when we say we will define if we understand 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.350
 We're talking about 20-30 g files. 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.979
 and this with the dry air current stores gets sent to me 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.009
 so it is necessary for a new technology 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:21.009
 that supports this quantity sold 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.790
 the intention is one of the companies that developed the new Mr. 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.090
 he was presented to the specialized press last year version 3 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.930
 points 0 of the device won a new symbol lets quiet 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:37.730
 there are already some prototypes 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.410
 earlier this Friday than the second half of 2009 the first 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.449
 devices like that of 3 0 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:50.479
 and other products actually start now when being attended Scenario Scenario 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.479
 and in early 2010 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.770
 there are many challenges facing the new usb 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.090
 the current two-point version 0 requires fast processors to handle the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.779
 message 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:05.789
 if the new version what to expect of all this speed 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.889
 well in practice the following story 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.910
 all new processors mainly from the foreign 7 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.270
 are already prepared to work perfectly with the new device 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:19.639
 But not only that 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.390
 duck was developed usb 3 0 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.390
 We had several concerns to see 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.349
 that were taken in the project the first of it was the energy consumption the second 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:36.709
 third-party security and with what business skill 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:42.159
 make a thousand trilogy as I am more arduous more speed become hi and 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.469
 sedex three were more reliable 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:50.299
 lins more than efficient this more darts we eat energy consumption 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.650
 now you ask will be that my pen drive how will work in the new 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.079
 doors the answer is yes although the clubs are a little different from them 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.760
 are compatible in crisis 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.739
 the usb 3 points 0 has the same structure as the previous one but it shows some kilos 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.469
 extras 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.259
 and the flash drives or three-point flash memories were to be sold in 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.129
 buildings along with the new clubs are also much faster but 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:20.410
 so they will stop working at the club two points 0 in the tests made in 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:25.050
 laboratory a file of 16 gigs, for example, which took almost nine minutes 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.520
 to be copied with usd 2 points 0 will only take 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.490
 53 seconds with the three point version 0 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.059
 developing the television 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.839
 the pipes and the cameras the scenarios, right? 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.330
 the technology that will transmit the sides because for us today it is fundamental 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.650
 have the devices that we listen in sync then you can reach the 

00:04:51.649 --> 00:04:56.809
 my house ate hi-5 cell phone a nissan and acted thus with polished beads with 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:59.379
 this to my videos efficiently 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:03.400
 It's no use coming home, waiting for stories to happen in synchronism. 

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:09.039
 so with sbt 0 the idea is that if this synchronism between 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:12.039
 devices takes place in a few minutes 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.810
 o the ports as display 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.879
 on any computer 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:20.689
 want to know more thoroughly these technologies years 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:23.959
 the process now look digital counts on the pr speak
