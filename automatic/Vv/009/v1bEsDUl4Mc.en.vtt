with<00:01:43.280> their<00:01:43.399> kisses<00:01:47.680> go<00:01:51.189> two-handed<00:01:52.189> sketches

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
with their kisses go two-handed sketches

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.850 
with their kisses go two-handed sketches
are<00:01:52.759> allowed<00:01:53.030> but<00:01:53.659> are<00:01:54.079> destroyed<00:01:54.500> for<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
are allowed but are destroyed for the

are allowed but are destroyed for the
sake<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.159> running

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.200 

like<00:02:00.790> our<00:02:01.630> sins<00:02:01.960> is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.410 

we<00:02:08.210> have<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.509> solve<00:02:08.780> it<00:02:08.960> so<00:02:10.150> what<00:02:11.150> you're<00:02:11.330> gonna

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
we have to solve it so what you're gonna

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.720
