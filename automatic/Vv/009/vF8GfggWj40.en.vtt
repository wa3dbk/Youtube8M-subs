level five lute player and to gain level

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.629 
level five lute player and to gain level
five<00:00:12.150> balute<00:00:12.570> playing<00:00:12.960> abilities<00:00:13.440> you<00:00:14.370> must

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
five balute playing abilities you must

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.120 
five balute playing abilities you must
first<00:00:15.059> unlock<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.630> in<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> road<00:00:16.859> to

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
first unlock it in the on the road to

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.450 
first unlock it in the on the road to
rule<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.670> believe<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.570> costs<00:00:18.779> 85<00:00:19.590> guild<00:00:20.070> seals

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
rule I believe it costs 85 guild seals

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
rule I believe it costs 85 guild seals
so<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.480> might<00:00:21.600> take<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.109> bit<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.380> time<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
so it might take a little bit of time to

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.570 
so it might take a little bit of time to
save<00:00:23.070> up<00:00:23.220> for<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.840> but<00:00:24.840> for<00:00:25.590> places<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.310> tuna

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
save up for it but for places the tuna

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.880 
save up for it but for places the tuna

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.849 
so far I just tried one city just as a
trial<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.519> it's<00:00:30.359> super<00:00:31.019> easy<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.560> because

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
just the gold multiplier one and then it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.760 
just the gold multiplier one and then it
shows<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.660> progress<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.469> quit<00:00:37.680> it

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.630 

three<00:04:27.170> out<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.320> four<00:04:30.100> eyes<00:04:31.100> back<00:04:31.430> out

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
three out of four eyes back out

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.140 
three out of four eyes back out
something<00:04:32.420> to<00:04:32.450> do<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:33.550> it's<00:04:34.550> looked<00:04:34.880> it

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
something to do that it's looked it

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.300 
something to do that it's looked it
looks<00:04:35.390> really<00:04:35.690> mix<00:04:36.320> again<00:04:36.470> look<00:04:36.800> really<00:04:37.130> bad

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
looks really mix again look really bad

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.480 
looks really mix again look really bad
out<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> loop<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.860> going<00:04:39.860> right<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.460> the

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
out of the loop is going right to the

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.280 
out of the loop is going right to the
soup<00:04:40.880> that<00:04:41.210> makes<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:42.100> not<00:04:43.100> so<00:04:43.160> cool<00:04:44.290> lastly

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
soup that makes it not so cool lastly

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.160 
soup that makes it not so cool lastly
city<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.800> aurora<00:04:46.840> Frank<00:04:47.840> Frank<00:04:48.140> BAM

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.430 

foreground<00:04:53.300> and<00:04:54.300> then<00:04:54.810> I<00:04:54.840> believe<00:04:55.170> it's<00:04:55.320> only

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
foreground and then I believe it's only

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.310 
foreground and then I believe it's only
five<00:04:55.800> gamerscore<00:04:56.280> so<00:04:58.100> it's<00:04:59.100> pretty<00:04:59.370> lame<00:04:59.610> but

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
five gamerscore so it's pretty lame but

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.720 
five gamerscore so it's pretty lame but
super<00:05:01.320> easy<00:05:01.440> so<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.860> guess<00:05:02.100> it's<00:05:02.280> why<00:05:02.400> it's<00:05:02.430> only

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
super easy so I guess it's why it's only

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.490 
super easy so I guess it's why it's only
five

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500
