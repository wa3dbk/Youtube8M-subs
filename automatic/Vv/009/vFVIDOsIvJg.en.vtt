00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:17.400
 very well to get van Buyten 2 0 of parquet to port we come to the spot 

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:19.089
 to the last word 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.029
 and two assists the pop world 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.869
 the recession 2 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.869
 4 7 he can fit that word 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.050
 AG AUA we can retrieve all commands as we can 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.670
 with the mouse wheel up and the gold is not immortal against money 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.890
 yes and so many other members of the 1 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.780
 their old and here 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.440
 this c-square at also under me, of course, has already made him here 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.069
 and what happens 

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:52.400
 this part 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.180
 Well we do it here in the team hotel and of course 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.800
 again 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.100
 EC Staudt who for order that means we open on 4 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.400
 our problem team against Ghana Inden 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.430
 Otmar old and it gets difficult and hit promptly with the smart 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.789
 is unpacking 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:13.549
 program 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.390
 your choice 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.390
 I reloaded her for it now 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.450
 so 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 while to school 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.180
 one also opens up to make these more expensive 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 that means we need the complete content 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.330
 actually designed for that exactly like you do not 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.940
 just works that varies xte just taken many files 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.970
 the natural one is really just thinking about a Schepp 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 yes on 8 and 10 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.930
 because take a little bit 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.490
 so 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 the man makes little progress 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.419
 According to the mirror, sneakers 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.289
 quarter 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:12.799
 Naturally 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.120
 is done 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.139
 so do the same 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.109
 in Poland 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.239
 SV Kreft 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.060
 which of course comes too 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.689
 1 0 like 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.799
 May comes into force soon 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.530
 By doing so far method in the sense always the same 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.029
 so 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.109
 FM that too with WinRAR 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.289
 Foul on packens program Oral should be for 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.039
 Shift $ 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:48.379
 No, I advise in Ankara days 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.329
 FC Cologne 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.429
 that's important to Jens 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.429
 yes, and also the Schlie Berr 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.769
 just confirm that here with okay 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.989
 so we close Moro this d is very important of course 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:17.449
 but not used ULZ is not said at least want 

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.930
 2 2 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.980
 Help especially since the three teams is that the IKB in their judgment 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.139
 in that you are ever a fake 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.719
 that is the small one that is called the eavesdropper percent in the sense the team 

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:35.979
 full stunts could be connected to error that is it can be connected 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.949
 that Heros imports those or that 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.159
 The last motto show more clearly shot in the Cup is always so 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.899
 and in addition 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:47.389
 Close dress 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.540
 10 Dieter continues to work my plea 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079
 we can close and we can 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:58.470
 we have been handed count 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.219
 2 start now 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.209
 or is there going to do 4 shorten anyway 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.649
 Go to the bar already finished with this and I would say let's see 

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:11.649
 offended us 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:14.999
 the year and we are already here 

00:04:14.999 --> 00:04:17.109
 in my Kopp we go up 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.530
 Nolte the collection on Mainzer we was also this year, for example, for Lore 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.530
 Hosp 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.569
 anyway only on our press release 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:33.529
 I'm doing the duo 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:36.080
 then put on something to see 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.919
 so 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.749
 that was it possible for her 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.710
 but we also see formally 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.490
 below 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.530
 a small animal is of course now needs 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.919
 yes, of course it is this on the 4th 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.449
 seen in the same way 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:56.870
 for example, with the button I knew him up the winter last 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.870
 Retrieve command 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.400
 we'll pick it up then it's empty again the sports reporter and what 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.309
 and runners to lock the tent full 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.759
 and where I want to show something too person 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.400
 what this must be enough for if I mean now 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.320
 Moscow has what the center of Foremost 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.779
 Such is a small wheel when I am here 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:28.270
 accepted 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.710
 if worried 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.740
 Percent I can now scroll up and down that means I can 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.740
 not everything from women 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.859
 what happened where I want this year, too, the customers 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.840
 how is Ali his humor so that is also now they are there is ours too 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.710
 main worry 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:48.830
 to man 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.689
 Functional tract in 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.749
 for safety reasons 

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.059
 yes also in the Lee I can see all here and if I of course with 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.809
 the 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:00.900
 with the arrow key in the sea 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.069
 up 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.749
 I can not forget to call it again 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.740
 how cheap 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.139
 or I wrote 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.000
 yes that's it points already to these acts I think this country is going 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:19.430
 so young 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.930
 I think Akin is "definitely 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:24.119
 this helpful to me 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.269
 not finished with this form all is a thousand times 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.059
 just too understandable to rewrite 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.229
 We did not win which Maren Baumbach which probably also posts like 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:39.499
 Ellis Park Inn 

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:42.080
 Under this motto is just like 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.089
 Let's see what keeps this place 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:49.199
 yes and I would say we see each other in Bonn was the chair of Wacker 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.629
 word 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:50.589
 then how it continues
