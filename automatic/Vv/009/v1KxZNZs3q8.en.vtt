00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.160 

so<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.759> first<00:00:05.970> question<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.870> fair

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
so the first question and it's a fair

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.560 
so the first question and it's a fair
one<00:00:07.440> is<00:00:08.630> y4g<00:00:09.630> what's<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.110> big<00:00:10.320> deal

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570 
one is y4g what's the big deal

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.959 
one is y4g what's the big deal
first<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.349> phrase<00:00:13.650> for<00:00:14.099> G<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> car

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
first of all the phrase for G in the car

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.960 
first of all the phrase for G in the car
has<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> lot<00:00:16.080> in<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.470> let's<00:00:17.039> unpack<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.699> phrase

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
has a lot in it let's unpack the phrase

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.029 
has a lot in it let's unpack the phrase
because<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.449> tells<00:00:18.660> us<00:00:18.840> much<00:00:19.080> first<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> all

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
because it tells us much first of all

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
because it tells us much first of all
for<00:00:20.400> G<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:21.060> means<00:00:21.090> greater<00:00:21.720> bandwidth<00:00:22.140> more

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
for G that means greater bandwidth more

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.640 
for G that means greater bandwidth more
speed<00:00:22.769> for<00:00:23.580> G<00:00:23.730> provides<00:00:24.119> faster<00:00:24.689> pipes<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.289> all

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
speed for G provides faster pipes so all

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.470 
speed for G provides faster pipes so all
of<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> sudden<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.789> ability<00:00:27.240> to<00:00:27.269> do

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
of a sudden you have the ability to do

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.500 
of a sudden you have the ability to do
things<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.470> less<00:00:28.740> lag<00:00:29.070> time<00:00:29.519> for<00:00:30.029> people

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
things with less lag time for people

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.600 
things with less lag time for people
that<00:00:30.630> are<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.990> car<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.830> experience<00:00:32.460> is

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that are in the car the experience is

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.400 
that are in the car the experience is
just<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:33.000> much<00:00:33.149> better<00:00:33.210> yeah<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.140> really<00:00:34.260> is

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
just that much better yeah it really is

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160 
just that much better yeah it really is
this<00:00:34.770> for<00:00:34.980> G<00:00:35.160> was<00:00:35.399> designed<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.059> IP<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.630> mind

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170
