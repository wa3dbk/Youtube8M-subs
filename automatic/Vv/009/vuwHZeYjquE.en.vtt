 thus in breach in a taxi with afssaps and patina it sparkle dlc 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.629
 soccer that is deserved 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.749

 we put all 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.010
 blum some guidelines and then in the end it's done but still with us 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.679
 when the votes committee is more than two hours 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.499
 the decisive pass 

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:21.959
 it's his command how it works 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.229
 all the tourists who is who and who makes the compromise the movement is you 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:26.189
 who are you 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.999

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:31.669
 two rooms on 2 sept 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.549
 the two put themselves 12 2 me of orders so much the two players put themselves in 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.849
 connection from the moment when I see his race 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:42.889
 precisely 2009 intensely to see me shifts binding agreement 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.739
 at the beginning of the school year, we will go back to the children it depends because 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.229
 Yes 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:51.079
 to free the country from the ocd 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.079

 he has almost nothing to do 

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:10.449
 the hand is the hardest to take he did well 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:16.059
 so I'm trying to 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.569
 Is it enough 

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:22.729
 but at the same time as 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.939
 it's a glance 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:27.939
 an offense of that moment 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.729
 I do not know for the football match amélie mauresmo coup c'est mon 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.419

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.819
 for the second file 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.960
 the ones we did it's a little bit for me it's a little bit that but I 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.529
 think the most beautiful but still marked so far in 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:48.370
 the film 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.370
 in a building it was 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:54.249
 - who participates 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.789
 the csn the csq font that alludes to his taste and what he does there 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.960
 the two cameras forest it must all that seems crazy when this 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.689
 last fraction of a second that I can 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:05.849
 eliminated 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.370
 see the race 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.370
 make the pass 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.469
 these meetings 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:14.949
 but it's something else 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:15.849
 the second try
