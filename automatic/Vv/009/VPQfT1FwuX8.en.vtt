together until it's perfectly mixed and

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.280 
together until it's perfectly mixed and
then<00:02:33.810> we're<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.020> to<00:02:34.050> set<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.380> aside<00:02:35.720> okay<00:02:36.720> so

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
then we're going to set it aside okay so

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.530 
then we're going to set it aside okay so
our<00:02:37.410> next<00:02:37.650> step<00:02:37.980> now<00:02:38.190> is<00:02:38.220> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.120> beating

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
our next step now is going to be beating

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.450 
our next step now is going to be beating
the<00:02:39.690> butter<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.170> quick<00:02:40.620> note<00:02:40.860> about<00:02:40.890> both<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
the butter a quick note about both the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.730 
the butter a quick note about both the
butter<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.060> eggs<00:02:42.240> we've<00:02:42.990> let<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:43.560> eggs

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
butter and the eggs we've let the eggs

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.800 
butter and the eggs we've let the eggs
and<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.010> butter<00:02:44.130> sit<00:02:44.610> out<00:02:44.820> at<00:02:45.570> about<00:02:45.690> room

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
and the butter sit out at about room

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.360 
and the butter sit out at about room
temperature<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.500> at<00:02:46.830> least<00:02:46.920> 30<00:02:47.280> minutes

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
temperature for at least 30 minutes

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.010 
temperature for at least 30 minutes
we're<00:02:47.970> going<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> be<00:02:48.420> beating<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.900> butter

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
we're going to be beating the butter

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.810 
we're going to be beating the butter
with<00:02:49.230> an<00:02:49.320> electric<00:02:49.710> mixer<00:02:49.860> and<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.700> was

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
with an electric mixer and if it was

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.580 
with an electric mixer and if it was
cold<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.330> hard<00:02:51.570> it<00:02:51.720> would<00:02:51.810> be<00:02:51.870> really<00:02:52.200> really

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
cold and hard it would be really really

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.530 
cold and hard it would be really really
difficult<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:53.070> do<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.730> pop<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.120> butter<00:02:54.330> into

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
difficult to do so pop the butter into

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.900 
difficult to do so pop the butter into
the<00:02:54.750> bowl<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.230> let's<00:02:55.830> mix<00:02:56.100> our<00:02:56.370> butter<00:02:56.610> on

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
the bowl so let's mix our butter on

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.670 
the bowl so let's mix our butter on
medium<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.870> high<00:02:58.020> speed<00:02:58.080> about<00:02:58.860> 30<00:02:59.190> seconds

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
medium to high speed about 30 seconds

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.110 
medium to high speed about 30 seconds
okay<00:03:01.680> so<00:03:01.740> now<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.250> time<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.520> add<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.060> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
okay so now it's time to add in the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640 
okay so now it's time to add in the
sugar<00:03:03.300> remember<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.780> quarter<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.260> cup<00:03:04.290> at<00:03:04.560> a

time<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.780> we're<00:03:06.930> gonna<00:03:07.050> continue<00:03:07.290> stirring

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
time and we're gonna continue stirring

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.089 
time and we're gonna continue stirring
we're<00:03:10.390> gonna<00:03:10.480> keep<00:03:10.780> doing<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.200> until<00:03:11.739> all<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
we're gonna keep doing this until all of

we're gonna keep doing this until all of
our<00:03:12.189> sugar<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.549> incorporated<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.359> gonna

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
our sugar is incorporated it's gonna

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.199 
our sugar is incorporated it's gonna

in there without some sort of fat either

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.340 
in there without some sort of fat either
like<00:05:10.620> an<00:05:10.830> oil<00:05:11.130> or<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.669> butter<00:05:12.120> the<00:05:13.020> chocolate
