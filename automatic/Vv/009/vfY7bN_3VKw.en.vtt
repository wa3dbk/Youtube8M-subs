00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:04.880 

here<00:00:03.629> we're<00:00:03.750> going<00:00:03.929> to<00:00:04.080> do<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.560> two's

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
here we're going to do the two's

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.440 
here we're going to do the two's
complement<00:00:05.460> arithmetic<00:00:05.609> we're<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.390> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
complement arithmetic we're going to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.790 
complement arithmetic we're going to
subtract<00:00:07.280> by<00:00:08.510> doing<00:00:09.510> addition<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.590> two's

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
subtract by doing addition of a two's

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.770 
subtract by doing addition of a two's
complement<00:00:11.400> number<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.240> suppose<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
complement number so suppose we have

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.470 
complement number so suppose we have
these<00:00:13.110> numbers<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:14.160> binary<00:00:14.670> number<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
these numbers this binary number here is

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.290 
these numbers this binary number here is
equal<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> 44<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:17.190> second<00:00:17.640> number<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:18.029> equal

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
equal to 44 the second number is equal

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
equal to 44 the second number is equal
to<00:00:18.420> 13<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.140> we're<00:00:19.260> going<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.439> subtract<00:00:19.770> 13<00:00:20.279> from

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to 13 so we're going to subtract 13 from

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.800 
to 13 so we're going to subtract 13 from
44<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.390> hopefully<00:00:22.170> get<00:00:22.350> 31<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.430> binary<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
44 and hopefully get 31 so in binary the

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.320 
44 and hopefully get 31 so in binary the
binary<00:00:25.230> number<00:00:25.590> 444<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> binary<00:00:26.789> number<00:00:27.150> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
binary number 444 the binary number for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.160 
binary number 444 the binary number for
13<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.580> do<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.970> what<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.990> any

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
13 and so to do this what you do is any

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.010 
13 and so to do this what you do is any
number<00:00:31.470> that's<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.769> negative<00:00:32.219> number<00:00:32.399> or<00:00:33.020> that

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
number that's a negative number or that

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020 
number that's a negative number or that
that's<00:00:34.260> being<00:00:34.620> subtracted<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.610> really<00:00:35.910> this

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
that's being subtracted so really this

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.660 
that's being subtracted so really this
could<00:00:36.239> be<00:00:36.360> written<00:00:36.570> as<00:00:36.860> 44<00:00:37.860> plus<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.520> negative

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
could be written as 44 plus a negative

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.430 
could be written as 44 plus a negative
13

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
13

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.150 
13
you<00:00:41.010> take<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.460> negative<00:00:42.390> number<00:00:42.750> and

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
you take that negative number and

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.799 
you take that negative number and
convert<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.460> into<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> two's<00:00:45.180> complement

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
convert it into a two's complement

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.500 
convert it into a two's complement
number<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.160> basically<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> we'll<00:00:48.390> be

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
number and so basically what we'll be

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.170 
number and so basically what we'll be
doing<00:00:48.809> then<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> adding<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.219> first<00:00:50.640> binary

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
doing then is adding this first binary

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.700 
doing then is adding this first binary
number<00:00:51.510> 444<00:00:52.050> plus<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.489> two's<00:00:53.730> complement<00:00:54.510> of

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
number 444 plus the two's complement of

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.319 
number 444 plus the two's complement of
13<00:00:55.710> which<00:00:56.070> gets<00:00:56.309> us<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.730> equivalent<00:00:57.000> of

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
13 which gets us the equivalent of

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
13 which gets us the equivalent of
negative<00:00:58.109> 13<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.770> adding<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.640> two

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
negative 13 and adding those two

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.779 
negative 13 and adding those two
together<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.739> to<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.010> two's<00:01:02.190> complement

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
together so to get the two's complement

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.609 
together so to get the two's complement
we<00:01:02.969> let's<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.690> write<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> number<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
we let's just write the number off to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.219 
we let's just write the number off to
the<00:01:04.739> side<00:01:04.979> here<00:01:08.240> get<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> ones<00:01:09.600> complement

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the side here get the ones complement

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.600 
the side here get the ones complement
first<00:01:10.560> by<00:01:10.890> making<00:01:11.400> by<00:01:12.000> inverting<00:01:12.479> each<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:13.610> to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
first by making by inverting each bit to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.800 
first by making by inverting each bit to
be<00:01:14.790> its<00:01:14.939> opposite<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:17.180> then<00:01:18.180> get<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> two's

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
be its opposite and then get the two's

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
be its opposite and then get the two's
complement<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:20.460> adding<00:01:21.119> one<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:22.140> this<00:01:22.290> lower

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
complement by adding one to this lower

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
complement by adding one to this lower
number<00:01:22.790> right<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> 0<00:01:25.920> plus<00:01:26.189> 1<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.759> 1<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
number right there so 0 plus 1 is 1 and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.149 
number right there so 0 plus 1 is 1 and
then<00:01:27.479> bring<00:01:27.930> all<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> other<00:01:28.259> digits<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
then bring all the other digits down in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.950 
then bring all the other digits down in
this<00:01:29.280> case<00:01:29.549> sometimes<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.420> turns<00:01:30.600> out<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
this case sometimes it turns out it

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.910 
this case sometimes it turns out it
ripples<00:01:31.290> across<00:01:32.750> so<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.290> here<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.740> is

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
ripples across so this right here now is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.149 
ripples across so this right here now is
the<00:01:34.979> two's<00:01:35.369> complement<00:01:36.030> number<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.979> so<00:01:37.979> now

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
the two's complement number and so now

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
the two's complement number and so now
to<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.490> our<00:01:38.640> addition<00:01:38.790> let's<00:01:39.450> rewrite<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
to do our addition let's rewrite the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.210 
to do our addition let's rewrite the
first<00:01:40.229> number<00:01:41.060> zero<00:01:42.060> zero<00:01:42.570> one<00:01:42.990> zero<00:01:43.200> one<00:01:43.920> one

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
first number zero zero one zero one one

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.780 
first number zero zero one zero one one
zero<00:01:44.490> zero<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.540> we're<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.500> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> add<00:01:47.159> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
zero zero and we're now going to add a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.600 
zero zero and we're now going to add a
negative<00:01:48.320> 13<00:01:49.320> which<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.280> two's

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
negative 13 which is what this two's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.910 
negative 13 which is what this two's
complement<00:01:51.240> number<00:01:51.570> represents

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.170 

remember<00:01:55.920> what<00:01:56.070> two's<00:01:56.250> complement<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.000> work

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
remember what two's complement you work

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.120 
remember what two's complement you work
with<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> fixed<00:01:57.780> number<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.650> don't<00:01:58.860> drop

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
with a fixed number with so don't drop

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.800 
with a fixed number with so don't drop
any<00:01:59.430> of<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.670> leading<00:01:59.880> zeros<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:00.660> we're

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
any of the leading zeros if we're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.270 
any of the leading zeros if we're
working<00:02:01.080> with<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> thick<00:02:01.530> numbers<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.010> have<00:02:02.130> to

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
working with a thick numbers you have to

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.820 
working with a thick numbers you have to
stay<00:02:02.490> everything<00:02:03.000> stays<00:02:03.270> eight<00:02:03.540> bits<00:02:03.830> that

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
stay everything stays eight bits that

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.590 
stay everything stays eight bits that
means<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.430> sometimes<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.090> carry

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
means if you sometimes get a carry

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.630 
means if you sometimes get a carry
after<00:02:07.440> doing<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.770> addition<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.310> just<00:02:08.460> throw

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
after doing this addition you just throw

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.670 
after doing this addition you just throw
away<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.910> carry<00:02:09.180> because<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.470> eight

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
away the carry because it's the eight

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.070 
away the carry because it's the eight
bit<00:02:10.920> number<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.670> end<00:02:11.790> up<00:02:11.940> with<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.390> what

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
bit number that you end up with is what

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.470 
bit number that you end up with is what
you<00:02:13.200> want<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> keep<00:02:13.620> so<00:02:14.430> 0<00:02:14.670> plus<00:02:14.910> 1<00:02:15.180> 3<00:02:15.810> plus<00:02:16.140> 1<00:02:16.470> 1

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
you want to keep so 0 plus 1 3 plus 1 1

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.180 
you want to keep so 0 plus 1 3 plus 1 1
1<00:02:18.530> 1<00:02:19.530> 1<00:02:20.280> plus<00:02:20.580> 1<00:02:20.850> is<00:02:21.030> 0<00:02:21.060> with<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.660> carry<00:02:21.960> 1<00:02:22.890> plus

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
1 1 1 plus 1 is 0 with the carry 1 plus

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.390 
1 1 1 plus 1 is 0 with the carry 1 plus
1<00:02:23.490> is<00:02:23.670> 0<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.240> carry<00:02:24.510> 1<00:02:24.930> plus<00:02:25.230> 1<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.740> 0<00:02:25.770> with

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
1 is 0 with the carry 1 plus 1 is 0 with

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.610 
1 is 0 with the carry 1 plus 1 is 0 with
the<00:02:26.580> carry<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.420> said<00:02:27.480> you<00:02:28.170> throw<00:02:28.470> away

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the carry and as I said you throw away

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.260 
the carry and as I said you throw away
the<00:02:28.980> carry<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:30.000> end<00:02:30.630> up<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:31.440> 1<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.880> does<00:02:33.090> it's

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
the carry it end up with 1 it does it's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.190 
the carry it end up with 1 it does it's
not<00:02:33.330> part<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.870> answer<00:02:34.550> ok<00:02:35.550> so<00:02:35.940> this<00:02:36.870> then

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
not part of the answer ok so this then

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.220 
not part of the answer ok so this then
is<00:02:37.440> our<00:02:37.740> answer<00:02:38.220> right<00:02:38.400> here<00:02:38.460> and<00:02:39.080> since<00:02:40.080> it

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
is our answer right here and since it

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
is our answer right here and since it
starts<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.620> with<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> 0<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.430> tells<00:02:41.640> us<00:02:41.880> our

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
starts out with a 0 that tells us our

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.510 
starts out with a 0 that tells us our
answer<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.540> positive<00:02:43.140> number<00:02:43.320> and<00:02:43.680> we<00:02:44.340> can

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
answer is a positive number and we can

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.370 
answer is a positive number and we can
go<00:02:44.670> ahead<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.030> write<00:02:45.180> our<00:02:45.330> powers<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:45.870> 2<00:02:46.020> above

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
go ahead and write our powers of 2 above

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.640 
go ahead and write our powers of 2 above
here<00:02:46.710> and<00:02:47.420> that'll<00:02:48.420> tell<00:02:48.630> us<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.080> it's<00:02:49.470> equal

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
here and that'll tell us what it's equal

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.790 
here and that'll tell us what it's equal
to<00:02:49.830> in<00:02:50.130> decimal<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.960> had<00:02:52.140> ended<00:02:52.440> up<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.770> a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
to in decimal if we had ended up with a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.450 
to in decimal if we had ended up with a
1<00:02:53.190> for<00:02:54.090> our<00:02:54.360> leading<00:02:54.840> most<00:02:55.680> significant<00:02:56.280> bit

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
1 for our leading most significant bit

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.360 
1 for our leading most significant bit
of<00:02:56.670> our<00:02:56.850> 8-bit<00:02:57.180> number<00:02:57.860> then<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.890> would<00:02:59.190> tell

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of our 8-bit number then that would tell

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.340 
of our 8-bit number then that would tell
us<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> answer<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.209> a<00:03:00.239> negative<00:03:00.600> number<00:03:01.170> and

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
us the answer is a negative number and

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.870 
us the answer is a negative number and
we<00:03:01.800> would<00:03:01.950> need<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.220> take<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.610> two's

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
we would need to take the two's

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.449 
we would need to take the two's
complement<00:03:03.510> again<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.230> we<00:03:04.800> want<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.070> find<00:03:05.220> out

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
complement again if we want to find out

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.130 
complement again if we want to find out
the<00:03:05.670> magnitude<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.570> number<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.959> then

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the magnitude of that number and then

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.600 
the magnitude of that number and then
we'll<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.590> remember<00:03:07.800> to<00:03:07.980> add<00:03:08.100> a<00:03:08.130> minus

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
we'll have to remember to add a minus

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.160 
we'll have to remember to add a minus
sign<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:08.970> front<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.510> that's<00:03:09.690> not<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.989> case

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
sign up front so that's not the case

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.590 
sign up front so that's not the case
here<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:10.620> is<00:03:10.800> a<00:03:10.830> positive<00:03:11.459> number<00:03:11.580> so<00:03:11.880> let's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
here this is a positive number so let's

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.620 
here this is a positive number so let's
write<00:03:12.900> our<00:03:13.050> powers<00:03:13.380> of<00:03:13.560> 2<00:03:13.709> above<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:14.630> see

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
write our powers of 2 above it and see

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.510 
write our powers of 2 above it and see
if<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.870> checks<00:03:16.080> out<00:03:16.350> with<00:03:16.590> what<00:03:16.800> we<00:03:16.950> expect<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
if it checks out with what we expect the

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.810 
if it checks out with what we expect the
answer<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.880> be<00:03:18.680> so<00:03:19.680> there<00:03:19.980> give<00:03:20.550> us<00:03:20.640> that

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
answer to be so there give us that

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.940 
answer to be so there give us that
number<00:03:21.030> and<00:03:21.420> write<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.170> powers<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.650> 2<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:24.950> we

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
number and write the powers of 2 and we

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.590 
number and write the powers of 2 and we
don't<00:03:26.100> need<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.310> do<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.640> leading<00:03:26.910> zeros<00:03:27.330> in

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
don't need to do the leading zeros in

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.050 
don't need to do the leading zeros in
this<00:03:27.690> case<00:03:28.010> let's<00:03:29.010> just<00:03:29.250> add<00:03:29.520> up<00:03:29.550> where<00:03:29.940> we

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this case let's just add up where we

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.949 
this case let's just add up where we
have<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.239> 1<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:34.320> we<00:03:34.440> get<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.739> number

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
have a 1 and so we get this number

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.190 
have a 1 and so we get this number
so<00:03:36.959> had<00:03:37.320> all<00:03:37.470> that<00:03:37.590> together<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:38.220> get<00:03:38.570> like<00:03:39.570> 21

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
so had all that together we get like 21

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.880 
so had all that together we get like 21
and<00:03:41.690> 3<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.739> our<00:03:43.920> answer<00:03:44.250> 31<00:03:44.790> yes<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.300> is<00:03:45.450> yay

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and 3 so is our answer 31 yes it is yay

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.400 
and 3 so is our answer 31 yes it is yay
so<00:03:46.890> yes<00:03:47.519> indeed<00:03:47.550> we<00:03:47.880> got<00:03:48.510> the<00:03:48.660> correct<00:03:48.840> answer

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
so yes indeed we got the correct answer

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.430 
so yes indeed we got the correct answer
by<00:03:50.160> just<00:03:50.519> doing<00:03:50.670> addition<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.870> we<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.200> had<00:03:52.350> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
by just doing addition so we just had to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.300 
by just doing addition so we just had to
complement<00:03:53.070> the<00:03:53.160> number<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.700> then<00:03:54.380> and<00:03:55.380> then

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
complement the number and then and then

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.970 
complement the number and then and then
add<00:03:56.550> 1<00:03:56.850> so<00:03:57.269> complement<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.959> number<00:03:58.200> at<00:03:58.410> 1

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
add 1 so complement the number at 1

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.730 
add 1 so complement the number at 1
it's<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.430> two's<00:03:59.640> complement

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
it's the two's complement

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.490 
it's the two's complement
that's<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.790> negative<00:04:01.970> equivalent<00:04:02.750> of<00:04:02.900> 13

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
that's the negative equivalent of 13

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.160 
that's the negative equivalent of 13
added<00:04:04.400> on<00:04:04.550> to<00:04:04.850> our<00:04:05.030> original<00:04:05.270> positive<00:04:05.930> number

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
added on to our original positive number

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.610 
added on to our original positive number
44<00:04:06.710> 44<00:04:07.280> plus<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.700> negative<00:04:08.000> 13<00:04:08.420> gives<00:04:09.230> us<00:04:09.440> this

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
44 44 plus of negative 13 gives us this

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.150 
44 44 plus of negative 13 gives us this
answer<00:04:09.890> right<00:04:10.190> here<00:04:10.250> which<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.300> equivalent<00:04:11.630> to

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
answer right here which is equivalent to

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.550 
answer right here which is equivalent to
positive<00:04:13.160> 31<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.750> neat<00:04:14.930> thing<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.170> with

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
positive 31 and a neat thing is with

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.440 
positive 31 and a neat thing is with
two's<00:04:15.740> complement<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.640> is<00:04:16.820> easy<00:04:17.150> to

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
two's complement this is easy to

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.790 
two's complement this is easy to
implement<00:04:17.989> with<00:04:18.320> electronics<00:04:19.100> hardware

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800 
implement with electronics hardware

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.660 
implement with electronics hardware
complementing<00:04:21.800> the<00:04:21.920> number<00:04:22.160> two<00:04:22.220> just

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
complementing the number two just

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.000 
complementing the number two just
inverting<00:04:23.210> this<00:04:23.390> number<00:04:23.750> here<00:04:24.080> we<00:04:24.530> do<00:04:24.770> with

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
inverting this number here we do with

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.130 
inverting this number here we do with
the<00:04:25.130> series<00:04:25.340> of<00:04:25.670> inverters<00:04:26.210> it's<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:26.960> very

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
the series of inverters it's a very

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.380 
the series of inverters it's a very
simple<00:04:27.410> electronic<00:04:28.040> part<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.520> then<00:04:28.940> adding

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
simple electronic part and then adding

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.420 
simple electronic part and then adding
one<00:04:29.600> you<00:04:29.780> already<00:04:29.990> know<00:04:30.140> how<00:04:30.290> you<00:04:30.350> can<00:04:30.620> add<00:04:30.860> it

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
one you already know how you can add it

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.760 
one you already know how you can add it
turns<00:04:31.670> out<00:04:31.910> we'll<00:04:32.240> use<00:04:32.510> for<00:04:32.870> our<00:04:33.110> adder<00:04:33.500> that

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
turns out we'll use for our adder that

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.640 
turns out we'll use for our adder that
we<00:04:34.130> have<00:04:34.340> will<00:04:34.850> use<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.360> carry<00:04:35.660> in<00:04:35.990> instead<00:04:36.530> of

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
we have will use the carry in instead of

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.400 
we have will use the carry in instead of
leaving<00:04:36.920> at<00:04:37.040> zero<00:04:37.340> will<00:04:38.090> make<00:04:38.660> the<00:04:38.810> carry<00:04:39.080> in<00:04:39.380> a

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
leaving at zero will make the carry in a

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.210 
leaving at zero will make the carry in a
1<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.130> then<00:04:40.700> that<00:04:40.940> will<00:04:41.470> add<00:04:42.470> with<00:04:42.800> it<00:04:43.010> there

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
1 and then that will add with it there

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.860 
1 and then that will add with it there
is<00:04:43.250> use<00:04:43.610> for<00:04:43.640> that<00:04:43.910> carry<00:04:44.180> in<00:04:44.360> 10<00:04:44.600> that<00:04:44.630> will

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
is use for that carry in 10 that will

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.570 
is use for that carry in 10 that will
that<00:04:45.140> will<00:04:45.200> be<00:04:45.290> this<00:04:45.530> plus<00:04:45.800> 1<00:04:46.070> right<00:04:46.310> here

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
that will be this plus 1 right here

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.580 
that will be this plus 1 right here
giving<00:04:47.210> us<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.510> two's<00:04:47.690> complement<00:04:48.230> when<00:04:48.470> we

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
giving us the two's complement when we

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.890 
giving us the two's complement when we
want<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.860> do<00:04:48.980> subtraction<00:04:49.190> and<00:04:49.760> we<00:04:50.420> will

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
want to do subtraction and we will

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.750 
want to do subtraction and we will
implement<00:04:51.230> that<00:04:51.500> using<00:04:51.890> some<00:04:52.100> exclusive<00:04:52.460> or

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
implement that using some exclusive or

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.060 
implement that using some exclusive or
gates<00:04:53.000> instead<00:04:53.420> of<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.630> burgers<00:04:53.930> actually<00:04:54.380> so

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
gates instead of and burgers actually so

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.970 
gates instead of and burgers actually so
ok<00:04:55.640> great
