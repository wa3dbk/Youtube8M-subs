tutorial<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:41.910> don't<00:00:42.390> know<00:00:42.480> most<00:00:42.809> people

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079

tutorial I don't know most people
probably<00:00:43.200> know<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.620> stuff<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.129> when<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
probably know this stuff but when I

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.549 
probably know this stuff but when I
first<00:00:44.910> started<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.270> game<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.719> i<00:00:46.079> was

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
first started this game I i was

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889 
first started this game I i was
completely<00:00:47.309> oblivious<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:48.149> basically<00:00:48.690> what

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
completely oblivious what basically what

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.840 
completely oblivious what basically what
i<00:00:48.930> thought<00:00:49.200> was<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.550> how<00:00:50.640> there's

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
i thought was that you know how there's

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.790 
i thought was that you know how there's
all<00:00:51.000> these<00:00:51.120> different<00:00:51.360> races<00:00:51.690> sorry<00:00:52.620> let<00:00:52.770> me

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
all these different races sorry let me

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
all these different races sorry let me
drag<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.070> over<00:00:53.250> all<00:00:54.180> these<00:00:54.420> different<00:00:54.570> races<00:00:54.840> i

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
drag it over all these different races i

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.689 
drag it over all these different races i
thought<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> like<00:00:56.010> Skyrim

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
thought that it would be like Skyrim

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.869 
thought that it would be like Skyrim
where<00:00:57.140> each<00:00:58.140> race<00:00:58.530> has<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:59.100> different<00:00:59.520> type

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
where each race has like different type

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.000 
where each race has like different type
of<00:00:59.910> abilities<00:01:00.600> or<00:01:00.899> at<00:01:01.140> least<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.590> kind<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
of abilities or at least some kind of

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
of abilities or at least some kind of
thing<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.280> different<00:01:02.760> differentiates<00:01:03.719> them

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
thing to different differentiates them

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
thing to different differentiates them
but<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> turns<00:01:04.979> out<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.250> currently<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.180> least

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
but it turns out that currently at least

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.510 
but it turns out that currently at least
in<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.720> update<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.470> if<00:01:07.799> this<00:01:07.979> changes<00:01:08.220> in

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
in this update like if this changes in

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.039 
in this update like if this changes in
the<00:01:08.610> future<00:01:08.760> maybe<00:01:09.479> check<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.930> description

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the future maybe check the description

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.609 
the future maybe check the description
and<00:01:10.650> I'll<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.360> know<00:01:12.390> tell<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.170> change<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
and I'll you know tell the change is

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.030 
and I'll you know tell the change is
there<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.659> currently<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.350> current

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
there but currently in this current

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.300 
there but currently in this current
alpha<00:01:17.640> version<00:01:17.900> all<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.170> races<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.920> really

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
alpha version all these races it really

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
alpha version all these races it really
doesn't<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> difference<00:01:21.210> whichever<00:01:21.689> one

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
doesn't make a difference whichever one

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.719 
doesn't make a difference whichever one
you<00:01:21.960> choose<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.830> it's<00:01:23.250> all<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.610> to

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
you choose so really it's all up to

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.520 
you choose so really it's all up to
personal<00:01:24.119> preferential<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> want

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
personal preferential of what you want

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.640 
personal preferential of what you want
to<00:01:25.619> look<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.040> guess<00:01:26.630> maybe<00:01:27.630> maybe<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.530> is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to look like I guess maybe maybe this is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
to look like I guess maybe maybe this is
just<00:01:28.680> speculation<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.610> my<00:01:29.790> part<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.210> no

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
just speculation on my part I have no

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
just speculation on my part I have no
idea<00:01:30.570> maybe<00:01:31.290> if<00:01:31.619> you're<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> dwarf

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
idea maybe if you're like the dwarf

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.569 
idea maybe if you're like the dwarf
right<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.119> um<00:01:33.470> it<00:01:34.470> could<00:01:34.799> be<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.009> like<00:01:35.430> your

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
right here um it could be that like your

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
right here um it could be that like your
hitbox<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.360> smaller<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.530> something

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
hitbox is smaller that's just something

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.819 
hitbox is smaller that's just something
maybe<00:01:38.189> it's<00:01:38.640> possible<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.810> highly<00:01:40.650> doubt

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
maybe it's possible but I highly doubt

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.310 
maybe it's possible but I highly doubt
it<00:01:40.939> cuz<00:01:41.939> like<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.899> dwarf<00:01:43.170> is

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it cuz like as you can see the dwarf is

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.319 
it cuz like as you can see the dwarf is
so<00:01:43.470> much<00:01:43.619> smaller<00:01:43.770> than<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> other<00:01:44.460> all

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so much smaller than all the other all

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.539 
so much smaller than all the other all
the<00:01:45.570> other<00:01:45.720> things<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.229> maybe<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> bit

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
the other things that maybe it's a bit

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.520 
the other things that maybe it's a bit
harder<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.850> hit<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.119> dwarf<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> enemies

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
harder to hit the dwarf for the enemies

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.620 
harder to hit the dwarf for the enemies
but<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.950> no<00:01:50.100> idea<00:01:50.189> from<00:01:51.030> what<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.299> all
