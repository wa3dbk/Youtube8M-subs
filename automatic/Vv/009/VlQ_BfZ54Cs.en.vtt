to<00:02:48.330> both<00:02:48.480> men<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:48.870> women<00:02:49.170> we<00:02:49.320> have<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.620> look<00:02:49.770> at

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to both men and women we have to look at

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.170 
to both men and women we have to look at
the<00:02:49.980> fact<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.340> essentially<00:02:50.880> they've<00:02:51.060> got

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the fact that essentially they've got

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.870 
the fact that essentially they've got
very<00:02:51.450> different<00:02:51.750> pelvic<00:02:52.320> shapes<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:52.980> we<00:02:53.670> look

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
very different pelvic shapes if we look

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.240 
very different pelvic shapes if we look
at<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.420> male<00:02:54.870> pelvis<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.650> can<00:02:55.800> see<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.130> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
at the male pelvis you can see that the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.670 
at the male pelvis you can see that the
pubic<00:02:56.610> symphysis<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:57.300> higher<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.470> seat

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
pubic symphysis is higher and the seat

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.490 
pubic symphysis is higher and the seat
bones<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.190> closer<00:02:59.490> together<00:02:59.790> on<00:03:00.209> your<00:03:01.050> female

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
bones are closer together on your female

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.520 
bones are closer together on your female
pelvis<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.580> pubic<00:03:02.880> symphysis<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.600> lower<00:03:04.200> and

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
pelvis the pubic symphysis is lower and

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.080 
pelvis the pubic symphysis is lower and
the<00:03:04.890> seat<00:03:05.100> bones<00:03:05.310> are<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.610> little<00:03:05.790> further

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the seat bones are a little further

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.970 
the seat bones are a little further
apart<00:03:06.300> because<00:03:06.840> of<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.170> birthing<00:03:07.590> channel

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
apart because of the birthing channel

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.430 
apart because of the birthing channel
the<00:03:08.640> reason<00:03:08.670> why<00:03:09.000> this<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.600> so<00:03:09.750> important<00:03:10.260> is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
the reason why this is so important is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.960 
the reason why this is so important is
if<00:03:10.620> we<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.890> at<00:03:11.040> how<00:03:11.190> these<00:03:11.430> seat<00:03:11.700> bones

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
if we look at how these seat bones

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.210 
if we look at how these seat bones
interact<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> seat<00:03:13.080> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.800> see<00:03:14.010> that

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
interact with the seat you can see that

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.979 
interact with the seat you can see that
if<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> seat<00:03:14.700> is<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.209> correct<00:03:15.450> width<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
if the seat is not the correct width it

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.280 
if the seat is not the correct width it
can<00:03:16.170> actually<00:03:16.410> cause<00:03:16.770> pain<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.400> rider<00:03:17.640> and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
can actually cause pain to the rider and

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.090 
can actually cause pain to the rider and
discomfort<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.739> way<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.950> they're

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
discomfort for the way that they're

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:31.770 
discomfort for the way that they're
going<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.370> sitting<00:03:20.580> in<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> saddle

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.050 

this<00:03:32.780> is<00:03:32.930> where<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.200> our<00:03:33.410> needs<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.680> stick<00:03:34.060> so

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
this is where this our needs to stick so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.480 
this is where this our needs to stick so
if<00:03:35.720> this<00:03:35.990> makes<00:03:36.260> sense<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:37.100> you<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.280> the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.490 
if this makes sense to you that the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.210 
if this makes sense to you that the
sound<00:03:37.730> should<00:03:37.940> sit<00:03:38.120> behind<00:03:38.300> the<00:03:38.600> shoulder

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
sound should sit behind the shoulder

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.390 
sound should sit behind the shoulder
when<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.340> horse<00:03:40.520> moves<00:03:40.730> up<00:03:41.950> muscle<00:03:42.950> contracts

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
when the horse moves up muscle contracts

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.330 
when the horse moves up muscle contracts
like<00:03:43.940> in<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.210> book<00:03:44.710> see<00:03:45.710> how<00:03:45.860> this<00:03:45.980> shoulder

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
like in the book see how this shoulder

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.730 
like in the book see how this shoulder
moves<00:03:46.610> now<00:03:46.790> and<00:03:47.110> then<00:03:48.110> it<00:03:48.230> wrote<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.620> it's

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
moves now and then it wrote here it's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.070 
moves now and then it wrote here it's
all<00:03:48.920> back<00:03:49.160> to<00:03:49.190> here<00:03:49.580> so<00:03:50.540> what<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.750> want<00:03:50.900> to<00:03:50.930> do

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
all back to here so what you want to do

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.980 
all back to here so what you want to do
is<00:03:51.230> identify<00:03:52.060> shoulder<00:03:53.060> where<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.720> hairline

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
is identify shoulder where the hairline

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.980 
is identify shoulder where the hairline
comes<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:55.070> end<00:03:55.220> of<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.460> saddle<00:03:55.820> area<00:03:55.990> then

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
comes the end of the saddle area then

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:59.920 
comes the end of the saddle area then
you<00:03:57.140> pinch<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.620> spine<00:03:58.420> it's<00:03:59.420> approximately

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
you pinch the spine it's approximately

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.170 
you pinch the spine it's approximately
three<00:04:00.230> finger<00:04:00.500> wide<00:04:00.740> arabs<00:04:01.550> really<00:04:01.970> really

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
three finger wide arabs really really

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.290 
three finger wide arabs really really
wide<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.630> channel<00:04:02.990> space<00:04:03.230> very<00:04:03.680> important

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
wide the channel space very important

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.390 
wide the channel space very important
okay<00:04:05.300> so<00:04:05.420> then<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.930> have<00:04:06.080> that<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.500> then<00:04:07.250> you

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
okay so then you have that and then you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.120 
okay so then you have that and then you
have<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.970> reflex<00:04:08.660> points<00:04:09.080> if<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.470> make<00:04:09.680> a<00:04:09.710> saddle

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
have to reflex points if I make a saddle

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.540 
have to reflex points if I make a saddle
sit<00:04:10.340> here<00:04:10.670> I<00:04:11.260> can<00:04:12.260> make<00:04:12.470> this<00:04:12.620> horse<00:04:12.890> for<00:04:13.370> B

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
sit here I can make this horse for B

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.340 
sit here I can make this horse for B
canter<00:04:13.970> which<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.240> really<00:04:14.480> bad<00:04:14.630> in<00:04:14.810> this<00:04:14.930> out<00:04:15.110> I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
canter which is really bad in this out I

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.050 
canter which is really bad in this out I
can<00:04:15.530> make<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.680> horse<00:04:15.980> buck<00:04:16.310> in<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.580> jumping

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
can make a horse buck in the jumping

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.930 
can make a horse buck in the jumping
side<00:04:17.269> like<00:04:17.570> constant<00:04:18.380> bucking<00:04:18.709> or<00:04:19.070> falling<00:04:19.700> or

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
side like constant bucking or falling or

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.880 
side like constant bucking or falling or
it<00:04:20.209> knocking<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.170> rails<00:04:21.380> like<00:04:21.560> you<00:04:21.680> wouldn't

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
it knocking the rails like you wouldn't

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:22.360 
it knocking the rails like you wouldn't
believe<00:04:21.980> it

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
believe it

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.970 
believe it
this<00:04:23.030> spot<00:04:23.420> here<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.870> hand<00:04:24.170> with<00:04:24.380> below<00:04:24.830> the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
this spot here a hand with below the

this spot here a hand with below the
withers<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:26.540> deep<00:04:26.780> laying<00:04:27.170> muscle<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.650> Aspen

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
withers the deep laying muscle is Aspen

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.760 
withers the deep laying muscle is Aspen
Alice's<00:04:28.460> that<00:04:29.360> muscle<00:04:29.780> controls<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.380> base<00:04:30.560> of

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
Alice's that muscle controls the base of

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.460 
Alice's that muscle controls the base of
the<00:04:30.890> neck<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.310> if<00:04:31.760> you<00:04:31.880> pinch<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.420> will<00:04:33.320> go

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
the neck so if you pinch that will go

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.420 
the neck so if you pinch that will go
like<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:33.730> or<00:04:34.960> stumble<00:04:35.960> or<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.980> tongue<00:04:37.220> is

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
busy or the ear flick so if I rap down

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.080 
busy or the ear flick so if I rap down
this<00:04:42.200> way<00:04:42.410> I<00:04:42.440> feel<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.919> ribs<00:04:43.130> now<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.940> an
