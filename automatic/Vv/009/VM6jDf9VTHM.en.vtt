00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.460
 Hello 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.100
 very positive a new experience 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.100
 quite rewarding 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.780
 very exciting we started from 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.170
 us as professionals then I 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.210
 has placed what would be that dialogue 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.100
 therapeutic new account that we need 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.630
 also stop to look at how we are 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.190
 we inside also have 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.090
 our wounds our duel in 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.460
 our loss and we need to stop 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.920
 look at them and then from there help the 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.130
 another to reflect on 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.590
 this you do not know if you have lost yes 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.920
 there is still in the form of helping I love 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.920
 the truth 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.880
 do not 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.860
 ah 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:07.239
 the therapy proposes the use of materials 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.599
 artistic to favor the 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:15.230
 self-expression and reflection enjoyment 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.990
 to create and procure this this state 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 of greater tranquility 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:24.810
 do not 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.810
 I have a moral responsibility 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.370
 in the journey of life 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.379
 i 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.530
 comparable 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.920
 Y 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.810
 and is to offer professionals the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.810
 possibility to look 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.380
 it's about creating art 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:13.320
 since the expression is about being able 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.900
 to express ourselves and find emotions that 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.520
 lead us to put you in a situation of 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.100
 understand what the needs of 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.600
 each have known the benefits 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.160
 of art therapy has made us assume 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.990
 as an obligation that people 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.000
 know really there is a before and a 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.590
 then in the background from the foundation 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.600
 We are looking for a gel to follow 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.410
 introducing new elements that we 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.050
 help us express ourselves 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.980
 to do again what brought us to the 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.980
 world of health 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.010
 do not 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.980
 do not
