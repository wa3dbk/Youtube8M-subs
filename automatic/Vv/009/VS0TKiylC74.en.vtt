different<00:00:12.630> mesh<00:00:12.750> sizes<00:00:13.110> without<00:00:13.200> having<00:00:13.650> to

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
different mesh sizes without having to

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.709 
different mesh sizes without having to
use<00:00:13.860> curable<00:00:14.219> reducer<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.450> see<00:00:15.540> right

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
use curable reducer as you can see right

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.510 
use curable reducer as you can see right
here<00:00:15.750> I'm<00:00:16.080> gonna<00:00:16.199> be<00:00:16.379> opening<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> this<00:00:17.400> is

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
here I'm gonna be opening up this is

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.640 
here I'm gonna be opening up this is
right<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.029> container<00:00:18.170> this<00:00:19.170> stores

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
right out of the container this stores

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.769 
right out of the container this stores
and<00:00:19.949> ships<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.520> lot<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:21.029> stable<00:00:21.300> than<00:00:21.510> most

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
and ships a lot more stable than most

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.259 
and ships a lot more stable than most
other<00:00:22.050> whites<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.769> planet<00:00:24.680> so<00:00:25.680> right<00:00:25.859> here

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:26.269 
other whites in the planet so right here

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.560 
other whites in the planet so right here
very<00:00:27.269> nice<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.840> creamy<00:00:29.060> shouldn't<00:00:30.060> have<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
very nice and creamy shouldn't have to

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.110 
very nice and creamy shouldn't have to
use<00:00:30.599> curable<00:00:31.410> reducer<00:00:31.949> when<00:00:32.550> using<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:32.969> now

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
use curable reducer when using this now

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510 
use curable reducer when using this now
obviously<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.630> if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.350> want<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.649> but

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
obviously you can if you want to but

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060 
obviously you can if you want to but
there<00:00:35.760> shouldn't<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> need<00:00:36.290> also<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.950> know

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
there shouldn't be a need also you know

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190 
there shouldn't be a need also you know
you<00:00:38.460> with<00:00:39.090> most<00:00:39.300> windings<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.750> really<00:00:40.050> have

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you with most windings you really have

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
you with most windings you really have
to<00:00:40.350> modulate<00:00:40.890> them<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> lot<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.879> get<00:00:42.030> them<00:00:42.149> nice

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to modulate them a lot to get them nice

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
to modulate them a lot to get them nice
and<00:00:42.329> creamy<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:43.440> always<00:00:43.829> good<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> mix<00:00:44.489> your

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and creamy it's always good to mix your

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.940 
and creamy it's always good to mix your
ink<00:00:44.910> but<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:46.110> meteor<00:00:46.440> white<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> don't<00:00:46.800> have

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
ink but with meteor white you don't have

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220 
ink but with meteor white you don't have
to<00:00:47.039> mix<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.430> nearly<00:00:47.789> as<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:48.989> see

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
to mix it nearly as much as you can see

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.709 
to mix it nearly as much as you can see
it's<00:00:49.469> nice<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.829> creamy<00:00:50.399> coming<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.600> edge

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
it's nice and creamy coming off the edge

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.590 
it's nice and creamy coming off the edge
of<00:00:51.870> my<00:00:51.960> spatula<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:53.180> for<00:00:54.180> screen<00:00:54.420> mash

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of my spatula there for screen mash

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.040 
of my spatula there for screen mash
we're<00:00:54.750> gonna<00:00:54.870> use<00:00:55.170> 110<00:00:55.920> through<00:00:56.370> 305<00:00:56.940> mesh<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
we're gonna use 110 through 305 mesh you

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.360 
we're gonna use 110 through 305 mesh you
can<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.469> use<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.649> those<00:00:58.980> different<00:00:59.280> mesh

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
can really use all those different mesh

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.760 
can really use all those different mesh
sizes<00:00:59.579> obviously<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.300> higher<00:01:00.570> mesh<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.140> go<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
sizes obviously the higher mesh you go a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.680 
sizes obviously the higher mesh you go a
little<00:01:02.609> bit<00:01:02.820> more<00:01:02.969> difficult<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.420> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> be

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
little bit more difficult is going to be

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.329 
little bit more difficult is going to be
the<00:01:03.750> print<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.500> print<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.799> very<00:01:04.830> very

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the print but this print is very very

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
the print but this print is very very
nicely<00:01:05.549> through<00:01:05.850> 156<00:01:06.680> 200<00:01:07.680> mesh<00:01:07.890> without<00:01:08.189> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
nicely through 156 200 mesh without the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.000 
nicely through 156 200 mesh without the
need<00:01:08.460> for<00:01:08.490> curable<00:01:08.970> reducer<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:10.110> great<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
need for curable reducer also great as a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.429 
need for curable reducer also great as a
spot<00:01:11.460> process<00:01:12.030> under<00:01:12.330> base<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.229> if<00:01:13.320> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
spot process under base so if you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.590 
spot process under base so if you're
doing<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.650> spot<00:01:13.950> process<00:01:14.460> printing<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.450> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
doing these spot process printing it's a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.960 
doing these spot process printing it's a
great<00:01:15.960> soft<00:01:16.470> spot<00:01:16.799> process<00:01:17.250> under<00:01:17.549> base<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
great soft spot process under base and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
great soft spot process under base and
spot<00:01:18.360> process<00:01:18.840> over<00:01:19.170> print<00:01:19.409> white<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:20.220> thing

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
spot process over print white one thing

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
spot process over print white one thing
that<00:01:20.640> makes<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.090> ink<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.630> creamy<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
that makes this ink so creamy is the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840 
that makes this ink so creamy is the
fact<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.560> it's<00:01:22.770> triple<00:01:23.189> blended<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.670> as<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
fact that it's triple blended so as you

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.600 
fact that it's triple blended so as you
can<00:01:23.939> see<00:01:24.000> flooding<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:25.170> issue<00:01:25.610> we're

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
can see flooding is not an issue we're

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
can see flooding is not an issue we're
gonna<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.119> print<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.540> push<00:01:27.810> print<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
gonna do this print as a push print and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630 
gonna do this print as a push print and
we'll<00:01:28.290> come<00:01:28.439> back<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.770> try<00:01:28.920> another<00:01:29.159> print<00:01:29.549> as

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
we'll come back and try another print as

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.609 
we'll come back and try another print as
a<00:01:29.670> pull<00:01:30.000> print<00:01:30.299> we're<00:01:30.659> gonna<00:01:30.780> take<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> pass<00:01:31.350> by

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
a pull print we're gonna take it pass by

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.490 
a pull print we're gonna take it pass by
pass<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.310> check<00:01:32.880> out<00:01:33.060> how<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> prints<00:01:33.840> so<00:01:34.439> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
pass and check out how it prints so I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.440 
pass and check out how it prints so I
have<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> eighth<00:01:36.060> inch<00:01:36.299> off

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have about you know a eighth inch off

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.179 
have about you know a eighth inch off
contact<00:01:36.930> right<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.110> normal<00:01:37.530> off<00:01:37.650> contact

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and then not a lot of pressure needed to

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.020 
and then not a lot of pressure needed to
print<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.850> clears<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.659> screen<00:01:42.869> beautifully

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
print that clears the screen beautifully

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.389 
print that clears the screen beautifully
it<00:01:45.030> gives<00:01:45.240> me<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.420> nice<00:01:45.869> under<00:01:46.619> base<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:47.100> over

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
it gives me a nice under base for over

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.340 
it gives me a nice under base for over
printing<00:01:47.700> color<00:01:47.909> or<00:01:48.240> then<00:01:48.750> flashing<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
printing color or then flashing and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.319 
printing color or then flashing and
printing<00:01:49.649> again<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.280> typically<00:01:51.090> on<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
printing again so typically on that

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.940 
printing again so typically on that
first<00:01:51.600> pass<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.110> maybe<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.439> two<00:01:52.740> so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
first pass you can maybe do two so

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.190 
first pass you can maybe do two so
that's<00:01:53.100> after<00:01:53.280> one<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.930> how<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.170> looks

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
that's after one we can see how it looks

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.270 
that's after one we can see how it looks
and<00:01:55.820> not<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> effort<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.659> get<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.280> so

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and not a lot of effort to get there so

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
and not a lot of effort to get there so
let's<00:02:00.180> do<00:02:00.390> two<00:02:00.719> passes<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.469> first<00:02:01.710> go

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
let's do two passes on the first go

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.550 
let's do two passes on the first go
around

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.200 

so<00:02:07.560> there's<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.800> second<00:02:08.340> even<00:02:08.490> brighter<00:02:09.000> of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
so there's a second even brighter of

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.870 
so there's a second even brighter of
course<00:02:09.800> now<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.860> thing<00:02:11.250> about<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.610> thing<00:02:11.730> is

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
course now the thing about this thing is

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.290 
course now the thing about this thing is
is<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.030> quick<00:02:12.390> flashing<00:02:13.050> ink<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.430> flashes<00:02:15.090> at

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
is a quick flashing ink so it flashes at

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.350 
is a quick flashing ink so it flashes at
about<00:02:15.630> 30<00:02:15.960> to<00:02:16.110> 40<00:02:16.470> degrees<00:02:16.590> lower<00:02:17.190> than<00:02:17.370> most

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
about 30 to 40 degrees lower than most

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720 
about 30 to 40 degrees lower than most
white<00:02:19.050> inks<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.650> means<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.190> can<00:02:20.310> speed<00:02:20.580> your

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
white inks that means you can speed your

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.420 
white inks that means you can speed your
flash<00:02:20.940> time<00:02:21.270> up<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.960> also<00:02:22.170> means<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:23.130> can<00:02:23.280> go

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
flash time up that also means you can go

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.180 
flash time up that also means you can go
faster<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.150> you're<00:02:24.480> printing<00:02:24.950> after<00:02:25.950> only<00:02:26.100> a

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
faster as you're printing after only a

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.670 
faster as you're printing after only a
few<00:02:26.250> second<00:02:26.850> flash<00:02:27.120> we're<00:02:28.110> ready<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.560> go

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
few second flash we're ready to go

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.180 
few second flash we're ready to go
around<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.160> print<00:02:29.400> again<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.770> one<00:02:31.950> final

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
around and print again so one final

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.220 
around and print again so one final
flood<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:32.940> then<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.330> push<00:02:33.600> print<00:02:33.900> once

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
flood up and then a push print once

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.820 
flood up and then a push print once

important<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.810> ink<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.170> reach<00:03:43.350> 325

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
important for the ink to reach 325

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.640 
important for the ink to reach 325
degrees<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.760> entire<00:03:45.150> ink<00:03:45.510> film<00:03:45.930> that

always want to stretch test your ink so

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.800 
always want to stretch test your ink so
stretch<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.650> and<00:03:52.860> then<00:03:53.820> also<00:03:54.030> wash<00:03:54.450> test

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
stretch it and then also wash test
