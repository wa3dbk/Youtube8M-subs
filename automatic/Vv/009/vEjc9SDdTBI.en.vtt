of presents coming on a Christmas train
so<00:03:33.790> I'm<00:03:33.910> testing<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.480> now<00:03:35.370> making<00:03:36.370> sure<00:03:36.550> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
so I'm testing that now making sure the

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.430 
so I'm testing that now making sure the
train<00:03:36.940> can<00:03:37.180> go<00:03:37.239> around<00:03:37.480> curves<00:03:37.840> without<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
train can go around curves without the

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:47.460 
train can go around curves without the
heavy<00:03:38.650> boxes<00:03:39.010> falling<00:03:39.640> over

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.590 

I<00:03:47.560> really<00:03:48.460> wanted<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.790> do<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.940> shot<00:03:49.210> like<00:03:49.390> this

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
I really wanted to do a shot like this

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.150 
I really wanted to do a shot like this
but<00:03:49.900> that<00:03:50.110> would<00:03:50.260> require<00:03:50.530> me<00:03:50.770> to<00:03:50.860> make<00:03:51.010> more

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
but that would require me to make more

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.360 
but that would require me to make more
scenery

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.160 

and<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.970> course<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.330> trains<00:03:57.569> are<00:03:57.720> having<00:03:57.989> some

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
and of course the trains are having some

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.540 
and of course the trains are having some
electrical<00:03:58.650> problems<00:04:01.340> hopefully<00:04:02.340> it'll<00:04:02.489> run

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
electrical problems hopefully it'll run

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.500 
electrical problems hopefully it'll run
smoothly<00:04:03.000> when<00:04:03.330> we<00:04:03.480> start<00:04:03.690> shooting
