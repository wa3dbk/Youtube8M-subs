not only expands when you have a fire
but<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> helps<00:00:40.890> keep<00:00:41.039> more<00:00:41.309> smoke<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.909> before

for<00:00:44.789> added<00:00:45.089> protection<00:00:45.239> we've<00:00:45.809> added<00:00:45.989> a

for added protection we've added a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.989 
for added protection we've added a
secondary<00:00:46.710> seal<00:00:47.100> which<00:00:47.339> is<00:00:47.489> also<00:00:47.789> going<00:00:47.940> to

60-minute fire rated safe and what that

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.770 
60-minute fire rated safe and what that
means<00:00:59.609> is<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.999> safe<00:01:00.179> has<00:01:00.329> actually<00:01:00.659> been

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
means is that the safe has actually been

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.930 
means is that the safe has actually been
tested<00:01:01.049> inside<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.709> a<00:01:01.769> furnace<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.729> we're<00:01:02.879> not

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
tested inside of a furnace so we're not

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
tested inside of a furnace so we're not
only<00:01:02.999> adding<00:01:03.569> features<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.080> we<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.500> are

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
only adding features that we think are

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.770
