00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hey this will be just little comparison

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.230 
hey this will be just little comparison
of<00:00:05.660> two<00:00:06.660> different<00:00:07.200> bikes<00:00:07.760> to<00:00:08.760> different

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of two different bikes to different

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.339 
of two different bikes to different
worlds

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
worlds

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.990 
worlds
but<00:00:10.590> they<00:00:11.040> have<00:00:11.219> some<00:00:11.519> similarities<00:00:13.730> both<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
but they have some similarities both of

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.370 
but they have some similarities both of
them<00:00:15.179> their<00:00:15.389> choppers<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:17.810> both<00:00:18.810> of<00:00:18.840> them

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
them their choppers and both of them

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.750 
them their choppers and both of them
have<00:00:20.689> air-cooled<00:00:21.689> engines<00:00:22.490> so<00:00:23.490> they<00:00:23.519> are

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
have air-cooled engines so they are

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.130 
have air-cooled engines so they are
pretty<00:00:24.029> cool<00:00:26.359> it's<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.720> lot<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.260> fun<00:00:28.769> too<00:00:29.519> right

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
pretty cool it's a lot of fun too right

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.470 
pretty cool it's a lot of fun too right
both<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.170> them<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.660> I<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:34.440> end<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.680> binded

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
both of them and I just end up binded

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
both of them and I just end up binded
Softail<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.860> two<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.489> them

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
Softail so right now I have two of them

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.400 
Softail so right now I have two of them
in<00:00:39.059> through<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.020> four<00:00:40.320> cells<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.160> thought

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
in through these four cells so I thought

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.709 
in through these four cells so I thought
you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.620> make<00:00:43.829> little<00:00:44.010> comparison<00:00:44.610> how<00:00:45.120> they

00:00:47.709 --> 00:00:47.719 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.220 

side-by-side<00:00:48.719> how<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.640> sound<00:00:51.289> side<00:00:52.289> by<00:00:52.530> side

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that's very last chance before then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.670 
that's very last chance before then
