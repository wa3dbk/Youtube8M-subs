we gave it a shot 14 grams of sugar in
one<00:03:01.230> cup<00:03:01.470> does<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.950> mean<00:03:02.130> that<00:03:02.280> milk<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.730> dead

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.610 
one cup does that mean that milk is dead
no<00:03:03.480> because<00:03:03.660> it's<00:03:03.930> 14<00:03:04.290> grams<00:03:04.560> of

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
no because it's 14 grams of
