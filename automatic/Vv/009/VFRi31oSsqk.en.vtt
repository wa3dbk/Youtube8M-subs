00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello to all kite-surfers I hope 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.050
 you make good progress because 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.900
 there this month we will see a theme enough 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.610
 important is how to jump I think 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.500
 that when you put everything in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.730
 you say think the goal when 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.199
 same and to be able to jump is what 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.369
 it's a fun way to jump on 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.920
 flat does not need waves 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.689
 so we're going to tackle it this month 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.350
 so let's go to jump in 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.720
 kitesurfing 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.140
 there for once you really have to be well 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.300
 cloth and passes easier access from 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 start jumping with a twin tip so 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.510
 the board to the little board to whom 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.399
 looks like a skateboard or snowboard that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.989
 go both ways it's still 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.700
 more and for it's easier to handle 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.930
 in the air after we can quite 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.480
 also skip a directional there is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.420
 no problem the whole thing is actually a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.010
 little like going upwind you have to 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.329
 go upwind precisely so you have to 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.329
 really take your leaning on his 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860
 heels look pretty low so we 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 was going the bass we were 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.969
 Heels screen we go back a bit to the wind 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.320
 it means that in fact oval we go 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.470
 wait as long as possible 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.939
 lines between each other and she is in 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.200
 makes being a bit like a spring in 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.570
 from time to time from time to time a 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.189
 moment rafa released her to be able to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 actually does take off and so the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.590
 looseness it will be done as in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.380
 breath that is 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.780
 by the window so to three quarters 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.310
 about an hour or so we fear 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.109
 really there are mounted a little bench 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.390
 all of a sudden so we imagine we jump by 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:26.950
 above that meaning there I have my wing 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.219
 when down and suddenly we're going 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.409
 send help from the other side 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:35.020
 so we go past noon we go up to 11 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.399
 hours or so and there in fact it takes 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.890
 so when I was weakening 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.509
 people I have to stand up for for 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.209
 help also a little raised ladies 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.459
 angela she who is here and with a 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:51.099
 bottom movement just like 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:54.759
 it's pretty brutal so let's go 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:57.009
 of three quarters window here so so 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:58.959
 we paint we actually do it go it 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.689
 participates in three quarters down she goes 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:04.179
 to come here at 11 o'clock and that's it 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.840
 in one go by giving a bar and 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.539
 so has him up 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.190
 I'm going to take off after one when we 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:10.149
 skip it must always anticipate so 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.310
 once I'm in the air you have to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.650
 always bring back the bar because if 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.510
 I keep my arm like that ben allel 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.989
 she will continue the other way and 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.310
 there so it's the range she ensured so 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.690
 when we are in the air and given 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.310
 this sudden movement it takes everything from 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.690
 next bring them back a little less 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.639
 bruce because if we take a 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.350
 water leak from side a little less bruce 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.739
 to bring back the air and land in 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.720
 softness 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.819
 So that's the basic jump 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.190
 after we can follow on fronts 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.680
 from side by side and all that follows 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.900
 so in fact before jumping when we 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.040
 take the edge grip we are in support 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.200
 on his legs sagged 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.690
 we are back we have the heels 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.630
 so we're on the heels and 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.489
 after when she makes us take off 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 necessarily there is relaxation agree 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.799
 after when we're going to land when we 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.290
 will just land sorry the 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.000
 board in twin tip to ask rather to 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.230
 flat so we will come to bend the legs 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.840
 for bat to cushion 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.209
 arrived after actually everything depends if from 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.200
 how we manage are they more we 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.720
 will manage they do so abruptly is 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.879
 down plus the territory has abrupt so 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.890
 then for that you have to manage the help 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.810
 in order to make a landing in 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.120
 sweetness so that's why talking 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.190
 arms how when we just jump 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.750
 we give a sudden movement for rank 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.209
 but she suddenly makes us 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.010
 take off after we bring back the most 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.810
 gently to be able to rpt and land 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.160
 smoothly if you are a directional 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.709
 clear in these cases we will seek to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.069
 more than come actually land on 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.269
 the back of the board and then 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.410
 take off again we will not come to terry 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.180
 reminding that with sonel years will come 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.400
 land more on the back of the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.709
 board and then we ready continued 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 to navigate 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.430
 so there it was on the dish then he 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.590
 is obviously possible to jump to 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.760
 using wave or chop rest 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.400
 even simpler because we help 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.989
 small stepping stones down for for 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.489
 take off so just have to have a 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.230
 little speed to take the springboard and 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 then we take off and we do everything 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.889
 we want that without necessarily having 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.540
 need to move her if we move them 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.669
 wings as I explained by taking off 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.569
 even higher so it's with a 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.269
 wave is even simpler 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.810
 finally since it is the stepping stone to 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.810
 the ex-party
