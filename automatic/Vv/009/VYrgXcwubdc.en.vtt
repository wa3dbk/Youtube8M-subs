 amount needed

 we are ready this morning this 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.789
 recipe that we are going to prepare is ideal 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:00.399
 as a garnish or why not maybe 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.719
 mid afternoon if we want to eat something a 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.579
 salad like the one we're going to 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.830
 prepare with cabbage that has a lot 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.750
 fiber and many very fresh vegetables 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.180
 besides everything very natural would be something 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.220
 ideal for that let's start scratching 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.049
 a little cabbage I 'm going now to 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.090
 auxiliary of this mandolin but 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.390
 equally you at home can 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.720
 scratch very finely 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.479
 the recipe tells us then half average 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
 The piece pretending depends sometimes on the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.020
 size of the party happens it has very 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.510
 can use a quarter according to 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 the amount they are going to do what 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.700
 important is that we have here I'm going 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.009
 to teach this cut the most finite 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.220
 possible let's clean up a little bit and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.160
 We continue with the next ingredient 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 here we already have a quantity of cabbage 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.080
 white we put a little color with the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.900
 purple cabbage and let's cut our 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.940
 apple we are going to put it on this occasion 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.070
 with the skin because we want that fiber 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.230
 but if you do not want it with skin 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.420
 is simply peel it then cut it 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.640
 in pieces and it is very important to have a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.680
 lemon because in the case of the apple 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.440
 as well as eggplant or banana 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.050
 some other vegetables or fruits that 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.690
 when they are when they cut and enter 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.850
 contact with the air these are 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.830
 oxidize then the lemon will help us 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.170
 that while we finished doing the 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.170
 courts we can have them in one place 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.440
 where there is a little lemon 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.630
 not much simply to go depositing 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.810
 there and the lemon will help us 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.970
 that do not rust, let's cut 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.970
 some little squares of apple 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.170
 to 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:48.600
 As I told you, we are going to transfer it 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:53.570
 in this case to our recipient 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.570
 we cut the other pieces 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.390
 i 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:04.960
 Here we are going to integrate the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.060
 to move them a little so that all 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.130
 imbue the game that will help us 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.980
 while we finished cutting so that 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.830
 do not rust and while we go to work 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.470
 also with another bit of color to this 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.200
 salad that we are going to make today 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.360
 and it is the carrot here so for 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.270
 issue of presentation at the time of 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.490
 as everything is going to go then raw we are going to 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.820
 have a better consistency let's 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.180
 remove him to remove the skin he cites the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.180
 carrot 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.300
 and we're just going to grate a little 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.480
 we integrated them and a bit of carrot to 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.299
 our cabbage mix and now we're going to 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.430
 prepare our vinaigrette and I told them 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.500
 in a beginning we are going to use yogurt 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.750
 let's do a slightly smaller amount 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.069
 from which the recipe marks us 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.980
 issues of time then we're going to 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.350
 put here the yoghurt let's put a 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.660
 little bit of mustard 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.210
 the mustard will always give us a lot 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.520
 flavor to our in this case vinaigrettes 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.790
 but it's not going to give us calories so 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.300
 we can use it freely here 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.390
 will give the color also a little 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.449
 of lemon juice very little because it 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.199
 we are going to put in addition 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.199
 in vinegar 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.030
 put a little vinegar 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.590
 a touch of honey 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.419
 wikireader in the is optional but to me 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.620
 I like it because with the taste of 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.349
 Apple 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.120
 vinegar acidity that is going to give a 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:57.280
 better the best texture and flavor too 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.340
 a little salt and now just here 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.669
 we are going to remove this and we are going to integrate it 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.669
 all 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.290
 We are going to put a little more yogurt 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.620
 for the amount that I'm seeing that 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.610
 we have to lighten the 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.610
 here we have it 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:22.920
 very good for my taste is a portento 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.500
 there is 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:32.100
 Here we have our vinaigrette ready 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:35.400
 and as easy as we bring our goal with 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:38.540
 the mixture of the cabbages in the 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.560
 purple white cabbage carrot 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.920
 we add the apple we are going to mix 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.490
 All very well 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.419
 let's help us here 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.419
 this spatula 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:06:00.430
 we revolve very well we are going to put you in 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.840
 this time a little blueberries 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:06.080
 and a little bit of almonds 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.180
 I will integrate everything clean the table and in 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.550
 a moment we go back 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.320
 Well, here we are finishing 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:17.979
 integrate everything let's add our 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.979
 dressing 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.890
 everything all everything all to the last 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.310
 we are going to give a last round 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:31.220
 so that our vegetables remain 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.410
 perfectly bathed with this rich 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.980
 taste of the dressing that we just had 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.740
 put using the yoghurt no longer 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.810
 we had to use no oil like that 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.420
 that also this dressing is 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.360
 much more lighter we saved ourselves 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.700
 here a few calories and nothing more to 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.270
 I like a little bit more for a 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.400
 little touch of color to put a little bit of 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.680
 cilantro and only for the color 

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.380
 because the flavors that we have 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.360
 in this salad they are very soft then 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.790
 we do not want the coriander to counteract 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.470
 much and we or so that in the case of 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.510
 almonds and cranberries with those 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.040
 sweet flavors so nothing else is for 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:11.330
 Give a little color you can 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.940
 replace any of the ingredients 

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:15.800
 if you do not have blueberries, you sell raisins if you do not 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.720
 they have almonds is not here the 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.640

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.440
