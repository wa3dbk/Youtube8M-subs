people<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.049> they're<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.170> getting<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.440> lot<00:00:13.620> of

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
people and they're not getting a lot of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.740 
people and they're not getting a lot of
coverage<00:00:14.059> or<00:00:15.059> maybe<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.450> come<00:00:15.599> much

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
coverage or maybe it's come much

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.230 
coverage or maybe it's come much
coverage<00:00:16.199> as<00:00:16.440> they<00:00:17.369> should<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.850> they're

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
coverage as they should and they're

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.609

additional levels which you can download
which<00:01:13.140> are<00:01:13.260> even<00:01:13.470> tougher<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.610> some<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
which are even tougher so some of the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.710 
which are even tougher so some of the
levels<00:01:15.299> are<00:01:15.600> pretty<00:01:15.630> short<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.570> some<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.659> them

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720

are<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> bit<00:01:19.080> longer<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.909> some<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.060> them<00:01:21.210> as

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
are a bit longer and some of them as

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.980 
are a bit longer and some of them as
like<00:01:21.990> i<00:01:22.049> said<00:01:22.290> are<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:23.430> tough<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
like i said are pretty tough so it's not

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.359 
like i said are pretty tough so it's not
the<00:01:25.049> easiest<00:01:25.170> games<00:01:25.619> definitely<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the easiest games definitely going to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.770 
the easiest games definitely going to
need<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> practice<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.420> get<00:01:27.509> through<00:01:27.720> it

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
need a bit of practice to get through it

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.719 
need a bit of practice to get through it
as<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.560> said<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.890> completely<00:01:29.430> free<00:01:29.640> at<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
as I said it is completely free at the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.810 
as I said it is completely free at the
moment<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.180> can<00:01:30.390> actually<00:01:30.570> see<00:01:31.820> probably

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
moment and you can actually see probably

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
moment and you can actually see probably
because<00:01:33.030> it's<00:01:33.180> free<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.930> has<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:36.110> being

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
because it's free and has actually being

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.440 
because it's free and has actually being
downloaded<00:01:37.290> by<00:01:37.710> quite<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> few<00:01:38.280> people<00:01:38.610> but<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
downloaded by quite a few people but you

is<00:05:31.970> fairly<00:05:32.390> easy<00:05:32.870> to<00:05:33.140> start<00:05:33.530> with<00:05:33.680> but<00:05:33.890> maybe

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
is fairly easy to start with but maybe

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.660 
is fairly easy to start with but maybe
not<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.430> easiest<00:05:34.850> game<00:05:35.090> ever<00:05:36.430> but<00:05:37.430> if<00:05:37.550> you're

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
not the easiest game ever but if you're

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.520

and<00:06:33.980> frenetic<00:06:34.510> pretty<00:06:35.510> frustrating<00:06:36.140> at<00:06:36.260> times

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:36.290 
and frenetic pretty frustrating at times

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.340

but<00:06:36.710> it<00:06:36.950> is<00:06:37.010> very<00:06:37.600> addictive<00:06:38.600> as<00:06:38.720> well<00:06:38.930> so<00:06:39.290> it's

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
but it is very addictive as well so it's

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.420 
but it is very addictive as well so it's
one<00:06:39.500> of<00:06:39.560> those<00:06:39.650> games

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
one of those games

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.180 
one of those games
very<00:06:41.060> simple<00:06:41.450> to<00:06:41.540> play<00:06:41.750> but<00:06:42.380> it's<00:06:42.950> quite

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
very simple to play but it's quite

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.610 
very simple to play but it's quite
difficult<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.760> master<00:06:44.270> and<00:06:44.510> it<00:06:45.230> will<00:06:45.350> take

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
difficult to master and it will take

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.780 
difficult to master and it will take
your<00:06:45.800> player<00:06:45.980> pract<00:06:46.280> it's<00:06:46.430> got<00:06:46.580> lots<00:06:46.640> of

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
different modes you can even design your

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:49.960 
different modes you can even design your
own<00:06:48.950> character<00:06:49.430> and<00:06:49.550> use<00:06:49.670> different

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.590 
this one out for pound 49 although maybe
that<00:07:25.340> doesn't<00:07:25.430> seen<00:07:25.700> the<00:07:25.790> cheapest<00:07:26.180> I<00:07:26.390> think

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:26.600 
that doesn't seen the cheapest I think

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.990 
that doesn't seen the cheapest I think
it's<00:07:26.750> well<00:07:27.020> worth<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.590> money<00:07:27.980> and<00:07:28.880> I

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 
it's well worth the money and I

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.660 
it's well worth the money and I
definitely<00:07:29.060> recommend<00:07:29.450> this<00:07:29.870> so<00:07:30.400> that's<00:07:31.400> it

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
definitely recommend this so that's it

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.090 
definitely recommend this so that's it
for<00:07:31.880> this<00:07:32.300> video<00:07:32.510> there<00:07:33.200> are<00:07:33.320> another<00:07:33.500> other
