00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.800
 No one likes to lose their village 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 We want to make sure that this never happens to you. 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.400
 Make sure your village doesn't lose progress 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.100
 You need your own equipment, your village 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 And a Google account used in Google Play Games. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.100
 Google Play Games is a universal Android app 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.160
 You can use it to save the progress of the game. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.600
 With friends who also play this game 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.700
 Share achievements and experiences. 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.800
 This is my village. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 I have a Google account, but my village is not connected to it yet. 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
 To make sure my game progress is always saved, 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 I will enter the game settings and tap "Google Play - Login" 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.200
 As you can see, there are currently several accounts on this device in use. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.700
 You must be sure that you have chosen your own account before you can continue. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
 This is very important! 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.000
 This is because in a "conflict" game, your village can only be connected to a Google account. 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.900
 In other words, your village will always be with you for the first time. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 The account is connected. 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.200
 Protect your village now! 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.200
 Tap "Add Account" to create an account 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400
 Then follow the required steps 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Or log in with an existing account! 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.170
 I originally had a Google account, and now I am logged in with this account. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.300
 The loading indicator will appear and prompt you with the "Welcome Text". 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
 Please make sure that your username is included in this message. 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.900
 Now my village is safe, I am going to kill a few Goblin! 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.100
 Want to use the shiny new Android device to get some "conflicts"? 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 Or would you like to transfer your village to the device you are using? 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.380
 Let your village board this new device 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.000
 You should first set up the device with an existing Google account. 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.500
 Below I want to set up my device. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.700
 After the device is started 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.400
 Go to the Play Store and download "Clash of Clans." 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.800
 After opening the game, the novice player tutorial will begin. 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.500
 Your village should now be connected to a Google account. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.100
 So you can tap the tutorial by tapping "Google Play Sign In". 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.500
 a popup window will appear 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
 And remind you that the village on the device is connected to the Google account. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.300
 Tap “Load Game” and your village will appear! 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.600
 Don't forget, in order to securely "conflict" on Android devices 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.800
 You need: your own device, a village, and a Google account. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.800
 Bold conflict!
