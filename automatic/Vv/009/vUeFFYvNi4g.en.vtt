00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:02.260
 and dear viewers 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:05.990
 especially in the southern half of the country there are already pretty broad ones 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.660
 clearing your profit 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.690
 and especially in the north you can sometimes read and stubborn cloud fields and 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:12.829
 clearings and clouds 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:16.560
 dulko this afternoon I still like to get a lot of clearings 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.410
 but the clearance that shows that the country is mainly about it 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.190
 with slightly more clouds over the medina north east of the country and where 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.109
 to be yes it is less likely to cut 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.229
 but in the end it will be a whole crew nice afternoon 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.149
 and then certainly for those in this region 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.440
 with a temperature of 20 degrees around 4 degrees 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.789
 Overlaps degrees which is especially very high or it still makes perfect sense for this 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:42.770
 time and saas 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.210
 at the moment your temperature is from 30 to 60 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.920
 and for tonight and tonight still work 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.699
 quite a few clearances, but later we got a bit too low 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.380
 clouds we remain on the northern flanks of this high-pressure area 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.280
 the dry weather is mavdh with both teams still fighting fairly well 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.600
 direction is being steered 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.640
 but that is also quite something than clouds can 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.940
 The conservatory of the UN organ stuck in the course of the night he didn't 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.760
 get to see so much more because those clearing them will therefore be a number 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.880
 if you go more to more low clouds during the night 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 and then later formation of mist or fog anti winter judt 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.119
 and nice very locally freezing fog temperatures drop in uncle mountains 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.420
 until the energy council showed the other side 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.410
 those songs that themselves nevertheless have temperatures around freezing 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.200
 and answers and stamping sign from plastic to art is a firm on the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.390
 not the sports lane anyway and that nice soft 8 for this time of the year 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.350
 and shortly thereafter under the influence of that product is not but apparently less 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.930
 merry flank song with is still the supply 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.690
 there were regularly low clouds, so as far as he was concerned, both Monday and Tuesday 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.150
 without Tom Nicon hiding behind a suit which way remains 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.530
 always dry 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.729
 sheep that only in your new directions 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.770
 when he tested this outage this time when it arrives in the course of Wednesday 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.979
 when the clouds and then during the afternoon or evening when that 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.160
 If there is a disruption across the country, it seems to be a bit harder and readings 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.970
 in the morning it is possible with an excuse that they already have a little lutfi the frames in March 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.959
 goes what the hardcore and regina newspaper tz savas 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.859
 Monday and Tuesday we were dry everywhere 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:24.849
 Monday you slightly cooler with a temperature around two very gifted 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.010
 But Tuesday's traffic model back to the time will not be too much 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.899
 wind 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.999
 clearing not known to all involved 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.149
 and everything else told for this afternoon 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.179
 asks it tonight 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.979
 tonight and tonight there are clearings largely low clouds disappear 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:47.169
 and mist and mist formation locally at temperatures of one to 6 degrees 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:50.979
 from and also other person who are cost with a few short clearings 

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.800
 especially by the sea and in hobart 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.040
 the maxima of 5 to 8 degrees 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.060
 the days thereafter it will remain mostly gray, especially from Wednesday onwards 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.259
 see a shrinkage 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.599
 always the viewers 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.420
 today there are nice broad clearances that profit does not make anything in particular 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.509
 it in south west and with the country side 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:12.089
 it is one can enjoy the sun 

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:16.149
 in the northeast, on the other hand, there was a reasonable amount of cloud cover 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:19.789
 tonight and tonight there are a few tickets left or right 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:20.819
 that cloud cover 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.150
 but in the course of the evening and night we may again 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.100
 more low clouds expect it remains dry and over everywhere 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.409
 winter hour lasts 6 the sky is still a fairly early coast 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.499
 Tuesday I can travel a bit or mist 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:38.469
 usually view and you can see minimum temperatures of intel toppers 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:39.599
 a poor one 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.989
 and then tomorrow we first have to get her morning free we get 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.039
 remain under the influence of a high pressure area it seems to me to 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:50.759
 northern flank attack with is still the supply of fairly humid 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:55.349
 sky with lots of low clouds in it it is also beautiful just anderson that it 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:58.549
 have a hard time getting through in some places that goes 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:03:59.000
 succeed 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.740
 but that will not be the case everywhere for too long 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.680
 So let the end of being satisfied about it is still that cost again and again 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.010
 already priced in the sun 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.109
 who tries to break through 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.180
 and especially on the coast for a hope that you can be the case and that 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.269
 all at temperatures of around 4 to 8 degrees 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.580
 So that wonderfully soft weather chairman Peter van Zoest and we will stay 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.910
 just after that 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.070
 on the northern flanks of that we have high pressure area it is still still 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.110
 again quite a few clouds but for this area a cult that it 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.460
 Monday and Tuesday it remains dry 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 it's waiting for news made sure to learn to walk and then budgeted 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.120
 again that chance of a fall 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.850
 as this disturbance gets closer the first the song will drip 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.200
 but when this failure in the course of the afternoon or evening from west to east 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.680
 about the country then the debate is going to style everyone 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.789
 and also from language is Thursday and Friday before that we still have our passion 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.110
 regular but tomorrow and the day after tomorrow old what they still cheated albert 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.860
 otherwise you will not always get through and there are the clearings that will cost 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:03.270
 from 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.289
 does it cost 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.670
 nature remains on the high side, also for Tuesdays 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.000
 that climb very smoothly in 5 degrees 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.200
 what have those that do not moor the normal temperatures are time of approx 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.610
 but we also go to the mÃ¡xima around the Ministry on Tuesday 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.230
 maybe after that white suits tells frank you have
