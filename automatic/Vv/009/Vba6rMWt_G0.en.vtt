00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
game breaking I don't think it is I

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.820 
game breaking I don't think it is I
think<00:05:54.430> they<00:05:54.700> struck<00:05:55.300> up<00:05:55.330> pretty<00:05:56.260> good<00:05:56.410> balance

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
think they struck up pretty good balance

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.560 
think they struck up pretty good balance
from<00:05:56.919> what<00:05:57.100> I've<00:05:57.250> seen<00:05:57.280> but<00:05:57.789> again<00:05:58.210> I<00:05:58.330> didn't

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
from what I've seen but again I didn't

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.250 
from what I've seen but again I didn't
play<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.870> game<00:05:59.910> so<00:06:00.910> yes<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.510> am<00:06:01.660> excited<00:06:02.140> and

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:03.840 
play the game so yes I am excited and
that<00:06:02.620> goes<00:06:02.770> back<00:06:02.950> to<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.280> hype<00:06:03.490> that<00:06:03.520> you

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
that goes back to the hype that you

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.779 
that goes back to the hype that you
create<00:06:04.180> yourself<00:06:04.440> because<00:06:05.440> prior<00:06:06.039> to<00:06:06.400> I<00:06:06.430> don't
