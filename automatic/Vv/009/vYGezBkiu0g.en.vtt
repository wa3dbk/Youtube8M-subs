face<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.420> well<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> destroy<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
face as well and destroy them but it

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.859 
face as well and destroy them but it
also<00:01:41.070> looks<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.670> we'll<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.329> vision<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
also looks like we'll get the vision of

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.080 
also looks like we'll get the vision of
the<00:01:42.930> alien<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.799> well<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> take<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.880> look

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the alien as well so if you take a look

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330 
the alien as well so if you take a look
right<00:01:45.329> now<00:01:45.750> there<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> door<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.189> right

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
right now there is a door on the right

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.039 
right now there is a door on the right
you<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.640> see<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.060> nothing<00:01:48.420> there<00:01:48.869> is

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you will see that nothing there is

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.870 
you will see that nothing there is
actually<00:01:49.590> glowing<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.369> as<00:01:50.460> soon<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
actually glowing up but as soon as the

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually glowing up but as soon as the
character<00:01:51.149> takes<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.170> perk<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.680> soon<00:01:52.890> as<00:01:53.070> he

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
character takes the perk as soon as he

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.460 
character takes the perk as soon as he
transforms<00:01:53.790> into<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.299> alien<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:55.200> door

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
transforms into this alien that door

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
transforms into this alien that door
then<00:01:56.070> glows<00:01:56.700> up<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> looks<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.899> were

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
then glows up so it looks like we were

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.109 
then glows up so it looks like we were
only<00:01:58.200> able<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.369> secret<00:01:59.820> things

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
only able to see some secret things

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
only able to see some secret things
whilst<00:02:00.540> we're<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> form<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.649> alien

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
whilst we're in the form of this alien

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670 
whilst we're in the form of this alien
in<00:02:02.790> normal<00:02:03.270> life<00:02:03.450> things<00:02:03.960> will<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.229> normal

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
in normal life things will look normal

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
in normal life things will look normal
but<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.100> we<00:02:05.159> transfer<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.000> transform

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
but when we transfer into the transform

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.330 
but when we transfer into the transform
into<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> alien<00:02:07.020> will<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.710> able<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:08.129> see

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
into this alien will be able to see

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550 
into this alien will be able to see
things<00:02:08.819> that<00:02:09.090> we<00:02:09.209> could<00:02:09.330> never<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.929> before<00:02:10.140> so

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
things that we could never see before so

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.949 
things that we could never see before so
for<00:02:10.770> example<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:11.310> access<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.970> door<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.480> looks

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
for example to access this door it looks

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.320 
for example to access this door it looks
like

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
like

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.700 
like
going<00:02:13.450> to<00:02:13.510> have<00:02:13.600> to<00:02:13.630> transform<00:02:14.260> into<00:02:14.500> this

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
going to have to transform into this

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.100 
going to have to transform into this
alien<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.370> did<00:02:15.790> we<00:02:15.820> can<00:02:16.150> then<00:02:16.270> actually<00:02:16.450> go

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
alien and did we can then actually go

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.260 
alien and did we can then actually go
through<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.590> or<00:02:17.740> somehow<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.790> things

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
through it or somehow see things

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.910 
through it or somehow see things
different<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.840> how<00:02:19.990> they<00:02:20.170> were<00:02:20.200> before<00:02:20.410> I

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
different to how they were before I

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.440 
different to how they were before I
guess<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.400> could<00:02:21.550> say<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.880> third<00:02:22.030> thing<00:02:22.270> you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
guess you could say the third thing you

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.930 
guess you could say the third thing you
may<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.840> missed<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:23.650> orb<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.580> the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
may have missed is this orb that the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.030 
may have missed is this orb that the
magician<00:02:25.480> or<00:02:25.630> nero<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.080> actually<00:02:26.740> throwing

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
magician or nero is actually throwing

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.740 
magician or nero is actually throwing
earlier<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.910> trailer<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.330> see<00:02:28.360> him

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
earlier in the trailer we see him

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.870 
earlier in the trailer we see him
throwing<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.290> knife<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:29.920> straight<00:02:30.460> after<00:02:30.760> that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
throwing a knife and straight after that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.270 
throwing a knife and straight after that
we<00:02:31.030> see<00:02:31.210> some<00:02:31.450> zombies<00:02:31.840> blow<00:02:32.080> up<00:02:32.290> but<00:02:32.740> later<00:02:32.980> on

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
we see some zombies blow up but later on

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.100 
we see some zombies blow up but later on
in<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.550> trailer<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:34.000> see<00:02:34.030> this<00:02:34.390> scene<00:02:34.840> it

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
in the trailer we see this scene it

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.960 
in the trailer we see this scene it
looks<00:02:35.500> exactly<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:36.190> same<00:02:36.250> as<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.820> before

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
looks exactly the same as the one before

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.030 
looks exactly the same as the one before
but<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.420> time<00:02:37.480> he's<00:02:38.110> actually<00:02:38.290> throwing<00:02:38.680> a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
but this time he's actually throwing a

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.880 
but this time he's actually throwing a
orb<00:02:39.430> or<00:02:39.730> some<00:02:40.030> kind<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.450> glass<00:02:41.080> ball<00:02:41.410> with

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
orb or some kind of glass ball with

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.620 
orb or some kind of glass ball with
something<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.850> obviously<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.450> doesn't

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
something and it obviously it doesn't

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.870 
something and it obviously it doesn't
like<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.260> dangerous<00:02:44.980> weapon<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.790> he's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
like a dangerous weapon but he's

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.210 
like a dangerous weapon but he's
throwing<00:02:46.270> this<00:02:46.360> ball<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:47.290> some<00:02:47.530> reason<00:02:48.010> what

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
throwing this ball for some reason what

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.430 
throwing this ball for some reason what
this<00:02:48.400> says<00:02:48.580> what<00:02:49.150> this<00:02:49.300> orb<00:02:49.600> or<00:02:49.810> ball<00:02:50.050> could<00:02:50.260> be

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
this says what this orb or ball could be

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.260 
this says what this orb or ball could be
I<00:02:50.680> have<00:02:50.830> no<00:02:51.040> idea<00:02:51.070> maybe<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.000> do<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
I have no idea maybe it's to do with the

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.880 
I have no idea maybe it's to do with the
easter<00:02:52.600> egg<00:02:52.690> like<00:02:53.140> i<00:02:53.170> said<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.530> probably

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
easter egg like i said it is probably

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.650 
easter egg like i said it is probably
something<00:02:54.100> magical<00:02:54.760> maybe<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.330> new<00:02:55.450> thing

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
something magical maybe it's a new thing

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.449 
something magical maybe it's a new thing
we<00:02:55.810> will<00:02:55.930> get<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.320> throw<00:02:56.650> but<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.310> just

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
we will get to throw but it's just

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.100 
we will get to throw but it's just
really<00:02:57.640> weird<00:02:57.880> why<00:02:58.240> would<00:02:58.480> he<00:02:58.660> be<00:02:58.690> throwing

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
really weird why would he be throwing

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.860 
really weird why would he be throwing
this<00:02:59.260> glass<00:02:59.320> blow<00:03:00.010> glass<00:03:00.490> ball<00:03:00.910> I'd<00:03:01.180> say<00:03:01.660> what

this glass blow glass ball I'd say what
looks<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.140> be<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.680> wall<00:03:02.980> or<00:03:03.190> some<00:03:03.670> kind<00:03:03.880> of
