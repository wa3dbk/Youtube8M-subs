hello and welcome this time I'll show

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.960 
hello and welcome this time I'll show
you<00:00:03.659> my<00:00:04.970> invention<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.150> how<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.540> use<00:00:07.970> some

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
you my invention on how to use some

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.549 
you my invention on how to use some
Pistons<00:00:09.389> some<00:00:09.780> powered<00:00:10.559> rails<00:00:10.830> to<00:00:11.490> create<00:00:11.790> a

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
Pistons some powered rails to create a

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.300 
Pistons some powered rails to create a
railroad<00:00:13.559> station<00:00:14.660> in<00:00:15.660> which<00:00:16.230> there's<00:00:16.830> always

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
railroad station in which there's always

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.679 
railroad station in which there's always
a<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.760> card<00:00:18.090> which<00:00:18.390> will<00:00:20.029> drive<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.240> where<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
a one card which will drive me where I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.750 
a one card which will drive me where I
need<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:23.090> return<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:24.539> I<00:00:24.570> need<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.710> as<00:00:26.580> we

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
need to and return when I need so as we

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.140 
need to and return when I need so as we
all<00:00:26.970> know<00:00:27.150> there's<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.720> powered<00:00:28.199> rails<00:00:29.150> which

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
all know there's a powered rails which

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.310 
all know there's a powered rails which
work<00:00:30.980> with<00:00:31.980> any<00:00:32.460> redstone<00:00:32.940> input<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:36.200> the<00:00:37.200> only

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
work with any redstone input so the only

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.270 
work with any redstone input so the only
problem<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:37.950> if<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> put<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> card<00:00:39.600> here<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.280> run

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
problem is if I put a card here and run

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.209 
problem is if I put a card here and run
it<00:00:41.460> it's<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.540> running<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.649> it

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
it it's not running because it's it

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.970 
it it's not running because it's it
doesn't<00:00:44.430> know<00:00:44.760> which<00:00:45.239> side<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.870> so<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> help

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
doesn't know which side to go so to help

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.619 
doesn't know which side to go so to help
that<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.460> put<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:49.309> stone<00:00:50.309> block<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.480> turn

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that we put here a stone block and turn

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.920 
that we put here a stone block and turn
it<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.640> only<00:00:53.789> one<00:00:54.329> way<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> go

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
it on so there's just only one way to go

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.450 
it on so there's just only one way to go
and<00:00:55.230> based<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.879> created<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:58.460> lunch

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and based on this I created a lunch

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.869 
and based on this I created a lunch
platform<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.469> here<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.730> know

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
platform and it's right here is you know

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.429 
platform and it's right here is you know
notice<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.760> shape<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.909> my<00:01:06.090> card<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:07.110> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
notice that is a shape in my card so it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.640 
notice that is a shape in my card so it
will<00:01:07.950> be<00:01:07.979> easier<00:01:09.049> basically<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.409> does

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
will be easier basically what this does

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.539 
will be easier basically what this does
if<00:01:10.979> i<00:01:11.220> press<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.490> button<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:13.010> turns<00:01:14.010> on<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
if i press this button it turns on this

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
if i press this button it turns on this
piston<00:01:15.000> which<00:01:15.479> will<00:01:15.720> push<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.680> block<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
piston which will push this block and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.800 
piston which will push this block and
this<00:01:17.700> rail<00:01:17.970> one<00:01:18.840> block<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:20.070> side<00:01:20.310> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
this rail one block to this side so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.399 
this rail one block to this side so
making<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.470> wall<00:01:23.960> in<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.200> meantime

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
making here a wall in the meantime

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
making here a wall in the meantime
there's<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> ticker<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.570> ticks<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:29.570> after

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
there's the ticker so for ticks so after

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
there's the ticker so for ticks so after
four<00:01:30.960> tix<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.500> turns<00:01:31.890> on<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.369> rail<00:01:33.259> and<00:01:34.259> after

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
four tix it turns on this rail and after

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.120 
four tix it turns on this rail and after
what<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.310> goes<00:01:35.549> here<00:01:35.880> too<00:01:36.470> few<00:01:37.470> more<00:01:37.680> ticks<00:01:37.950> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
what it goes here too few more ticks and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.289 
what it goes here too few more ticks and
this<00:01:38.640> other<00:01:39.000> piston<00:01:39.540> pushes<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.460> so

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
this other piston pushes it back in so

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.810 
this other piston pushes it back in so
let's<00:01:42.810> see<00:01:42.990> how<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.259> works

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
let's see how that works

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.110 
let's see how that works
push<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:45.780> bucket

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.220 

so<00:01:52.000> that<00:01:53.000> was<00:01:53.210> good

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
so that was good

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.980 
so that was good
for<00:01:55.800> some<00:01:56.040> reason<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.700> doesn't<00:01:57.270> isn't

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
for some reason this doesn't isn't

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
for some reason this doesn't isn't
working<00:01:58.680> oh<00:02:00.740> no<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.920> working<00:02:02.280> so<00:02:02.910> here's<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
working oh no it's working so here's the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.020 
working oh no it's working so here's the
back<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:03.930> once<00:02:04.230> more<00:02:05.420> push<00:02:07.190> rating<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.310> go<00:02:08.460> go

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
back so once more push rating go go go

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.830 
back so once more push rating go go go
you<00:02:09.060> back<00:02:09.470> let<00:02:10.470> these<00:02:10.680> didn't<00:02:11.310> work<00:02:11.840> some

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you back let these didn't work some

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.600 
you back let these didn't work some
reason<00:02:13.790> now<00:02:14.990> push<00:02:15.990> and<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.560> goes<00:02:17.600> so<00:02:18.600> goes

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
reason now push and it goes so goes

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.480 
reason now push and it goes so goes
around<00:02:22.010> comes<00:02:23.010> back<00:02:23.180> here<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:25.310> resets<00:02:26.310> itself

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
around comes back here and resets itself

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.240 
around comes back here and resets itself
so<00:02:27.240> when<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.570> push<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.960> again<00:02:28.580> it<00:02:29.580> goes<00:02:29.760> again

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
so when I push this again it goes again

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.410 
so when I push this again it goes again
so<00:02:32.250> all<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.390> time<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:34.500> comes<00:02:35.010> back<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.520> stops

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so all the time it comes back and stops

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.240 
so all the time it comes back and stops
right<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.490> so<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.880> gives<00:02:39.330> me<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.860> ability<00:02:40.860> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
right here so this gives me a ability to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.570 
right here so this gives me a ability to
lunch<00:02:41.430> again<00:02:42.380> there's<00:02:43.380> some<00:02:43.650> times<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:44.250> it

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
lunch again there's some times that it

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.700 
lunch again there's some times that it
stops<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.540> bit<00:02:45.720> further<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:47.160> not<00:02:47.370> working

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
stops a bit further and it's not working

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.830 
stops a bit further and it's not working
so<00:02:49.710> you<00:02:49.770> just<00:02:50.190> have<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.670> push<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.390> bit<00:02:51.420> back

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
so you just have to push it a bit back

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.980 
so you just have to push it a bit back
and<00:02:52.140> run<00:02:52.770> again<00:02:55.460> also<00:02:56.460> I<00:02:56.490> should<00:02:56.940> notice<00:02:57.750> that

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and run again also I should notice that

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.660 
and run again also I should notice that
you<00:02:59.000> don't<00:03:00.000> want<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.450> make<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> calm<00:03:02.400> down

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
you don't want to make it a calm down

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.170 
you don't want to make it a calm down
hill<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.560> case<00:03:04.830> it<00:03:05.130> will<00:03:05.280> stop<00:03:05.580> around

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
hill so in that case it will stop around

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.790 
hill so in that case it will stop around
here<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.790> won't<00:03:09.000> work<00:03:09.209> but<00:03:10.080> nothing

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
here and it won't work but nothing

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.000 
here and it won't work but nothing
happens<00:03:11.300> so<00:03:12.300> better<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> use<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> straight<00:03:13.860> line

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
happens so better to use a straight line

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.680 
happens so better to use a straight line
so<00:03:17.010> we'll<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.120> back<00:03:19.280> no<00:03:20.280> works<00:03:20.730> again<00:03:21.090> so

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
so we'll be back no works again so

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.410 
so we'll be back no works again so
basically<00:03:22.260> oh<00:03:22.500> this<00:03:23.400> was<00:03:23.580> my<00:03:23.730> second<00:03:24.120> idea

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
basically oh this was my second idea

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.580 
basically oh this was my second idea
first<00:03:24.959> idea<00:03:25.380> was<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.980> create<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:28.320> pistons

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
first idea was to create it with pistons

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.830 
first idea was to create it with pistons
which<00:03:29.100> will<00:03:29.370> rise<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:32.130> moment<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.120> in

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
which will rise this this moment and in

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.220 
which will rise this this moment and in
that<00:03:33.900> case<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.560> will<00:03:34.770> make<00:03:37.010> slight<00:03:38.010> downhill

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
that case it will make slight downhill

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.710 
that case it will make slight downhill
for

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
for

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.820 
for
the<00:03:42.590> side<00:03:43.340> where<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.730> go<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:44.150> it<00:03:45.110> will<00:03:45.290> just

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
the side where to go or it will just

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.960 
the side where to go or it will just
break<00:03:46.070> this<00:03:47.050> creating<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.170> wall<00:03:48.350> but<00:03:49.190> this

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
break this creating a wall but this

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.720 
break this creating a wall but this
didn't<00:03:50.390> work<00:03:50.540> only<00:03:51.530> problem<00:03:51.800> not<00:03:52.580> a<00:03:52.610> problem

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
didn't work only problem not a problem

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.260 
didn't work only problem not a problem
but<00:03:53.210> a<00:03:53.870> little<00:03:54.290> bug<00:03:54.530> which<00:03:55.340> is<00:03:55.580> interesting

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
but a little bug which is interesting

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.390 
but a little bug which is interesting
here<00:03:57.230> you<00:03:57.350> see<00:03:57.560> is<00:03:57.910> three<00:03:58.910> detector<00:03:59.570> rails<00:04:00.400> so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
here you see is three detector rails so

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.550 
here you see is three detector rails so
when<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:01.850> push<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.360> button<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.930> should<00:04:03.110> lift

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
when I push this button it should lift

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.180 
when I push this button it should lift
up<00:04:03.770> that<00:04:04.010> and<00:04:05.050> then<00:04:06.050> rice<00:04:06.290> down<00:04:06.590> in<00:04:06.800> no

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
up that and then rice down in no

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.760 
up that and then rice down in no
problems<00:04:07.610> but<00:04:08.270> in<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:08.720> case<00:04:08.960> if<00:04:09.260> i<00:04:09.440> push<00:04:09.650> this

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
problems but in this case if i push this

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.930 
problems but in this case if i push this
button<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:10.760> see<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:12.250> goes<00:04:13.250> up<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.730> there

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
button you see that it goes up and there

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.770 
button you see that it goes up and there
is<00:04:14.090> one<00:04:14.270> extra<00:04:15.489> detector<00:04:16.489> rail<00:04:16.700> it<00:04:17.269> will<00:04:17.540> work

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
is one extra detector rail it will work

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.640 
is one extra detector rail it will work
with<00:04:17.810> any<00:04:18.609> rails<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.060> just<00:04:20.540> basically<00:04:20.900> put<00:04:21.530> it

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
with any rails so just basically put it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.310 
with any rails so just basically put it
up<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.100> it<00:04:22.340> will<00:04:22.490> create<00:04:22.730> one<00:04:23.320> additional

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
up and it will create one additional

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.950 
up and it will create one additional
rail<00:04:26.380> so<00:04:27.380> this<00:04:27.800> didn't<00:04:28.670> work<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.180> moved<00:04:29.660> with

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
rail so this didn't work so I moved with

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.130 
rail so this didn't work so I moved with
deep<00:04:30.170> this<00:04:31.100> sort<00:04:31.850> of<00:04:31.940> thing<00:04:32.000> was<00:04:32.420> two<00:04:32.690> pistons

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
deep this sort of thing was two pistons

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.210 
deep this sort of thing was two pistons
and<00:04:33.370> as<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:34.550> see<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:36.110> sometimes<00:04:36.560> glitches<00:04:37.010> so

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
and as you see it sometimes glitches so

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.060 
and as you see it sometimes glitches so
I<00:04:37.400> have<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.880> push<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.180> a<00:04:38.480> bit<00:04:38.510> back<00:04:38.900> and<00:04:39.350> won

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
I have to push it a bit back and won

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.970 
I have to push it a bit back and won
again<00:04:41.890> with<00:04:42.890> more<00:04:43.130> back<00:04:44.200> and<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.410> goes<00:04:45.650> again

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
again with more back and it goes again

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:50.890 
again with more back and it goes again
so<00:04:46.820> it's<00:04:47.270> not<00:04:47.419> perfect<00:04:47.930> but<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.350> if<00:04:48.950> you<00:04:49.900> think

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
so it's not perfect but a if you think

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.010 
so it's not perfect but a if you think
out<00:04:51.110> maybe<00:04:51.800> this<00:04:52.340> rail<00:04:52.610> is<00:04:53.419> giving<00:04:53.750> too<00:04:53.870> much

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
out maybe this rail is giving too much

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.270 
out maybe this rail is giving too much
momentum<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.880> if<00:04:56.330> I<00:04:56.510> remove<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.979> put

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
momentum so if I remove this and put

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.570 
momentum so if I remove this and put
some<00:04:58.790> more<00:04:59.360> else<00:04:59.660> in<00:05:02.380> this<00:05:03.380> was<00:05:03.650> in<00:05:04.130> here

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
some more else in this was in here

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.840 
some more else in this was in here
because<00:05:04.910> I<00:05:05.140> run<00:05:06.140> tests<00:05:06.470> with<00:05:06.800> empty<00:05:07.370> cart<00:05:07.640> and

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
because I run tests with empty cart and

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.990 
because I run tests with empty cart and
as<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.180> know<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.570> doesn't<00:05:08.870> go<00:05:09.140> that<00:05:09.530> far<00:05:09.970> so<00:05:10.970> I

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
as you know it doesn't go that far so I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.750 
as you know it doesn't go that far so I
have<00:05:11.270> to<00:05:11.419> use<00:05:11.600> a<00:05:11.870> boost<00:05:12.260> so<00:05:12.979> in<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.250> case<00:05:13.460> is

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
have to use a boost so in this case is

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.890 
have to use a boost so in this case is
stop<00:05:14.300> just<00:05:14.860> where<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.890> want<00:05:16.010> it<00:05:16.370> so<00:05:16.669> push<00:05:17.210> and

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
stop just where you want it so push and

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.080 
stop just where you want it so push and
go<00:05:18.310> so<00:05:19.310> that's<00:05:19.729> basically

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
go so that's basically

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.629 
go so that's basically
thanks<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.199> watching<00:05:22.230> and<00:05:22.740> compute<00:05:23.160> cop<00:05:23.490> you

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 
thanks for watching and compute cop you
