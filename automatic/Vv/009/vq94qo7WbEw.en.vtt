00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
side my left side of the bench needs to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.850 
side my left side of the bench needs to
come<00:01:23.789> up<00:01:23.940> just<00:01:24.149> a<00:01:24.599> little<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.899> I'm<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.800> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
come up just a little bit I'm going to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.660 
come up just a little bit I'm going to
check<00:01:26.099> it<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.520> way<00:01:26.819> as<00:01:27.530> well<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.220> much

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
check it this way as well and I'm much

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
check it this way as well and I'm much
further<00:01:30.030> off<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.569> direction<00:01:30.630> now<00:01:31.259> that's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
further off in this direction now that's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.589 
further off in this direction now that's
not<00:01:32.099> uncommon<00:01:32.520> because<00:01:32.849> if<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> floor<00:01:33.479> of

00:01:33.589 --> 00:01:33.599 
not uncommon because if the floor of

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:35.630 
not uncommon because if the floor of
your<00:01:33.660> workshop<00:01:34.140> isn't<00:01:34.649> perfectly<00:01:35.009> level<00:01:35.399> your

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
your workshop isn't perfectly level your

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.130 
your workshop isn't perfectly level your
bench<00:01:35.849> isn't<00:01:36.149> going<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.330> be<00:01:36.390> perfectly<00:01:36.810> level

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
bench isn't going to be perfectly level

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.960 
bench isn't going to be perfectly level
so<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.679> can't<00:01:37.950> continue<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> chair

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
so we can't continue with the chair

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.830 
so we can't continue with the chair
until<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:40.410> bench<00:01:40.649> itself<00:01:41.069> is<00:01:41.610> dead<00:01:42.000> level<00:01:42.270> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
until the bench itself is dead level so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
until the bench itself is dead level so
what<00:01:42.989> I'll<00:01:43.140> do<00:01:43.349> is<00:01:43.380> I'll<00:01:43.709> take<00:01:43.739> just<00:01:44.190> building

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
on by leveling this surface these rails

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.160 
on by leveling this surface these rails
I<00:02:54.379> have<00:02:54.860> now<00:02:55.040> made<00:02:55.370> this<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:56.090> a<00:02:56.209> perfectly<00:02:56.900> flat

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
I have now made this in a perfectly flat

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.759 
I have now made this in a perfectly flat
plane<00:02:57.739> parallel<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.269> level<00:02:59.569> bench<00:02:59.810> in

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:00.769 
plane parallel to the level bench in

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.270 
plane parallel to the level bench in
order<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.579> do<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:02.120> had<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.420> shim<00:03:02.920> these<00:03:03.920> two

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
order to do that I had a shim these two
