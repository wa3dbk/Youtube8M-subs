00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
and if you learning about all the things

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.880 
and if you learning about all the things
that<00:00:39.150> are<00:00:39.330> happening<00:00:39.420> now<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:40.590> know<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.830> the

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that are happening now you know at the

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.310 
that are happening now you know at the
appoint<00:00:41.160> thing<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.970> new<00:00:42.089> chairman<00:00:42.510> which

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
appoint thing of the new chairman which

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
appoint thing of the new chairman which
has<00:00:43.470> gone<00:00:43.650> against<00:00:43.949> the<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.519> students<00:00:44.940> wishes

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
has gone against the the students wishes

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.110 
has gone against the the students wishes
I<00:00:45.540> think<00:00:46.199> it's<00:00:46.830> only<00:00:46.980> fair<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.519> students

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I think it's only fair that the students

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.329 
I think it's only fair that the students
that<00:00:48.989> deserve<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.409> failure<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.949> know<00:00:49.979> what<00:00:50.220> the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
that deserve a failure you know what the

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.729 
that deserve a failure you know what the
money<00:00:50.580> I<00:00:50.790> think<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.299> they<00:00:51.510> required<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.589> an

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
money I think all they required is an

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.649 
money I think all they required is an
aspirational<00:00:53.400> field<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:54.659 
aspirational field to look up to

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:55.939 
aspirational field to look up to
somebody<00:00:54.900> with<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> large<00:00:55.409> body<00:00:55.650> of<00:00:55.769> work

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
somebody with a large body of work

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.979 
somebody with a large body of work
there's<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:56.400> not<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.000> large<00:00:57.239> body<00:00:57.449> work<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.839> that

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
there's a not a large body work but that

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.539 
there's a not a large body work but that
the<00:00:58.080> body<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.409> work<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:58.769> they<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.159> aspire

00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
the body of work which they can aspire

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:04.910 
the body of work which they can aspire
or<00:01:00.030> they<00:01:00.269> can<00:01:00.420> be<00:01:00.540> inspired<00:01:00.960> from<00:01:01.229> I<00:01:01.739> think<00:01:03.920> the

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
or they can be inspired from I think the

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.710 
or they can be inspired from I think the
institutional<00:01:05.580> autonomy<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.299> also<00:01:06.570> very

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
institutional autonomy is also very

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.080 
institutional autonomy is also very
important<00:01:07.170> you<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> certain

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
important you know the certain

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.780 
important you know the certain
guidelines<00:01:09.799> that<00:01:10.799> students<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> follow

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
guidelines that students have to follow

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
guidelines that students have to follow
in<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> means<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> when<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.020> come<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.350> an

in it means to you when you come from an
institute<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.920> art<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.270> needs<00:01:15.420> to

be a freedom of speech there needs to be

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.450 
be a freedom of speech there needs to be
a<00:01:17.850> dialogue<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.869> between<00:01:19.460> the
