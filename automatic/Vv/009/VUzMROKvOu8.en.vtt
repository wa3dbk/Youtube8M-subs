00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.950
 the hard reset procedure on the tablet 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.469
 lennox bbb 9 mil 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.849
 It is a very simple procedure but 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.009
 helps a lot when you are 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.980
 facing a problem related to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.740
 software such as slowness and errors with 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.680
 applications or even in case you 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.800
 have forgotten the unlock pattern and 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.960
 in this case the appliance becomes unusable 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
 this procedure is also compatible 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 with some models in the series 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:42.030
 Come on, you turn the tablet off when 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.879
 he is totally off you 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.680
 will hold the volume key - and after 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.680
 you hold the power key on and off 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.149
 it will take a while 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.570
 when an android doll appeared you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.080
 loose on / off technique and 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.210
 hold the volume key 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.540
 when the options appear you go to the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 option the idf twin set with the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:23.430
 volume and confirms with his land 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 off goes to the iess and confirms 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 again at this time he is formatting 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.929
 all internal memory and restoring 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.080
 all settings when 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:44.640
 finish it back to the first option 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:48.750
 reboots, just confirm and then 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.090
 it will restart and when you call 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.340
 factory fully restored 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.170
 the first time you turn the reset is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.170
 a little time consuming but it's normal 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.569
 That's it folks I hope it works out. 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.849
 With you, if you click right, I like it 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.569

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:11.030

 A big hug and, bye.
