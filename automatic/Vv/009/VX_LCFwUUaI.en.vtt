00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
history with phonetic we started

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.560 
history with phonetic we started
developing<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.729> hawk<00:01:09.940> during<00:01:10.479> the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
developing the hawk during the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.840 
developing the hawk during the
supercross<00:01:11.140> days<00:01:11.410> this<00:01:11.830> was<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.340> board<00:01:12.580> that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
supercross days this was the board that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.140 
supercross days this was the board that
our<00:01:13.110> PWA<00:01:14.110> team<00:01:14.440> was<00:01:14.650> using<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:15.760> go<00:01:15.940> on<00:01:16.000> the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150

Supercross<00:01:16.690> races<00:01:17.140> they<00:01:17.710> actually<00:01:18.070> were

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
Supercross races they actually were

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.120 
Supercross races they actually were
really<00:01:18.520> successful<00:01:19.119> at<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.390> time<00:01:19.420> of<00:01:19.810> that

and<00:01:21.130> we<00:01:22.119> sort<00:01:22.420> of<00:01:22.570> developed<00:01:23.260> this<00:01:23.500> line<00:01:23.740> into

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
and we sort of developed this line into

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.359 
and we sort of developed this line into
our<00:01:24.790> performance<00:01:25.000> free<00:01:25.630> ride<00:01:25.840> line<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.979> got

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
plane quickly and you can really take it

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.199 
plane quickly and you can really take it
nearly<00:01:56.350> to<00:01:56.530> slalom<00:01:56.830> speed<00:01:57.340> it's<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.759> very<00:01:57.970> easy

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
nearly to slalom speed it's a very easy

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:01.109 
nearly to slalom speed it's a very easy
board<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.630> sail<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.289> like<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.009> said<00:02:00.069> since<00:02:00.880> it's

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
board to sail and like I said since it's

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.400 
board to sail and like I said since it's
been<00:02:01.270> coming<00:02:01.509> from<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.780> Supercross

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
been coming from the Supercross

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.040 
been coming from the Supercross
development<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.759> has<00:02:03.880> a<00:02:04.090> lot<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.390> jiving

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
development it has a lot of jiving

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.339 
development it has a lot of jiving
potential<00:02:05.619> and<00:02:05.740> maneuver<00:02:06.069> potential<00:02:06.759> and

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
potential and maneuver potential and

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
potential and maneuver potential and
yeah<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:10.209> easy<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.500> look<00:02:12.459> here<00:02:12.730> also<00:02:13.510> here

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
we have a flat rocker off the tail with

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.780 
we have a flat rocker off the tail with
a<00:02:18.250> slightly<00:02:18.910> more<00:02:19.360> opening<00:02:19.990> me<00:02:20.280> this<00:02:21.280> opening

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a slightly more opening me this opening

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.150 
a slightly more opening me this opening
v<00:02:21.940> let's<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.330> board<00:02:22.569> come<00:02:22.840> fly<00:02:23.530> bit<00:02:23.860> freer

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
v let's the board come fly bit freer

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.520 
v let's the board come fly bit freer
when<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.550> go<00:02:24.700> full<00:02:25.000> blast<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.599> supports<00:02:26.380> the

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
when you go full blast and supports the

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.760 
when you go full blast and supports the
driving<00:02:26.980> awesome<00:02:27.599> it's<00:02:28.599> almost<00:02:28.990> our<00:02:29.319> boards

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
driving awesome it's almost our boards

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.980 
driving awesome it's almost our boards
you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.220> see<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:31.209> volume<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.810> very

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
you can see the volume is very

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.990 
you can see the volume is very
harmonically<00:02:32.680> distributed<00:02:33.370> here

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
harmonically distributed here

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.149 
harmonically distributed here
this<00:02:35.689> is<00:02:35.870> especially<00:02:36.079> important<00:02:36.890> when<00:02:37.040> you

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:37.159 
this is especially important when you

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:39.729 
this is especially important when you
come<00:02:37.340> off<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.579> job<00:02:37.970> or<00:02:38.439> when<00:02:39.439> you're<00:02:39.560> not

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
come off the job or when you're not

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.050 
come off the job or when you're not
planning<00:02:40.159> when<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.430> start<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.849> get<00:02:41.000> going

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
planning when you start to get going

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.890 
planning when you start to get going
then<00:02:41.959> you<00:02:41.989> have<00:02:42.260> some<00:02:42.680> volume<00:02:43.640> up<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:43.879> nose<00:02:44.209> so

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
then you have some volume up the nose so

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.710 
then you have some volume up the nose so
the<00:02:45.019> board's<00:02:45.459> floats<00:02:46.459> nicely<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:47.209> even<00:02:47.540> when

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the board's floats nicely and even when

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.280 
the board's floats nicely and even when
you're<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:48.019> playing<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:49.870> little<00:02:50.870> bit<00:02:51.079> about

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
you're not playing a little bit about

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.199 
you're not playing a little bit about
the<00:02:51.470> race<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.980> can<00:02:52.159> see<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.400> very<00:02:52.609> harmonic

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
the race you can see a very harmonic

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.240 
the race you can see a very harmonic
range<00:02:53.420> shape<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:54.079> with<00:02:54.530> a<00:02:54.620> little<00:02:54.799> bit<00:02:55.010> more

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
range shape here with a little bit more

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.960 
range shape here with a little bit more
tucked<00:02:55.750> for<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> driving<00:02:57.290> performance<00:02:57.970> and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
tucked for the driving performance and

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.250 
tucked for the driving performance and
again<00:02:59.599> here<00:03:00.019> why<00:03:00.590> chop<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.159> the<00:03:01.340> tain<00:03:01.579> here<00:03:02.260> to

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
again here why chop off the tain here to

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.009 
again here why chop off the tain here to
give<00:03:03.439> you<00:03:03.590> pressure<00:03:04.159> on<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.359> Hawks<00:03:05.599> as<00:03:05.810> well

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
give you pressure on the Hawks as well

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.129 
give you pressure on the Hawks as well
you<00:03:06.260> find<00:03:06.590> slight<00:03:07.549> double<00:03:08.000> concave<00:03:08.239> through

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
you find slight double concave through

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:09.759 
you find slight double concave through
the<00:03:09.260> nose

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
the nose

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.240 
the nose
combined<00:03:10.220> with<00:03:10.340> me<00:03:10.959> again<00:03:11.959> as<00:03:12.319> all<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:13.099> other

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
combined with me again as all the other

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.940 
combined with me again as all the other
designs<00:03:13.700> -<00:03:14.030> double<00:03:14.840> concave<00:03:15.079> support<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
designs - double concave support you

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.550 
designs - double concave support you
when<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.190> want<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.459> get<00:03:16.700> going<00:03:16.940> and<00:03:17.379> they<00:03:18.379> give

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
when you want to get going and they give

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.990 
when you want to get going and they give
you<00:03:18.650> a<00:03:18.709> smoother<00:03:19.099> ride<00:03:19.280> while<00:03:19.579> cutting

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
you a smoother ride while cutting

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000 
you a smoother ride while cutting
through<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.329> top<00:03:20.599> so<00:03:20.870> you'll<00:03:21.409> actually<00:03:21.650> find

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
through the top so you'll actually find

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.830 
through the top so you'll actually find
this<00:03:22.250> on<00:03:22.430> most<00:03:22.670> of<00:03:22.819> our<00:03:22.970> boards<00:03:23.359> we'll<00:03:23.540> have<00:03:23.720> it

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
this on most of our boards we'll have it

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.949 
this on most of our boards we'll have it
on<00:03:23.930> our<00:03:24.079> slalom<00:03:24.620> boards<00:03:24.950> we<00:03:25.099> have<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.400> on<00:03:25.579> our

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
on our slalom boards we have it on our

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.869 
on our slalom boards we have it on our
free<00:03:26.959> race<00:03:27.170> boards<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.829> race<00:03:28.010> we<00:03:28.370> find<00:03:28.760> it

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
free race boards on the race we find it

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.119 
free race boards on the race we find it
on<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.120> Hawks<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:29.629> on<00:03:30.109> the<00:03:30.260> Sharks<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:30.829> it's<00:03:30.980> a

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
on the Hawks and on the Sharks so it's a

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.280 
on the Hawks and on the Sharks so it's a
design<00:03:31.459> feature<00:03:31.700> that<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.689> found<00:03:32.900> really

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
design feature that we found really

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.699 
design feature that we found really
working<00:03:33.769> well<00:03:37.690> can<00:03:38.690> see<00:03:38.930> here<00:03:39.199> quite<00:03:39.379> nicely

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
working well can see here quite nicely

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.129 
working well can see here quite nicely
is<00:03:40.129> this<00:03:40.370> sort<00:03:40.609> of<00:03:40.699> brownish<00:03:41.209> fiber<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:42.079> is

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
is this sort of brownish fiber this is

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.839 
is this sort of brownish fiber this is
not<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.440> color<00:03:42.829> this<00:03:43.099> is<00:03:43.250> actually<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.639> color

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
not a color this is actually the color

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.689 
not a color this is actually the color
of<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.480> fiber<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:44.989> a<00:03:45.019> basalt<00:03:45.440> fiber<00:03:45.799> which

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
of the fiber it's a basalt fiber which

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.550 
of the fiber it's a basalt fiber which
has<00:03:46.879> a<00:03:46.910> lot<00:03:47.150> of<00:03:47.180> strengths<00:03:47.750> stronger<00:03:48.410> than

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
has a lot of strengths stronger than

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.710 
has a lot of strengths stronger than
s-class<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.310> it's<00:03:49.909> actually<00:03:50.299> more<00:03:50.480> eco

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
s-class and it's actually more eco

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.099 
s-class and it's actually more eco
friendly<00:03:51.069> fiber<00:03:52.069> because<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.760> has<00:03:52.940> less<00:03:53.239> co2

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
friendly fiber because it has less co2

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.740 
friendly fiber because it has less co2
output<00:03:54.349> when<00:03:54.829> it<00:03:54.949> gets<00:03:55.129> produced<00:03:55.340> so<00:03:55.879> kinetic

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
output when it gets produced so kinetic

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.720 
output when it gets produced so kinetic
is<00:03:56.989> looking<00:03:57.379> into<00:03:57.620> using<00:03:57.829> more<00:03:58.220> materials

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
is looking into using more materials

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.240 
is looking into using more materials
like<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.180> that<00:03:59.419> are<00:03:59.540> more<00:03:59.569> eco<00:03:59.930> friendly

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
like that that are more eco friendly

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.319 
like that that are more eco friendly
because<00:04:01.250> we<00:04:01.489> are<00:04:01.549> also<00:04:01.669> aware<00:04:02.030> of<00:04:02.209> the

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
because we are also aware of the

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.180 
because we are also aware of the
environment<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.109> we<00:04:03.440> all<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:03.769> to<00:04:03.919> be<00:04:04.040> out

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
environment and we all like to be out

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.189 
environment and we all like to be out
there<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.579> nature<00:04:04.970> so<00:04:05.239> it's<00:04:05.659> important<00:04:06.169> to

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
there in the nature so it's important to

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:09.569 
there in the nature so it's important to
keep<00:04:06.379> that<00:04:06.440> alive<00:04:07.659> in<00:04:08.659> the<00:04:08.750> limited-edition

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
keep that alive in the limited-edition

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.559 
keep that alive in the limited-edition
nice<00:04:10.579> polished<00:04:11.180> finish<00:04:11.479> on<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.780> bottom<00:04:11.930> and

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
nice polished finish on the bottom and

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:22.719 
nice polished finish on the bottom and
yeah<00:04:15.760> check<00:04:16.760> it<00:04:16.789> out

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.580 

okay<00:04:23.729> yeah<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.360> have<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:24.840> wood<00:04:25.110> sandwich

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
okay yeah I have the wood sandwich

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.430 
okay yeah I have the wood sandwich
version<00:04:26.009> of<00:04:26.160> the<00:04:26.310> hawk<00:04:26.810> also<00:04:27.810> wood<00:04:27.990> is<00:04:28.139> a<00:04:28.169> very

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
version of the hawk also wood is a very

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.379 
version of the hawk also wood is a very
nice<00:04:28.620> material<00:04:28.889> to<00:04:29.340> work<00:04:29.520> with<00:04:29.580> because<00:04:30.210> it

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
nice material to work with because it

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.100 
nice material to work with because it
works<00:04:30.569> like<00:04:30.840> AUD<00:04:31.380> it<00:04:32.220> has<00:04:32.430> all<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.660> fibers

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
works like AUD it has all the fibers

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.790 
works like AUD it has all the fibers
lining<00:04:35.120> in<00:04:36.120> this<00:04:36.330> axe<00:04:36.630> off<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.990> board<00:04:37.259> so<00:04:37.650> it's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
lining in this axe off the board so it's

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.279 
lining in this axe off the board so it's
actually<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.160> really<00:04:39.150> good<00:04:39.389> material<00:04:39.960> for<00:04:40.139> all

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
actually a really good material for all

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.879 
actually a really good material for all
purposes<00:04:40.620> and<00:04:41.870> also<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:43.349> the<00:04:43.560> wood<00:04:43.710> is<00:04:43.740> a

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
purposes and also that the wood is a

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.770 
purposes and also that the wood is a
little<00:04:44.160> more<00:04:44.310> eco-friendly<00:04:44.849> than<00:04:45.479> just

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
little more eco-friendly than just

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.589 
little more eco-friendly than just
composite<00:04:46.650> materials<00:04:47.220> so<00:04:47.849> we're<00:04:48.449> really

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
composite materials so we're really

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.219 
composite materials so we're really
trying<00:04:48.840> to<00:04:49.110> make<00:04:49.410> an<00:04:49.590> effort<00:04:49.770> here<00:04:50.569> to<00:04:51.569> make

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
trying to make an effort here to make

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.860 
trying to make an effort here to make
this<00:04:52.440> board<00:04:52.740> as<00:04:53.250> green<00:04:53.789> as<00:04:54.030> possible

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
this board as green as possible

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.650 
this board as green as possible
nice<00:04:55.410> fittings<00:04:55.919> also<00:04:56.310> here<00:04:56.610> the<00:04:57.180> new<00:04:57.360> foot

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
nice fittings also here the new foot

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.070 
nice fittings also here the new foot
pads<00:04:57.930> they're<00:04:58.169> very<00:04:58.410> grippy<00:04:59.780> nice<00:05:00.780> foot

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080
