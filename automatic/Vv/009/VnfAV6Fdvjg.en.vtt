of<00:01:17.830> Italy<00:01:18.030> vivanta<00:01:19.030> France<00:01:19.740> so<00:01:21.960> there's<00:01:22.960> an

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
of Italy vivanta France so there's an

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.450 
of Italy vivanta France so there's an
estimate<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.950> know<00:01:24.039> maybe<00:01:24.249> it's

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
estimate that you know maybe it's

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.080 
estimate that you know maybe it's
fifteen<00:01:24.939> thousand<00:01:25.539> tons<00:01:25.810> of<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.950> 30,000<00:01:27.850> tons

fifteen thousand tons of the 30,000 tons

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.529 
fifteen thousand tons of the 30,000 tons
that<00:01:28.509> has<00:01:28.810> been<00:01:29.670> reported<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:30.909> IMF<00:01:31.299> as

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:31.539 
that has been reported to the IMF as

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.209 
that has been reported to the IMF as

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
owned by government is actually out on

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.370 
owned by government is actually out on

loan that will never be repaid to
central<00:01:35.829> banks<00:01:36.159> so<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.270> issue<00:01:37.390> is<00:01:37.569> if<00:01:37.899> the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
central banks so the issue is if the

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.349 
central banks so the issue is if the
dollar<00:01:38.350> collapses<00:01:39.100> how<00:01:39.460> do<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.670> reconstruct

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:40.359 
dollar collapses how do you reconstruct

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:43.590 
dollar collapses how do you reconstruct
a<00:01:40.719> monetary<00:01:41.200> system<00:01:41.429> in<00:01:42.429> a<00:01:42.670> fiat<00:01:43.060> currency

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
a monetary system in a fiat currency

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.819 
a monetary system in a fiat currency
world<00:01:43.840> where<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.229> world's<00:01:44.530> reserve<00:01:44.799> currency

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
world where the world's reserve currency

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.800 
world where the world's reserve currency
is<00:01:45.460> essentially<00:01:46.030> destroyed<00:01:46.450> because<00:01:46.630> of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
is essentially destroyed because of

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.959 
is essentially destroyed because of
hyperinflation<00:01:47.219> you<00:01:48.219> have<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.490> go<00:01:48.609> back<00:01:48.759> to

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
hyperinflation you have to go back to

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.450 
hyperinflation you have to go back to
gold<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.139> more<00:01:50.350> gold<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.950> a<00:01:50.979> country's

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
gold so the more gold that a country's

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.179 
gold so the more gold that a country's
central<00:01:51.880> bank<00:01:52.090> has<00:01:52.389> the<00:01:53.259> better<00:01:53.469> position

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 
central bank has the better position

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:55.709 
central bank has the better position
they<00:01:54.340> are<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.729> re-establish<00:01:55.420> their<00:01:55.630> own

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
they are to re-establish their own

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:06.310 
they are to re-establish their own
national<00:01:56.289> currency
