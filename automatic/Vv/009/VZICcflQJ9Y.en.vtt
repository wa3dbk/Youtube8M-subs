00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.780 
you can hear it's this really strong
orating<00:01:01.730> reverb<00:01:02.360> I<00:01:02.630> like<00:01:03.350> it<00:01:03.620> again<00:01:04.520> there's<00:01:04.730> a

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
orating reverb I like it again there's a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.520 
orating reverb I like it again there's a
mod<00:01:05.000> you<00:01:05.120> could<00:01:05.240> do<00:01:05.300> out<00:01:05.420> there<00:01:05.510> for<00:01:05.720> $30<00:01:06.320> so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
mod you could do out there for $30 so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.440 
mod you could do out there for $30 so
you<00:01:06.620> can<00:01:06.710> go<00:01:06.830> out<00:01:06.860> it's<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:08.180> some<00:01:08.270> like<00:01:08.420> a

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
you can go out it's you get some like a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.270 
you can go out it's you get some like a
chronics<00:01:08.990> reverb<00:01:10.480> unit<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.810> a<00:01:12.200> lot<00:01:13.040> of<00:01:13.070> people

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
chronics reverb unit and a lot of people

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.320 
chronics reverb unit and a lot of people
are<00:01:13.370> saying<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.550> that's<00:01:13.760> that's<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.150> quick

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330

fix if you think it's too strong again
that's<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.910> little<00:01:17.120> under<00:01:17.330> half<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:17.720> let's<00:01:17.930> turn

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
that's a little under half so let's turn

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.540 
that's a little under half so let's turn
all<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.290> way<00:01:18.320> up<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.500> you'll<00:01:18.620> see<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.160> gets

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
all the way up and you'll see this gets

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.219 
all the way up and you'll see this gets
actually<00:01:20.120> way<00:01:20.300> too<00:01:20.360> powerful<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.930> sounds

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
actually way too powerful this sounds

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.170 
actually way too powerful this sounds
like<00:01:21.320> you're<00:01:21.470> in<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.650> back<00:01:21.800> of<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:22.040> air<00:01:22.790> hangar

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
like you're in the back of a air hangar

like you're in the back of a air hangar
as<00:01:23.360> some<00:01:23.750> people<00:01:23.960> online<00:01:24.080> uh<00:01:24.229> put<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:24.740> let's

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
as some people online uh put it so let's

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.219 
as some people online uh put it so let's
go<00:01:24.950> check<00:01:24.979> that<00:01:25.310> out

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.279 

for<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.100> sake<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.280> my<00:01:33.430> hearing<00:01:33.729> I'm<00:01:33.909> not<00:01:34.090> gonna

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
for the sake of my hearing I'm not gonna

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:36.660 
for the sake of my hearing I'm not gonna
play<00:01:35.289> that<00:01:35.320> too<00:01:35.619> much<00:01:35.860> cuz<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.430> does

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
play that too much cuz that does

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.340 
play that too much cuz that does
definitely<00:01:37.329> especially<00:01:38.020> when<00:01:38.140> you're<00:01:38.229> right

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
definitely especially when you're right

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.690 
definitely especially when you're right
in<00:01:38.409> front<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:38.890> can't<00:01:39.070> figure<00:01:39.159> out<00:01:39.340> anywhere

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
in front but can't figure out anywhere

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.100 
in front but can't figure out anywhere
else<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.240> set<00:01:40.420> this<00:01:40.509> camera<00:01:40.719> to<00:01:40.960> get<00:01:41.049> the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
else you set this camera to get the

00:01:41.110 --> 00:02:07.279 
else you set this camera to get the
sound<00:01:41.409> so<00:01:41.710> yep

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:07.289 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:17.380 

yeah<00:02:09.060> what's<00:02:10.060> that

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.370 

let's<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.480> bring<00:02:18.630> back<00:02:18.840> down<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.200> usable

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
let's go bring back down to a usable

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.700 
let's go bring back down to a usable
level<00:02:19.800> again<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.630> try<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.440> make<00:02:22.590> it

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
level again you know is try to make it

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.050
