00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.610 

the<00:02:55.640> story<00:02:55.910> that<00:02:56.180> must<00:02:56.420> have<00:02:56.600> been<00:02:56.780> a<00:02:57.140> lot<00:02:57.560> of

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
the story that must have been a lot of

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.200 
the story that must have been a lot of
pressure<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.280> guys<00:02:58.310> because<00:02:58.670> she<00:02:58.760> wanted

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
to get it right I'm guessing if somebody

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.500 
to get it right I'm guessing if somebody
gives<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.460> something<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.000> do<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.360> that

you<00:03:02.690> must<00:03:03.050> just<00:03:03.320> want<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.220> be<00:03:04.370> brilliant

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
you must just want it to be brilliant

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.140 
you must just want it to be brilliant
