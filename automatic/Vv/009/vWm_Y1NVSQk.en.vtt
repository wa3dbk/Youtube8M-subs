I really love doing drop sets because it

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.700 
I really love doing drop sets because it
really<00:01:39.100> intensifies<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.909> workout<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:41.319> puts

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
really intensifies the workout it puts

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.450 
really intensifies the workout it puts
lots<00:01:42.549> of<00:01:42.819> stress<00:01:43.149> on<00:01:43.359> the<00:01:43.450> muscle<00:01:43.840> I<00:01:44.460> like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
lots of stress on the muscle I like

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.449 
lots of stress on the muscle I like
feeling<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.909> pain<00:01:46.829> love<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.950> pain<00:01:50.459> it's

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
feeling the pain love the pain it's

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:54.059 
feeling the pain love the pain it's
really<00:01:51.729> not<00:01:51.850> about<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:53.469> upward<00:01:53.859> motion

00:01:54.059 --> 00:01:54.069 
really not about the the upward motion

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.819 
really not about the the upward motion
is<00:01:54.369> more<00:01:54.520> about<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.849> descent<00:01:55.500> when<00:01:56.500> it<00:01:56.619> comes

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:56.829 
is more about the descent when it comes

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.649 
is more about the descent when it comes
up<00:01:57.069> it's<00:01:57.310> much<00:01:57.880> faster<00:01:58.149> than<00:01:58.479> when<00:01:58.569> he's

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
up it's much faster than when he's

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.249 
up it's much faster than when he's
coming<00:01:58.990> down<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:01.299> have<00:02:01.359> to<00:02:01.539> control<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
coming down you have to control the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.089 
coming down you have to control the
descent<00:02:03.209> that's<00:02:04.209> was<00:02:04.509> really<00:02:04.539> gonna<00:02:05.099> stress

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:06.099 
descent that's was really gonna stress

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.020 
descent that's was really gonna stress
your<00:02:06.369> muscle<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:07.289> create<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.789> cut<00:02:09.789> between

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
your muscle and create that cut between

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.280 
your muscle and create that cut between
the<00:02:10.569> bicep<00:02:10.959> and<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.349> front<00:02:11.590> shoulder<00:02:13.079> so<00:02:14.079> just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the bicep and the front shoulder so just

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.880 
the bicep and the front shoulder so just
remember<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.650> control<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.730> downward<00:02:16.150> motion

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.490 

come<00:02:24.430> come

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
and the downward motion should be nice

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.289 
and the downward motion should be nice
and<00:03:01.700> slow<00:03:03.280> we<00:03:04.280> did<00:03:04.430> three<00:03:04.700> sets<00:03:04.940> of<00:03:05.150> this

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299

and slow we did three sets of this
exercise<00:03:05.599> with<00:03:06.319> about<00:03:06.620> ten<00:03:06.890> reps<00:03:06.920> per<00:03:07.489> set<00:03:07.760> I

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
exercise with about ten reps per set I

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.050 
exercise with about ten reps per set I
would<00:03:09.319> highly<00:03:09.829> recommend<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.459> guys<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.670> add

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
would highly recommend you guys to add

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.479 
would highly recommend you guys to add
this<00:03:11.299> to<00:03:11.450> your<00:03:11.510> routine<00:03:11.870> if<00:03:12.140> you<00:03:12.200> have<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.650> this

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
this to your routine if you have it this

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:16.059 
this to your routine if you have it this
is<00:03:13.640> more<00:03:13.879> to<00:03:14.480> create<00:03:14.989> cuts<00:03:15.440> on<00:03:15.620> your<00:03:15.739> shoulders

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
is more to create cuts on your shoulders

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.100 
is more to create cuts on your shoulders
than<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.459> actually<00:03:16.879> build<00:03:17.180> broader<00:03:18.099> shoulders

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
than to actually build broader shoulders

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.590 
than to actually build broader shoulders
let<00:03:21.110> me<00:03:21.200> know<00:03:21.319> how<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:21.560> goes
