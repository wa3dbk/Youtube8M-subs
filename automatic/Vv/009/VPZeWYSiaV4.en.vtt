00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
we're first going to show you how to

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.590 
we're first going to show you how to
fill<00:01:17.440> up<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.590> water<00:01:17.950> tank<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:19.060> first<00:01:19.270> step

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
fill up that water tank the first step

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.140 
fill up that water tank the first step
is<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:20.380> remove<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.890> drain<00:01:21.040> hose<00:01:21.400> from<00:01:22.060> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
is to remove the drain hose from the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.320 
is to remove the drain hose from the
reservoir<00:01:22.600> tank<00:01:24.390> next<00:01:25.390> we<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.350> close<00:01:26.770> off

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
reservoir tank next we have to close off

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.540 
reservoir tank next we have to close off
the<00:01:28.330> two<00:01:28.540> wing<00:01:28.810> nuts<00:01:28.840> on<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:29.350> valves<00:01:29.800> this

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
the two wing nuts on the valves this

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.920 
the two wing nuts on the valves this
will<00:01:30.730> stop<00:01:30.940> the<00:01:31.090> water<00:01:31.330> from<00:01:31.660> flowing<00:01:31.840> through

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
will stop the water from flowing through

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.720 
will stop the water from flowing through
then<00:01:34.930> we<00:01:35.710> want<00:01:35.890> to<00:01:35.950> go<00:01:36.040> ahead<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.280> open<00:01:36.640> up
