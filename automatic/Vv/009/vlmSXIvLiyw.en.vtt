you<00:03:54.690> should<00:03:54.959> keep<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.410> little<00:03:55.530> thingy<00:03:55.800> comes

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you should keep the little thingy comes

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.320 
you should keep the little thingy comes
in<00:03:56.340> to<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.640> give<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.910> bit<00:03:57.030> more<00:03:57.060> protection

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
in to just give it a bit more protection

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.570 
in to just give it a bit more protection
because<00:03:57.840> it's<00:03:58.080> so<00:03:58.260> small<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.890> slim<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.310> almost

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
because it's so small and slim I almost

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.759 
because it's so small and slim I almost
feel<00:03:59.820> like<00:03:59.880> that<00:04:00.239> could<00:04:00.269> cause<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.080> kind<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
feel like that could cause it to kind of

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.790 
feel like that could cause it to kind of
get<00:04:02.160> damaged<00:04:02.700> in<00:04:02.820> transit<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:04.050> that's<00:04:04.260> that

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
get damaged in transit so that's that

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:10.160

when I went to mobile for last year so

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.430 
when I went to mobile for last year so
really<00:05:52.020> enjoyed<00:05:52.290> that<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:52.950> then<00:05:53.190> in<00:05:53.460> terms<00:05:53.760> of
