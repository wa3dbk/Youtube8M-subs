driveway like blacktop or concrete you

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.460 
driveway like blacktop or concrete you
probably<00:00:24.270> want<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.599> have<00:00:24.689> your<00:00:24.869> scraper<00:00:25.200> bar

probably want to have your scraper bar

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.920 
probably want to have your scraper bar
actually<00:00:26.340> touching<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.849> ground<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.720> it

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
actually touching the ground so that it

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
actually touching the ground so that it
scrapes<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.500> driveway<00:00:28.890> clean<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:29.910> you

blacktop is broken up and rough you

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.009 
blacktop is broken up and rough you
probably<00:00:35.640> want<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.030> set<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.480> so<00:00:36.839> that

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
probably want to set that so that

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.090 
probably want to set that so that
there's<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> clearance

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
there's a little bit of clearance

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
there's a little bit of clearance
between<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.519> scraper<00:00:38.910> bar<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> ground

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
between the scraper bar and the ground

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.680 
between the scraper bar and the ground
now<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.650> way<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.920> do<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.699> to<00:00:42.510> take

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
now the way to do that is to take

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.719 
now the way to do that is to take
something<00:00:42.989> like<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.769> small<00:00:44.070> block<00:00:44.339> of<00:00:44.370> wood

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:44.729 
something like this small block of wood

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.930 
something like this small block of wood
or<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.600> piece<00:00:45.839> of<00:00:46.019> steel<00:00:46.400> something<00:00:47.400> that<00:00:47.670> will

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
or a piece of steel something that will

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.270 
or a piece of steel something that will
give<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.479> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:49.440> bit<00:00:49.589> of<00:00:49.619> clearance<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.220> it

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
give you a little bit of clearance so it

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.729 
give you a little bit of clearance so it
will<00:00:50.369> hold<00:00:50.549> this<00:00:50.790> up<00:00:51.119> off<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.720> ground<00:00:51.900> do<00:00:52.559> this

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
will hold this up off the ground do this

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.439 
will hold this up off the ground do this
on<00:00:52.890> a<00:00:52.920> flat<00:00:53.220> level<00:00:53.460> surface<00:00:53.610> like<00:00:54.210> your<00:00:54.360> garage

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
on a flat level surface like your garage

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.109 
on a flat level surface like your garage
floor<00:00:54.869> in<00:00:55.589> this<00:00:55.799> case<00:00:56.040> we've<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.549> somewhere

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
floor in this case we've got somewhere

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.939 
floor in this case we've got somewhere
between<00:00:57.239> 1/2<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.900> 3/4<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.470> an<00:00:58.650> inch<00:00:58.739> that

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch that

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
between 1/2 and 3/4 of an inch that
we've<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.339> created<00:00:59.549> between<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.360> scraper

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
we've just created between the scraper

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.649 
we've just created between the scraper
bar<00:01:01.049> and<00:01:01.650> the<00:01:02.610> floor<00:01:05.030> next<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.479> to

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bar and the floor next you need to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.570 
bar and the floor next you need to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
takes a 9/16 wrench and I've already

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.069 
takes a 9/16 wrench and I've already
loosened<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.500> bolts<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.039> other<00:01:17.189> side

loosened the bolts on the other side

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.099 
loosened the bolts on the other side
when<00:01:19.079> we<00:01:19.229> loosen<00:01:19.590> these<00:01:19.710> bolts<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.579> skid<00:01:20.820> shoe

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
when we loosen these bolts the skid shoe

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:29.870 
when we loosen these bolts the skid shoe
slides<00:01:22.109> down<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.679> touch<00:01:22.859> snapped<00:01:28.789> tighten<00:01:29.789> the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.030 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.780 

and<00:01:50.030> now<00:01:50.380> when<00:01:51.380> we<00:01:51.410> remove<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.070> blocks<00:01:52.610> of

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and now when we remove the blocks of

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.900 
and now when we remove the blocks of
wood<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:54.140> can<00:01:54.320> see<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:55.430> there's<00:01:55.640> a<00:01:55.700> pretty

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
wood you can see that there's a pretty

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.350 
wood you can see that there's a pretty
good<00:01:56.120> size<00:01:56.360> gap<00:01:56.720> in<00:01:57.440> there<00:01:58.060> between<00:01:59.060> the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
good size gap in there between the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.760 
good size gap in there between the
scraper<00:01:59.720> bar<00:01:59.870> and<00:02:00.080> the<00:02:00.140> ground<00:02:02.350> now<00:02:03.350> something

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
scraper bar and the ground now something

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.790 
scraper bar and the ground now something
to<00:02:03.800> consider<00:02:04.300> if<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.360> are<00:02:05.570> if<00:02:06.110> you<00:02:06.350> have<00:02:06.380> set

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
to consider if you are if you have set

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.499 
to consider if you are if you have set
your<00:02:06.950> scraper<00:02:07.190> bar<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.640> scrape<00:02:08.000> on<00:02:08.240> a<00:02:08.270> hard

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
your scraper bar to scrape on a hard

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.990 
your scraper bar to scrape on a hard
surface<00:02:08.720> like<00:02:09.020> blacktop<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:10.280> will<00:02:10.610> over<00:02:10.970> time

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
surface like blacktop it will over time

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.190 
surface like blacktop it will over time
start<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.720> wear<00:02:11.900> down

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
start to wear down

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.220 
start to wear down
it's<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.980> replaceable<00:02:13.580> part<00:02:13.820> it's<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.930> a<00:02:15.020> few

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
it's a replaceable part it's just a few

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.350 
it's a replaceable part it's just a few
nuts<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.709> bolts<00:02:16.070> to<00:02:16.340> take<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.670> off<00:02:16.820> and<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.209> put

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
nuts and bolts to take it off and to put

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.420 
nuts and bolts to take it off and to put
a<00:02:17.390> new<00:02:17.600> one<00:02:17.750> on<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.709> a<00:02:18.800> good<00:02:18.980> idea<00:02:19.280> to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
a new one on and it's a good idea to

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.850 
a new one on and it's a good idea to
check<00:02:19.640> that<00:02:19.880> at<00:02:20.030> least<00:02:20.209> annually<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.739> you

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
check that at least annually so that you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.610 
check that at least annually so that you
catch<00:02:22.100> it<00:02:22.340> before<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:23.239> starts<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.660> before<00:02:24.530> you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
catch it before it starts to before you

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.699 
catch it before it starts to before you
start<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:25.070> wear<00:02:25.850> back<00:02:26.150> into<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:27.500> auger

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
start to wear back into the auger

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.920 
start to wear back into the auger
