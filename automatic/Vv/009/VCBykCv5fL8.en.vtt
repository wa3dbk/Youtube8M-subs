considered<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.850> they'll<00:01:57.000> be<00:01:57.180> releasing

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
considered that they'll be releasing

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.179 
considered that they'll be releasing
their<00:01:57.810> DLC<00:01:58.290> during<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> same<00:01:58.890> time<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
their DLC during the same time the

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.800 
their DLC during the same time the
watchdog's<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.759> coming<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.149> because<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.689> my

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
watchdog's is coming out because in my

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.389 
watchdog's is coming out because in my
opinion<00:02:00.899> they'll<00:02:01.290> probably<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:02.009> out<00:02:02.159> within

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
opinion they'll probably be out within

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.550 
opinion they'll probably be out within
five<00:02:02.790> or<00:02:02.820> ten<00:02:03.210> days<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.479> each<00:02:03.600> other<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
five or ten days of each other and I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.080 
five or ten days of each other and I
think<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> smart<00:02:05.009> answer<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> yes<00:02:05.670> they

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
think the smart answer would be yes they

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.370 
think the smart answer would be yes they
probably<00:02:06.329> already<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.899> considered<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
probably already have considered that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
probably already have considered that
because<00:02:07.860> well<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.550> rock<00:02:08.789> star<00:02:09.060> that<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.420> their

because well the rock star that is their
their<00:02:10.140> business<00:02:10.470> their<00:02:10.679> job<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.370> you

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
their business their job and it's you

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.250 
their business their job and it's you

know their job to know what else is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.640 
know their job to know what else is
going<00:02:13.500> on

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
going on

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.350 
going on
on<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> video<00:02:14.099> game<00:02:14.250> industry<00:02:14.579> and<00:02:15.000> watch

on in the video game industry and watch
dogs<00:02:15.659> is<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.959> bit<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.379> you<00:02:16.709> know<00:02:16.739> competition

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
dogs is a bit of a you know competition

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160 
dogs is a bit of a you know competition
for<00:02:17.579> them<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.150> from<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.450> marketing<00:02:18.900> standpoint

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
for them so from a marketing standpoint

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.080 
for them so from a marketing standpoint
is<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.829> best<00:02:20.040> option<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.579> release<00:02:20.879> their

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
is it the best option to release their

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.610 
is it the best option to release their
dlc<00:02:21.510> during<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.900> same<00:02:22.049> time<00:02:22.079> that<00:02:22.439> watch<00:02:22.590> dogs

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
dlc during the same time that watch dogs

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.309 
dlc during the same time that watch dogs
is<00:02:23.010> coming<00:02:23.459> out<00:02:23.579> I<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:24.450> don't<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.200> it<00:02:25.290> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
is coming out I I don't know if it is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.800 
is coming out I I don't know if it is
realistically<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.310> probably<00:02:26.879> isn't<00:02:27.120> but<00:02:27.510> at

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
realistically it probably isn't but at

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.030 
realistically it probably isn't but at
the<00:02:27.930> same<00:02:28.110> time<00:02:28.319> they<00:02:28.530> probably<00:02:28.739> don't<00:02:28.920> have

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the same time they probably don't have

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
the same time they probably don't have
that<00:02:29.280> much<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.610> choice<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.900> DLC

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
that much of a choice because the DLC

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.539 
that much of a choice because the DLC
has<00:02:31.379> been<00:02:31.530> delayed<00:02:31.859> so<00:02:31.920> much<00:02:32.280> at<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.459> point

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
has been delayed so much at this point

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.280 
has been delayed so much at this point
as<00:02:32.909> well<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:33.180> heists<00:02:33.599> that<00:02:33.840> at<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.079> point

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
as well as heists that at this point

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.960 
as well as heists that at this point
they<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.829> just<00:02:34.859> need<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.280> get<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
they really just need to get it out and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.880 
they really just need to get it out and
get<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.150> released<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.780> obviously<00:02:37.470> you<00:02:37.650> know

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
get it released and obviously you know

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.020 
get it released and obviously you know
they<00:02:38.040> don't<00:02:38.189> want<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.370> make<00:02:38.489> us<00:02:38.640> wait<00:02:38.790> until

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
they don't want to make us wait until

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.839 
they don't want to make us wait until
june<00:02:39.269> or<00:02:39.480> july<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.470> this<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.489> pretty<00:02:41.609> much<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
june or july so this is pretty much the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.819 
june or july so this is pretty much the
only<00:02:42.030> option<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.319> other<00:02:43.349> thing<00:02:43.530> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
only option and then the other thing to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.710 
only option and then the other thing to
consider<00:02:43.980> is<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.519> fact<00:02:44.879> that<00:02:44.970> watch<00:02:45.180> dogs<00:02:45.209> is

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
consider is the fact that watch dogs is

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.930 
consider is the fact that watch dogs is
