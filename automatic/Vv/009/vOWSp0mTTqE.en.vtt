put this together you'll just be amazed
at<00:01:48.469> what<00:01:48.590> happens<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.219> now<00:01:49.369> we're<00:01:49.609> going<00:01:49.759> to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
at what happens so now we're going to

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.690 
at what happens so now we're going to
lay<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:50.689> on<00:01:50.899> top<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.289> each<00:01:51.439> other<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:54.549> we<00:01:55.549> are

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
lay this on top of each other and we are

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.249 
lay this on top of each other and we are
going<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.060> sew<00:01:56.270> both<00:01:56.509> sides<00:01:56.899> of<00:01:57.109> this<00:01:57.200> a

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
going to sew both sides of this a

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.760 
going to sew both sides of this a
quarter<00:01:57.710> inch<00:01:57.890> seam<00:01:58.009> and<00:01:58.579> make<00:01:58.939> a<00:01:59.149> tube<00:01:59.770> okay

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
quarter inch seam and make a tube okay

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.260 
quarter inch seam and make a tube okay
so<00:02:00.829> we<00:02:01.039> place<00:02:01.280> these<00:02:01.460> right<00:02:01.759> sides<00:02:01.789> together

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
so we place these right sides together

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.200 
so we place these right sides together
and<00:02:03.280> we're<00:02:04.280> going<00:02:04.429> to<00:02:04.490> sew<00:02:04.640> a<00:02:04.670> quarter<00:02:05.060> inch

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
and we're going to sew a quarter inch

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.950 
and we're going to sew a quarter inch
seam

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.390 

all<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.950> way<00:02:09.039> down<00:02:10.230> to<00:02:11.230> enclose<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.250> know

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
all the way down to enclose it I know

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.070 
all the way down to enclose it I know
this<00:02:12.730> sounds<00:02:13.090> kind<00:02:13.210> of<00:02:13.330> strange<00:02:13.540> but<00:02:13.900> what

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
this sounds kind of strange but what

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.470 
this sounds kind of strange but what
we're<00:02:14.230> doing<00:02:14.260> is<00:02:14.560> we're<00:02:14.740> making<00:02:14.860> a<00:02:15.130> tube<00:02:18.480> when

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
we're doing is we're making a tube when

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.520 
we're doing is we're making a tube when
you<00:02:19.600> so<00:02:19.810> long

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
you so long

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.979 
you so long
seems<00:02:20.740> like<00:02:21.040> this

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
seems like this

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.809 
seems like this
you<00:02:23.290> want<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.560> be<00:02:23.650> sure<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:24.040> change<00:02:24.340> directions

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
you want to be sure to change directions

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.330 
you want to be sure to change directions
often<00:02:25.659> so<00:02:26.049> that<00:02:26.230> your<00:02:26.409> fabric<00:02:26.799> doesn't<00:02:27.040> bow

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
often so that your fabric doesn't bow

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.020 
often so that your fabric doesn't bow
this<00:02:28.180> is<00:02:28.329> only<00:02:28.510> two<00:02:29.220> two<00:02:30.220> seams<00:02:30.670> so<00:02:31.000> it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
this is only two two seams so it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.420 
this is only two two seams so it
shouldn't<00:02:31.360> be<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:32.290> won't<00:02:32.409> be<00:02:32.590> bad<00:02:32.769> at<00:02:32.980> all

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
shouldn't be it won't be bad at all

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.789 
shouldn't be it won't be bad at all
but<00:02:33.790> if<00:02:33.879> you<00:02:33.939> sewed<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.209> your<00:02:34.780> seams<00:02:35.230> going<00:02:35.590> in

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
but if you sewed all your seams going in

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.970 
but if you sewed all your seams going in
one<00:02:35.980> direction<00:02:36.010> it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
one direction it

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.330 
one direction it
it<00:02:38.250> would<00:02:38.370> create<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.760> bow<00:02:39.000> in<00:02:39.240> that<00:02:39.900> pattern<00:02:40.410> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it would create a bow in that pattern so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.260 
it would create a bow in that pattern so
we're<00:02:41.490> just<00:02:41.520> going<00:02:41.730> to<00:02:41.819> turn<00:02:42.030> these<00:02:42.239> around

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
we're just going to turn these around

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.520 
we're just going to turn these around
and<00:02:42.750> sew<00:02:42.900> back<00:02:43.140> down<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.620> other<00:02:43.770> direction

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
and sew back down the other direction

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:51.760 
and sew back down the other direction
with<00:02:46.530> our<00:02:46.709> sides<00:02:47.010> matched<00:02:47.370> up<00:02:49.730> 1/4<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.790> an<00:02:50.880> inch

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
with our sides matched up 1/4 of an inch

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.350 
with our sides matched up 1/4 of an inch
okay<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:52.830> here<00:02:53.160> we<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.000> end<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.209> our

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
okay so here we are at the end of our

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.470 
okay so here we are at the end of our
two<00:02:55.640> let's<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.850> finish<00:02:57.060> this<00:02:57.330> up

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
two let's just finish this up

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.660 
two let's just finish this up
there<00:02:59.990> we<00:03:00.110> go<00:03:00.260> all<00:03:00.590> done<00:03:00.650> now<00:03:01.340> over<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.580> the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
there we go all done now over to the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.720 
there we go all done now over to the
cutting<00:03:01.819> cable<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.020> can<00:03:03.260> see<00:03:03.500> that<00:03:03.770> this

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
cutting cable so you can see that this

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.100 
cutting cable so you can see that this
is<00:03:04.910> a<00:03:04.940> tube<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.680> we'll<00:03:06.680> lay<00:03:06.830> it<00:03:06.860> out<00:03:07.010> here<00:03:07.489> and

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
is a tube and we'll lay it out here and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.440 
is a tube and we'll lay it out here and
we're<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.380> to<00:03:09.410> use<00:03:09.800> this<00:03:10.130> under<00:03:10.940> grid<00:03:11.150> ruler

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
we're going to use this under grid ruler

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.449 
we're going to use this under grid ruler
which<00:03:11.690> is<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:12.020> just<00:03:12.709> a<00:03:12.800> nine<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> half<00:03:13.220> inch

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
which is a just a nine and a half inch

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.250 
which is a just a nine and a half inch
square<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> imagine<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.300> can<00:03:14.450> do<00:03:14.540> anyone<00:03:14.989> that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
square I imagine you can do anyone that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.000 
square I imagine you can do anyone that
has<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:16.160> 45<00:03:16.640> degree<00:03:17.000> line<00:03:17.030> on<00:03:17.510> it<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.010> that's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
has the 45 degree line on it and that's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.570 
has the 45 degree line on it and that's
the<00:03:19.220> line<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.550> will<00:03:19.640> give<00:03:19.790> us<00:03:19.910> our<00:03:20.060> angles<00:03:21.580> so

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
the line that will give us our angles so

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.020 
the line that will give us our angles so
you<00:03:22.640> lay<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.090> line<00:03:23.360> on<00:03:24.550> your<00:03:25.550> quarter<00:03:25.880> of<00:03:25.940> an

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
you lay that line on your quarter of an

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.600 
you lay that line on your quarter of an
inch<00:03:26.090> seam<00:03:26.680> so<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.860> we<00:03:27.950> can<00:03:28.100> make<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.280> cut<00:03:28.580> here

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
inch seam so that we can make a cut here

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.040 
inch seam so that we can make a cut here
that<00:03:29.480> will<00:03:29.630> give<00:03:29.750> us<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.319> top<00:03:30.620> point<00:03:31.190> of<00:03:32.050> our

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
that will give us the top point of our

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.970 
that will give us the top point of our
first<00:03:33.319> cut

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
first cut

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.280 
first cut
now<00:03:34.340> I'm<00:03:34.519> left-handed<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.630> I'm<00:03:35.900> doing<00:03:36.080> this

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
now I'm left-handed so I'm doing this

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.190 
now I'm left-handed so I'm doing this
left-handed<00:03:36.920> ways<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.430> we<00:03:37.670> will<00:03:37.850> are<00:03:38.239> doing

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
left-handed ways and we will are doing

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.420 
left-handed ways and we will are doing
this<00:03:39.290> left-hand<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:39.950> then<00:03:40.040> we<00:03:40.160> will<00:03:40.280> bring

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
this left-hand and then we will bring

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.559 
this left-hand and then we will bring
Natalie<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.000> show<00:03:41.150> you<00:03:41.209> how<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.390> make

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
Natalie and to show you how to make

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.400 
Natalie and to show you how to make
right-handed<00:03:42.080> cut<00:03:42.290> a<00:03:43.299> little<00:03:44.299> bit<00:03:44.420> down<00:03:44.630> so

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
right-handed cut a little bit down so

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.080 
right-handed cut a little bit down so
the<00:03:45.530> next<00:03:45.739> thing<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.069> want<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.310> do<00:03:46.519> is<00:03:46.790> we<00:03:46.940> want

the next thing we want to do is we want

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.479 
the next thing we want to do is we want
to<00:03:47.180> slide<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.720> down<00:03:47.780> here<00:03:48.470> and<00:03:48.680> put<00:03:49.280> it<00:03:49.370> on

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
to slide this down here and put it on

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.870 
to slide this down here and put it on
the<00:03:49.640> bottom<00:03:49.790> seam<00:03:50.209> line<00:03:51.400> see<00:03:52.400> how<00:03:52.519> easy<00:03:52.760> that

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
the bottom seam line see how easy that

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.970 
the bottom seam line see how easy that
was<00:03:53.200> makes<00:03:54.200> a<00:03:54.319> point<00:03:54.620> and<00:03:55.239> we<00:03:56.239> make<00:03:56.420> our<00:03:56.450> cut

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
was makes a point and we make our cut

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.229 
was makes a point and we make our cut
we're<00:03:57.980> going<00:03:58.100> to<00:03:58.160> slide<00:03:58.489> it<00:03:58.670> up<00:03:58.790> we'll<00:03:59.090> move

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
we're going to slide it up we'll move

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.210 
we're going to slide it up we'll move
this<00:03:59.420> out<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.690> here<00:03:59.959> see<00:04:00.230> see<00:04:00.739> this<00:04:00.890> is<00:04:01.069> the

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
this out of here see see this is the

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.670 
this out of here see see this is the
block<00:04:01.459> that<00:04:01.489> you<00:04:01.880> get<00:04:02.290> put<00:04:03.290> it<00:04:03.380> right<00:04:03.560> along

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
block that you get put it right along

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:12.360 
block that you get put it right along
the<00:04:03.950> seam<00:04:04.190> line<00:04:04.489> and<00:04:07.420> we<00:04:08.420> make<00:04:08.600> another<00:04:08.870> cut

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.740 

this<00:04:13.370> is<00:04:13.549> going<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.790> be<00:04:13.910> so<00:04:14.090> amazing<00:04:14.329> when<00:04:14.660> you

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
this is going to be so amazing when you

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.710 
this is going to be so amazing when you
see<00:04:14.930> what<00:04:15.049> happens<00:04:15.410> when<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.620> open<00:04:15.950> these<00:04:16.070> up

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
see what happens when we open these up

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.969 
see what happens when we open these up
we'll<00:04:17.720> finish<00:04:17.900> cutting<00:04:18.260> these<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.680> really

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
we'll finish cutting these and really

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:22.990 
we'll finish cutting these and really
all<00:04:22.100> we<00:04:22.220> need<00:04:22.370> is<00:04:22.490> four<00:04:22.760> for<00:04:22.970> our

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
all we need is four for our

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.050 
all we need is four for our
demonstration<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.430> this<00:04:25.580> will<00:04:25.700> be<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:25.880> last

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
demonstration so this will be the last

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.400 
demonstration so this will be the last
one<00:04:26.300> we'll<00:04:26.510> cut<00:04:27.220> before<00:04:28.220> the<00:04:28.430> magic<00:04:28.910> begins

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.100

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
all right now we have four of these

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.260 
all right now we have four of these
blocks<00:04:35.470> and<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.340> can<00:04:36.520> get<00:04:36.670> four<00:04:36.910> more<00:04:37.090> out<00:04:37.240> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
blocks and you can get four more out of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.640 
blocks and you can get four more out of
this<00:04:37.480> tube<00:04:37.920> when<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:39.040> open<00:04:39.400> them<00:04:39.550> up<00:04:40.470> this<00:04:41.470> is

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
this tube when you open them up this is

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.420 
this tube when you open them up this is
what<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:41.980> get<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.250> little<00:04:42.670> piece<00:04:42.850> of<00:04:43.060> magic

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
what you get a little piece of magic

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.020 
what you get a little piece of magic
look<00:04:45.430> at<00:04:45.550> that<00:04:47.070> now<00:04:48.070> what's<00:04:48.280> fun<00:04:48.520> about<00:04:48.550> this

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
look at that now what's fun about this

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.050 
look at that now what's fun about this
is<00:04:49.390> because<00:04:49.960> of<00:04:50.260> the<00:04:50.350> way<00:04:50.470> they're<00:04:50.680> cut<00:04:51.060> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
is because of the way they're cut the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.710 
is because of the way they're cut the
entire<00:04:52.450> Center<00:04:53.200> will<00:04:53.770> be<00:04:53.890> opposites<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.730> so

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
entire Center will be opposites and so

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.550 
entire Center will be opposites and so
what<00:04:55.930> you're<00:04:56.110> making<00:04:56.590> is<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.770> double<00:04:57.160> hourglass

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
what you're making is a double hourglass

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:06.270 
what you're making is a double hourglass
set<00:04:59.560> on<00:04:59.800> point<00:05:04.410> how<00:05:05.410> cool<00:05:05.650> is<00:05:05.800> that

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
set on point how cool is that

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.710 
set on point how cool is that
let's<00:05:06.490> go<00:05:06.640> over<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:06.910> iron<00:05:07.090> these<00:05:07.270> so<00:05:07.450> you<00:05:07.480> get

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
let's go over and iron these so you get

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.840 
let's go over and iron these so you get
an<00:05:07.810> even<00:05:07.840> better<00:05:08.140> look<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.610> we<00:05:09.730> set<00:05:09.970> our<00:05:10.120> seams

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
an even better look so we set our seams

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.430 
an even better look so we set our seams
and<00:05:12.850> then<00:05:12.970> we'll<00:05:13.210> lift<00:05:13.360> them<00:05:13.600> up<00:05:13.630> and<00:05:14.020> press

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
and then we'll lift them up and press

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.189 
and then we'll lift them up and press
them<00:05:14.650> over<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:16.240> make<00:05:16.390> this<00:05:16.540> lay<00:05:16.780> flat

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:24.649 

and<00:05:22.710> I<00:05:22.830> think<00:05:23.099> if<00:05:23.249> you<00:05:23.370> had<00:05:23.610> like<00:05:24.360> three<00:05:24.629> of

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
and I think if you had like three of

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:26.119 
and I think if you had like three of
these<00:05:24.870> blocks<00:05:25.259> it<00:05:25.560> would<00:05:25.680> make<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.949> most

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:26.129 
these blocks it would make the most

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.610 
these blocks it would make the most
darling<00:05:26.430> little<00:05:26.789> table<00:05:27.120> runner<00:05:27.300> okay<00:05:28.199> so<00:05:28.259> here

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
darling little table runner okay so here

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.439 
darling little table runner okay so here
we<00:05:28.650> are<00:05:28.740> back<00:05:28.860> at<00:05:29.189> the<00:05:29.279> cutting<00:05:29.580> table<00:05:29.969> with

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
we are back at the cutting table with

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.800 
we are back at the cutting table with
our<00:05:30.479> nice<00:05:30.810> pressed<00:05:31.439> block<00:05:31.919> and<00:05:32.909> we<00:05:33.479> laid<00:05:33.659> them

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
our nice pressed block and we laid them

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.369 
our nice pressed block and we laid them
out<00:05:33.960> and<00:05:35.029> you<00:05:36.029> can<00:05:36.240> see<00:05:36.449> once<00:05:36.629> again<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:37.020> this

00:05:37.369 --> 00:05:37.379 
out and you can see once again that this

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.600 
out and you can see once again that this
is<00:05:37.560> a<00:05:37.909> double<00:05:38.909> hourglass<00:05:39.449> set<00:05:40.080> on<00:05:40.229> point<00:05:40.610> three

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
is a double hourglass set on point three

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.489 
is a double hourglass set on point three
of<00:05:41.729> these<00:05:41.879> blocks<00:05:42.210> with<00:05:42.479> a<00:05:42.509> little<00:05:42.779> three<00:05:43.349> inch

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:43.499 
of these blocks with a little three inch

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:45.170 
of these blocks with a little three inch
sashing<00:05:43.919> around<00:05:44.430> and<00:05:44.610> would<00:05:44.699> make<00:05:44.819> the<00:05:44.999> most

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
sashing around and would make the most

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.540 
sashing around and would make the most
darling<00:05:45.479> table<00:05:45.960> runner<00:05:46.169> ever<00:05:46.409> now<00:05:47.400> we're

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
darling table runner ever now we're

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.519 
darling table runner ever now we're
going<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.729> have<00:05:47.849> Natalie<00:05:48.300> show<00:05:48.569> how<00:05:49.169> to<00:05:49.229> cut<00:05:49.469> it

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:49.529 
going to have Natalie show how to cut it

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:51.739 
going to have Natalie show how to cut it
from<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:49.860> right-handed<00:05:50.520> side<00:05:50.789> because<00:05:51.389> it<00:05:51.509> is

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:51.749 
from the right-handed side because it is

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:56.059 
from the right-handed side because it is
it's<00:05:52.199> basically<00:05:52.439> the<00:05:52.889> same<00:05:53.039> idea<00:05:53.099> just<00:05:55.069> just

00:05:56.059 --> 00:05:56.069 
it's basically the same idea just just

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.679 
it's basically the same idea just just
just<00:05:56.550> takes<00:05:56.759> a<00:05:56.879> little<00:05:56.969> bit<00:05:57.120> different<00:05:57.569> angle

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
just takes a little bit different angle

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.629 
just takes a little bit different angle
so<00:05:58.439> we'll<00:05:58.589> have<00:05:58.740> her<00:05:58.949> come<00:05:59.129> over<00:05:59.219> and<00:05:59.430> show

00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 
so we'll have her come over and show

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:01.939 
so we'll have her come over and show
that<00:06:00.020> all<00:06:01.020> right<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.349> only<00:06:01.439> difference

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
that all right the only difference

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.110 
that all right the only difference
between<00:06:02.129> a<00:06:02.370> left-handed<00:06:02.969> and<00:06:03.029> a<00:06:03.089> right-handed

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.120 
between a left-handed and a right-handed

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.439 
between a left-handed and a right-handed
cut<00:06:03.810> is<00:06:04.050> which<00:06:04.289> side<00:06:04.740> you<00:06:04.949> start<00:06:05.189> on<00:06:05.400> so<00:06:06.270> we're

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
cut is which side you start on so we're

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:09.589 
cut is which side you start on so we're
going<00:06:06.539> to<00:06:06.599> do<00:06:06.779> this<00:06:06.930> from<00:06:07.139> this<00:06:07.319> side<00:06:08.360> just<00:06:09.360> the

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 
going to do this from this side just the

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:11.089 
going to do this from this side just the
same<00:06:09.810> as<00:06:09.930> she<00:06:10.050> did<00:06:10.169> before<00:06:10.349> lining<00:06:10.979> the

00:06:11.089 --> 00:06:11.099 
same as she did before lining the

okay so now that you've seen the
left-handed<00:06:36.070> in<00:06:36.190> the<00:06:36.280> right<00:06:36.430> handy<00:06:36.760> way<00:06:36.850> let's

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
left-handed in the right handy way let's

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.980 
left-handed in the right handy way let's
see<00:06:37.210> what<00:06:37.330> else<00:06:37.420> we<00:06:37.570> can<00:06:37.600> do<00:06:37.810> with<00:06:37.840> these

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
see what else we can do with these

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:41.280 
see what else we can do with these
blocks<00:06:38.260> besides<00:06:38.800> the<00:06:39.100> double<00:06:39.430> hourglass<00:06:40.290> so

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
blocks besides the double hourglass so

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.150 
blocks besides the double hourglass so
we<00:06:41.530> figure<00:06:41.950> we<00:06:41.980> can<00:06:42.340> put<00:06:42.520> them<00:06:42.610> together<00:06:42.760> and

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 
we figure we can put them together and

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.560 
we figure we can put them together and
make<00:06:45.160> the<00:06:45.340> double<00:06:45.640> square<00:06:48.330> we<00:06:49.330> could<00:06:49.480> do

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
make the double square we could do

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.820 
make the double square we could do
something<00:06:49.990> wild<00:06:50.380> and<00:06:50.680> crazy<00:06:51.040> and<00:06:51.550> and<00:06:52.830> line

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:53.830 
something wild and crazy and and line

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.170 
something wild and crazy and and line
them<00:06:53.980> up<00:06:54.070> so<00:06:54.580> that<00:06:54.610> they're<00:06:56.760> they<00:06:57.760> make<00:06:57.910> a<00:06:57.940> kind

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180
