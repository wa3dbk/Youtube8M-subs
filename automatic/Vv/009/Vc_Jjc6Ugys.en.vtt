00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.440
 hello to all the techniques welcome to 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:19.510
 unboxing video of samsung galaxy s ii 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.730
 we thank the friends of global work 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.070
 mobile for this terminal that is 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.110
 this year's boxing object a good one 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.160
 first curiosity see the terminal here 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:33.039
 presents the white color in the 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.340
 we say cover the sticker and instead there 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:39.309
 he says inexorably that the coloring 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.520
 inside is black for me 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.430
 it is not very recent it came out more or less 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.440
 on the market towards the end of September 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.090
 however, not having yet reviewed the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.980
 metal moves kept an interesting 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.860
 definitely take a look at the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.780
 terminal also this is one of the few 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 terminals that we manage say 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.899
 perfectly both sims in 3g 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.250
 well let's go to open the 4th pack 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.159
 this confession of tests and therefore not 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.909
 there are plastiki or on the terminal 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.640
 here it is the galaxy s ii in version 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.880
 black as the sticker saying precisely the 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 battery inside and a thousand and 500 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.780
 milliampere the packaging content is 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.939
 much we say very basic we have the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.229
 charger in the format 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:32.950
 here it is micro usb and a cable that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.860
 you see usb micro usb 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.580
 beyond the lack of the manual 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.130
 Fast paper does not lack nothing 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.479
 so the headphones just aren't 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 inside the package 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.060
 original as there are not 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:52.000
 well let's put the packaging aside 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.829
 meanwhile we open the craxi s2 with the 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.700
 classic opening threshold now for everyone 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:00.670
 the last samsung terminals we insert 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.050
 the battery and here is a slot in 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.860
 mini- like format 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.570
 double slot for the two sims just fine 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.780
 if we go to see the quickly then 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.430
 terminal in the back 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.680
 meanwhile let's close the matter aside 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.450
 possible we have the camera that is 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.970
 a 5 megapixel sensor is not 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.800
 backlight is present the auto focus 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.050
 but curiously, the touch is not present 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.390
 focus we will see it as in the dedicated focus groups 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.610
 led flash and video voice speaker 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.300
 then we have on the front the 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.820
 display that with 4 inches by 800 x 480 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.910
 of simple effects cues is not love them 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:44.110
 of the super amoled and nor ips 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:48.280
 or prs then we have a front room 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.990
 in vga format proximity sensor not 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.550
 there is a light sensor 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.580
 therefore the museum is not present 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.940
 automatic ear capsule after the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.700
 home button and here two soft touch backs e 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.340
 menu on your left presents the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.350
 volume rocker on the right side is 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.830
 the power button is present 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.459
 switch off and the lid for the 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.570
 micro sd slot cover 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.239
 especially they are only supported up to 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:21.220
 at 32 giga I will try my 64 taken 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.320
 eventually reads also the 64 on 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.190
 bottom side we have the connector 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.770
 micro usb and the hole for the microphone e 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.790
 on the upper front bus 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:35.080
 excuse me 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.510
 we have the 3m jack for headphones well 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.000
 while doing the terminal I give you 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.230
 some other feature is 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:49.450
 first of all the dimensions we have 121.5 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:53.050
 for 63.1 for a thickness of 10.5 mm the 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.910
 weight is 120 grams is quite good 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.310
 and above all the phone is compact 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.350
 at least for a person like me who by now 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.840
 get used phone that go at minimum 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.720
 on 4 and a half inches back to 4 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.080
 inch and finely I seem to be 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.420
 back to old men to old sony 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.520
 ericsson I don't know if anyone says 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.740
 he remembers it anyway apart from these 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.610
 nonsense 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.840
 I turn on the phone while I give you 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.430
 some other information 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.560
 the operating system is android 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.660
 obviously in version 4.0 4 therefore ice 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.510
 cream sandwich will be upgradeable ease 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.700
 booklet and soon the samsung has 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.169
 officially announced we have 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.479
 not too much professor 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:40.600
 let's say recent a qualcomm 72 27 a is a 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:43.090
 dragon of the s1 family then the first 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.830
 process snapdragon family 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.450
 production at 45 nanometers than the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.180
 professor do it for they were in which 4 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:52.419
 in 2011 so you have more or less 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:55.090
 present in short here is the period is a 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.790
 1 gigahertz people and architecture 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:02.530
 of the support to professor is that arm 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:05.770
 cortex a5 the gpu inside is a grain 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:09.420
 200 the memory available to the ram 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.910
 but I'm talking sorry I'm 768 megs 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.080
 the internal aroma is 4 gigabytes apologetic 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:18.810
 meanwhile I connected to the net I said to myself 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.800
 the memory is 4 gigabytes and the rom 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.320
 internal 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.390
 I told him expandable via microsd 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:32.820
 and yet available to the user 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:35.490
 there are about 1.8 gigabytes at startup 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.100
 we then have connectivity as you see 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.890
 wifi bgn 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.180
 not dual band only safe band bandas 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.770
 therefore only on the 2.4 gigahertz 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.800
 sorry I was wrong here we go on 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:54.810
 following 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:56.730
 ok then we have a connectivity beyond 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:59.370
 to the wifi connectivity we have the 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:03.600
 h spa connectivity and to be precise 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:06.870
 we have 7.2 megabits in download and 5.76 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.340
 megabit upload 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.950
 we then always with regards 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:16.340
 the connectivity we have the bluetooth in 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:18.990
 version 3.0 with protocol support 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:21.260
 a2dp then to music streaming 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.740
 via bluetooth 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.850
 I've already talked about the camera 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.820
 keep asking me to think about accounts 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:32.100
 samsung camera back that 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.630
 with I said it's 5 megapixel with 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.540
 sensor not backlit then a 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:40.080
 extremely classic sensor is not 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.240
 when the touch focus is present the videos come 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.800
 people unfortunately only in vga format 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.720
 at 30 frames per second 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.260
 the front camera is a camera 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.450
 also we then all the vga 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:54.750
 classic sensors then accelerometer 

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:56.190
 we have no compass proximity 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.000
 said the brightness sensor of 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:02.940
 a present automatic brightness 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.340
 however we have a gps GPS is formed 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.720
 so they should be fast enough 

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.810
 if from there we will see 

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.390
 we then have a stereo radio in with 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:16.650
 rds support the verdict battery 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:19.170
 be a thousand and 500 thousand per well for 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.030
 regarding the boxing and the 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:23.700
 technical features of the galaxy s2 

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:25.080
 if I refer you to the focus in 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:27.330
 next days 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:31.100
 thanks again for following me and a 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.100
 greeting from tecnost
