00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.570
 good day as I told you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.090
 last week 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:22.070
 we will therefore realize today a 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.070
 little soup with mushrooms so 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:30.720
 well we'll start a little box 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.739
 mushrooms cut in eighty 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.760
 fifteen small trays 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.760
 so we will put in the device 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:01:00.469
 Monday then save himself to 2000 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:00.469
 zucchini 1 had cut into pieces 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 the good die cut into pieces and we 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.619
 will put as stock cube 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 vegetables 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:26.690
 here we are going to add water up to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.690
 height of the first train and it will be good 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.549
 so we will add the water 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:48.070
 judge would count the highest one here and we 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:52.360
 will be able to cook and well there 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.200
 we will choose the first position 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.479
 until then we want a soup or line and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.750
 this is the device is stuck at the 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.439
 pollution 1 and have started cooking that's 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.019
 Let's go 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:14.080
 there are not 20 minutes you can 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:16.380
 hear that that's okay and steam 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.380
 fate 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.049
 but there obviously as steam 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.239
 escapes who has no danger of leather the 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:33.349
 cover as is the case on the 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:37.810
 competing devices and well the soup 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.810
 is finished so we will serve her 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.109
 you will notice that the jetta was there 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.430
 to give a small green color 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:58.069
 otherwise a sample of a color 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:03:00.590
 light brown is much better with 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:07.939
 a little iron pot then after there is 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:10.280
 two solutions or so you add and 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.519
 you mix two portions of cow that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:20.959
 laughs but hey it's not recommended for 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:22.800
 the line or so well here it is 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.960
 better 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:31.410
 you will add a little bit of 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.580
 grain and weigh not too much liquid you to 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.050
 Hevea is a little bit in the hold 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:43.980
 and it will improve the couple here is good 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.120
 for this week it's over then 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.410
 as many people have 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.390
 asked legend where the souls 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.670
 the book ends and the good weather to 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.260
 to arrive and so it will be necessary maybe 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:01.230
 lose some weight so from 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.200
 next Sunday we will be studying 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 fat burning soups that allow you to 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.090
 find the light 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.370

 this blair time or where I'm trying to 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:45.660
 to exceed months here you can add 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.250
 salt pepper and maybe tobacco 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.980
