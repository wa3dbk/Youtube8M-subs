butterflies and two blue boots so here's

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.390 
butterflies and two blue boots so here's
the<00:00:40.180> main<00:00:40.390> event<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:41.170> it's<00:00:41.769> a<00:00:41.949> one<00:00:42.129> and<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.370> half

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
the main event and it's a one and a half

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.390 
the main event and it's a one and a half
minute<00:00:43.000> rounds<00:00:43.510> and<00:00:43.629> it<00:00:43.900> is<00:00:44.080> quite<00:00:44.440> tough<00:00:44.769> you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
minute rounds and it is quite tough you

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.460 
minute rounds and it is quite tough you
need<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.760> block<00:00:46.000> just<00:00:46.420> before<00:00:46.900> your<00:00:47.080> hit<00:00:47.260> to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
need to block just before your hit to

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.950 
need to block just before your hit to
get<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> perfect<00:00:48.010> block<00:00:48.489> and<00:00:48.760> sometimes<00:00:49.750> he

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
get a perfect block and sometimes he

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.289 
get a perfect block and sometimes he
does<00:00:50.170> slower<00:00:50.589> moves<00:00:50.979> than<00:00:51.339> others<00:00:51.699> so<00:00:52.089> when

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
does slower moves than others so when

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.960 
does slower moves than others so when
the<00:00:52.659> crowd<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.140> right<00:00:53.409> down<00:00:53.769> coming<00:00:54.519> down<00:00:54.729> from

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
the crowd is right down coming down from

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.270 
the crowd is right down coming down from
up<00:00:55.150> wait<00:00:55.720> longer<00:00:56.110> as<00:00:56.500> that's<00:00:56.799> one<00:00:57.040> of<00:00:57.159> his

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
up wait longer as that's one of his

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.149 
up wait longer as that's one of his
slower<00:00:57.699> moves<00:00:58.059> and<00:00:58.420> heavy<00:00:59.290> weapon<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.890> good

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
slower moves and heavy weapon is good

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.850 
slower moves and heavy weapon is good
because<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.820> does<00:01:01.059> block<00:01:01.510> slower<00:01:02.080> than<00:01:02.500> light

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
because it does block slower than light

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.219 
because it does block slower than light
weapon<00:01:03.369> and<00:01:03.549> so<00:01:04.119> you've<00:01:04.299> got<00:01:04.330> more<00:01:04.689> chance<00:01:04.960> of

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
weapon and so you've got more chance of

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.560 
weapon and so you've got more chance of
getting<00:01:05.560> perfect<00:01:06.070> block<00:01:06.310> now<00:01:07.030> when<00:01:07.180> he<00:01:07.299> puts

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
getting perfect block now when he puts

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.570 
getting perfect block now when he puts
his<00:01:07.689> arm<00:01:07.960> light<00:01:08.260> up<00:01:08.470> in<00:01:08.650> the<00:01:08.799> air<00:01:08.920> and<00:01:09.159> his<00:01:09.280> body

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
his arm light up in the air and his body

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.300 
his arm light up in the air and his body
straight<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.960> center<00:01:11.439> block<00:01:11.680> but

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
straight that is the center block but

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.060 
straight that is the center block but
when<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.610> twist<00:01:12.909> his<00:01:13.240> body<00:01:13.540> and<00:01:13.930> also<00:01:14.500> keeps

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
when you twist his body and also keeps

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.670 
when you twist his body and also keeps
his<00:01:15.250> arm<00:01:15.460> out<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:15.910> side<00:01:16.030> that's<00:01:17.020> a<00:01:17.320> right

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
his arm out to the side that's a right

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.550 
his arm out to the side that's a right
block<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.820> I'll<00:01:19.210> show<00:01:19.270> you<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.780> few<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.290> the

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
block so I'll show you a few of the

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.460 
block so I'll show you a few of the
moves<00:01:21.040> here<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:21.730> that<00:01:21.940> we<00:01:22.090> can<00:01:22.330> identify<00:01:22.600> them

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
moves here so that we can identify them

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.500 
moves here so that we can identify them
as<00:01:23.620> he<00:01:24.070> does<00:01:24.250> have<00:01:24.550> a<00:01:24.760> couple<00:01:25.240> that<00:01:25.390> looked

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
as he does have a couple that looked

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.840 
as he does have a couple that looked
quite<00:01:25.810> similar<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.530> watch<00:01:27.250> out<00:01:27.520> from<00:01:27.730> his

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
quite similar and watch out from his

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.570 
quite similar and watch out from his
double<00:01:28.300> hit<00:01:28.540> you<00:01:28.900> need<00:01:29.050> to<00:01:29.170> block<00:01:29.409> longer<00:01:30.010> so

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
double hit you need to block longer so

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.490 
double hit you need to block longer so
that<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.850> don't<00:01:31.120> get<00:01:31.270> hit<00:01:31.540> by<00:01:31.750> his<00:01:31.990> second

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
that you don't get hit by his second

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.340 
that you don't get hit by his second
salt<00:01:32.830> now<00:01:33.550> he<00:01:33.610> has<00:01:33.970> two<00:01:34.240> down<00:01:34.630> two<00:01:34.840> up<00:01:34.870> news

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
salt now he has two down two up news

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.230 
salt now he has two down two up news
that<00:01:35.620> looks<00:01:35.830> similar<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.520> when<00:01:36.700> he's<00:01:36.909> leaning

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
that looks similar so when he's leaning

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.930 
that looks similar so when he's leaning
it's<00:01:38.050> a<00:01:38.230> right<00:01:38.530> block<00:01:38.980> but<00:01:39.640> when<00:01:39.760> his

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
it's a right block but when his

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.750 
it's a right block but when his
straighter<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.840> his<00:01:41.470> other<00:01:41.710> sword<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.310> up<00:01:42.520> in

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
straighter and his other sword is up in

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.360 
straighter and his other sword is up in
the<00:01:42.790> air<00:01:43.090> that's<00:01:43.780> a<00:01:43.990> center<00:01:44.560> block

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
the air that's a center block

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.120 
the air that's a center block
and<00:01:45.720> you'll<00:01:46.720> find<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.140> there's<00:01:47.470> actually<00:01:47.890> no

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
and you'll find that there's actually no

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.700 
and you'll find that there's actually no
left<00:01:48.520> blocks<00:01:48.910> it's<00:01:49.300> all<00:01:49.660> center<00:01:50.230> or<00:01:50.440> right

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
left blocks it's all center or right

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.890 
left blocks it's all center or right
blocks<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.640> if<00:01:51.760> it<00:01:51.880> looks<00:01:52.090> like<00:01:52.330> there's<00:01:52.750> the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
blocks so if it looks like there's the

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.870 
blocks so if it looks like there's the
left<00:01:53.140> block<00:01:53.440> coming<00:01:53.890> it's<00:01:54.130> not<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.640> will<00:01:54.700> be<00:01:54.850> a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
left block coming it's not it will be a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.720 
left block coming it's not it will be a
center<00:01:55.360> block<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.900> he's<00:01:56.560> also<00:01:56.740> not<00:01:57.160> one<00:01:57.460> hit

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
center block and he's also not one hit

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.360 
center block and he's also not one hit
kills<00:01:58.060> so<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:58.570> health<00:01:58.810> potion<00:01:59.380> is<00:01:59.560> useful<00:02:00.130> and

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.370 
kills so the health potion is useful and

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.540 
kills so the health potion is useful and
he<00:02:01.060> doesn't<00:02:01.540> take<00:02:01.750> off<00:02:01.960> much<00:02:02.260> shield<00:02:03.070> so<00:02:03.490> you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
he doesn't take off much shield so you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.170 
he doesn't take off much shield so you
may<00:02:03.850> not<00:02:04.060> need<00:02:04.330> a<00:02:04.540> shield<00:02:04.960> replenish<00:02:05.560> potion

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
may not need a shield replenish potion

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.300 
may not need a shield replenish potion
so<00:02:07.180> I<00:02:07.240> locum<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:07.930> try<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> few<00:02:08.590> times<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
so I locum and you try a few times to

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.700 
so I locum and you try a few times to
get<00:02:09.430> the<00:02:09.610> timing<00:02:09.940> right<00:02:10.149> as<00:02:10.960> he<00:02:11.290> does<00:02:11.470> have

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
get the timing right as he does have

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.040 
get the timing right as he does have
different<00:02:12.160> speeds<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.700> hits<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.210> this<00:02:13.810> one

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
different speeds of hits and this one

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380 
different speeds of hits and this one
overhead<00:02:14.830> again<00:02:15.400> you<00:02:15.520> need<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.820> wait<00:02:16.000> longer

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
overhead again you need to wait longer

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.930 
overhead again you need to wait longer
it's<00:02:17.050> a<00:02:17.260> double<00:02:17.680> hit<00:02:17.920> and<00:02:18.190> he<00:02:18.430> does<00:02:18.640> take

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
it's a double hit and he does take

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.810 
it's a double hit and he does take
longer<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.510> perform<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.190> there's<00:02:21.190> one<00:02:21.280> break

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
longer to perform it there's one break

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.630 
longer to perform it there's one break
and<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.780> may<00:02:22.960> perform<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.530> step<00:02:23.830> back<00:02:24.070> in<00:02:24.280> stage

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
and you may perform a step back in stage

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.390 
and you may perform a step back in stage
so<00:02:25.030> be<00:02:25.540> ready<00:02:25.720> for<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.560> I've<00:02:27.010> put<00:02:27.190> his

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so be ready for that and I've put his

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.520 
so be ready for that and I've put his
step<00:02:27.730> backs<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.630> description<00:02:29.140> under<00:02:29.410> this

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
step backs in the description under this

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.280 
step backs in the description under this
video<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.790> keep<00:02:31.090> practicing<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.990> get<00:02:32.170> the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
video so keep practicing to get the

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.070 
video so keep practicing to get the
timing<00:02:32.620> right<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:33.430> may<00:02:33.700> need<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.000> run<00:02:34.810> through

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
timing right you may need to run through

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.860 
timing right you may need to run through
the<00:02:35.230> stage<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.770> few<00:02:36.100> times<00:02:36.370> guess<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.360> if

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
the stage a few times guess it and if

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.990 
the stage a few times guess it and if
you<00:02:37.990> do<00:02:38.170> find<00:02:38.440> heaven<00:02:38.740> too<00:02:39.100> hard<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:39.730> want<00:02:39.910> to

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you do find heaven too hard and want to

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940 
you do find heaven too hard and want to
use<00:02:40.240> light<00:02:40.540> again<00:02:41.350> check<00:02:41.620> out<00:02:41.800> the
