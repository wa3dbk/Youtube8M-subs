00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
I've looked at well before but I'm going

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370

to concentrate primarily on Roadbuster

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.410 
to concentrate primarily on Roadbuster
but<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.740> reason<00:01:34.160> I<00:01:34.520> brought<00:01:34.700> whirl<00:01:34.970> up<00:01:35.240> is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
but the reason I brought whirl up is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.330 
but the reason I brought whirl up is
because<00:01:36.020> they<00:01:36.230> both<00:01:36.410> come<00:01:36.650> along<00:01:36.920> from<00:01:37.220> the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
because they both come along from the

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.820

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
it so i won't so I'd be completely

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.110 
it so i won't so I'd be completely
honest<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.560> know<00:02:29.620> absolutely<00:02:30.010> nothing<00:02:30.879> about

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
honest I know absolutely nothing about

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.849 
honest I know absolutely nothing about
the<00:02:31.420> show<00:02:31.629> other<00:02:32.019> than<00:02:32.349> the<00:02:32.500> fact<00:02:32.620> i<00:02:32.829> think

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:32.859 
the show other than the fact i think

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.309 
the show other than the fact i think
it's<00:02:33.250> similar<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.849> the<00:02:34.120> lines<00:02:34.329> of<00:02:34.510> battle<00:02:34.840> tech

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
it's similar to the lines of battle tech

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.569 
it's similar to the lines of battle tech
and<00:02:35.590> i<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:36.670> they're<00:02:36.819> like<00:02:36.969> make<00:02:37.629> tank

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
and i think they're like make tank

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.000 
and i think they're like make tank
protection<00:02:39.579> force<00:02:39.969> police<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.989> does<00:02:41.920> that

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
protection force police thing does that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.879 
protection force police thing does that
make<00:02:42.189> sense<00:02:42.269> no<00:02:43.269> doesn't<00:02:44.079> matter<00:02:44.200> let's<00:02:44.769> look

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
make sense no doesn't matter let's look

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.039 
make sense no doesn't matter let's look
at<00:02:45.040> Roadbuster<00:02:45.430> he's<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> good<00:02:46.209> character<00:02:46.659> in

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
at Roadbuster he's a good character in

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.360 
at Roadbuster he's a good character in
the<00:02:47.319> comic<00:02:47.560> book<00:02:47.680> runners<00:02:47.950> you<00:02:48.099> know<00:02:48.220> he

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the comic book runners you know he

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.830 
the comic book runners you know he
didn't<00:02:48.639> appear<00:02:48.939> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.120> transformer<00:02:49.629> show

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
didn't appear in the transformer show

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.190 
didn't appear in the transformer show
and<00:02:50.019> reason<00:02:50.590> being<00:02:50.799> for<00:02:50.919> that<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:52.200> the

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
and reason being for that because the

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.099 
and reason being for that because the
toy<00:02:53.409> was<00:02:53.470> one<00:02:53.859> hasbro<00:02:54.310> or<00:02:54.549> secure<00:02:55.120> as<00:02:55.239> rival<00:02:55.719> so

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
toy was one hasbro or secure as rival so

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.629 
toy was one hasbro or secure as rival so
if<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.319> show<00:02:56.530> was<00:02:56.680> gonna<00:02:56.829> be<00:02:56.889> shown<00:02:57.129> in<00:02:57.159> Japan

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
if the show was gonna be shown in Japan

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.699 
if the show was gonna be shown in Japan
they<00:02:58.090> can't<00:02:58.359> have<00:02:58.599> characters<00:02:59.379> from<00:02:59.469> other

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
they can't have characters from other

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.490 
they can't have characters from other
shows<00:03:00.010> appearing<00:03:00.579> in<00:03:00.760> their<00:03:01.030> show<00:03:01.299> so<00:03:01.959> it's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
shows appearing in their show so it's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.869

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.349 
take a look at the toy bizarre color
scheme<00:04:02.919> isn't<00:04:03.069> it<00:04:03.250> because<00:04:03.549> he's<00:04:03.790> yet<00:04:04.060> again

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
scheme isn't it because he's yet again

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:05.729 
scheme isn't it because he's yet again
he's<00:04:04.540> not<00:04:04.689> a<00:04:04.720> transform<00:04:05.319> and<00:04:05.500> they<00:04:05.560> obviously

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
he's not a transform and they obviously

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.819 
he's not a transform and they obviously
didn't<00:04:06.250> bother<00:04:06.459> changing<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.329> color<00:04:07.829> they

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
didn't bother changing the color they

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.589 
didn't bother changing the color they
put<00:04:08.979> a<00:04:09.009> rub<00:04:09.220> sign<00:04:09.549> on<00:04:09.790> him<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.150> know<00:04:10.269> that

think they die cast metal because

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.999 
think they die cast metal because
they're<00:05:13.880> chipping<00:05:14.090> away<00:05:14.360> down<00:05:14.599> here<00:05:14.800> so<00:05:15.800> yeah
