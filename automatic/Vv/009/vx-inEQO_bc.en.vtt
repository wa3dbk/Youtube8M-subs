product I was really drawn by the design
of<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.729> and<00:01:00.940> because<00:01:01.809> it<00:01:02.229> has<00:01:02.499> i<00:01:03.010> think<00:01:03.879> it's

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
of it and because it has i think it's

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.800 
of it and because it has i think it's
called<00:01:04.150> it<00:01:04.570> turdus<00:01:05.260> or<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.800> tortoise<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:07.720> of

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
called it turdus or the tortoise kind of

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.850 
called it turdus or the tortoise kind of
packaging<00:01:08.320> which<00:01:08.590> looks<00:01:08.860> like<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.070> and<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
packaging which looks like this and this

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.450 
packaging which looks like this and this
is<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.400> much<00:01:12.970> better<00:01:13.210> than<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:14.320> regular<00:01:14.980> black

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
is so much better than the regular black

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.330 
is so much better than the regular black
sleek<00:01:15.970> design<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.660> can't<00:01:17.320> say<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.860> feels<00:01:18.130> a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
sleek design I can't say that it feels a

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.920 
sleek design I can't say that it feels a
bit<00:01:18.520> thinner<00:01:18.970> than<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.110> regular<00:01:20.350> um

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
bit thinner than the regular um

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.020 
bit thinner than the regular um
highlighters<00:01:22.930> but<00:01:23.320> let's<00:01:24.190> see<00:01:24.430> what<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.670> looks

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.940 
like and there you go OOP something good
oh<00:01:30.660> so<00:01:31.660> this<00:01:31.810> is<00:01:31.990> what<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.260> looks<00:01:32.470> like<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
look at that like

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.600 
look at that like
I<00:01:36.530> didn't<00:01:37.530> tell<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.010> is<00:01:38.190> going<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.400> be

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I didn't tell that this is going to be

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.730 
I didn't tell that this is going to be
like<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.570> heck<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:42.000> beauty<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.870> thought<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
like one heck of a beauty I thought that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.980 
like one heck of a beauty I thought that
this<00:01:43.860> would<00:01:44.070> work<00:01:44.400> really<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:44.820> against<00:01:45.750> my

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
this would work really well against my

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.100 
this would work really well against my
skin<00:01:46.200> tone<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.740> because<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.820> fairly<00:01:48.720> tan

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
skin tone just because I'm fairly tan

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.650 
skin tone just because I'm fairly tan
and<00:01:51.320> nobody<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.500> go<00:01:52.680> wrong<00:01:52.890> with<00:01:53.160> bronze<00:01:53.660> I

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
and nobody can go wrong with bronze I

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.060 
and nobody can go wrong with bronze I
don't<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.290> if<00:01:55.410> I<00:01:55.530> would<00:01:55.590> really<00:01:55.860> recommend

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
don't know if I would really recommend

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.270
