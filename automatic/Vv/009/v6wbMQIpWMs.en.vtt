you<00:00:09.570> remember<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:09.990> car<00:00:10.230> it's<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.830> one<00:00:10.950> who

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
you remember this car it's the one who

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.990 
you remember this car it's the one who
dynode<00:00:11.460> that<00:00:11.610> manifold<00:00:12.030> on<00:00:13.759> deciding<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
dynode that manifold on deciding not to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
dynode that manifold on deciding not to
go<00:00:15.269> with<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.480> 90<00:00:15.660> millimeter<00:00:16.049> throttle<00:00:16.199> body

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
go with the 90 millimeter throttle body

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.250 
go with the 90 millimeter throttle body
I<00:00:17.570> honestly<00:00:19.010> don't<00:00:20.010> believe<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.490> yet<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
I honestly don't believe in it yet and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.189 
I honestly don't believe in it yet and
won't<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:23.070> I've<00:00:23.550> seen<00:00:23.880> too<00:00:24.269> many<00:00:24.990> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
won't because I've seen too many of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.650 
won't because I've seen too many of
these<00:00:25.260> cars<00:00:25.590> make<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> lot<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> power<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> the

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
these cars make a lot of power and the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.820 
these cars make a lot of power and the
stock<00:00:27.900> throttle<00:00:28.470> bodies<00:00:28.710> 80<00:00:28.920> millimeters

I've<00:00:31.830> seen<00:00:32.130> cars<00:00:32.399> make<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:33.149> know<00:00:33.680> eight

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
I've seen cars make you know eight

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.540 
I've seen cars make you know eight
hundred<00:00:35.070> plus<00:00:35.280> through<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:36.090> know<00:00:36.210> 70s<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
hundred plus through you know 70s so I

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.950 
hundred plus through you know 70s so I
don't<00:00:38.550> really<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:38.820> we're<00:00:39.180> gonna<00:00:39.270> need<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.540> 90

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
don't really think we're gonna need a 90

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
don't really think we're gonna need a 90
just<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> honest<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:41.180> bigger<00:00:42.180> is<00:00:42.450> not

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
just to be honest and bigger is not

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.900 
just to be honest and bigger is not
always<00:00:42.660> better

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
always better

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.369 
always better
most<00:00:44.910> definitely<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:46.850> I<00:00:47.850> am<00:00:48.750> gonna<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:49.079> taking

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
most definitely and I am gonna be taking

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.930 
most definitely and I am gonna be taking
the<00:00:49.469> nitrous<00:00:49.800> plate<00:00:49.920> out<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> want

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the nitrous plate out because I want

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.709 
the nitrous plate out because I want
this<00:00:51.110> back<00:00:52.190> that<00:00:53.190> distance<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.510> am

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
this back that distance because I am

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.860 
this back that distance because I am
building<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> new<00:00:55.140> intake<00:00:55.410> forward<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> cold<00:00:55.980> air

building a new intake forward a cold air

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.540 
building a new intake forward a cold air

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
moving the air intake temperature sensor

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.330 
moving the air intake temperature sensor
over<00:01:03.080> that<00:01:04.080> way<00:01:04.880> where<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.000> hole<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.510> done<00:01:07.380> in

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
over that way where the hole is done in

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.380 
over that way where the hole is done in
there<00:01:08.549> and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.930 

to<00:01:12.140> read<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.010> correct<00:01:13.400> air<00:01:13.640> intake

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.160 
to read the correct air intake
temperature<00:01:14.090> charge<00:01:14.540> it's<00:01:14.780> gonna<00:01:14.900> be<00:01:15.020> off<00:01:15.110> a

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
temperature charge it's gonna be off a

2011<00:01:16.010> srt8<00:01:17.229> challenger<00:01:18.229> they<00:01:18.380> have<00:01:18.500> a<00:01:18.530> better

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
2011 srt8 challenger they have a better

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.340 
2011 srt8 challenger they have a better
air<00:01:19.130> intake<00:01:19.400> temp<00:01:19.640> sensor<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.960> get<00:01:21.110> it<00:01:21.200> out<00:01:21.320> of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
air intake temp sensor to get it out of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.370 
air intake temp sensor to get it out of
this<00:01:21.500> heat<00:01:21.740> area<00:01:22.100> sometimes<00:01:22.550> these<00:01:22.760> show

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
this heat area sometimes these show

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.719 
this heat area sometimes these show
basically<00:01:24.380> false<00:01:24.890> readings<00:01:25.280> because<00:01:25.610> they

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
basically false readings because they

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.020 
basically false readings because they
eat<00:01:25.909> soak<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.300> sensor<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:28.640> lose<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.880> lot

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
eat soak the sensor and you lose a lot

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.940 
eat soak the sensor and you lose a lot
of<00:01:29.240> low<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.479> power<00:01:29.690> and<00:01:30.080> stuff<00:01:30.350> they<00:01:30.590> get<00:01:30.740> heat

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
of low in power and stuff they get heat

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.240 
of low in power and stuff they get heat
soaked<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.780> we're<00:01:32.990> switching<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.320> a<00:01:33.440> single

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.250 
soaked so we're switching to a single

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.560 
soaked so we're switching to a single
nozzle<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:34.700> if<00:01:34.790> you're<00:01:34.880> interested<00:01:35.180> in<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
nozzle so if you're interested in the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.499 
nozzle so if you're interested in the

it so the wide open throttle switch by

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.830 
it so the wide open throttle switch by
itself<00:05:13.550> is<00:05:13.820> no<00:05:14.180> good<00:05:14.360> for<00:05:14.540> what<00:05:14.690> we're<00:05:14.810> doing

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840
