00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.139
 hello friends how will they know fight night sad 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.020
 Fredys 4 was officially announced by 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.119
 half of scott cautious I do not want to ask them 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.430
 Apologies in advance because in this 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:17.980
 there will be no analysis of the trailer 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.050
 because I'm going to give you a notice about the 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.050
 story of face nights at fredys 4 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.480
 I've been thinking very seriously how 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.390
 make the last video about face 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.610
 nights at fredys in the two deliveries 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.790
 previous ones that I've made I 've done them 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.610
 in narrative form and the anthology in 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.530
 Chapter format is obvious that with 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.680
 this new delivery the story is 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.989
 rewrite therefore on this occasion 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.089
 I will not rewrite the whole story 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.390
 as I have done previously with the 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.390
 anthology 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.250
 I have seen some comments regarding 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.840
 the long duration that the anthology has 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.390
 some liked the duration but 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.580
 others were very tedious to have to 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.550
 listen to the voice loquendo for almost hour and 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.980
 mean and I understand that since I have taken 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.250
 the decision to do two parts if it is 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.990
 the video is over 50 minutes I 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.720
 comments have come on the date 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.350
 of the game's launch that will be 8 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.810
 August 2015 good if it's really 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.460
 the release date I want to tell you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.770
 that I will start with the production of 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.770
 video on the set date that scott 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.840
 had put in their pitchers so 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.740
 I will start to make the video in the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740
 corresponding date 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.220
 I do this for four reasons 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.000
 important one more information 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.120
 abundant for research two 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.300
 planning and argumentation 3 edition of 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.479
 video 4 time to make said 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.610
 work there are many people who think 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.010
 that making a full video is done 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.740
 It takes a lot of time overnight 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:03.010
 work and effort put together a whole 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.440
 puzzle so I really ask them 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.470
 they say ask when I'm going to upload 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.350
 the video because I do not even know how much 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.060
 it may take to do this are by 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.280
 sure that follows the history of country 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.550
 night sad fredys 4 even if 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.410
 working on other projects well I think 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.570
 that going to the next topic I 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.550
 I would like to ask you as always if 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.800
 have information that can help me in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.959
 the research can share it in 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.970
 the comments 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.710
 this would help me produce the script more 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.930
 Quick 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.180
 I know that maybe some people do not 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.040
 will agree to these measures or 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.410
 that I always take a long time in 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.630
 do it but really and you know 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.030
 I try to give you a good video that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.220
 is understandable that not boring 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.800
