 I started playing the first 5 games that 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.960

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.379

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.979
 future things to tell you that this video 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 it's just so that one for that 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.760
 apart from enjoying a bit how 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.700
 hold three to tell you a little about 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.900
 plan the goals that I have and things 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.210
 that have happened on my channel during this 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.080
 year let's say it's like the count and 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.360
 and objectives is nothing of relocation 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.729
 tell you that I am very happy that 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.920
 I started the channel so let's say that on 1 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.500
 September was already pretty much 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.869
 formalized with about 70 subscribers and 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.250
 when a nuclear arrived in search and 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.890
 destroy what started to go each time 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.509
 better and now I have changed the trailer of the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.390
 channel by void in looking for this that I 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.280
 because it is better and nothing bit by bit 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.200
 they were coming out the things I got to do 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.729
 a rather difficult series than the new 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.960
 nuclear in all the eggs the 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.460
 I managed to do if I'm not mistaken in 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.320
 three months sorry 2006 and a half and thank you 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.509
 to that because I encouraged her to continue to 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.260
 keep uploading videos to follow I do not know 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.270
 with illusion and with ship with me I think that 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.750
 and trying to get a few games 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.160
 trying to make things be 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.290
 entertaining that are spectacular by 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.270
 say it some other way than try 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.310
 teach you everything that everything I 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.740
 I can control in the call of duty a lot 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.210
 People ask me but not you because 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.800
 do not upload another game I say good 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.690
 is that I do not upload another game because Carlos 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.130
 food and if I'm doing quite well and because 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.330
 at the moment is what I want to upload my 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.770
 subscribers are call of duty and 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.320
 I do not want to bring you anything other than 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.360
 be call of duty later on we'll see 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.010
 later we would see if you can climb 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.110
 I know any other battle game 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.880
 signature in class I do not know what that is anymore 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.980
 would depend on all the subscribers of 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.090
 all of you and also of me that I 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.500
 like to upload what I do not like about 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.290
 upload it because I love to play 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.670
 call of duty not only ghosts that the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.070
 truth that lately I have enough 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.620
 hobby but white the two modern warfare 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.930
 3 whatever the other day when I went up the 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 video guys you want to see with the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.050
 series of new cop in the following 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.310
 episode says very warfare 3 work as its 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.850
 very good response to many comments 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.110
 and the majority won by whites 2 for 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.360
 that same thing and I'm uploading a video of 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.100
 modern warfare 3 so that everyone 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 be happy and surely the video 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.150
 Monday is in the black ops 2 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.590
 you will see what frank it is and I hope that 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.939
 be a good game because they will not be 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.250
 universes or it will not be a public and 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.260
 Decent and cool that I hope you like and 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.640
 why will you use francs on the white 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.930
 since that 's a bit harder than 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.560
 at the cost of thing and it seems pretty 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.200
 easier 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.520
 nothing, as I count, tell you about 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.290
 the series say that the subscribers 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.300
 they are deluxe that I am very happy that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.010
 I hope to change the fund soon 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.900
 youtube the background the banner as 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.989
 you want to call and the avatar to wash a 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:38.519
 little my image the image of the channel and give 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.290
 a new air aside from how not to separate 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.730
 for this image of twitter and those 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.470
 things that always come that always 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.209
 come change them 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.569
 that is let 's say somehow the 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.280
 count and that is what are the 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.830
 objectives so good the objectives are 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.390
 the quite ambitious goals the 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.569
 objectives are to reach 10,000 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.700
 subscribers before the month of August is 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.350
 say do a year and that on 1 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.380
 September have 10,000 subscribers is 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.349
 a very difficult goal I do not know but good 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 I believe that with a daily video almost 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.630
 daily video with your help like this 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.880
 support with likes with favorites 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.979
 to share with, that is, everything with the 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.739
 videos I think you can reach the 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.419
 objective and now that we can and do a 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.400
 channel in conditions little by little the thing 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.740
 is getting better and I said not a lot 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.580
 time when I uploaded a video the third 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.530
 fourth and I said 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.110
 little by little I'm seeing things is true 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.629
 little by little I'm doing to others I'm going 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.250
 pulling my two best I'm going trying 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:39.110
 make a new series I'm changing 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.520
 things well I'm doing I think that 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.349
 I hope I hope so and keep it up though 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.719
 Have the subscribers you have 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:47.250
 always and always I can answer 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:48.689
 All the comments can help you in 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.000
 everything you ask me I can do everything 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:52.560
 what I can so that to help us 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.750
 improve I think it's important that it's 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.879
 in what basically this channel is based 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.490
 apart from a little show say what 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:02.099
 that many will think that maybe the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:05.159
 special let's say so new year would have 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.330
 been a double that would not have been mode 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:07.889
 double what but I 'm telling you 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.330
 lately with the likes and quite 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.940
 pissed off I'm playing more the cope the 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.930
 two because I do not want to leave out 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.000
 whites all because it seems like a 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.490
 I will also obviously play more 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.680
 ghosts but I'll tell you that I have 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.409
 thought to go up nuclear with very good 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.509
 weapons with difficult weapons maybe not 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:27.719
 Nuclear a major streak with 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:30.330
 cans 45 I'll try to take nuclear 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:31.169
 with weapons I do not know different difficult 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.389
 to give 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.639
 more variety part of that double meat 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.669
 that nothing then apart from the other 10,000 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:40.370
 subscribers that I hope and want to get 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:42.240
 try things like for example 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.330
 triples than them before they will take out the 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.310
 game 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.259
 it is simply this saying the new 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.509
 purposes what I said guys I hope that 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.490
 you have entered well in the year and tomorrow 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.020
 we have a video of clan war like that 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.060
 Please forgive us, I hope that 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.620
 you liked the video guys and nothing that 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.979
 have a great time and this next 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.979
 video
