that like sweet spot for you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.030 
that like sweet spot for you
you're<00:01:39.450> gonna<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:39.869> pressure<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> stick

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you're gonna put pressure on the stick

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.820 
you're gonna put pressure on the stick
with<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.420> left<00:01:42.690> hand<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.200> you're<00:01:43.740> gonna

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
with your left hand and you're gonna

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.500 
with your left hand and you're gonna
basically<00:01:44.479> pop<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.490> puck<00:01:47.490> up<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> edge<00:01:48.030> which

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
basically pop the puck up on edge which

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.210 
basically pop the puck up on edge which
you're<00:01:48.690> gonna<00:01:48.810> see<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> video<00:01:49.500> that's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you're gonna see in the video that's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.060 
you're gonna see in the video that's
kind<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.729> basically<00:01:51.270> how<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:52.229> more<00:01:53.010> or

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
kind of basically how that's more or

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.800 
kind of basically how that's more or
less<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> trick<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.880> just<00:01:53.909> getting<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.570> edge

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
less the trick is just getting on edge

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.770 
less the trick is just getting on edge
and<00:01:55.080> then<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.950> next<00:01:56.100> step<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.299> basically

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
and then in the next step you basically

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.859 
and then in the next step you basically
just<00:01:58.110> kind<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> scoop<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.010> up<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.869> that's

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
just kind of scoop it up and that's

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.570 
just kind of scoop it up and that's
really<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:02.040> magic<00:02:02.270> of<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.570> Michigan<00:02:04.580> another

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
really the magic of the Michigan another

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.730 
really the magic of the Michigan another
point<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.000> step<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.409> really

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
point for step two is that you really

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.650 
point for step two is that you really
need<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> keep<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> pressure<00:02:08.760> down<00:02:09.269> with

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
need to keep that pressure down with

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.830 
need to keep that pressure down with
with<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.080> left<00:02:10.910> with<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.060> left<00:02:12.299> hand<00:02:12.600> you're

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
with your left with the left hand you're

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.370 
with your left with the left hand you're
basically<00:02:13.230> pushing<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:13.890> down<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
basically pushing it down and you

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.930 
basically pushing it down and you
definitely<00:02:16.769> want<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.100> some<00:02:17.160> flex<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
definitely want to have some flex on the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.490 
definitely want to have some flex on the
stick<00:02:18.209> because<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.600> really<00:02:19.140> want<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.380> come

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
stick because you really want to come

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.830 
stick because you really want to come
under<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.950> this<00:02:20.280> step<00:02:20.549> this<00:02:21.209> whole<00:02:21.420> move<00:02:21.690> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
under this this step this whole move is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.280 
under this this step this whole move is
really<00:02:22.140> about<00:02:22.290> control<00:02:22.830> and

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
really about control and

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.569 
really about control and
pushing<00:02:25.040> down<00:02:25.069> keeps<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:26.030> puck<00:02:26.299> in<00:02:27.129> the<00:02:28.129> angle

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
pushing down keeps the puck in the angle

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.729 
pushing down keeps the puck in the angle
where<00:02:28.909> it's<00:02:29.060> up<00:02:29.239> on<00:02:29.450> its<00:02:29.629> side<00:02:29.719> in<00:02:30.260> your<00:02:30.500> blade

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
where it's up on its side in your blade

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.750 
where it's up on its side in your blade
to<00:02:31.730> get<00:02:31.849> ready<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.390> scoop<00:02:32.659> motion<00:02:33.760> okay

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
to get ready for the scoop motion okay

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.309 
to get ready for the scoop motion okay
now<00:02:34.909> that<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.120> puck<00:02:35.390> isn't<00:02:35.719> that<00:02:35.810> sweet<00:02:36.049> spot

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
now that the puck isn't that sweet spot

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.319 
now that the puck isn't that sweet spot
for<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:36.890> got<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.159> on<00:02:37.250> edge<00:02:37.489> at<00:02:38.150> this

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
for you and you got it on edge at this

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.899 
for you and you got it on edge at this
point<00:02:38.980> keeping<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.099> pressure<00:02:40.430> down<00:02:40.700> with

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
point keeping the pressure down with

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:42.670 
point keeping the pressure down with
your<00:02:41.060> left<00:02:41.209> hand<00:02:41.420> we're<00:02:41.959> gonna<00:02:42.109> make<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> C

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
your left hand we're gonna make a C

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
your left hand we're gonna make a C
motion<00:02:43.159> really<00:02:43.430> quick<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.129> left<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.549> you

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
motion really quick to the left of you

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.949 
motion really quick to the left of you
and<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.530> do<00:02:48.739> that<00:02:49.299> you're<00:02:50.299> going<00:02:50.389> to<00:02:50.540> turn

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
and as you do that you're going to turn

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.289 
and as you do that you're going to turn
your<00:02:51.319> hands<00:02:51.889> you're<00:02:52.400> going<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.609> turn<00:02:52.790> up<00:02:53.030> and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
scoop the puck up and so your blade is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.420 
scoop the puck up and so your blade is
gonna<00:02:55.849> be<00:02:56.000> facing<00:02:56.389> up<00:02:56.689> so<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.319> was<00:02:57.439> down<00:02:57.680> now

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
gonna be facing up so it was down now

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.089 
gonna be facing up so it was down now
it's<00:02:58.579> going<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.849> facing<00:02:59.090> up<00:02:59.920> so<00:03:00.920> that

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:01.099 
it's going to be facing up so that

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.720 
it's going to be facing up so that
part's<00:03:01.430> kind<00:03:01.639> of<00:03:01.790> fast<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:04.099> get<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.400> to<00:03:04.489> come<00:03:04.669> on

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
part's kind of fast to get it to come on

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.420 
part's kind of fast to get it to come on
edge<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.359> then<00:03:05.989> once<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.709> do<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:06.980> scoop

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
edge and then once you do this scoop

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.789 
edge and then once you do this scoop
part<00:03:08.120> it's<00:03:08.389> a<00:03:08.510> little<00:03:08.959> bit<00:03:09.079> more<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.379> a<00:03:09.470> finesse

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
part it's a little bit more of a finesse

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.500
