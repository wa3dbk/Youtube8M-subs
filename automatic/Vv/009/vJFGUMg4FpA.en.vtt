00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
we can pre-order days right absolutely a

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.280 
we can pre-order days right absolutely a
low<00:03:25.880> price<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.260> we<00:03:27.260> don't<00:03:27.410> know<00:03:27.470> yet<00:03:27.650> exactly

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
low price of we don't know yet exactly

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.020 
low price of we don't know yet exactly
so<00:03:30.370> last<00:03:31.370> week<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:31.880> the<00:03:32.000> tech<00:03:32.269> source<00:03:32.660> a<00:03:33.200> rather

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
so last week on the tech source a rather

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.520 
so last week on the tech source a rather
important<00:03:35.030> card<00:03:35.329> was<00:03:35.510> released<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:36.049> nvidia

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
important card was released the nvidia

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.720 
important card was released the nvidia
geforce<00:03:37.040> gtx<00:03:37.519> 590<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.360> these<00:03:38.840> two<00:03:39.079> clowns

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
geforce gtx 590 and these two clowns

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.800 
geforce gtx 590 and these two clowns
reviewed<00:03:40.730> it<00:03:40.910> and<00:03:40.940> well<00:03:41.269> he<00:03:41.390> can't<00:03:41.600> see<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
reviewed it and well he can't see the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.420 
reviewed it and well he can't see the
other<00:03:41.840> clown<00:03:42.170> he's<00:03:42.350> behind<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.680> camera<00:03:43.010> yes

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
other clown he's behind the camera yes

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.720 
other clown he's behind the camera yes
well<00:03:43.760> no<00:03:44.329> he's<00:03:44.510> there<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:45.549> reviewed<00:03:46.549> it<00:03:46.700> and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
well no he's there that reviewed it and

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.789 
well no he's there that reviewed it and
didn't<00:03:47.360> do<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> best<00:03:47.690> job<00:03:47.810> of<00:03:48.110> introducing<00:03:48.290> it

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
didn't do the best job of introducing it

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:53.770 
didn't do the best job of introducing it
so<00:03:49.130> we<00:03:49.430> did<00:03:49.549> a<00:03:49.579> great<00:03:50.090> job<00:03:50.680> hey<00:03:51.680> boys<00:03:52.660> don't<00:03:53.660> red

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
so we did a great job hey boys don't red

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.229 
so we did a great job hey boys don't red

forward<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.480> this<00:04:08.630> card<00:04:08.989> guys<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.739> going<00:04:09.890> to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
forward to this card guys it's going to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.910 
forward to this card guys it's going to
be<00:04:10.040> great<00:04:10.780> but<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:12.380> has<00:04:13.209> 233<00:04:14.290> GPUs<00:04:15.290> on<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.739> and

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
be great but it has 233 GPUs on it and

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.140 
be great but it has 233 GPUs on it and
it's<00:04:16.820> not<00:04:17.000> faster<00:04:17.539> than<00:04:17.570> a<00:04:17.720> 590<00:04:18.880> it's<00:04:19.880> going<00:04:20.090> to

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
it's not faster than a 590 it's going to

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.710 
it's not faster than a 590 it's going to
be<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:20.450> fast<00:04:21.760> uses<00:04:22.760> so<00:04:22.970> much<00:04:23.030> power<00:04:25.510> nvidia<00:04:26.510> sli

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
be so fast uses so much power nvidia sli

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.830 
be so fast uses so much power nvidia sli

two three or even four of this world's
most<00:04:32.690> excellent<00:04:33.380> video<00:04:33.620> cards<00:04:34.039> too

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
most excellent video cards too

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.150 
most excellent video cards too
gather<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:35.300> process<00:04:36.290> any<00:04:37.070> more<00:04:37.670> awesomeness

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
gather to process any more awesomeness

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.490 
gather to process any more awesomeness
so<00:04:40.300> how<00:04:41.300> can<00:04:41.360> this<00:04:41.540> technology<00:04:42.050> get<00:04:42.170> even

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
so how can this technology get even

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.740 
so how can this technology get even
better<00:04:42.620> well<00:04:43.400> how<00:04:43.760> about<00:04:43.790> it<00:04:44.180> coming<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.660> the

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
better well how about it coming to the

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.980 
better well how about it coming to the
AMD<00:04:45.140> bulldozer<00:04:45.320> chipset<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:47.450> sounds<00:04:47.690> really

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
AMD bulldozer chipset that sounds really

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.600 
AMD bulldozer chipset that sounds really
interesting<00:04:48.170> because<00:04:48.800> well<00:04:49.190> we<00:04:49.310> haven't<00:04:49.430> had

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
interesting because well we haven't had

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.330 
interesting because well we haven't had
that's<00:04:50.480> a<00:04:50.570> lie<00:04:50.720> on<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.110> Andes<00:04:51.950> side<00:04:52.130> for<00:04:52.310> a

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
that's a lie on the Andes side for a

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.520 
that's a lie on the Andes side for a
while<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:52.760> since<00:04:53.510> we<00:04:53.660> have<00:04:53.750> had<00:04:53.870> crossbar<00:04:54.380> the

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
while but since we have had crossbar the

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.140 
while but since we have had crossbar the
entire<00:04:54.890> time<00:04:55.220> because<00:04:55.610> you<00:04:55.700> know<00:04:55.820> we<00:04:56.000> know

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
entire time because you know we know

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.820 
entire time because you know we know
it's<00:04:56.300> superior<00:04:56.600> and<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:56.990> scales<00:04:57.350> better<00:04:57.650> in

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
it's superior and it scales better in

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.370 
it's superior and it scales better in
the<00:04:57.920> new<00:04:58.040> 69<00:04:58.610> series<00:04:59.060> because<00:05:00.050> you<00:05:00.200> know<00:05:00.290> you

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
the new 69 series because you know you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.500 
the new 69 series because you know you
can<00:05:00.470> get<00:05:00.530> to<00:05:00.680> 69<00:05:01.100> 70<00:05:01.520> s<00:05:01.580> and<00:05:01.700> they<00:05:02.120> still<00:05:02.360> better

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
can get to 69 70 s and they still better

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.150 
can get to 69 70 s and they still better

really<00:05:29.720> interesting<00:05:29.750> maneuver<00:05:30.680> um<00:05:30.880> so<00:05:31.880> people

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
really interesting maneuver um so people

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.520 
really interesting maneuver um so people
looking<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.360> get<00:05:32.480> into<00:05:32.600> bulldozer<00:05:33.050> but<00:05:33.380> not

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
not really sure because they really are

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.120 
not really sure because they really are
