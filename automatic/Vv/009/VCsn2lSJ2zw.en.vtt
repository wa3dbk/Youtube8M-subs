some hover bowls on this thing so we can

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.470 
some hover bowls on this thing so we can
get<00:00:30.060> elevated<00:00:31.550> make<00:00:32.550> sure<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.850> remember<00:00:33.180> rise

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
get elevated make sure you remember rise

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.450 
get elevated make sure you remember rise
what<00:00:33.870> numbers<00:00:34.320> you<00:00:34.350> have<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.770> set<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.160> so<00:00:35.340> we

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
what numbers you have it set it so we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.610 
what numbers you have it set it so we
don't<00:00:35.670> have<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> keep<00:00:36.540> checking<00:00:36.899> back<00:00:37.140> later

four<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.800> each<00:00:40.950> side<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.309> usually<00:00:42.090> enough<00:00:42.739> make

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
four on each side is usually enough make

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:57.260 
four on each side is usually enough make
sure<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:44.399> stable<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.329> doesn't<00:00:45.780> fall<00:00:56.270> okay

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
sure it's stable it doesn't fall okay

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 
sure it's stable it doesn't fall okay
compare<00:00:58.199> those<00:00:58.440> on<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.859> test<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.430> we're

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
a bit to the side but I will deal with

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.030 
a bit to the side but I will deal with
it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
it

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.770

okay<00:02:04.040> now<00:02:04.280> we<00:02:04.340> need<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.610> worry<00:02:05.030> about<00:02:05.180> getting

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
okay now we need to worry about getting

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.050 
okay now we need to worry about getting
momentum<00:02:06.409> and<00:02:06.860> thrust<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.640> we're<00:02:07.850> going<00:02:07.940> to

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
momentum and thrust so we're going to

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.810 
momentum and thrust so we're going to
use<00:02:08.300> thrusters<00:02:08.780> once<00:02:09.530> again<00:02:09.679> memorized<00:02:10.429> look

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
use thrusters once again memorized look

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.410 
use thrusters once again memorized look
what<00:02:11.780> numbers<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.380> your<00:02:13.060> powers<00:02:14.060> edit

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420

what numbers you have your powers edit
mine<00:02:15.580> 74<00:02:16.580> forward<00:02:17.150> 64<00:02:17.870> backwards<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:19.400> toggle

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
mine 74 forward 64 backwards you toggle

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.230 
mine 74 forward 64 backwards you toggle
if<00:02:20.810> I<00:02:20.990> table<00:02:21.350> toggling<00:02:21.920> you<00:02:22.520> can<00:02:22.730> hit<00:02:22.970> the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
if I table toggling you can hit the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.790 
if I table toggling you can hit the
exact<00:02:23.660> same<00:02:23.870> thing<00:02:24.080> again<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:24.680> will

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
exact same thing again it it will

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.520 
exact same thing again it it will
activate<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.790> engines<00:02:26.209> and<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.930> let's<00:02:30.230> test

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
activate the engines and here let's test

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.059 
activate the engines and here let's test
this<00:02:30.770> out<00:02:30.950> real<00:02:31.190> quick

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069

I<00:02:39.239> Jessica<00:02:40.239> said<00:02:40.450> it<00:02:40.629> a<00:02:40.719> rather<00:02:40.989> slow<00:02:41.590> speed

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.249 
I Jessica said it a rather slow speed

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.690 
I Jessica said it a rather slow speed
for<00:02:42.819> right<00:02:42.999> now<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:44.200> now<00:02:44.950> let's<00:02:45.249> see<00:02:45.549> what

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
else we want to add how about weapons so

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.270 
else we want to add how about weapons so
we're<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:51.939> find<00:02:52.150> our<00:02:52.329> shirt<00:02:52.689> tool<00:02:53.280> we're

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
we're going to find our shirt tool we're

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.929 
we're going to find our shirt tool we're
going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.489> choose<00:02:54.790> what<00:02:54.969> kind<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.329> gun<00:02:55.540> we<00:02:55.689> want
