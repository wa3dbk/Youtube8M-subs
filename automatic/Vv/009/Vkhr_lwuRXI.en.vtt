00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.339
 good risotto with real and never pumpkin 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.230
 tried the pan-fried pumpkin with potatoes 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.750
 rosemary in true delight for not 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.910
 then talk about the baked pumpkin already in 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 the extraordinarily interesting dishes 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.310
 but not without problems as limit 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.619
 great cleaning of the pumpkin indeed 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 this vegetable has a shock 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.330
 very hard and massive so even a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.099
 difficult to remove 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 but don't worry because today 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.099
 I will show you how to clean properly 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.559
 never wound pumpkin proceeded then then 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.200
 three pumpkins are prepared these are 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.940
 pumpkin variety with helix that is only of the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 pumpkins very consumed in the peninsula 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.820
 very fleshy and very sweet 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.460
 tasty in the good pumpkin you recognize 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.200
 by weight it must be rather 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.050
 heavy 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.690
 and then the stock must be very two in 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 massive so our will be harder 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.600
 zest of the best pumpkin will be to 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.199
 flavors 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.059
 now let's get ready for Italy for 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.900
 first thing i am removing with a 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.939
 small knife all the bumps 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.000
 natural of our zucchetta so then 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.420
 it will be easier to cut them by removing the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.420
 peel 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.350
 and now we wash it properly in fresh water 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.409
 we have any traces of soil 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.409
 even with a toothbrush 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.210
 let's proceed now with the cut we take 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.259
 a long and thin blade knife 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.700
 this in my opinion is the most part 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.890
 difficult to cut the pumpkin in half 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.810
 I got a pumpkin here 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.280
 small but there are also pumpkins 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.770
 much larger 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.840
 clearly we try to engrave but so 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:58.429
 pointing the tip and then giving strength 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.020
 also with the other part a final part 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.830
 of the knife you see that I do a little 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.479
 fatigue 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:07.149
 so what do you recommend doing? 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:10.789
 remove tip knife ad 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:16.099
 carving the pumpkin in this way 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.569
 around like that with the whole knife of 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.569
 all the diameter of the pumpkin 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:31.370
 you see that it is easier to cut anna e 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.790
 the pumpkin is perfect 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.459
 this pumpkin will smell very much will be 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.800
 surely delicious now it must 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.570
 proceed to the removal of signs and gods 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.100
 internal filaments so you can 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:50.750
 equip you with a digger or even 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:57.590
 a steel spoon and do this 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:00.320
 operation dug simply and then 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.900
 we can finally sow the diploma of 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.330
 one below you see if you can't do it with the 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.260
 spoon you can use them very well 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:14.989
 also both in areas with a digger 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.459
 it is possible to remove better and with more 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.459
 ease and complaining internally 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.920
 this is our half-dug hole 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.800
 while here we owe the seeds again 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.990
 dirty then we say with filaments and 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.530
 here we find the seeds always the filaments 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.570
 because I did this the seeds 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.430
 do not throw them away because they are delicious from 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.800
 taste as an appetizer first though 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.480
 you will have to remove all the filaments in 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.140
 excess so wash well under 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.450
 the water 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.430
 also remove the filaments with your hands 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.850
 with a little patience then you will get 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.430
 this result then you can get to 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.460
 toast in the oven on a baking tray then 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:02.570
 on a sheet of baking paper and put 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.340
 in the oven at 200 degrees for about 20 25 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.890
 minutes or until in short the 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 surface will have become beautiful and golden 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.580
 crunchy then solves laughter with a little 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
 of salt you can also eat them in front 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.610
 On TV 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.820
 pumpkin seeds are rich in 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.950
 vitamin carotenoids and therefore powerful 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.049
 antioxidant and also have a function 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.780
 remineralizing because I bring it in good 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.330
 quantitative terms say iron 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.520
 manganese phosphorus zinc 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.140
 but that's not all because they are allies of the 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.690
 health due to the presence of fatty acids 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:35.840
 essential as well as her as acid 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.090
 good linoleic let's now proceed with the 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.780
 remission of the stock 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:45.080
 how do we turn the pumpkin then 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.730
 we lay the base on the cutting board of all time 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.070
 with the same long-bladed knife 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:51.070
 let's cut it in half 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.910
 we got two which every quarter a 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.910
 in turn it will have to be cut again 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:16.030
 the smaller the piece the easier 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:17.560
 the removal of the stock is done 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.260
 now remove the stock 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.020
 let's take a quarter then support it 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.180
 a base must be a flat square and must 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.520
 then lean on the chopping board at the base 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.610
 support with one hand with the left 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.070
 in this case we hold the apex of a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.100
 piece of pumpkin then with fingers well 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.260
 away from the knife blade with 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.470
 the other hand we take knife 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:46.090
 we engrave the rind and then with gods 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:50.410
 firm taps we follow hidden thing e 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.970
 we see it with a little patience you will see 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:58.060
 that if the stock is taken away 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:06:00.970
 perfectly and this is that thick of 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.950
 pumpkin without rind 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.350
 now I would like you to see a method that 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:07.780
 according to me it is not very suitable for the 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:09.490
 pumpkin cleaning because you can 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.980
 hurt 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.390
 taking the pumpkin so engraving 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:20.880
 the hostage between the pulp and the stock e 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:23.280
 directing the knife towards us though 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.860
 see that I call too close 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.640
 to the knife blade so I could 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:28.500
 hurt 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.380
 here is the bis advice for this 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.300
 method though maybe it could be 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.370
 immediate remove the stock in this 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:39.690
 so try what you suggested 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.640
 I will see the pumpkin is very ready for 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.060
 be cooked according to our tastes 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:47.610
 but I recommend paying attention to the fingers 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.500
 then if you want you can prepare the 

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:51.660
 Italian pumpkin pieces with pickaxes 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:54.030
 to prepare the sauce maybe for 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.070
 prepare pumpkin risotto as in 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.260
 this case if you wish 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.020
 prepare the baked pumpkin you can 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:09.630
 cut mirrors a little more 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:13.040
 large as I am doing goes towards a 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:17.540
 me the pumpkin also likes boiled or 

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.540
 crushed like a low wall
