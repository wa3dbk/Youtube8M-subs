00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.779
 compact MPV full of solutions 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.300
 innovative 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.099
 the opel meriva and spacious practice e 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.290
 therefore perfect for the family but also 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.360
 fanciful enough thanks to the look 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.850
 modern given by the doors 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.220
 rear with upwind opening 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.050
 today then with the opel home offers is 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 even a smart purchase 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 you have understood that she is the chosen one 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.240
 for our column of the proposal 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.240
 of the week 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.540
 opel deserves a practical minivan 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.790
 comfortable and decidedly economical 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.940
 especially in the bifuel version with 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.710
 fuel and LPG supply 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.470
 the second generation of meriva is 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.870
 grown to a size of 4.28 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.269
 meters long and can count on one 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.720
 load capacity ranging between 400 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.400
 and 1500 liters but one of the most important aspects 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.409
 exclusive and interesting 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.449
 German minivans are the five doors 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.339
 with the two rear ones opening 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.930
 upwind 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.450
 this solution allows easy 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.700
 accessibility on board and once seated 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.670
 you can benefit from plenty of space for 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.680
 the legs and a rear bench seat 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.200
 enough to accommodate three people 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.299
 as regards the opel engine range 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.610
 offers for the meriva three solutions a 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.310
 gasoline and four diesel with powers that 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.500
 they range from 75 to 130 horses 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.250
 among these the bifuel engine stands out 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.450
 petrol and LPG 1.4 liter unit with 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.119
 120 horses 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.490
 if on the one hand it receives LPG it can 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.030
 reach 188 kilometers per hour and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.009
 shoot from 0 to 100 in 11.5 seconds 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.189
 on the other hand it declares average consumption that 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:48.310
 vary between 13 and 24 km a liter a 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.409
 depending on use and feeding 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.719
 without forgetting the autonomy that with 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.960
 two gasoline and gas tanks can 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:58.179
 reach 1,300 kilometers from the point 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.549
 economically, let's not forget 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:03.189
 that the LPG besides being a fuel 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.659
 green and therefore tolerated even in areas a 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.899
 limited traffic 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.860
 costs the pump at about 0.85 euros per 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 liter 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.150
 in these weeks opel proposes 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.600
 a very tempting offer throughout 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.790
 the range 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.910
 but let's go into detail with an example 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.420
 the meriva 1400 turbo gpl tech in 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.569
 elective preparation and sold at 18,900 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.050
 euro instead of the 20,900 provided by 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.150
 list 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.330
 to this is added a proposal 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.170
 financial rate zero and tai 2.10 per 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.580
 cent so structured advance 5,250 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 euros and 35 monthly installments of 100 98.77 euros 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.240
 more final installment 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.240
 6,993 euros
