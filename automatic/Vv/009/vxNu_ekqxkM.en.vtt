hello<00:00:01.290> now<00:00:01.920> a<00:00:01.949> few<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.700> were<00:00:03.120> asking<00:00:03.389> for

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
hello now a few of you were asking for

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.249 
hello now a few of you were asking for
tutorials<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.680> this<00:00:05.390> here<00:00:06.390> automated<00:00:06.960> bridge

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
tutorials on this here automated bridge

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.350 
tutorials on this here automated bridge
and<00:00:07.710> so<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:09.150> will<00:00:09.750> give<00:00:09.990> you<00:00:10.139> one<00:00:10.910> now<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:11.940> tried

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
and so I will give you one now I tried

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.660 
and so I will give you one now I tried
building<00:00:12.780> another<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:13.170> earlier<00:00:13.679> but<00:00:14.009> for

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
building another one earlier but for

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.910 
building another one earlier but for
some<00:00:14.849> reason<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:16.080> delays<00:00:16.379> weren't<00:00:16.710> just

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
some reason the delays weren't just

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.890 
some reason the delays weren't just
working<00:00:17.100> out<00:00:17.430> so<00:00:17.699> I'll<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.150> use<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.869> I

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
working out so I'll just use the one I

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.599 
working out so I'll just use the one I
already<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.310> blueprint<00:00:22.130> up<00:00:23.130> here<00:00:23.400> we

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
already have as a blueprint up here we

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.779 
already have as a blueprint up here we
have<00:00:23.760> our<00:00:24.029> lava<00:00:24.210> which<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:24.930> controlled<00:00:25.380> by<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
have our lava which is controlled by a

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.689 
have our lava which is controlled by a
piston<00:00:27.349> it<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.500> be<00:00:28.590> used<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:29.039> sort<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.429> control

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
piston it can be used to sort of control

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
piston it can be used to sort of control
when<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> bridge<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.230> not

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
when the bridge is and it's not

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.840 
when the bridge is and it's not
repairing<00:00:31.920> itself<00:00:33.079> so<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.590> instance<00:00:34.920> blow<00:00:35.730> it

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
repairing itself so for instance blow it

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
repairing itself so for instance blow it
up<00:00:35.940> at<00:00:36.059> night<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.780> decided<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> repair<00:00:38.160> during

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
up at night and decided to repair during

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.260 
up at night and decided to repair during
the<00:00:38.520> day<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.280> our<00:00:41.399> repeater<00:00:41.760> circuits

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the day this is our repeater circuits

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.569 
the day this is our repeater circuits
activated<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> by<00:00:43.530> placing<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.160> quickly

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
activated it by placing and quickly

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.369 
activated it by placing and quickly
removing<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.030> torch<00:00:45.270> although<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
removing a torch although I think a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.650 
removing a torch although I think a
button<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.340> good<00:00:47.579> enough<00:00:47.820> anyway<00:00:50.660> the

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
button would be good enough anyway the

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
button would be good enough anyway the
first<00:00:51.930> thing<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> gets<00:00:52.410> activated<00:00:52.620> when<00:00:53.219> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
first thing that gets activated when the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.950 
first thing that gets activated when the
circuit<00:00:53.850> goes<00:00:54.000> around<00:00:56.059> is<00:00:57.059> these<00:00:57.629> four

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
circuit goes around is these four

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.689 
circuit goes around is these four
Pistons<00:00:59.960> they<00:01:00.960> push<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.500> entire<00:01:02.399> line

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
Pistons they push the entire line

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.740 
Pistons they push the entire line
forward<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.890> then<00:01:04.970> the<00:01:05.970> second<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.510> as

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
forward and then the second one as

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.359 
forward and then the second one as
activated<00:01:07.290> as<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.530> one<00:01:08.960> it<00:01:09.960> isn't<00:01:10.369> pushing

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
activated as this one it isn't pushing

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.710 
activated as this one it isn't pushing
forward<00:01:11.760> until<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.210> one's<00:01:12.390> all<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> way

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
forward until this one's all the way

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320 
forward until this one's all the way
back<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.530> doesn't<00:01:13.799> break<00:01:14.210> you<00:01:15.210> have

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
back so that it doesn't break you have

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.670 
back so that it doesn't break you have
to<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.600> sure<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.020> timing<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
to make sure that the timing on this is

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.149 
to make sure that the timing on this is
good<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.939> else<00:01:18.320> your<00:01:19.320> Pistons<00:01:19.680> will<00:01:19.799> break<00:01:19.950> and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
good or else your Pistons will break and

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.380 
good or else your Pistons will break and
you'll<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> go<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.880> replace<00:01:21.090> them

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you'll have to go in and replace them

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.530 
you'll have to go in and replace them
which<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> huge<00:01:22.380> ordeal

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.440 

this<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.590> sort<00:01:32.190> of<00:01:32.280> activated<00:01:35.450> right

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
this one is sort of activated right

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.680 
this one is sort of activated right
after<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:38.120> right<00:01:39.120> after<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
after this one is right after this is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.480 
after this one is right after this is
pulled<00:01:39.900> back<00:01:40.050> this<00:01:40.530> pushes<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> new<00:01:41.280> one

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
pulled back this pushes a new one

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.620 
pulled back this pushes a new one
forward<00:01:41.940> and<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.600> did<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.900> lot<00:01:44.630> whatever

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
forward and we did this lot whatever

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.550 
forward and we did this lot whatever
that<00:01:45.870> means

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.080 

now<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.800> isn't<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> most<00:01:50.430> efficient<00:01:50.910> layout

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
now this isn't the most efficient layout

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 
now this isn't the most efficient layout
you<00:01:51.840> could<00:01:52.020> have<00:01:52.260> this<00:01:52.620> feeding<00:01:53.250> directly

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
you could have this feeding directly

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.780 
you could have this feeding directly
into<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.120> line<00:01:54.710> but<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.580> how<00:01:56.760> I

into the line but this is just how I

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.850 
into the line but this is just how I
started<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.480> I<00:01:57.810> encourage<00:01:58.560> you<00:01:58.650> to<00:01:58.710> come

started it out I encourage you to come

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.930 
started it out I encourage you to come
up<00:01:58.920> with<00:01:59.010> your<00:01:59.160> own<00:01:59.280> creative<00:01:59.490> designs<00:02:01.940> again

up with your own creative designs again

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.969 
up with your own creative designs again
I<00:02:03.300> must<00:02:03.900> stress<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> importance<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.830> making

there<00:02:37.489> remember<00:02:38.489> that<00:02:38.550> this<00:02:38.910> loop<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.510> not

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
there remember that this loop is not

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.280 
there remember that this loop is not
stable<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:40.410> won't<00:02:41.340> keep<00:02:42.269> going<00:02:42.720> after<00:02:43.110> you've

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
stable and won't keep going after you've

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.650 
stable and won't keep going after you've
logged<00:02:43.620> out<00:02:43.890> I'll<00:02:44.550> have<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.820> restart<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.360> by

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
logged out I'll have to restart it by

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.220 
logged out I'll have to restart it by
placing<00:02:46.230> another<00:02:46.560> torch

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.400 

like<00:02:51.220> so

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.020 

also<00:02:57.410> remember<00:02:57.800> that<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.130> structure<00:02:58.790> is

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
also remember that this structure is

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
also remember that this structure is
made<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.480> glass<00:02:59.780> for<00:03:00.050> demonstration<00:03:00.620> purposes

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
made of glass for demonstration purposes

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.500 
made of glass for demonstration purposes
and<00:03:01.340> should<00:03:01.580> probably<00:03:01.730> be<00:03:01.910> made<00:03:02.090> of<00:03:02.270> obsidian

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
and should probably be made of obsidian

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.200 
and should probably be made of obsidian
if<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.800> don't<00:03:04.160> want<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.550> be<00:03:04.640> blown<00:03:04.880> up<00:03:04.910> by

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
if you don't want it to be blown up by

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.900 
if you don't want it to be blown up by
creepers<00:03:05.740> it<00:03:06.740> is<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.190> key<00:03:07.370> to<00:03:07.550> making<00:03:07.730> this

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
creepers it is the key to making this

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.900 
creepers it is the key to making this
entire<00:03:08.840> mechanism<00:03:09.110> work<00:03:09.620> and<00:03:09.920> if<00:03:10.520> it's<00:03:10.670> blown

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
entire mechanism work and if it's blown

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.290 
entire mechanism work and if it's blown
up

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
up

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.470 
up
well<00:03:12.400> cobblestone<00:03:13.400> is<00:03:13.670> probably<00:03:14.210> going<00:03:14.420> to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
well cobblestone is probably going to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.360 
well cobblestone is probably going to
get<00:03:14.600> everywhere<00:03:14.990> if<00:03:15.290> you<00:03:15.410> let<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:15.770> lava<00:03:15.980> and

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
get everywhere if you let the lava and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.120 
get everywhere if you let the lava and
the<00:03:16.580> water<00:03:16.790> meet<00:03:17.530> I've<00:03:18.530> seen<00:03:18.770> it<00:03:18.860> before<00:03:18.950> and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
the water meet I've seen it before and

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.300 
the water meet I've seen it before and
it's<00:03:19.340> not<00:03:19.520> pretty

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
it's not pretty

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.550 
it's not pretty
well<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.490> think<00:03:22.760> that's<00:03:22.910> all<00:03:23.060> for<00:03:23.090> now<00:03:23.440> if<00:03:24.440> you

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
well I think that's all for now if you

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.440 
well I think that's all for now if you
have<00:03:24.650> any<00:03:24.800> other<00:03:25.010> questions<00:03:25.490> I'll<00:03:25.820> do<00:03:26.120> my<00:03:26.270> best

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
have any other questions I'll do my best

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.080 
have any other questions I'll do my best
to<00:03:26.600> answer<00:03:26.750> them<00:03:27.760> otherwise<00:03:28.900> happy<00:03:29.900> crafting
