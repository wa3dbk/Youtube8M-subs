00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
hi there this is Michael and we're going

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.289 
hi there this is Michael and we're going
to<00:00:03.210> draw<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> 3d<00:00:04.020> cross<00:00:04.759> to<00:00:05.759> start<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.120> I'm

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
to draw a 3d cross to start with I'm

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.220 
to draw a 3d cross to start with I'm
going<00:00:06.480> to<00:00:06.600> use<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:07.519> tool<00:00:08.519> either<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.570> ruler<00:00:09.990> or

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
going to use a tool either a ruler or

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.620 
going to use a tool either a ruler or
something<00:00:10.320> like<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> paint<00:00:11.580> stick<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> piece

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
something like a paint stick or a piece

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.890 
something like a paint stick or a piece
of<00:00:12.660> wood<00:00:12.840> or<00:00:13.320> folded<00:00:14.190> piece<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> paper<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.780> help

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
of wood or folded piece of paper to help

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.590 
of wood or folded piece of paper to help
me<00:00:16.109> get<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.980> shape<00:00:17.310> for<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> cross<00:00:17.960> so<00:00:20.600> let's

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
me get the shape for the cross so let's

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.179 
me get the shape for the cross so let's
go<00:00:21.750> ahead<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.260> piece<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.590> paper<00:00:22.800> here

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
go ahead and use the piece of paper here

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.650 
go ahead and use the piece of paper here
and<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.820> taking<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.090> regular<00:00:24.210> sheet<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
and I'm just taking a regular sheet of

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.330 
and I'm just taking a regular sheet of
paper<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.109> folded<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.680> over<00:00:25.920> several<00:00:26.189> times

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
paper and folded it over several times

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.500 
paper and folded it over several times
and<00:00:27.080> we<00:00:28.080> use<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:29.179> as<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> guide<00:00:32.149> to<00:00:33.149> get<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
and we use that as a guide to get the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.700 
and we use that as a guide to get the
shape<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:34.020> our<00:00:34.079> cross<00:00:36.290> I'll<00:00:37.290> go<00:00:37.410> ahead<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
shape for our cross I'll go ahead and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.139 
shape for our cross I'll go ahead and
finish<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.160> off<00:00:38.219> at<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.579> bottom<00:00:38.850> there<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
finish that off at the bottom there and

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
finish that off at the bottom there and
then<00:00:42.149> we'll<00:00:42.719> lay<00:00:42.870> that<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.110> across<00:00:43.530> here

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
then we'll lay that right across here

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
then we'll lay that right across here
and<00:00:44.629> figure<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.660> how<00:00:45.960> far<00:00:46.430> we<00:00:47.430> want<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.879> to

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
and figure out how far we want that to

00:00:48.090 --> 00:01:00.520 
and figure out how far we want that to
extend

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.430 

something<00:01:01.250> like<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.670> we<00:01:02.660> can<00:01:02.810> use<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.170> as<00:01:03.410> a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
something like that we can use this as a

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.540 
something like that we can use this as a
ruler<00:01:06.280> so<00:01:07.280> even<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:07.610> you<00:01:07.700> don't<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.120> ruler

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
ruler so even if you don't have a ruler

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.940 
ruler so even if you don't have a ruler
you<00:01:10.550> can<00:01:10.700> either<00:01:10.850> fold<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.210> piece<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.540> paper

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
you can either fold the piece of paper

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.250 
you can either fold the piece of paper
and<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.970> will<00:01:14.090> work<00:01:14.210> just<00:01:14.270> fine<00:01:14.660> for<00:01:14.960> drawing

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
and that will work just fine for drawing

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.460 
and that will work just fine for drawing
straight<00:01:15.530> lines<00:01:16.900> there's<00:01:17.900> something<00:01:18.170> roughly

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
straight lines there's something roughly

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.190 
straight lines there's something roughly
like<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.890> not<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.370> perfect<00:01:19.880> cross<00:01:20.060> but<00:01:20.600> gives

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
like that not a perfect cross but gives

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.000 
like that not a perfect cross but gives
us<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.620> idea<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:23.260> now<00:01:24.260> what<00:01:24.560> do<00:01:24.650> we<00:01:24.710> do<00:01:24.860> to<00:01:24.980> make

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 
us the idea so now what do we do to make

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.360 
us the idea so now what do we do to make
this<00:01:25.340> 3d<00:01:25.820> well<00:01:26.330> first<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.930> have<00:01:27.080> to<00:01:27.110> decide<00:01:27.530> how

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
this 3d well first we have to decide how

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.550 
this 3d well first we have to decide how
we're<00:01:28.430> looking<00:01:28.940> at<00:01:29.060> that<00:01:29.210> are<00:01:29.420> we<00:01:29.600> down<00:01:29.810> low<00:01:30.500> to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
we're looking at that are we down low to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.070 
we're looking at that are we down low to
the<00:01:30.740> ground<00:01:30.800> here<00:01:31.520> or<00:01:31.850> are<00:01:31.970> we<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.540> looking

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
the ground here or are we up looking

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.980 
the ground here or are we up looking
down<00:01:33.290> at<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.590> I'm<00:01:34.580> going<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.970> presume<00:01:35.150> that<00:01:35.690> we

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
down at it I'm going to presume that we

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.990 
down at it I'm going to presume that we
are<00:01:36.140> down<00:01:36.380> low<00:01:36.740> to<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:37.010> ground<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.640> our<00:01:37.729> point

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
are down low to the ground and our point

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.600 
are down low to the ground and our point
of<00:01:38.180> view<00:01:38.290> is<00:01:39.290> going<00:01:39.650> to<00:01:39.770> establish<00:01:40.070> what<00:01:40.580> we

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
of view is going to establish what we

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.580 
of view is going to establish what we
call<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> horizon<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:45.050> horizon<00:01:45.170> is

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
call the horizon and the horizon is

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.780 
call the horizon and the horizon is
different<00:01:45.950> for<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.250> if<00:01:46.369> you're<00:01:46.490> laying<00:01:46.670> down

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
different for you if you're laying down

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.300 
different for you if you're laying down
on<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.119> ground<00:01:47.740> so<00:01:48.740> it's<00:01:48.860> not<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.160> actual

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
on the ground so it's not the actual

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.640 
on the ground so it's not the actual
horizon<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.090> earth<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:50.720> it<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.990> it's<00:01:51.290> the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
horizon the earth what it is it's the

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.999 
horizon the earth what it is it's the
it's<00:01:52.009> the<00:01:52.130> horizon<00:01:53.090> from<00:01:53.450> your<00:01:53.840> point<00:01:54.200> of<00:01:54.350> view

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.310 

so<00:02:01.009> let's<00:02:01.040> make<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.600> horizon<00:02:02.869> line

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
so let's make that the horizon line

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.999 
so let's make that the horizon line
right<00:02:03.590> there

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
right there

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.340 
right there
and<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:04.790> we<00:02:04.850> have<00:02:05.150> to<00:02:05.270> decide<00:02:05.600> how<00:02:06.290> we're

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
and now we have to decide how we're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.320 
and now we have to decide how we're
looking<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.340> are<00:02:07.670> we<00:02:07.790> looking<00:02:08.090> at<00:02:08.149> it

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
looking at this are we looking at it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.710 
looking at this are we looking at it
from<00:02:08.600> this<00:02:08.899> direction<00:02:10.120> are<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.239> looking<00:02:11.510> at<00:02:11.570> it

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
from this direction are we looking at it

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.170 
from this direction are we looking at it
from<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.080> direction<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.769> is<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.160> turned<00:02:13.820> or

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
from this direction and is it turned or

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.610 
from this direction and is it turned or
is<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.390> flat<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.630> us<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.290> I'm<00:02:15.380> going<00:02:15.560> to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
is it flat to us and I'm going to

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.640 
is it flat to us and I'm going to
presume<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.010> this<00:02:16.310> is<00:02:16.489> flat<00:02:16.790> to<00:02:16.820> us<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:17.650> that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
presume that this is flat to us and that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.540 
presume that this is flat to us and that
we<00:02:18.920> are<00:02:19.160> looking<00:02:19.480> from<00:02:20.480> over<00:02:20.750> here<00:02:21.550> towards

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
we are looking from over here towards

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.290 
we are looking from over here towards
this<00:02:23.239> place<00:02:23.540> right<00:02:24.080> there

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
this place right there

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.509 
this place right there
so<00:02:26.300> that's<00:02:26.480> where<00:02:26.720> our<00:02:26.750> eye<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.380> gazed<00:02:28.130> and

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
so that's where our eye is gazed and

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.660 
so that's where our eye is gazed and
this<00:02:29.150> surface<00:02:29.600> right<00:02:29.750> here<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:31.190> pretty<00:02:31.549> much

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
this surface right here is pretty much

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.410 
this surface right here is pretty much
flat<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.299> us<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:33.380> with<00:02:33.709> that<00:02:33.860> being<00:02:34.190> the<00:02:34.880> point

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
flat to us so with that being the point

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
flat to us so with that being the point
that<00:02:35.570> we're<00:02:35.720> looking<00:02:35.810> we're<00:02:36.110> gonna<00:02:36.200> call<00:02:36.410> that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
that we're looking we're gonna call that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.910 
that we're looking we're gonna call that
the<00:02:36.769> vanishing<00:02:37.430> point<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.500> we're<00:02:39.500> going<00:02:39.530> to

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
the vanishing point and we're going to

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.140 
the vanishing point and we're going to
draw<00:02:40.160> lines<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:41.420> go<00:02:41.600> from<00:02:41.840> our<00:02:42.080> cross<00:02:42.350> to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
draw lines that go from our cross to

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:51.400 
draw lines that go from our cross to
that<00:02:44.150> point<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.660> we'll<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:50.900> pick<00:02:51.049> up<00:02:51.200> off

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
that point and we'll just pick up off

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.380 
that point and we'll just pick up off
the<00:02:51.620> corners<00:02:52.040> there<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:52.730> we've<00:02:52.850> got<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> corner

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
the corners there and we've got a corner

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.449 
the corners there and we've got a corner
here<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.690> pick<00:02:53.959> up<00:02:54.110> off<00:02:54.350> of<00:02:56.470> right<00:02:57.470> there<00:02:57.739> so

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
here to pick up off of right there so

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.810 
here to pick up off of right there so
now<00:02:59.080> we<00:03:00.080> can<00:03:00.230> come<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.709> using<00:03:01.700> our

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
now we can come in using our

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.240 
now we can come in using our
straightedge<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:04.480> we<00:03:05.480> can<00:03:05.950> let<00:03:06.950> me<00:03:07.010> go<00:03:07.130> ahead

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
straightedge and we can let me go ahead

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.440 
straightedge and we can let me go ahead
and<00:03:07.459> come<00:03:07.580> off<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.850> that<00:03:07.970> corner<00:03:08.299> right<00:03:08.330> there

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
and come off of that corner right there

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.680 
and come off of that corner right there
too<00:03:09.580> don't<00:03:10.580> want<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.819> miss<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:10.970> corner

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
too don't want to miss a corner

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.800 
too don't want to miss a corner
when<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.380> come<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.770> and<00:03:13.010> now<00:03:13.160> fill<00:03:13.490> in<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
when you come in and now fill in the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.640 
when you come in and now fill in the
parts<00:03:15.170> of<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:16.220> cross<00:03:16.460> that<00:03:16.760> we<00:03:16.910> will<00:03:17.150> see<00:03:17.650> from

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
parts of the cross that we will see from

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.220 
parts of the cross that we will see from
that<00:03:18.830> point<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.250> view<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.840> it's<00:03:20.840> always<00:03:20.990> going

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
that point of view and it's always going

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.510 
that point of view and it's always going
to<00:03:21.290> be<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.410> little<00:03:21.590> different<00:03:21.770> say<00:03:22.250> for

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
to be a little different say for

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.940 
to be a little different say for
instance<00:03:22.640> we<00:03:22.940> were<00:03:23.620> looking<00:03:24.620> from<00:03:24.770> above

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
instance we were looking from above

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.250 
instance we were looking from above
we'll<00:03:25.520> do<00:03:25.700> some<00:03:25.970> things<00:03:26.510> like<00:03:26.690> that<00:03:26.930> on

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
we'll do some things like that on

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.030 
we'll do some things like that on
another<00:03:27.470> lesson<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:30.680> there<00:03:30.950> we<00:03:31.130> go

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
another lesson so there we go

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:39.010 
another lesson so there we go
that<00:03:34.040> right<00:03:34.370> there<00:03:34.700> creates<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:38.570> 3d

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
that right there creates the 3d

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.490 
that right there creates the 3d
perspective<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.510> cross<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.200> I'm<00:03:42.290> just

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
perspective for a cross and I'm just

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.830 
perspective for a cross and I'm just
cleaning<00:03:42.710> up<00:03:42.890> the<00:03:42.950> corners<00:03:43.460> here<00:03:46.630> all<00:03:47.630> right

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
cleaning up the corners here all right

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.760 
cleaning up the corners here all right
now<00:03:48.320> let's<00:03:49.280> talk<00:03:49.430> about<00:03:49.490> light<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.350> we<00:03:51.620> have<00:03:51.740> a

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
now let's talk about light so we have a

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.020 
now let's talk about light so we have a
light<00:03:52.010> coming<00:03:52.400> in<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:53.540> way<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:55.250> then<00:03:55.790> this

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
light coming in this way and then this

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.910 
light coming in this way and then this
side<00:03:56.240> over<00:03:56.450> here<00:03:56.570> is<00:03:56.900> going<00:03:57.110> to<00:03:57.290> be<00:03:57.500> in<00:03:57.680> some

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
side over here is going to be in some

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.970 
side over here is going to be in some
shadow<00:03:58.570> but<00:03:59.570> these<00:04:00.260> surfaces<00:04:00.680> are<00:04:00.770> going<00:04:00.920> to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
shadow but these surfaces are going to

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.650 
shadow but these surfaces are going to
pick<00:04:01.190> up<00:04:01.310> some<00:04:01.490> light<00:04:01.670> bouncing<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.360> them

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
pick up some light bouncing on them

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.020 
pick up some light bouncing on them
whereas<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.680> ones<00:04:03.890> underneath<00:04:04.460> this

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
whereas the ones underneath this

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.210 
whereas the ones underneath this
crossbar<00:04:05.660> normally<00:04:06.530> if<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.710> sun's<00:04:07.010> coming

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
crossbar normally if the sun's coming

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.160 
crossbar normally if the sun's coming
down<00:04:07.460> won't<00:04:07.670> catch<00:04:07.970> as<00:04:08.150> much<00:04:08.390> light<00:04:08.630> bouncing

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
down won't catch as much light bouncing

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.170 
down won't catch as much light bouncing
up<00:04:09.350> so<00:04:10.010> these<00:04:10.130> are<00:04:10.280> going<00:04:10.370> to<00:04:10.430> be<00:04:10.580> your<00:04:10.700> darkest

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
up so these are going to be your darkest

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.060 
up so these are going to be your darkest
areas<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:11.900> these<00:04:12.020> will<00:04:12.260> be<00:04:12.290> a<00:04:12.410> medium<00:04:12.920> and

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
areas and these will be a medium and

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.200 
areas and these will be a medium and
we're<00:04:13.190> just<00:04:13.310> going<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.490> leave<00:04:13.610> this<00:04:13.790> surface

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.210 
we're just going to leave this surface

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:16.660 
we're just going to leave this surface
white<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.470> let's<00:04:15.740> come<00:04:15.920> in<00:04:16.100> and<00:04:16.340> just<00:04:16.459> do<00:04:16.640> a

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
white so let's come in and just do a

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:28.790 
white so let's come in and just do a
little<00:04:16.700> shading<00:04:17.120> under<00:04:17.510> here

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.550 

like<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:30.070> will<00:04:30.400> shade<00:04:30.670> this<00:04:31.000> surface<00:04:32.820> and

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
like that will shade this surface and

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.110 
like that will shade this surface and
now<00:04:35.560> will<00:04:35.770> shade<00:04:36.010> the<00:04:36.190> sides<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:36.850> we're<00:04:37.030> not

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
now will shade the sides but we're not

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:49.980 
now will shade the sides but we're not
going<00:04:37.270> to<00:04:37.330> shade<00:04:37.480> them<00:04:37.690> as<00:04:37.810> dark

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.600 

all<00:04:50.990> right<00:04:51.229> something<00:04:51.470> like<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.919> now<00:04:52.460> let<00:04:52.550> me

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
all right something like that now let me

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.730 
all right something like that now let me
do<00:04:52.729> a<00:04:52.759> little<00:04:52.940> cleanup<00:04:53.210> here<00:04:53.660> with<00:04:53.870> my<00:04:54.319> kneaded

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
do a little cleanup here with my kneaded

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.710 
do a little cleanup here with my kneaded
eraser<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.729> one's<00:04:55.970> getting<00:04:56.060> kind<00:04:56.389> of<00:04:56.449> dry

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
eraser this one's getting kind of dry

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.430 
eraser this one's getting kind of dry
and<00:04:56.990> old
