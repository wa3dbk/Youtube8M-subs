00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.389
 and now another show of dreams and marinating with our report this 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.389
 happens 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.400
 is increasingly common 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.460
 the hiring of architects and carpentry professionals to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.740
 design small spaces as is the case of this apartment of 50 meters 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.810
 by the architect regina of the year 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.869
 regina 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.620
 What is the solution that you gave to this tito? 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 good droughts and challenge that is the farmer 150 square meters 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.000
 a space had a comfortable time to watch television 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.710
 a good room 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.450
 In the beginning the internal part was well and more is the possibility to receive the 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.450
 children of seven members weekend 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.920
 this whole room made up of spain of wood ltda cpc uncomfortable that I 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.520
 I'm weak kept spending at the weekend 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.619
 the architects a dangerous selection 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.170
 we worked with a walnut blade a pre-composed blade of 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.209
 mdf walnut mdp maria rita the progress is bené during the day has the 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.990
 living room 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.950
 he certainly has a built-in camera 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 that clothing also the intention was discreet is strange that no one 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.270
 imagine that you enter the room step in the mineirão where he was jean ended up 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.300
 example what kind of hardware do you check 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.550
 we need a spring that is imported and working together with 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.450
 question 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.000
 and this is the question that makes the bed could bash and rise a certain 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.660
 break your spine 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.220
 but wasted the election 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.500
 it is very important that the professional you want to be updated with the 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.880
 available on the market 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.880
 innovation can be a great differential of your work 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.240
 enjoy the constant development of new finishing characters 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.799
 in this position he divided the kitchen iee the room mérida this separation 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.200
 foregoing 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.399
 and at the same time 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.489
 when he was on the couch and it seems to me more people understand that he turn to dust 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.040
 and they have the possibility to watch the TV with whatever it is and how it is 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.540
 that you have managed to create is that it is the heavy panel 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.489
 but despite the fall of a pine tree 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.550
 he is totally free from the pici of the most interesting technique because the 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.560
 people work with a piece of sieve embedded in the floor and ceiling and the system 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.329
 that allows this mobility without you making any effort as well. 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.449
 That's where we get it. Everybody says that action gets embedded in a 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.829
 column that you have access through a door and is in the part of 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.879
 behind the table what happened said that it is an open project but it stays 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.110
 totally isolated from the living room by his father 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.710
 that has even name né already thinks about going medicament tailor and in the motors 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.519
 to calculate the footprint exactly here we have already worked with 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:58.860
 bpn laminate 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.230
 he again as good as the age group a crossing I think 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.649
 he has a sl 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:10.689
 for the project to go according to what is requested, it is very important that 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.519
 professional carpentry 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.109
 participate actively in all the details of the work 

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.870
 in fact we should do a job 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.060
 also in partnership with 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.099
 is to make the drawings did not give him none of the suggestions sent back 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.729
 at the time of the network exchange information on hardware to research on itself 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:34.809
 own equipment that we use your gift in everything everything was calculated 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.689
 in every mayor joão pata in the project phase 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.549
 at the time he met the teacher 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:43.790
 We learned what he wanted and we did not either. 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.409
 continuation 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.939
 this was furious because we can every key they face in this round that 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:50.279
 the square is ours
