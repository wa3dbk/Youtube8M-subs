00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.330 
over 30 times and I still not received
amount<00:00:33.440> all<00:00:34.440> right<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.829> when<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> get<00:00:35.160> in

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
amount all right so when you get in

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.380 
amount all right so when you get in
you're<00:00:35.489> gonna<00:00:35.579> want<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.000> around<00:00:36.120> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
you're gonna want to go around this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.810 
you're gonna want to go around this
thing<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.290> kill<00:00:37.980> these<00:00:38.219> ads<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.670> these

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
thing and then kill these ads and these

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.979 
thing and then kill these ads and these
ads<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:40.340> skippable<00:00:41.600> avoidable<00:00:42.600> if

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
ads are actually skippable avoidable if

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.720 
ads are actually skippable avoidable if
you<00:00:43.469> go<00:00:43.680> directly<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.340> middle<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.640> them

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
you go directly in the middle of them

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.090 
you go directly in the middle of them
but<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.239> usually<00:00:45.480> hard<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.260> once

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
but it's usually hard to do that once

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.380 
but it's usually hard to do that once
you<00:00:47.190> kill<00:00:47.340> them<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> should<00:00:47.879> get<00:00:48.030> this<00:00:48.180> pack

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
you kill them you should get this pack

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.850 
you kill them you should get this pack
because<00:00:48.570> they<00:00:48.809> may<00:00:48.930> cause<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.260> grief<00:00:49.440> later

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
because they may cause you grief later

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
because they may cause you grief later
on<00:00:50.070> once<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.820> get<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> other<00:00:51.149> side<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
on once you get to the other side and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.049 
on once you get to the other side and
they're<00:00:52.559> not<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> hard<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.789> know<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they're not that hard so you know it's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.810 
they're not that hard so you know it's
also<00:00:54.210> extra<00:00:54.629> loot<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> whatnot<00:00:55.699> once<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
also extra loot and whatnot once you

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.970 
also extra loot and whatnot once you
kill<00:00:57.000> them<00:00:57.180> you're<00:00:58.050> gonna<00:00:58.170> walk<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.530> this

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
kill them you're gonna walk around this

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.549 
kill them you're gonna walk around this
tree<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> do<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.899> skip<00:01:01.170> these<00:01:01.350> guys

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.950 
and you want to make this as fast as

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 
down for too long

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.220 
down for too long
fighting<00:07:33.840> him<00:07:33.990> and<00:07:35.450> once<00:07:36.450> he's<00:07:36.600> finished<00:07:36.930> the

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.230 
fighting him and once he's finished the

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.530 
fighting him and once he's finished the
space<00:07:37.530> he<00:07:37.830> like<00:07:37.980> sits<00:07:38.700> there<00:07:38.940> as<00:07:39.060> you<00:07:39.150> see<00:07:39.330> here

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:39.540 
space he like sits there as you see here

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:40.280 
space he like sits there as you see here
he<00:07:39.630> just<00:07:39.810> sits<00:07:40.020> there

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:40.290 
he just sits there

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.620 
he just sits there
so<00:07:40.950> he's<00:07:41.190> easily<00:07:41.310> killable<00:07:41.880> by<00:07:42.150> this<00:07:42.210> by<00:07:42.570> the

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.630 
so he's easily killable by this by the

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:46.340 
so he's easily killable by this by the
end<00:07:42.720> of<00:07:42.870> the<00:07:42.990> phase<00:07:43.350> -<00:07:43.590> and<00:07:44.090> once<00:07:45.090> you've<00:07:45.350> got

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:46.350 
end of the phase - and once you've got

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.200 
end of the phase - and once you've got
onto<00:07:46.470> one<00:07:46.710> person<00:07:46.950> one<00:07:47.190> health<00:07:47.400> then<00:07:47.880> he<00:07:48.060> will

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:48.210 
onto one person one health then he will

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:52.100 
onto one person one health then he will
die<00:07:48.390> will<00:07:49.050> not<00:07:49.080> die<00:07:49.440> but<00:07:49.710> be<00:07:50.310> defeated

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.110 
die will not die but be defeated

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.950 
die will not die but be defeated
and<00:07:52.639> then<00:07:53.639> you<00:07:53.759> can<00:07:53.909> loot<00:07:54.120> and<00:07:54.300> this<00:07:54.539> guy<00:07:54.689> drops

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 
and then you can loot and this guy drops

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.779 
and then you can loot and this guy drops
a<00:07:55.110> pet<00:07:55.319> as<00:07:55.530> you<00:07:55.740> see<00:07:55.889> here<00:07:56.159> there's<00:07:56.310> the<00:07:56.460> pets<00:07:56.639> a

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:56.789 
a pet as you see here there's the pets a

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:59.300 
a pet as you see here there's the pets a
second<00:07:57.120> from<00:07:57.270> the<00:07:57.300> top<00:07:57.800> he<00:07:58.800> also<00:07:58.949> has<00:07:59.159> the

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.310 
second from the top he also has the

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.570 
second from the top he also has the
chance<00:07:59.520> to<00:07:59.639> drop<00:07:59.789> the<00:08:00.090> mount<00:08:00.900> and<00:08:01.139> I<00:08:02.039> think

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:02.580 
chance to drop the mount and I think

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.029 
chance to drop the mount and I think
that's<00:08:02.849> a<00:08:03.090> disguise<00:08:03.689> for<00:08:03.900> a<00:08:03.990> blood<00:08:04.259> elf<00:08:04.439> so

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 
that's a disguise for a blood elf so

00:08:05.039 --> 00:08:06.529 
that's a disguise for a blood elf so
thanks<00:08:05.580> guys<00:08:05.669> for<00:08:05.939> watching<00:08:06.000> and<00:08:06.360> see<00:08:06.479> you
