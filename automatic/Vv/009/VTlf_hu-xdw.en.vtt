warfare<00:04:34.969> is<00:04:35.120> now<00:04:35.300> built<00:04:35.629> around<00:04:35.930> these<00:04:36.139> EXO

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
warfare is now built around these EXO

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.830 
warfare is now built around these EXO
suits<00:04:37.039> the<00:04:37.879> maps<00:04:38.150> are<00:04:38.330> built<00:04:38.509> around<00:04:38.629> the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
suits the maps are built around the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.230 
suits the maps are built around the
exosuits<00:04:39.370> so<00:04:40.370> when<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.610> when<00:04:40.819> I<00:04:40.849> think<00:04:41.150> to

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.230 
play the exosuit playlist at least at
first<00:04:47.780> because<00:04:48.680> that's<00:04:49.099> what<00:04:49.669> this<00:04:49.819> game<00:04:50.030> was

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
stuff and I'm gonna try and play it the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.779 
stuff and I'm gonna try and play it the
way<00:04:59.210> that<00:04:59.360> they<00:04:59.979> intended<00:05:00.979> this<00:05:01.129> game<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.639> be

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
way that they intended this game to be

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:04.990 
way that they intended this game to be
played<00:05:01.819> and<00:05:02.419> that<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:03.620> think<00:05:04.580> it's<00:05:04.699> going<00:05:04.819> to<00:05:04.879> be

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
played and that I think it's going to be

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.670 
played and that I think it's going to be
fun<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.210> mean<00:05:05.389> like<00:05:05.509> I<00:05:05.659> said<00:05:05.689> I<00:05:06.080> didn't<00:05:06.560> enjoy

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
fun I mean like I said I didn't enjoy

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.080 
fun I mean like I said I didn't enjoy
titanfall<00:05:07.189> when<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.490> played<00:05:07.669> it<00:05:07.759> like<00:05:07.849> call<00:05:08.060> of

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
titanfall when I played it like call of

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.939 
titanfall when I played it like call of
duty<00:05:08.419> and<00:05:08.599> so<00:05:09.319> I<00:05:09.349> started<00:05:09.439> playing<00:05:09.830> like

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
duty and so I started playing like

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.230 
duty and so I started playing like
titanfall<00:05:10.310> so<00:05:10.610> I'm<00:05:10.699> gonna<00:05:10.789> play<00:05:10.969> advanced

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
titanfall so I'm gonna play advanced

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.600 
titanfall so I'm gonna play advanced
warfare<00:05:11.719> like<00:05:12.289> advanced<00:05:12.620> warfare<00:05:13.129> and<00:05:13.310> not

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
warfare like advanced warfare and not

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.540 
warfare like advanced warfare and not
like<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:14.240> older<00:05:14.539> Cod's<00:05:14.810> and<00:05:15.129> I'm<00:05:16.129> hoping<00:05:16.490> that

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
like the older Cod's and I'm hoping that

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.209 
like the older Cod's and I'm hoping that
I'll<00:05:16.759> have<00:05:16.909> a<00:05:16.939> good<00:05:17.599> time<00:05:17.810> with<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.080> you<00:05:18.919> know<00:05:19.009> I

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:19.219 
I'll have a good time with it you know I

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:20.830 
I'll have a good time with it you know I
really<00:05:19.699> think<00:05:19.819> advanced<00:05:20.210> warfare<00:05:20.599> is<00:05:20.719> going

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
really think advanced warfare is going

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.080 
really think advanced warfare is going
to<00:05:20.900> be<00:05:20.960> like<00:05:21.080> any<00:05:21.259> other<00:05:21.349> FPS<00:05:21.620> shooter<00:05:22.189> it'll

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
to be like any other FPS shooter it'll

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.760 
to be like any other FPS shooter it'll
be<00:05:23.210> fun<00:05:23.449> if<00:05:23.659> people<00:05:23.960> play<00:05:24.199> it<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.500> way<00:05:24.529> that

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
be fun if people play it the way that

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.519 
be fun if people play it the way that

other stuff like you could run on walls

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.629 
other stuff like you could run on walls
but<00:05:32.960> if<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.440> just<00:05:33.710> play<00:05:33.949> the<00:05:34.159> game<00:05:34.190> the<00:05:34.610> way

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 
but if you just play the game the way

the developers intended the game to be
played<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:37.310> think<00:05:37.849> advanced<00:05:38.150> warfare<00:05:38.569> will<00:05:38.810> be

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960
