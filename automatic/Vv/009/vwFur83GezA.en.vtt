00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
so I like that one if you look at a

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.289 
so I like that one if you look at a
vacuum<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.769> there's<00:03:23.099> also<00:03:23.340> that's<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.180> nice

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
vacuum on there's also that's a nice

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.860 
vacuum on there's also that's a nice
example<00:03:24.480> it's<00:03:24.870> also<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.139> shonen<00:03:26.099> jump<00:03:26.870> title

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
example it's also a shonen jump title

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.069 
example it's also a shonen jump title
and<00:03:28.199> that's<00:03:28.739> where<00:03:29.430> we're<00:03:29.639> mashiro<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.480> uzuki

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
and that's where we're mashiro and uzuki

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.339 
and that's where we're mashiro and uzuki
are<00:03:31.319> well<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.549> almost<00:03:33.060> based<00:03:33.540> on<00:03:33.840> that

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
are well it's almost based on that

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.869 
are well it's almost based on that
connection<00:03:35.419> so<00:03:36.419> i<00:03:36.780> think<00:03:37.409> it's<00:03:37.799> it's<00:03:38.069> it's<00:03:38.310> if

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
connection so i think it's it's it's if

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.270 
connection so i think it's it's it's if
you<00:03:39.030> keep<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.299> good<00:03:39.419> balance<00:03:39.829> and<00:03:40.829> if<00:03:41.010> you're

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
you keep a good balance and if you're

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.159 
you keep a good balance and if you're
writing<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.000> showing<00:03:43.519> keep<00:03:44.519> showing<00:03:45.169> primary

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
writing a showing keep showing primary

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.039 
writing a showing keep showing primary
that's<00:03:46.949> that's<00:03:47.340> that's<00:03:47.849> what<00:03:48.120> you're<00:03:48.329> heading

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
that's that's that's what you're heading

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.680 
that's that's that's what you're heading
for<00:03:49.079> because<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:50.069> you<00:03:50.190> put<00:03:50.220> too<00:03:50.519> much<00:03:50.909> shoujo

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
important to find a balance but I also

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.730
