00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.619 
bring it up some people like to do
wherever<00:02:06.990> right<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.119> continue

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
wherever right and just can continue

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.059 
wherever right and just can continue
that<00:02:09.810> pattern<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.379> right<00:02:10.530> over<00:02:10.560> left<00:02:10.860> and

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that pattern or right over left and

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.740 
that pattern or right over left and
continue<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> pattern<00:02:11.730> all<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:11.879> way<00:02:11.970> up<00:02:12.239> but

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
continue the pattern all the way up but

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.530 
continue the pattern all the way up but
I<00:02:13.080> don't

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
I don't

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.880 
I don't
don't<00:02:13.840> matter<00:02:13.959> because<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.290> nobody's

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
don't matter because that nobody's

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.890 
don't matter because that nobody's
really<00:02:15.040> going<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> see<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:16.299> so<00:02:16.689> then

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
really going to see it like that so then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.000 
really going to see it like that so then
you<00:02:17.140> cross<00:02:17.379> them<00:02:17.530> again<00:02:17.879> and<00:02:19.739> it's<00:02:20.739> really<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
you cross them again and it's really a

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.949 
you cross them again and it's really a
fast<00:02:21.280> process<00:02:21.790> once<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.299> used<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:24.959> or

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
fast process once you get used to it or

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.720 
fast process once you get used to it or
once<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.319> know<00:02:26.470> how<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:26.950> then<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.459> cross

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
once you know how and then you cross

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.559 
once you know how and then you cross
them<00:02:27.849> again

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.899 

you<00:02:31.569> cross<00:02:31.810> them<00:02:31.900> again<00:02:32.200> you<00:02:35.430> put<00:02:36.430> this<00:02:36.610> one<00:02:36.790> in

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
you cross them again you put this one in

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.930 
you cross them again you put this one in
right<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.599> and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.890> I<00:02:39.159> don't<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.609> don't<00:02:39.670> like

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
on all the other holes so that leaves

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.430 
on all the other holes so that leaves
this<00:02:59.319> one<00:02:59.500> outside<00:03:00.540> sticking<00:03:01.540> lines<00:03:01.720> out<00:03:01.989> that

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
this one outside sticking lines out that

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.530 
this one outside sticking lines out that
way<00:03:02.620> but<00:03:03.430> if<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.819> if<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.120> were<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.239> put<00:03:04.420> them

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
way but if you if you were to put them

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.509 
way but if you if you were to put them
in<00:03:04.659> this<00:03:04.810> way<00:03:05.079> like<00:03:05.799> you<00:03:05.980> have<00:03:06.129> been<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.400> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
in this way like you have been all the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.580 
in this way like you have been all the
other<00:03:06.639> holes<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.269> it<00:03:07.780> comes<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.139> sides<00:03:08.379> and

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
other holes and it comes in sides and

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.259 
other holes and it comes in sides and
you<00:03:08.650> can't<00:03:08.859> really<00:03:09.010> tie<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.400> knot<00:03:09.909> on<00:03:10.150> the

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
you can't really tie the knot on the

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.839 
you can't really tie the knot on the
outside<00:03:10.690> so<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.349> got<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.980> put<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.400> on<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.609> arm

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
outside so you got to put it on the arm

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.910 
outside so you got to put it on the arm
through<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.780> inside<00:03:14.139> to<00:03:14.409> the<00:03:14.440> outside

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
through the inside to the outside

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.789 
through the inside to the outside
so<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> knot<00:03:15.970> basically<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.690> it<00:03:16.870> is<00:03:16.930> it's<00:03:17.650> a

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
so the knot basically all it is it's a

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.460 
so the knot basically all it is it's a
lot<00:03:17.980> of<00:03:18.010> trial<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.699> error<00:03:18.940> for<00:03:19.269> your<00:03:19.599> foot<00:03:19.900> or

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
lot of trial and error for your foot or

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.319 
lot of trial and error for your foot or
whatever<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:21.010> comfortable<00:03:21.280> to<00:03:21.639> you<00:03:21.819> but<00:03:22.239> all

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
whatever is comfortable to you but all

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.349 
whatever is comfortable to you but all
you<00:03:22.389> do<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.720> take<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.109> take<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.560> end<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:25.030> fold

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
you do is take the take the end you fold

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.909 
you do is take the take the end you fold
it<00:03:25.480> like<00:03:25.720> that<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.639> then<00:03:27.639> you<00:03:27.790> go<00:03:28.000> around<00:03:28.919> so

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:29.919 
it like that and then you go around so

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.809 
it like that and then you go around so
you<00:03:29.980> go<00:03:30.160> AB<00:03:30.340> under<00:03:30.669> and<00:03:30.879> then<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:33.579> keep

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819 
you go AB under and then you you keep

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.050 
you go AB under and then you you keep
you<00:03:34.120> keep<00:03:34.329> folding<00:03:34.629> until<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.669> all<00:03:37.000> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
you keep folding until you get all the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.119 
you keep folding until you get all the
way<00:03:37.389> to<00:03:37.419> the<00:03:37.660> end<00:03:37.840> or<00:03:38.079> you<00:03:38.109> run<00:03:38.410> out<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.919> then

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
way to the end or you run out and then

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.610 
way to the end or you run out and then
you<00:03:39.340> get<00:03:39.489> to<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.730> end<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.660> stick<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.169> into<00:03:41.349> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
you get to the end you stick it into the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.659 
you get to the end you stick it into the
end<00:03:41.799> hole<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.780> looks<00:03:44.079> like<00:03:44.199> that<00:03:44.470> and<00:03:45.430> then

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:45.669 
end hole so looks like that and then

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.059 
end hole so looks like that and then
you're<00:03:45.790> supposed<00:03:45.879> to<00:03:46.120> be<00:03:46.269> able<00:03:46.419> to<00:03:46.810> pull<00:03:47.440> and

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
you're supposed to be able to pull and

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:55.949 
you're supposed to be able to pull and
get<00:03:48.310> this<00:03:48.730> sort<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.180> thing<00:03:49.810> right<00:03:50.079> there<00:03:54.959> so

the top

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.860 
the top
like<00:04:27.800> this<00:04:28.040> and<00:04:29.000> he<00:04:29.090> sticks<00:04:29.300> it<00:04:29.390> the<00:04:29.480> whole<00:04:29.630> top

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
like this and he sticks it the whole top

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.110 
like this and he sticks it the whole top
it<00:04:30.050> gives<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.350> like<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.670> then<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.940> just

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
it gives it like that and then you just

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.030 
it gives it like that and then you just
take<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.480> pull<00:04:32.660> it<00:04:32.690> and<00:04:33.020> it<00:04:33.710> makes<00:04:33.860> it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
take it and pull it and it makes it

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.110 
take it and pull it and it makes it
tight<00:04:34.250> and<00:04:34.820> then<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:36.200> can<00:04:36.790> stretch<00:04:37.790> them<00:04:38.060> out

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
tight and then you can stretch them out

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.870 
tight and then you can stretch them out
at<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.390> top<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.110> do<00:04:39.920> whatever<00:04:40.130> slide<00:04:40.610> them<00:04:40.790> on

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880

a<00:04:48.110> lot<00:04:48.350> of<00:04:48.500> trial<00:04:48.770> and<00:04:48.950> error<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:50.360> get<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:50.930> knot

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
a lot of trial and error to get the knot

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.640 
a lot of trial and error to get the knot
right<00:04:51.410> because<00:04:51.830> on<00:04:52.730> these<00:04:53.240> on<00:04:53.930> these<00:04:54.290> six
