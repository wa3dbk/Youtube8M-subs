00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
because it's opening up as a app it has

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.770 
because it's opening up as a app it has
all<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.909> its<00:01:36.000> defaults<00:01:36.810> that's<00:01:37.320> why<00:01:37.650> because

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
all of its defaults that's why because

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.359 
all of its defaults that's why because
it<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.960> automatically<00:01:40.439> did<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.950> for<00:01:41.220> me

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it just automatically did that for me

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
it just automatically did that for me
before<00:01:41.840> when<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.110> started<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.680> don't

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
before when I just started this I don't

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.560 
before when I just started this I don't
know<00:01:43.920> why<00:01:44.149> probably<00:01:45.149> because<00:01:45.360> i<00:01:45.390> use<00:01:45.540> google

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
know why probably because i use google

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.370 
know why probably because i use google
chrome<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> lot<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:46.950> than<00:01:47.159> internet<00:01:47.520> explorer

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380
