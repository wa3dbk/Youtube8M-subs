and a real additional key characteristic
and<00:01:57.950> difference<00:01:58.310> in<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:58.909> that<00:01:59.719> the<00:01:59.899> smell

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and difference in this is that the smell

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.340 
and difference in this is that the smell
of<00:02:00.640> Hill<00:02:01.640> mustard<00:02:02.060> leaves<00:02:02.329> has<00:02:02.689> a<00:02:02.719> distinct

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
of Hill mustard leaves has a distinct

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.429 
of Hill mustard leaves has a distinct
cabbage<00:02:03.950> odor<00:02:04.159> where<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.850> does<00:02:05.149> not<00:02:05.390> in<00:02:06.229> many

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
cabbage odor where this does not in many

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.200 
cabbage odor where this does not in many
cases<00:02:06.860> they<00:02:07.009> can<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.250> found<00:02:07.430> flowering<00:02:08.000> at<00:02:08.119> the

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
cases they can be found flowering at the

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.389 
cases they can be found flowering at the
same<00:02:08.420> time<00:02:08.720> although<00:02:09.140> typically<00:02:10.130> yellow

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
same time although typically yellow

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.730 
same time although typically yellow
rocket<00:02:10.910> flowers<00:02:11.330> several<00:02:11.840> weeks<00:02:12.050> in<00:02:12.260> advance

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
rocket flowers several weeks in advance

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.250 
rocket flowers several weeks in advance
so<00:02:13.730> those<00:02:13.910> are<00:02:14.060> some<00:02:14.180> key<00:02:14.510> characteristics

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
so those are some key characteristics

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.080 
so those are some key characteristics
