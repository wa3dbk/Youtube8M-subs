00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
going on so yeah I wanna start over

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.230 
going on so yeah I wanna start over
looks<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:22.710> straight<00:00:23.010> away

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
looks as you can see straight away

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.759 
looks as you can see straight away
obviously<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> actual<00:00:24.930> district<00:00:25.289> 9<00:00:25.500> where

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
obviously in the actual district 9 where

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
looking at the background you've also

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.700 
looking at the background you've also
got<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> big<00:00:50.129> shift<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.460> background<00:00:50.879> as<00:00:51.000> well

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
got a big shift in background as well

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.260 
got a big shift in background as well
which<00:00:52.039> is<00:00:52.190> awesome<00:00:52.579> he's<00:00:52.699> made<00:00:52.850> look<00:00:53.030> really

yeah it's awesome so overlooks 105 the

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.490 
yeah it's awesome so overlooks 105 the
physics<00:00:58.550> as<00:00:59.269> you'll<00:00:59.480> see<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.690> bit<00:00:59.989> later<00:01:00.019> on

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
physics as you'll see a bit later on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.889 
physics as you'll see a bit later on
everything<00:01:01.309> will<00:01:01.430> start<00:01:01.670> going<00:01:01.850> off<00:01:02.090> as<00:01:02.600> it

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
everything will start going off as it

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.520 
everything will start going off as it
doesn't<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.589> film<00:01:03.860> all<00:01:04.460> the<00:01:04.640> shooting<00:01:05.059> and

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
doesn't in the film all the shooting and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.260 
doesn't in the film all the shooting and
I'll<00:01:06.530> let<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:06.920> watch<00:01:07.130> rally<00:01:07.400> and<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.180> I'm

I'll let you watch rally and so I'm
going<00:01:08.390> to<00:01:08.450> write<00:01:08.630> physics<00:01:09.080> a<00:01:09.259> mile<00:01:09.619> off<00:01:09.799> far<00:01:09.979> as

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
going to write physics a mile off far as

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.190 
going to write physics a mile off far as
long<00:01:10.310> as<00:01:10.520> he's<00:01:10.729> made<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.030> really<00:01:11.210> nice<00:01:11.420> but<00:01:12.170> I

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.590 
well and the spaceship there which they
take<00:01:39.130> off<00:01:39.370> and<00:01:39.640> you'll<00:01:39.760> see<00:01:39.940> you<00:01:40.000> later<00:01:40.420> on

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
even go down in a second right there so

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.080 
even go down in a second right there so
yeah<00:01:44.800> obviously<00:01:44.950> corresponding<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:46.000> the

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
yeah obviously corresponding to the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.510 
yeah obviously corresponding to the
permit

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
permit

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.310 
permit
awesome<00:01:46.820> say<00:01:47.000> idea<00:01:47.329> another<00:01:47.659> five<00:01:47.899> are<00:01:48.109> fine

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
awesome say idea another five are fine

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.499 
awesome say idea another five are fine
complexity<00:01:49.159> you've<00:01:49.700> made<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.000> awesome

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
complexity you've made it awesome

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.469 
complexity you've made it awesome
the<00:01:50.840> actual<00:01:51.560> whole<00:01:51.770> idea<00:01:52.070> behind<00:01:52.250> it<00:01:52.640> how<00:01:53.329> is

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
the actual whole idea behind it how is

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.300 
the actual whole idea behind it how is
actually<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.990> made<00:01:54.200> it<00:01:54.380> actually<00:01:54.860> coming

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
actually it made it actually coming

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.660 
actually it made it actually coming
faster<00:01:55.759> film<00:01:55.969> and<00:01:57.159> it's<00:01:58.159> awesome<00:01:59.049> so<00:02:00.049> yeah<00:02:00.380> so

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
faster film and it's awesome so yeah so

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.590 
faster film and it's awesome so yeah so
complexity<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.880> how<00:02:02.179> much<00:02:02.329> background

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
complexity and how much background

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.510 
complexity and how much background
details<00:02:03.259> Ben<00:02:03.469> is<00:02:03.649> all<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.979> buildings<00:02:04.399> in<00:02:04.429> the

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
details Ben is all the buildings in the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.320 
details Ben is all the buildings in the
background

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.620 

yeah<00:02:08.230> complex<00:02:08.680> the<00:02:08.860> five

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
yeah complex the five

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.840 
yeah complex the five
say<00:02:09.900> from<00:02:10.050> Susan<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.860> there's<00:02:11.490> a<00:02:11.550> really<00:02:11.700> high

say from Susan so there's a really high

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.820 
say from Susan so there's a really high
close<00:02:12.210> to<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.540> lot<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.080> parts<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.500> get<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.680> ring

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
close to a lot of parts you get a ring

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.130 
close to a lot of parts you get a ring
that's<00:02:13.950> QuickTime<00:02:14.510> as<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.690> can<00:02:15.840> see<00:02:15.960> now

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
that's QuickTime as you can see now

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's QuickTime as you can see now
sorry<00:02:16.440> I'll<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.400> very<00:02:17.670> end<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.090> film

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and the actual ship moves destroys all

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.480 
and the actual ship moves destroys all
the<00:02:20.820> windows<00:02:21.330> everywhere<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.860> he<00:02:23.040> picks<00:02:23.310> up

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
the windows everywhere and he picks up
