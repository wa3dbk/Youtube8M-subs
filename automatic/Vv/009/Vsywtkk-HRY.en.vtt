00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
very very strong side that i was lucky

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:17.110 
very very strong side that i was lucky
enough<00:03:57.130> to<00:03:57.370> play

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.590 

as<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.540> finished<00:04:19.109> round<00:04:19.650> started<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:20.480> he<00:04:21.480> was

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
as I I finished round started and he was

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.030 
as I I finished round started and he was
obviously<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.049> young<00:04:22.440> guy<00:04:22.590> with<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.800> lot<00:04:23.010> of

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
obviously a young guy with a lot of

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.379 
obviously a young guy with a lot of
potential<00:04:23.780> I<00:04:24.780> think<00:04:25.320> Ron<00:04:25.590> just<00:04:26.040> epitomizes

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:26.389 
potential I think Ron just epitomizes

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.980 
potential I think Ron just epitomizes

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.110 
are 69 teams playing in hong kong now so
many<00:04:37.800> more<00:04:38.010> teams<00:04:38.280> than<00:04:38.460> when<00:04:38.610> i<00:04:38.639> was<00:04:38.880> playing

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
many more teams than when i was playing

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.960 
many more teams than when i was playing
and<00:04:39.510> just<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.310> probably<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.340> number<00:04:41.790> of

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
and just the probably the number of

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.200 
and just the probably the number of
players<00:04:42.630> playing<00:04:43.080> must<00:04:43.590> make<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.669> quality<00:04:45.180> of

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
players playing must make the quality of

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.659 
players playing must make the quality of
the<00:04:45.360> quality<00:04:46.139> of<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.320> opposition<00:04:46.800> so<00:04:46.979> much<00:04:47.130> so

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
the quality of the opposition so much so

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.060 
the quality of the opposition so much so
much<00:04:47.700> higher<00:04:48.030> so<00:04:48.389> I<00:04:48.660> think<00:04:49.380> it's<00:04:49.620> come<00:04:49.800> quite<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
much higher so I think it's come quite a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.860 
much higher so I think it's come quite a
long<00:04:50.130> way<00:04:50.310> since<00:04:50.760> the<00:04:50.940> time<00:04:51.479> when<00:04:51.630> I<00:04:51.720> was

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
long way since the time when I was
