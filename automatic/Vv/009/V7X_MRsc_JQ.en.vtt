the speed booster for Nichkhun after

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.700 
the speed booster for Nichkhun after
micro<00:00:15.059> four-thirds<00:00:15.630> gives<00:00:15.990> you<00:00:16.080> extra<00:00:16.529> light

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
micro four-thirds gives you extra light

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.040 
micro four-thirds gives you extra light
and<00:00:17.010> extra<00:00:17.609> width<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> shot

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

switching<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> meta<00:00:22.500> bones<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.980> can<00:00:23.130> see

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
switching to the meta bones you can see

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.060 
switching to the meta bones you can see
it<00:00:23.400> got<00:00:23.580> wider<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.359> brighter<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.740> if<00:00:25.920> we

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
it got wider and brighter and if we

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
it got wider and brighter and if we
correct<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.609> frame<00:00:26.880> by<00:00:27.060> moving<00:00:27.330> closer<00:00:27.779> he's

the final shot with the meta bones lets
you<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.380> shallower<00:00:31.800> depth<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> field<00:00:32.520> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you get the shallower depth of field and
