00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.199
 or not 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.860
 and good guys nowadays you have to have 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.380
 Be careful what you want every time 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.020
 We ask and demand more graphic quality 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.000
 the games that are coming and of course that 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.429
 assumes some hardware requirements 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.289
 older than in many cases are almost 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.269
 impossible to pay for many of 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.009
 we 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.860
 battlefield 4 is perhaps one of the 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.960
 better in this aspect in fact many 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.120
 they feared they would not be able to 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.970
 the pc version for not coming up with the 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 required profile well there are two 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.890
 news the first we already know the 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.710
 minimum requirements of battlefield 4 for 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 pc and the second one you will not need a 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.460
 nasa computer to play it 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.220
 at the system level, windows will suffice 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.560
 view sp2 have ahead as for the 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:03.490
 processor we will need an amd chip 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.460
 athlon x2 of 28 gigahertz or intel 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.920
 core2 duo at 2.4 gigahertz 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.020
 to this we must add a minimum of 4 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.150
 gigas of ram memory 30 gigas of space 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.900
 free on the hard drive and a graphic 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:22.210
 radio an h of 3,870 or its similar 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.130
 nvidia 1 887 of 512 megabytes of memory 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.380
 course if we talk about requirements 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.990
 minimum we talk about the basics to be able 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.880
 run the game if what we want is 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.790
 fully enjoy graphics and effects 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 of physics in marte fill 4 our pc 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.930
 should run windows 8 64 bits 8 gigas 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.710
 of ram a cpu discordia md or intel quad 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.850
 core and graphics as the radeon hd 7 thousand 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:53.040
 870 ml or the nvidia gtx 660 that you think 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 a lot of demand for a battle film
