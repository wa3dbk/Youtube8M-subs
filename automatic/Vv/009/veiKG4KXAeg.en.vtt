00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.530 
that's a pretty good premise but this
for<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.290> really<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.090> lackluster<00:01:48.090> trailer

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
for me was really a lackluster trailer

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.069 
for me was really a lackluster trailer
to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.409> honest<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:49.950> only<00:01:50.310> laughed<00:01:50.880> once<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.930> this

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to be honest I only laughed once in this

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
to be honest I only laughed once in this
trailer<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.100> was<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.520> hand<00:01:54.030> under

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
trailer and that was at the hand under

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.780 
trailer and that was at the hand under
the<00:01:54.540> table<00:01:54.750> gag<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.380> even<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.549> wasn't

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the table gag and even then that wasn't

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940 
the table gag and even then that wasn't
really<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.450> funny<00:01:57.869> just<00:01:58.560> some<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.860> the

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
really that funny just some of the

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.709 
really that funny just some of the
decisions<00:01:59.549> that<00:01:59.670> seemed<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.360> gone<00:02:00.540> into

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
decisions that seemed to have gone into

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.330 
decisions that seemed to have gone into
the<00:02:01.110> plot<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:01.829> movie

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the plot of this movie

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
the plot of this movie
judging<00:02:02.820> from<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.030> trailer<00:02:03.479> just<00:02:04.020> don't<00:02:04.259> seem

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
judging from the trailer just don't seem

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.340 
judging from the trailer just don't seem
very<00:02:04.560> appealing<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.729> example<00:02:06.240> giving<00:02:06.659> brick

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
very appealing for example giving brick

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.070 
very appealing for example giving brick
I<00:02:07.619> think<00:02:08.129> maybe<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> love<00:02:08.729> interest<00:02:08.910> who<00:02:09.899> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
I think maybe a love interest who is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.460 
I think maybe a love interest who is
exactly<00:02:10.890> like<00:02:11.250> him<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.660> doesn't<00:02:13.260> sound

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
exactly like him it just doesn't sound

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.820 
exactly like him it just doesn't sound
like

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.000 
like
very<00:02:14.160> good<00:02:14.580> idea<00:02:14.990> even<00:02:15.990> the<00:02:16.380> way<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.710> trailer

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
very good idea even the way the trailer

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.700 
very good idea even the way the trailer
is<00:02:17.310> constructed<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.390> makes<00:02:18.630> me<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:18.960> what

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
is constructed just makes me think what

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.310 
is constructed just makes me think what
on<00:02:19.920> earth<00:02:20.100> were<00:02:20.340> Paramount<00:02:20.910> Pictures

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
on earth were Paramount Pictures

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.960 
on earth were Paramount Pictures

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.240 
priorities in this trailer for example
there's<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.240> shot<00:02:24.480> about<00:02:25.140> five<00:02:25.440> seconds<00:02:26.040> where

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
there's a shot about five seconds where

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.160 
there's a shot about five seconds where
two<00:02:26.580> dolphins<00:02:27.120> come<00:02:27.330> out<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.630> water<00:02:27.870> and

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
two dolphins come out of the water and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.590 
two dolphins come out of the water and
flip<00:02:28.530> over<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:29.580> there's<00:02:29.820> Ron<00:02:30.060> Burgundy

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
flip over and then there's Ron Burgundy

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.380

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and it doesn't inspire much confidence

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.910 
and it doesn't inspire much confidence
when<00:03:20.820> at<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.030> end<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.660> trailer<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.350> tells

how this movie got greenlit so something

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.690 
how this movie got greenlit so something
tells<00:04:04.230> me<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.500> DreamWorks<00:04:05.190> don't<00:04:05.459> really

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
tells me that DreamWorks don't really

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.100 
tells me that DreamWorks don't really
know<00:04:05.880> what<00:04:06.030> they've<00:04:06.209> got<00:04:06.420> on<00:04:06.450> their<00:04:06.750> hands

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
know what they've got on their hands

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.560 
know what they've got on their hands
they<00:04:07.230> don't<00:04:07.440> really<00:04:07.590> know<00:04:07.800> the<00:04:07.980> appeal<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
they don't really know the appeal of the

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.570 
they don't really know the appeal of the
first<00:04:09.840> movie<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:10.890> don't<00:04:11.130> really<00:04:11.400> know

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
first movie so they don't really know

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.090 
first movie so they don't really know
how<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.940> market<00:04:12.480> it<00:04:12.660> or<00:04:12.840> who<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.260> market<00:04:13.650> it<00:04:13.830> to

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
how to market it or who to market it to

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.430 
how to market it or who to market it to
and<00:04:14.340> that's<00:04:15.060> how<00:04:15.360> this<00:04:15.570> trailers<00:04:15.989> worked<00:04:16.200> out

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
and that's how this trailers worked out

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.289 
and that's how this trailers worked out
because<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:17.130> same<00:04:17.370> creative<00:04:17.850> team<00:04:18.060> as<00:04:18.180> the

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
because the same creative team as the

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.659 
because the same creative team as the
first<00:04:18.510> movie<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.989> think<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.739> movie<00:04:20.070> will<00:04:20.310> still

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
first movie I think the movie will still

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.810 
first movie I think the movie will still
be<00:04:20.790> very<00:04:20.970> good<00:04:21.299> but<00:04:21.959> maybe<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.220> distributor

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
be very good but maybe the distributor

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.550 
be very good but maybe the distributor
doesn't<00:04:24.240> really<00:04:24.450> know<00:04:24.720> how<00:04:25.020> they're<00:04:25.260> going<00:04:25.380> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
doesn't really know how they're going to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.090 
doesn't really know how they're going to
market<00:04:25.950> it<00:04:26.130> and<00:04:26.280> that<00:04:26.610> connects

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
market it and that connects

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.130 
market it and that connects
playing<00:04:27.250> this<00:04:27.460> lackluster<00:04:28.180> trailer<00:04:28.780> well<00:04:29.110> I

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
playing this lackluster trailer well I

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.290 
playing this lackluster trailer well I
still<00:04:29.500> see<00:04:29.740> the<00:04:29.890> movie<00:04:30.220> well<00:04:30.640> probably<00:04:30.910> it's

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
still see the movie well probably it's

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.750

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
see how it turns out but consider my

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.640 
see how it turns out but consider my
expectations<00:04:37.060> lowered<00:04:37.780> quite<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.110> bit<00:04:38.410> because

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
expectations lowered quite a bit because
