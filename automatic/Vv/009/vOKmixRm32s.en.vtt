00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
touches a change em the track around to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.470 
touches a change em the track around to
make<00:02:44.160> it<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.520> doesn't<00:02:44.760> go<00:02:44.850> out<00:02:44.970> there<00:02:45.180> so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
make it so it doesn't go out there so

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.960 
make it so it doesn't go out there so
the<00:02:45.660> second<00:02:46.050> one<00:02:46.230> so<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.250> think<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.550> good

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
the second one so that I think it's good

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.960 
the second one so that I think it's good
bread<00:02:48.750> well<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:50.010> lever<00:02:50.280> will<00:02:50.520> switch<00:02:50.760> this

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
bread well the lever will switch this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.570 
bread well the lever will switch this
one<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.810> car<00:02:52.380> will<00:02:52.500> continue<00:02:53.070> when<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.400> saw

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
one so the car will continue when I saw

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.330 
one so the car will continue when I saw
let's<00:02:53.790> return<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.870> go<00:02:55.050> back<00:02:55.260> into<00:02:55.590> that<00:02:55.950> place

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
let's return and go back into that place

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.580 
let's return and go back into that place
so<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.120> bread<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.930> got<00:02:58.110> his<00:02:58.230> liking<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so the bread and got his liking the

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.199 
so the bread and got his liking the
bread<00:02:58.980> will<00:02:59.100> come<00:02:59.220> up<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.580> instead<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.090> going

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
bread will come up here instead of going

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.540 
bread will come up here instead of going
up<00:03:00.480> there<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.810> so<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.620> so<00:03:01.709> forth<00:03:01.860> so

up there and so on and so forth so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.460 
up there and so on and so forth so
that's<00:03:03.239> how<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.450> works<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.780> he<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:04.019> continue

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
that's how it works and he can continue

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.350 
that's how it works and he can continue
on<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:04.860> there<00:03:05.519> you'll<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:05.970> one<00:03:07.940> so<00:03:08.940> faster

lever damn you see like this one this

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.880 
lever damn you see like this one this
first<00:03:21.239> leave<00:03:21.420> all<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.810> activate<00:03:22.230> this<00:03:22.590> one

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
first leave all just activate this one

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.500 
first leave all just activate this one
it<00:03:23.040> will<00:03:23.100> switch<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.489> one<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.180> it<00:03:24.269> doesn't

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
it will switch that one and it doesn't

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.960 
it will switch that one and it doesn't
matter<00:03:24.870> doesn't<00:03:25.140> reach<00:03:25.410> this<00:03:25.739> over<00:03:26.130> here<00:03:26.400> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
matter doesn't reach this over here the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940 
matter doesn't reach this over here the
second<00:03:27.360> one<00:03:27.480> will<00:03:27.690> will<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.080> activate<00:03:28.560> this

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
second one will will like activate this

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.759 
second one will will like activate this
and<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:30.300> activate<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> next<00:03:31.170> one<00:03:31.350> but<00:03:31.560> won't

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
and then activate the next one but won't

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.330 
and then activate the next one but won't
activate<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> next<00:03:32.400> one<00:03:32.489> it's<00:03:32.910> kind<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.150> like

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
activate the next one it's kind of like

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.400 
activate the next one it's kind of like
it's<00:03:35.340> just<00:03:35.519> using<00:03:35.940> if<00:03:36.390> Fred<00:03:37.019> sound<00:03:37.230> didn't

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
it's just using if Fred sound didn't

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.320 
it's just using if Fred sound didn't
have<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> limit<00:03:37.860> it<00:03:37.980> wouldn't<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.310> possible<00:03:38.460> but

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
have a limit it wouldn't be possible but

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.630 
have a limit it wouldn't be possible but
because<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:39.870> 15<00:03:40.290> block<00:03:40.560> limit<00:03:40.920> it<00:03:41.130> is

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
because of the 15 block limit it is

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.910 
because of the 15 block limit it is
so<00:03:42.270> yeah<00:03:42.390> that's<00:03:42.540> M<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:45.440> the<00:03:46.440> vending

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
so yeah that's M that is the vending

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.949 
so yeah that's M that is the vending
machine<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.490> i'll<00:03:47.670> probably<00:03:48.330> show<00:03:48.900> you

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
