tablet first of all I'd like to start

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.340 
tablet first of all I'd like to start
actually<00:00:14.610> with<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.660> basically<00:00:16.199> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
actually with what is basically the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.349 
actually with what is basically the
current<00:00:16.680> benchmark<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.400> capacitive<00:00:18.210> stylus

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
current benchmark of capacitive stylus

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.200 
current benchmark of capacitive stylus
inking<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.770> that<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.220> penultimate<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:21.119> on

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
inking and that is penultimate here on

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.710 
inking and that is penultimate here on
the<00:00:21.330> iPad<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.279> what<00:00:24.090> i<00:00:24.119> wrote<00:00:24.449> earlier

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the iPad so this is what i wrote earlier

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.230 
the iPad so this is what i wrote earlier
you'll<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.070> comparison<00:00:26.760> photos

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
you'll see it in the comparison photos

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.900 
you'll see it in the comparison photos
in<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> review<00:00:27.779> which<00:00:28.109> will<00:00:28.289> be<00:00:28.380> up<00:00:28.500> shortly

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
in the review which will be up shortly

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.310 
in the review which will be up shortly
but<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.330> show<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.929> looks<00:00:30.960> like

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
but just to show you what it looks like

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.930 
but just to show you what it looks like
to<00:00:31.380> lay<00:00:31.619> down<00:00:31.650> ink<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.160> penultimate<00:00:32.430> i'll

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
to lay down ink and penultimate i'll

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.069 
to lay down ink and penultimate i'll
start<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.300> new<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:35.480> well<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.510> guess<00:00:36.690> selecting

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
start a new one well I guess selecting

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.400 
start a new one well I guess selecting
the<00:00:37.170> pen<00:00:37.320> tool<00:00:37.350> helps<00:00:38.300> so<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.070> ink<00:00:42.410> and

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
the pen tool helps so this is ink and

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:50.450 
the pen tool helps so this is ink and
penultimate<00:00:46.190> on<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.640> iPad<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.829> it<00:00:49.829> does<00:00:50.160> have

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
penultimate on the iPad and it does have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
penultimate on the iPad and it does have
some<00:00:50.850> software<00:00:51.390> based<00:00:51.570> palm<00:00:52.410> rejection<00:00:52.649> but

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
some software based palm rejection but

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
some software based palm rejection but
with<00:00:53.460> this<00:00:53.610> current<00:00:53.910> case<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.780> at<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
with this current case on it at the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
with this current case on it at the
angle<00:00:55.320> i'm<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.440> i'm<00:00:55.920> actually<00:00:56.129> not<00:00:56.340> touching

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
angle i'm at i'm actually not touching

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.819 
angle i'm at i'm actually not touching
the<00:00:57.030> screen<00:00:57.300> simply<00:00:58.199> because<00:00:58.530> my<00:00:58.559> hands

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the screen simply because my hands

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.529 
the screen simply because my hands
resting<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.489> edge<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> which<00:01:00.149> makes<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
resting on the edge of it which makes it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.280 
resting on the edge of it which makes it
really<00:01:00.600> easy<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.500> smooth<00:01:01.920> ink<00:01:03.080> laid<00:01:04.080> down

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
really easy to get smooth ink laid down

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
really easy to get smooth ink laid down
right<00:01:04.559> there<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.549> thing<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.150> penultimate

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
right there the thing is in penultimate

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
right there the thing is in penultimate
once<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.200> put<00:01:07.380> your<00:01:07.500> ink<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:08.369> just

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
once you put your ink down that's just

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.620 
once you put your ink down that's just
where<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.560> which<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.890> why<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.060> nice<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.540> be

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
where it is which is why it's nice to be

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
where it is which is why it's nice to be
able<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.409> Inc<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.750> OneNote<00:01:15.950> running

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
able to Inc here in OneNote running

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
able to Inc here in OneNote running
under<00:01:17.189> windows<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.200> ink<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
under windows so this is the ink that I

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.600 
under windows so this is the ink that I
put<00:01:19.920> down<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:22.170> windows-based<00:01:22.799> side<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
put down for the windows-based side of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.880 
put down for the windows-based side of
the<00:01:23.670> comparison<00:01:24.270> photo<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.320> did<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.710> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the comparison photo and I did this in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.560 
the comparison photo and I did this in
portrait<00:01:26.280> mode<00:01:26.340> although<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.729> usually<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
portrait mode although I usually like to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.480 
portrait mode although I usually like to
use<00:01:27.810> OneNote<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.710> landscape<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:31.490> it

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
use OneNote in landscape just because it

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.830 
use OneNote in landscape just because it
takes<00:01:32.610> up<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:32.850> much<00:01:32.909> side<00:01:33.210> space<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
takes up so much side space with the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.120 
takes up so much side space with the
toolbars<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.290> everything<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:34.920> like

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
toolbars and everything and I like

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.260 
toolbars and everything and I like
having<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> center<00:01:35.729> space<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> middle

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
having the center space in the middle

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.270 
having the center space in the middle
also<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.439> pretty<00:01:37.680> generous<00:01:38.040> sized

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
also there's a pretty generous sized

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.910 
also there's a pretty generous sized
bezel<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.240> bottom<00:01:39.659> which<00:01:40.259> makes<00:01:40.500> resting

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
bezel at the bottom which makes resting

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.920 
bezel at the bottom which makes resting
your<00:01:41.009> palm<00:01:41.220> easy<00:01:42.090> enough<00:01:42.360> since<00:01:42.720> there's

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
your palm easy enough since there's

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.569 
your palm easy enough since there's
obviously<00:01:43.020> no<00:01:43.439> palm<00:01:43.649> rejection<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.430> either

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
obviously no palm rejection here either

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.090 
obviously no palm rejection here either
although<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.360> found<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.290> nice<00:01:46.500> long

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
although I have found that a nice long

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
although I have found that a nice long
sleeve<00:01:47.430> sweater<00:01:47.790> does<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> good<00:01:48.780> job<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
sleeve sweater does a good job of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.350 
sleeve sweater does a good job of
keeping<00:01:49.470> your<00:01:49.770> hand<00:01:50.009> out<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
nice thing about having inked in OneNote

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.149 
nice thing about having inked in OneNote
is<00:01:53.340> we<00:01:53.939> can<00:01:54.090> search<00:01:54.360> through<00:01:54.659> our<00:01:55.590> notebooks

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
is we can search through our notebooks

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.120 
is we can search through our notebooks

found it for us in the ink that I put

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.540 
found it for us in the ink that I put
down<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
down and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.470

looks like to get here here's a new page

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.280 
looks like to get here here's a new page
we're<00:02:19.300> not<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.570> use<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> tip<00:02:20.080> I've

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
we're not going use the tip I've

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.560 
we're not going use the tip I've
actually<00:02:20.920> found<00:02:21.280> that<00:02:21.490> it's<00:02:21.700> most<00:02:22.090> helpful<00:02:22.360> to

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
actually found that it's most helpful to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.540 
actually found that it's most helpful to
use<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> thicker<00:02:23.080> marker<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:24.600> OneNote<00:02:25.600> because

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
use a thicker marker in OneNote because

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.470 
use a thicker marker in OneNote because
it<00:02:27.550> does<00:02:27.760> some<00:02:28.000> kind<00:02:28.210> of<00:02:28.270> pressure

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
it does some kind of pressure

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.770 
it does some kind of pressure
sensitivity<00:02:29.140> thing<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:29.950> i<00:02:30.250> press<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.420> stylus

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
sensitivity thing if i press the stylus

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.890 
sensitivity thing if i press the stylus
and<00:02:31.900> harder<00:02:32.200> i<00:02:32.260> get<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.470> thicker<00:02:32.740> line<00:02:32.830> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and harder i get a thicker line and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.190 
and harder i get a thicker line and
normal<00:02:34.900> pressure<00:02:35.190> gives<00:02:36.190> me<00:02:36.400> a<00:02:37.200> more

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
normal pressure gives me a more

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.550 
normal pressure gives me a more
medium-sized<00:02:38.770> line<00:02:39.160> that<00:02:40.030> by<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.360> way<00:02:40.570> is<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
medium-sized line that by the way is the

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.320 
medium-sized line that by the way is the
bossanova<00:02:41.890> interface<00:02:42.460> which<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.910> neat<00:02:43.120> I'll

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
bossanova interface which is neat I'll

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.090 
bossanova interface which is neat I'll
show<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.540> some<00:02:43.840> other<00:02:43.870> time<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.920> does

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
show that some other time but it does

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.380 
show that some other time but it does
switch<00:02:45.340> back<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.610> forth<00:02:45.790> pretty<00:02:46.180> quickly

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
switch back and forth pretty quickly

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.210 
switch back and forth pretty quickly
there's<00:02:46.660> an<00:02:46.750> easy<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> button<00:02:47.680> in<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:48.010> top

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
there's an easy to button in the top

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.450 
there's an easy to button in the top
corner<00:02:48.250> there<00:02:48.840> but<00:02:49.840> back<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> inking<00:02:50.590> any

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
of these smaller pens are going to come

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.240 
of these smaller pens are going to come
out<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:54.610> thin<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> tend<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.200> go<00:02:56.350> for<00:02:56.380> the
