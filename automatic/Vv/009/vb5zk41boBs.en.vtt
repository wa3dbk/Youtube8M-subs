me<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:36.090> tree<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.750> insight<00:01:36.990> oh<00:01:37.880> I<00:01:41.270> found

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
me of the tree of insight oh I found

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.289 
me of the tree of insight oh I found
this<00:01:42.630> path<00:01:43.590> around<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.220> level<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
this path around the level to be the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.450 
this path around the level to be the
easiest<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.930> run<00:01:46.140> for<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.560> first<00:01:49.399> for<00:01:50.399> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
easiest to run for the first for the

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
easiest to run for the first for the
first<00:01:50.729> two<00:01:51.060> parts<00:01:51.329> or<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> first<00:01:52.560> three

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
first two parts or for the first three

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.719 
first two parts or for the first three
parts<00:01:53.009> rather<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:55.110> when<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.619> get<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
parts rather and when you get to the

parts rather and when you get to the
very<00:01:56.969> last<00:01:57.360> part<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.899> he's<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.140> running

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
very last part when he's just running

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
very last part when he's just running
super<00:01:58.829> fast<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.850> have<00:02:00.030> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
super fast and you really don't have a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.520 
super fast and you really don't have a
chance<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.020> have<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> run<00:02:01.409> as

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
chance to think you just have to run as

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.080 
chance to think you just have to run as
fast<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.890> possible<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.520> can't<00:02:02.700> afford<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
fast as possible and you can't afford to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
fast as possible and you can't afford to
miss<00:02:03.210> any<00:02:03.450> jumps<00:02:03.810> mm-hmm<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:05.070> got<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.490> start

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
miss any jumps mm-hmm you got to start

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.690 
miss any jumps mm-hmm you got to start
improvising

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
improvising

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.089 
improvising
now<00:02:07.240> does<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.540> blue<00:02:07.990> stuff<00:02:08.259> regenerate<00:02:08.860> it

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
now does that blue stuff regenerate it

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.680 
now does that blue stuff regenerate it
does<00:02:09.340> regenerate<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.149> takes<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.509> couple

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
does regenerate it takes a couple

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.240 
does regenerate it takes a couple
seconds<00:02:11.170> though<00:02:11.349> so<00:02:11.530> you<00:02:11.590> can't<00:02:11.890> just<00:02:12.069> like

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
seconds though so you can't just like

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.970 
seconds though so you can't just like
shoot<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:12.819> two<00:02:13.060> or<00:02:13.090> three<00:02:13.239> times<00:02:13.390> in<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> row<00:02:13.980> but

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
shoot it two or three times in a row but

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.530 
shoot it two or three times in a row but
it'll<00:02:15.190> be<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:15.489> on<00:02:15.610> your<00:02:15.640> next<00:02:16.000> path<00:02:16.239> it'll

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
it'll be there on your next path it'll

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.820 
it'll be there on your next path it'll
be<00:02:16.690> there<00:02:16.840> on<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:16.989> next<00:02:17.110> lap<00:02:17.290> okay<00:02:17.980> exactly

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.870

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
after I'd spent a lot of time

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.509 
after I'd spent a lot of time
experimenting<00:03:43.079> with<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.920> best<00:03:44.189> way<00:03:44.489> to

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
experimenting with the the best way to

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.009 
experimenting with the the best way to
go<00:03:44.760> about<00:03:44.879> doing<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.450> mm-hmm

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
go about doing it mm-hmm

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.490 
go about doing it mm-hmm
grenades<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:47.670> be<00:03:47.879> helpful<00:03:48.269> if<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:49.049> can<00:03:49.260> throw

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
grenades can be helpful if you can throw

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.860 
grenades can be helpful if you can throw
them<00:03:49.829> as<00:03:50.220> you're<00:03:50.609> running<00:03:50.819> without<00:03:51.329> aiming<00:03:51.569> at

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
them as you're running without aiming at

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.199 
them as you're running without aiming at
the<00:03:51.989> base<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.680> blue<00:03:52.829> stuff<00:03:53.129> because<00:03:54.030> they

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
the base of that blue stuff because they

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.940 
the base of that blue stuff because they
take<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.450> couple<00:03:54.780> seconds<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.200> explode<00:03:55.620> so<00:03:55.890> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
take a couple seconds to explode so you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.390 
take a couple seconds to explode so you
can<00:03:56.359> continue<00:03:57.359> to<00:03:57.510> run<00:03:57.750> as<00:03:58.109> he<00:03:58.739> gets<00:03:58.889> hurt<00:03:59.129> so

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
can continue to run as he gets hurt so

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.030 
can continue to run as he gets hurt so
you're<00:04:00.269> done<00:04:00.450> now<00:04:00.629> I'm<00:04:01.200> done<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.829> is<00:04:01.889> the
