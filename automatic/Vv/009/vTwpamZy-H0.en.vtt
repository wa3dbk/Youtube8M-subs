00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.780
 and since Raul Araiza said about 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.850
 that julián figueroa has made public 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.320
 who asked for professional help because he has 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.320
 problems with his drinking 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.650
 raúl araiza considers an oven 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.750
 courage and courage the fact that Julian 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.119
 figueroa has publicly recognized 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.429
 have been admitted to a clinic 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.519

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:33.250
 of alcoholism entry is a great 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.440
 courage on your part of the support of 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.140
 the family in the case his father his mother 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.690
 or ex are wonderful that is the basis and 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.140
 especially the great admiration of going out and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.739
 say it publicly 12 at age to what 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.449
 that at age in terms of age like 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.879
 he is doing it because the younger 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.649
 it's harder to understand that you have a 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.660
 situation that needs to be addressed in health 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.140
 because he can return due to death and 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.030
 we will also save you the suffering 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.949
 then this is very and the example 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.130
 that can give the one about it 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.750
 now is that nobody says better than him 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.299
 to understand by the difficult situation 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.650
 that crossed the son of joan sebastian and 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.630
 maribel guard 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.580
 you have to remember at the time he 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.970
 also required the professional wind 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.980
 to overcome their addictions what stops 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.100
 what things that are personal of our 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.260
 private life but then private between 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.660
 quotes because I always have educated 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.970
 we are a public person to me 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.920
 they educated two public people I was born 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.020
 in a breast this artistic 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.430
 so I 've always thought that 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.980
 when there is something that needs to be done 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.680
 public, you can do it if 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.960
 you can save it save it but if you already 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.820
 is discovered as it was in my case 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.380
 because it's a personal matter but 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.940
 well I also understand magazines 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.729
 I also understand the one I prepare 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.950
 much less but I had to accept 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.479
 and what good then to expose because 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.729
 serves something and has served because I've 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.619
 I had many many people who have 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.770
 said hey how did I see you then my 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.090
 son came up and asked for help reported in
