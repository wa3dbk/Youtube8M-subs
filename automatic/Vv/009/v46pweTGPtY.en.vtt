00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
there's not really a whole lot for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.850 
there's not really a whole lot for
vehicle<00:00:28.380> mode

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:28.860 
vehicle mode

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.500 
vehicle mode
he<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.400> scuffed<00:00:30.120> up<00:00:30.360> and<00:00:30.780> dirty<00:00:32.030> that's<00:00:33.030> pretty

much<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.929> for<00:00:33.960> vehicle<00:00:34.589> mode<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.539> must<00:00:36.780> say

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
much it for vehicle mode and I must say

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.340 
much it for vehicle mode and I must say
the<00:00:37.140> prime<00:00:37.350> figures<00:00:37.829> they<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.129> tiny<00:00:39.350> tiny

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the prime figures they are tiny tiny

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.489 
the prime figures they are tiny tiny
figures<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.429> is<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.910> ridiculous<00:00:42.660> how<00:00:42.989> tiny

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:43.499 
figures it is just ridiculous how tiny

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:47.180 
figures it is just ridiculous how tiny
they<00:00:43.769> are<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:46.320> again<00:00:46.499> I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.800> say<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.039> bear

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
they are and again I have to say it bear

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.899 
lot of patience and I'm not a fan about
the<00:00:52.760> prime<00:00:53.760> transformation<00:00:54.719> figures<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
the prime transformation figures so I

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.479 
the prime transformation figures so I
don't<00:00:57.690> actually<00:00:58.379> mess<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.069> all<00:00:59.280> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
much I paint them and I'm good an
honestly<00:01:04.200> Megatron<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> Cliffjumper<00:01:05.070> here

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610

honestly Megatron and Cliffjumper here
probably<00:01:05.910> the<00:01:06.060> only<00:01:06.360> prime<00:01:06.720> figures<00:01:07.170> I'm

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
probably the only prime figures I'm

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:16.610 
probably the only prime figures I'm
gonna<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:10.640> yeah<00:01:12.560> but<00:01:14.480> again<00:01:15.480> not<00:01:16.020> too<00:01:16.320> crazy

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:16.620 
gonna do yeah but again not too crazy

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.570 
gonna do yeah but again not too crazy
about<00:01:17.040> them<00:01:18.230> just<00:01:19.230> not<00:01:19.440> only<00:01:20.130> don't<00:01:20.370> know<00:01:20.490> what

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
about them just not only don't know what

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:38.840 
about them just not only don't know what
else<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:20.790> say

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.940 

so<00:01:39.850> train<00:01:40.270> keep<00:01:40.480> this<00:01:40.720> trying<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.500> keep<00:01:41.620> it<00:01:41.710> low

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so train keep this trying to keep it low

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.290 
so train keep this trying to keep it low
so<00:01:42.250> you<00:01:42.370> can<00:01:42.520> still<00:01:42.730> kind<00:01:42.910> of<00:01:42.940> see<00:01:43.000> on<00:01:43.120> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
so you can still kind of see on the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.950 
so you can still kind of see on the
camera<00:01:43.650> here's<00:01:44.650> what<00:01:44.770> I<00:01:44.830> got<00:01:44.950> much<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.250> see<00:01:45.960> for

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
him even done with the transformation

00:01:48.010 --> 00:02:09.300 
him even done with the transformation
but<00:02:03.870> and<00:02:04.870> since<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.710> saw<00:02:06.570> pictures<00:02:07.570> of<00:02:08.310> first

bit of metallic blue splatter here on

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:04.350 
bit of metallic blue splatter here on
the<00:05:00.160> hammer<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:01.350> be<00:05:02.350> normal<00:05:03.010> Energon<00:05:03.460> like<00:05:04.150> he

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
the hammer to be normal Energon like he

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.260 
the hammer to be normal Energon like he
was<00:05:04.510> bludgeoning<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.229> hell<00:05:05.410> out<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:06.270> just

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
was bludgeoning the hell out of just

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:14.690 
was bludgeoning the hell out of just
some<00:05:07.630> some<00:05:08.470> other<00:05:08.820> non<00:05:10.500> zombified

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.060 

Cybertronian<00:05:15.700> and<00:05:15.910> just

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
Cybertronian and just

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.390 
Cybertronian and just
really<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:18.330> think<00:05:18.540> it<00:05:18.660> helps<00:05:19.220> put<00:05:20.220> the

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
really I just think it helps put the

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.570 
really I just think it helps put the
violence<00:05:20.910> into<00:05:21.420> how<00:05:21.900> you<00:05:22.650> know<00:05:22.770> they<00:05:22.950> are<00:05:23.130> in

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
violence into how you know they are in

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.800 
violence into how you know they are in
their<00:05:23.880> zombie<00:05:24.150> forms<00:05:29.030> so<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:30.480> pretty

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
their zombie forms so that is pretty

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.260 
their zombie forms so that is pretty
much<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:31.320> for<00:05:31.350> a<00:05:31.710> terror<00:05:31.980> con<00:05:32.370> or<00:05:32.730> zombie

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
much it for a terror con or zombie

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.000 
much it for a terror con or zombie

sounds<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:03.360> this<00:06:03.510> time<00:06:04.670> but<00:06:05.670> I<00:06:06.030> fixed<00:06:06.750> his

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
sounds and this time but I fixed his

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.710 
sounds and this time but I fixed his
shoulder<00:06:07.500> so<00:06:07.850> if<00:06:08.850> you<00:06:09.030> watch<00:06:09.180> the<00:06:09.330> other<00:06:09.390> video

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
shoulder so if you watch the other video

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.720 
shoulder so if you watch the other video
it<00:06:10.020> fell<00:06:10.350> quite<00:06:11.010> a<00:06:11.070> bit<00:06:11.250> I<00:06:11.280> guess<00:06:11.460> it<00:06:11.580> still

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
it fell quite a bit I guess it still

dark<00:06:24.900> Energon<00:06:25.290> crystal<00:06:25.740> made<00:06:26.370> that<00:06:26.580> today<00:06:27.140> and

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
dark Energon crystal made that today and

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:34.310 
dark Energon crystal made that today and
I<00:06:29.100> made<00:06:29.340> extra<00:06:29.580> sure<00:06:32.600> to<00:06:33.600> make<00:06:33.780> that<00:06:33.960> fit<00:06:34.230> in
