00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.750
 snowmobiles must be very reliable and 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 durable to provide passengers 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.860
 safe comfortable and fast driving 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.019
 uneven terrain production 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.240
 It begins with such an aluminum frame 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.180
 parts are already partly attached to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.560
 the radiator the robot turns and places 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.570
 grass in position 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.670
 a special computerized 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.289
 mechanism makes a hole and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.570
 rivet inserts 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.429
 thanks to this technology details 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.429
 fixed firmly and does not vibrate 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.300
 but 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.059
 now the turn of the rear suspension is her task 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.800
 make the trip as comfortable as possible 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.570
 this plastic gasket reduces to 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.079
 minimize the friction between suspension and 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.470
 track conveyor moves system 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.809
 suspension on several stages of these wheels 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.780
 and asterisks will rotate the caterpillar 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.690
 which clings to the snow details 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.719
 suspension spring coils are put on 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.299
 runners thanks to restaurant design 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.729
 all well on the frame of the snowmobile 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.200
 the parts are attached manually later 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.030
 a special device will make 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.030
 compound even more durable 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.960
 assembly of the transmission system begins with 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.920
 counterdrive first set 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.370
 high performance brake disc of 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.370
 forged steel 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.649
 thanks to a special ledge on it 

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:31.450
 perfectly gets your skin up to chain transfer in 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.990
 cast aluminum case 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.659
 there are two gears and a chain 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.850
 this bolt is connected to a spring which is not 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.220
 gives gear and chains to loosen 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.450
 transformations the device moves along 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.250
 groove back and forth 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.580
 to ensure uniform tension 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.439
 chains spring tension compression is also under 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.570
 control 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.520
 steam install oil pressure gauges 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.649
 it is very important that the parts are well 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.259
 lubricated because the engine creates 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.159
 additional friction 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:05.350
 the gear is mounted on top of the frame 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.209
 coil spring padded wheels easy 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.700
 get up on a rubber caterpillar 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.910
 days now attach the rear suspension 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.019
 and a plastic white star connects 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.019
 caterpillar with gear 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.819
 directly to the asterisk attached 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.939
 speed sensor 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.459
 using 4 steel bolts rear 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:27.540
 the suspension is mounted on the frame Balta 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.609
 so strong 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.040
 that the suspension can withstand vibration 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.670
 arising at the highest speeds 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.379
 Now go to the engine assembly 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.159
 bolts attach electric starter 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.189
 engine 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.739
 this engine gives a lot of heat up 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.659
 700 degrees Celsius therefore for 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.870
 driver protection is set 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.019
 several layers of insulation material 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.340
 acting as a thermal barrier 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.150
 engine made of cast aluminum 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.949
 does not weigh only 45 kilograms 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.750
 thanks to him the snowmobile develops 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.750
 speed up to two hundred kilometers per hour 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.700
 now go to the front 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.580
 snowmobile front suspension arranged 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.540
 Other than the rear both parts fit together. 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.550
 lift mechanism 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.040
 gas tank is not made of metal but of 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.900
 light stamped plastic 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.230
 choke serves to control the speed 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.150
 like a gas pedal in the car after him 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.060
 sets some more important 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.480
 details 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:36.980
 lightweight streamlined plastic panels 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.200
 give the snowmobile an elegant shape finally 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.470
 the lift puts the finished snowmobile on 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.630
 these polystyrene pallet you and sheets 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.849
 protect it when transporting in 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.130
 the store the assembly of this machine took only 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:52.720
 three hours now she is ready to drive on 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.720
 snowdrifts in the strongest snowstorms
