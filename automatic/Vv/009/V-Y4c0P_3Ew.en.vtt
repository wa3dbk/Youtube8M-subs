is a gorgeous color and a really nice
frosty<00:01:41.520> shimmer<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:42.990> not<00:01:43.290> bold<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.399> a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
frosty shimmer and it's not bold it is a

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.510 
frosty shimmer and it's not bold it is a
little<00:01:44.670> bit<00:01:44.939> patchy<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.840> i<00:01:45.930> guess<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.619> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
little bit patchy but i guess for you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
little bit patchy but i guess for you
know<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.689> highlight<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.380> guess

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
know a kind of a highlight I guess

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050 
know a kind of a highlight I guess
that's<00:01:49.829> fine<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.430> because<00:01:50.850> that's

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
that's fine really because that's

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's fine really because that's
basically<00:01:51.210> what<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.869> was<00:01:52.020> for<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> highlight

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
basically what it was for to highlight

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
basically what it was for to highlight
the<00:01:52.799> inner<00:01:52.979> corner<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.640> little<00:01:54.060> bit<00:01:54.270> patchy

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the inner corner so a little bit patchy

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.260 
the inner corner so a little bit patchy
but<00:01:54.750> overall<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.799> really<00:01:56.040> nice<00:01:56.399> effect<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
but overall and a really nice effect and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.929 
but overall and a really nice effect and
then<00:01:57.960> carbon<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.640> when<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.880> came

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
then carbon and you know when I came

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.190 
then carbon and you know when I came
close<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.509> camera<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.840> think<00:02:01.079> you'd

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
close to the camera I think you'd

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.510 
close to the camera I think you'd
probably<00:02:01.409> thought<00:02:01.680> wow<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.219> didn't<00:02:02.460> even

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
probably thought wow I didn't even

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.340 
probably thought wow I didn't even
realize<00:02:02.820> she<00:02:03.030> had<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:03.930> I've

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
realize she had like because I've

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.929 
realize she had like because I've
smudged<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.950> out<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.579> goes<00:02:05.790> a<00:02:05.850> long

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
smudged it out a little bit goes a long

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.900 
smudged it out a little bit goes a long
way<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.479> really<00:02:07.049> really<00:02:07.950> blendable<00:02:08.459> so

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
way and it's really really blendable so

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.820 
way and it's really really blendable so
I<00:02:08.940> completely<00:02:09.569> smudged<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.500> it's<00:02:10.649> just

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
I completely smudged it out so it's just

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.040 
I completely smudged it out so it's just
a<00:02:11.009> very<00:02:11.670> light<00:02:12.270> smoke

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
a very light smoke

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.350 
a very light smoke
on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.260> eye<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.710> that's<00:02:14.580> one<00:02:14.970> fantastic

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
on the eye and that's one fantastic

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.850 
on the eye and that's one fantastic
thing<00:02:15.690> about<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:16.020> is<00:02:16.110> very<00:02:16.350> very<00:02:16.410> blendable

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
thing about it is very very blendable

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.130 
thing about it is very very blendable
and<00:02:17.190> from<00:02:17.820> how<00:02:18.120> black<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.450> looks<00:02:18.570> in<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> pot

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and from how black it looks in the pot

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.710 
and from how black it looks in the pot
is<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.500> quite<00:02:19.740> as<00:02:20.010> black<00:02:20.730> on<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:21.210> when<00:02:21.540> it's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
is not quite as black on I when it's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.750 
is not quite as black on I when it's
blended<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.320> if<00:02:22.770> you<00:02:22.950> pack<00:02:23.160> sit<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.490> and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
blended and if you pack sit on and

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.310 
blended and if you pack sit on and
didn't<00:02:23.970> blend<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.390> would<00:02:24.570> be<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:25.020> dark

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
didn't blend it it would be that dark

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.650 
didn't blend it it would be that dark
but<00:02:25.980> blended<00:02:26.490> out<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:26.850> much<00:02:27.270> much<00:02:27.600> nicer

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
but blended out it's much much nicer

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.390 
but blended out it's much much nicer
which<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> kind<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:28.710> nice<00:02:28.830> because<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:29.190> guess

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
which is kind of nice because I guess

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.620 
which is kind of nice because I guess
you<00:02:29.520> can<00:02:29.670> build<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> coverage<00:02:30.480> you<00:02:30.510> want

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
you can build up the coverage you want

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.260 
you can build up the coverage you want
from<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.130> cream<00:02:32.340> eyeshadows<00:02:32.880> retail

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
from it so the cream eyeshadows retail

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.470 
from it so the cream eyeshadows retail
for<00:02:33.450> sixteen<00:02:33.840> dollars<00:02:34.050> 50<00:02:34.590> which<00:02:34.740> i<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:34.980> is

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
for sixteen dollars 50 which i think is

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.300 
for sixteen dollars 50 which i think is
expensive<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:36.660> i<00:02:36.750> will<00:02:37.020> say<00:02:37.350> that<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.950> little

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
expensive but i will say that a little

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.460 
expensive but i will say that a little
goes<00:02:38.460> a<00:02:38.490> long<00:02:38.610> way<00:02:38.910> so<00:02:38.970> i<00:02:39.360> guess<00:02:39.810> for<00:02:40.290> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
goes a long way so i guess for the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.770 
goes a long way so i guess for the
amount<00:02:40.620> of<00:02:40.770> products<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.490> which<00:02:41.820> is<00:02:42.030> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
amount of products you get which is you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.780 
amount of products you get which is you
know<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:43.650> doesn't<00:02:43.920> look<00:02:44.010> much<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> jar<00:02:44.610> but

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
know it doesn't look much in the jar but

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
know it doesn't look much in the jar but
when<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.240> should<00:02:45.450> when<00:02:45.660> you<00:02:45.750> realize<00:02:46.050> how

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
when you should when you realize how

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.600 
when you should when you realize how
much<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.530> use<00:02:46.710> each<00:02:46.860> time<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.430> go<00:02:47.580> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
much you use each time that you go a

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.690 
much you use each time that you go a
long<00:02:47.760> way<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.110> i<00:02:49.590> really<00:02:50.130> i<00:02:50.220> do<00:02:50.280> like<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
long way so and i really i do like the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.420 
long way so and i really i do like the
products<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.450> maybe<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.530> little<00:02:52.590> bit<00:02:52.950> privacy

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
products and maybe a little bit privacy

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.100 
products and maybe a little bit privacy

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
the pigment get I know that's to be

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.130 
the pigment get I know that's to be
expected<00:03:32.459> but<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.330> quite<00:03:33.570> dramatically

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
expected but it's quite dramatically

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.800 
expected but it's quite dramatically
less<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.830> although<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:35.790> a<00:03:35.880> beautiful<00:03:36.660> color

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
less so although it's a beautiful color

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.900 
less so although it's a beautiful color
you'll<00:03:37.080> need<00:03:37.290> quite<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.680> bit<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
you'll need quite a bit of it and the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.449 
you'll need quite a bit of it and the
saying<00:03:39.150> that<00:03:39.420> the<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.290> jar<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.800> thirteen

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
saying that the the jar is thirteen

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.220 
saying that the the jar is thirteen
dollars<00:03:41.580> 50<00:03:42.030> but<00:03:42.239> it<00:03:42.420> contains<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> lot<00:03:43.200> of

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
dollars 50 but it contains a lot of

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.820 
dollars 50 but it contains a lot of
pigment<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.850> guess<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.630> that<00:03:46.110> respect<00:03:46.500> it's

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
pigment so I guess in that respect it's

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.770 
pigment so I guess in that respect it's
quite<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.130> good<00:03:47.340> deal<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:47.790> then<00:03:48.330> the<00:03:48.420> second

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
quite a good deal and then the second

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.190 
quite a good deal and then the second
one<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:49.170> called<00:03:49.650> impact<00:03:53.870> this<00:03:54.870> is<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.080> most

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
one is called impact this is the most

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.430 
one is called impact this is the most
beautiful<00:03:55.520> color<00:03:56.520> in<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.030> pan<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.570> if<00:03:58.290> you

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
beautiful color in the pan and if you

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.920 
beautiful color in the pan and if you
can<00:03:58.650> see<00:03:58.890> it's<00:03:59.430> black<00:04:00.000> with<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.390> gold<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
can see it's black with these gold and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.100 
can see it's black with these gold and
blue<00:04:01.200> reflex<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.310> amazing<00:04:02.930> so<00:04:03.930> can

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
blue reflex and it's just amazing so can

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.350 
blue reflex and it's just amazing so can
I<00:04:04.140> swatch<00:04:04.440> pigment<00:04:04.950> it's<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.250> bottom<00:04:05.670> color

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
I swatch pigment it's the bottom color

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.120 
I swatch pigment it's the bottom color
here<00:04:08.420> now<00:04:09.420> it's<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.660> gorgeous<00:04:09.959> color<00:04:10.620> but<00:04:10.920> again

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
here now it's a gorgeous color but again

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.710 
here now it's a gorgeous color but again
you<00:04:11.550> need<00:04:11.670> quite<00:04:11.940> a<00:04:11.970> bit<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.330> get<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.480> good

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
you need quite a bit to get a good

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.000 
you need quite a bit to get a good
coverage<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.660> mean<00:04:15.660> I've<00:04:16.440> never<00:04:16.739> really

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
coverage and so I mean I've never really

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.530 
coverage and so I mean I've never really
seen<00:04:17.190> a<00:04:17.250> color<00:04:17.519> like<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.150> think<00:04:18.390> it's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
seen a color like this and I think it's

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.850 
seen a color like this and I think it's
beautiful<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:20.100> I'm<00:04:20.850> loving<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:22.109> color<00:04:22.320> again

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
beautiful so I'm loving the color again

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.780 
beautiful so I'm loving the color again
the<00:04:23.280> negative<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.120> it<00:04:24.270> is<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.840> just

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
the negative of it is that it just

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.790 
the negative of it is that it just
a little<00:04:26.030> bit<00:04:26.180> to<00:04:26.360> get<00:04:26.480> it<00:04:26.540> going<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.110> but

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
a little bit to get it going and but

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.100 
a little bit to get it going and but
that<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.460> similar<00:04:29.090> with<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.390> lot<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.600> eyeshadows

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
that is similar with a lot of eyeshadows

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.140 
that is similar with a lot of eyeshadows
and<00:04:30.140> a<00:04:30.350> lot<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.530> high-end<00:04:30.770> eyeshadows<00:04:31.370> so<00:04:31.610> I<00:04:31.880> do

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
and a lot of high-end eyeshadows so I do

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.140 
and a lot of high-end eyeshadows so I do
really<00:04:32.540> like<00:04:32.720> that<00:04:32.900> one<00:04:33.370> then<00:04:34.370> finally<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.820> come

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150

this one now I put this on my lips
before<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.640> actually<00:04:46.760> took<00:04:47.000> off<00:04:47.210> because

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
before and I actually took off because

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.630 
before and I actually took off because
it<00:04:47.570> made<00:04:47.840> me<00:04:47.990> feel<00:04:48.200> a<00:04:48.230> little<00:04:48.440> bit<00:04:48.680> 90s<00:04:49.490> like

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
it made me feel a little bit 90s like

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.360 
it made me feel a little bit 90s like
yeah<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.270> nineties<00:04:50.780> like<00:04:51.020> glossy<00:04:51.380> brown<00:04:51.860> lips

yeah the nineties like glossy brown lips
I'll<00:04:52.940> sort<00:04:53.180> it<00:04:53.270> on<00:04:53.420> my<00:04:53.510> hand<00:04:53.720> for<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.170> I<00:04:57.370> think

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
I'll sort it on my hand for you I think

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.920 
I'll sort it on my hand for you I think
it's<00:04:58.520> nice<00:04:58.640> but<00:04:58.880> I<00:04:58.940> think<00:04:59.120> if<00:04:59.240> I<00:04:59.330> were<00:04:59.540> I<00:04:59.600> would

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
it's nice but I think if I were I would

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:01.870 
it's nice but I think if I were I would
have<00:05:00.080> to<00:05:00.230> mix<00:05:00.710> it<00:05:00.920> with<00:05:00.950> another<00:05:01.250> color<00:05:01.520> and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
have to mix it with another color and

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.950 
have to mix it with another color and
just<00:05:02.660> because<00:05:03.020> it's<00:05:03.440> a<00:05:04.400> bit<00:05:04.670> too<00:05:05.000> 90s<00:05:05.570> for<00:05:05.810> me

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
just because it's a bit too 90s for me

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.670 
just because it's a bit too 90s for me
and<00:05:06.430> but<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.460> do<00:05:07.820> i<00:05:08.210> do<00:05:08.300> like<00:05:08.750> it<00:05:09.110> and<00:05:09.290> i<00:05:09.470> think

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
and but I do i do like it and i think

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.340 
and but I do i do like it and i think
it's<00:05:09.800> a<00:05:09.980> really<00:05:10.130> nice<00:05:10.370> little<00:05:10.790> payoff<00:05:11.150> and<00:05:11.600> a
