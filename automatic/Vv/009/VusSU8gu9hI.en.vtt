00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
you could pretty much pick them up and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:53.020

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.620 
I currently have them in this tank it's
actually<00:01:57.020> this<00:01:57.679> might<00:01:57.890> be<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.490> very<00:01:58.880> good<00:01:59.060> idea

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
actually this might be a very good idea

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.260 
actually this might be a very good idea
for<00:02:00.170> many<00:02:00.380> pet<00:02:00.649> owners<00:02:00.679> they<00:02:01.670> have<00:02:01.819> larger

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
for many pet owners they have larger

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.109 
for many pet owners they have larger
ones<00:02:02.479> than<00:02:02.690> this<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.860> is<00:02:04.069> about<00:02:04.280> 50<00:02:04.729> quarts

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
ones than this this is about 50 quarts

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.830 
ones than this this is about 50 quarts
and<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:06.170> just<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:06.649> Sterilite<00:02:07.399> tub<00:02:07.840> closes

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
and it's just a Sterilite tub closes

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.440 
and it's just a Sterilite tub closes
with<00:02:08.989> these<00:02:09.200> two<00:02:11.380> latches<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.940> it<00:02:13.940> closes

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
with these two latches and it closes

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.810 
with these two latches and it closes
tight<00:02:14.959> enough<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.380> nothing<00:02:15.950> can<00:02:16.040> escape<00:02:16.190> but

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
tight enough that nothing can escape but

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.850 
tight enough that nothing can escape but
it's<00:02:16.970> not<00:02:17.150> airtight<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.930> could<00:02:18.320> stick<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> knife

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's not airtight I could stick a knife

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.030 
it's not airtight I could stick a knife
through<00:02:19.220> there<00:02:19.489> it's<00:02:20.420> not<00:02:20.630> airtight<00:02:21.110> so<00:02:21.860> the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
through there it's not airtight so the

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.180 
through there it's not airtight so the
animal<00:02:22.480> suffocate<00:02:23.480> in<00:02:23.600> there<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:24.100> it's<00:02:25.100> a

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
animal suffocate in there and it's a

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.569 
animal suffocate in there and it's a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
of the cage climbing out I was like how

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.550 
of the cage climbing out I was like how

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
did you get out so I actually decided to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.699 
did you get out so I actually decided to
go<00:03:42.799> and<00:03:43.130> get<00:03:43.970> one<00:03:44.120> of<00:03:44.150> these<00:03:44.269> tubs<00:03:44.569> for<00:03:45.560> them

go and get one of these tubs for them

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.000 
go and get one of these tubs for them
also<00:03:45.970> because<00:03:47.139> there's<00:03:48.139> no<00:03:48.200> way<00:03:48.530> out

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
also because there's no way out

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.309 
also because there's no way out
a<00:03:49.209> or<00:03:50.209> get<00:03:50.359> Simenson<00:03:50.840> they're<00:03:51.019> not<00:03:51.139> going<00:03:51.290> to

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
suffocate and this way I don't have to

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.699 
suffocate and this way I don't have to
worry<00:03:53.540> about<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.959> babies<00:03:54.260> getting<00:03:54.440> loose

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
worry about the babies getting loose

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.890 
worry about the babies getting loose
plus<00:03:55.579> these<00:03:55.790> cages<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:56.329> I<00:03:56.419> said<00:03:56.599> they<00:03:56.690> cost

five<00:03:57.109> bucks<00:03:57.139> they're<00:03:58.130> not<00:03:58.280> really<00:03:58.430> cages<00:03:58.940> of

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
five bucks they're not really cages of

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.690 
five bucks they're not really cages of
course<00:03:59.299> but<00:03:59.989> they<00:04:00.109> cost<00:04:00.290> five<00:04:00.560> bucks<00:04:00.590> and<00:04:01.190> to
