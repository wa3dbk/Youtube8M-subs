 Good time I played video because I 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.289

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:36.420
 cold and it's good that it's very good and you want it 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.270
 sleep you do not want to record or are you today 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.780

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:04.100
 the cuts I want more - here in the thigh 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.100

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:26.009
 Good. Now, woman, camera. 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 try the best here is the thread that 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.670
 I want to divert and it's just and pulling those 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.970
 darker threads that do not even have 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:44.340
 blue sport and this whiter purple 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:48.320
 blue is doing this on the whole wire 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.320
 until he gets like this 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.210
 Was this what you were doing this? 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.530
 all the cuts we made and she 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.140
 it will stay like this 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.990
 I'm going to make some more cuts here. 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.990
 in the leg I do not know yet 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.759
 Then I can be with you again. 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.430
 thing that is important to say that it has 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:18.040
 and you must have been this fabric here 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:22.480
 What is more, he was like this. 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:28.080
 about him and also extract the square 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.080
 after it oscillated it will stay but if the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.959
 Hi or that one say yes that the quality 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.739
 of videos to note if a wonder why

 I do not have a tripod and because I do not have 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.880

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.829
