00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
and hop into it will start with spawn

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
and hop into it will start with spawn
the<00:00:50.520> spawn<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.360> want<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> stand<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.020> here

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
edge of the bomb marker and it'll take

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.179 
edge of the bomb marker and it'll take
it<00:01:03.149> straight<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.500> enemy<00:01:04.890> spawn

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it straight down into the enemy spawn

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.300 
it straight down into the enemy spawn
again<00:01:05.479> spawn<00:01:06.479> tomahawks<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.830> need<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
again spawn tomahawks do not need to be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
again spawn tomahawks do not need to be
exact<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.060> people<00:01:09.360> are<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
exact because people are not going to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
exact because people are not going to
run<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.650> path<00:01:11.010> or<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.700> same<00:01:11.939> place

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
run the same path or in the same place

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.840 
run the same path or in the same place
every<00:01:13.200> single<00:01:13.530> time<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.580> rough

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
every single time so just rough

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.330 
every single time so just rough
estimates<00:01:15.390> guys<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.070> put<00:01:17.250> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
estimates guys and this will put you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.399 
estimates guys and this will put you
somewhere<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> general<00:01:18.420> area<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:19.080> path

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
somewhere in the general area of a path

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.410 
somewhere in the general area of a path
that<00:01:19.890> they<00:01:20.040> will<00:01:20.189> be<00:01:20.340> running<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.210> out

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that they will be running just from out

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.679 
that they will be running just from out
of<00:01:21.570> their<00:01:21.720> spawn<00:01:22.250> pretty<00:01:23.250> good<00:01:23.460> pretty<00:01:24.330> simple

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
of their spawn pretty good pretty simple

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
of their spawn pretty good pretty simple
that<00:01:24.900> way<00:01:25.110> pretty<00:01:25.710> easy<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.850> get<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.090> into

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that way pretty easy to get it into

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.060 
that way pretty easy to get it into
their<00:01:27.479> spawn<00:01:27.869> with<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> slope<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
their spawn with the slope but the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
their spawn with the slope but the
opposite<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.909> what<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> came<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.720> with<00:01:30.750> is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
opposite of that what I came up with is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
opposite of that what I came up with is
you<00:01:31.079> run<00:01:31.320> up<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.619> behind<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.420> behind<00:01:33.420> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you run up here behind this behind this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.679 
you run up here behind this behind this
forklift<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.380> look<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.670> your<00:01:36.060> bottom

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
forklift here look up have your bottom

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.420 
forklift here look up have your bottom
graticule<00:01:36.960> touch<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.560> power<00:01:37.770> line<00:01:38.009> looking

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
graticule touch the power line looking

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.940 
graticule touch the power line looking
directly<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> bball<00:01:39.810> marker<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
directly over the bball marker and it

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
directly over the bball marker and it
just<00:01:41.070> brings<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.549> straight<00:01:41.939> into<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.450> path

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
just brings it straight into that path

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
just brings it straight into that path
that<00:01:43.049> they<00:01:43.140> would<00:01:43.259> be<00:01:43.409> running<00:01:43.619> down<00:01:44.009> from

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
that they would be running down from

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.870 
that they would be running down from
their<00:01:45.119> spawn<00:01:45.540> again<00:01:46.200> does<00:01:47.189> not<00:01:47.399> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.759> be

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
their spawn again does not have to be

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.330 
their spawn again does not have to be
exact<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.570> something<00:01:48.930> in<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> general<00:01:49.950> gist

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
exact just something in the general gist

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
exact just something in the general gist
of<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> showed<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.390> will<00:01:52.259> put<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> right

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
of what I showed you will put it right

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.010 
of what I showed you will put it right
through<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.549> middle<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:54.329> right

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020

through the middle of there right
through<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.259> middle<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.710> path<00:01:55.950> right

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
through the middle of their path right

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.959 
through the middle of their path right
there<00:01:56.840> next<00:01:57.840> we're<00:01:58.560> gonna<00:01:58.619> move<00:01:58.890> over<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> we

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
right behind her feet because she did

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.479 
right behind her feet because she did
scoot<00:02:53.230> up<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.440> little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.739> when<00:02:53.890> she<00:02:53.920> diffused

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
scoot up a little bit when she diffused

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.490 
scoot up a little bit when she diffused
and<00:02:54.700> that<00:02:54.850> did<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.150> jump<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.019> brought<00:02:56.320> me

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
and that did a jump and it brought me

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.009 
and that did a jump and it brought me
just<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:57.310> enough<00:02:57.580> closer<00:02:57.880> to<00:02:58.690> go<00:02:58.810> ahead<00:02:58.930> and

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
just just enough closer to go ahead and

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.810 
just just enough closer to go ahead and
pick<00:02:59.170> her<00:02:59.380> off<00:02:59.560> defusing<00:03:00.160> right<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.519> again

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820
