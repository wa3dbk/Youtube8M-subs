how's<00:00:10.660> it<00:00:10.690> going<00:00:11.050> everyone<00:00:11.320> got<00:00:12.219> a<00:00:12.250> review<00:00:12.610> for

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:12.820 
how's it going everyone got a review for

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.180 
how's it going everyone got a review for
you<00:00:12.969> today<00:00:13.210> on<00:00:13.540> a<00:00:13.570> protein<00:00:14.139> product<00:00:14.740> this

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
you today on a protein product this

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.980 
you today on a protein product this
one's<00:00:15.400> made<00:00:15.549> by<00:00:15.670> Dymatize<00:00:16.120> nutrition<00:00:16.180> and

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
one's made by Dymatize nutrition and

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.950 
one's made by Dymatize nutrition and
it's<00:00:17.440> called<00:00:17.680> elite<00:00:18.220> fusion<00:00:18.850> 7<00:00:19.360> and<00:00:19.660> it<00:00:19.780> gets

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960 
it's called elite fusion 7 and it gets

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.230 
it's called elite fusion 7 and it gets
its<00:00:20.110> name<00:00:20.199> from<00:00:20.590> having<00:00:21.400> seven<00:00:21.940> different

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
its name from having seven different

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.349 
its name from having seven different
sources<00:00:22.810> of<00:00:22.990> protein<00:00:23.220> inside<00:00:24.220> it<00:00:24.460> so<00:00:25.240> the

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
sources of protein inside it so the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.269 
sources of protein inside it so the
seven<00:00:25.630> sources<00:00:25.810> are<00:00:26.380> whey<00:00:26.769> protein

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
seven sources are whey protein

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.320 
seven sources are whey protein
concentrate

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.330 
concentrate

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.300 
concentrate
it<00:00:28.660> also<00:00:28.810> has<00:00:29.050> whey<00:00:29.199> protein<00:00:29.589> isolate<00:00:30.070> in<00:00:30.189> it

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
it also has whey protein isolate in it

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.670 
it also has whey protein isolate in it
there<00:00:30.640> I<00:00:30.849> think<00:00:31.240> counting<00:00:31.570> that<00:00:31.660> as<00:00:31.720> one<00:00:32.050> so

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
there I think counting that as one so

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.600 
there I think counting that as one so
you<00:00:32.740> have<00:00:32.890> basically<00:00:33.250> a<00:00:33.400> whey<00:00:33.580> protein

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
you have basically a whey protein

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.360 
you have basically a whey protein
profile<00:00:34.600> in<00:00:34.840> there<00:00:35.020> milk<00:00:35.950> protein

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
profile in there milk protein

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.960 
profile in there milk protein
concentrate<00:00:37.200> calcium<00:00:38.200> caseinate<00:00:38.970> micellar

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
concentrate calcium caseinate micellar

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.440 
concentrate calcium caseinate micellar
casein<00:00:40.330> milk<00:00:41.260> protein<00:00:41.800> isolate<00:00:42.430> and<00:00:42.670> an<00:00:43.150> egg

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
casein milk protein isolate and an egg

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.900 
casein milk protein isolate and an egg
protein<00:00:44.050> in<00:00:44.170> it<00:00:44.290> as<00:00:44.410> well<00:00:44.680> so<00:00:45.010> you're<00:00:45.550> getting

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
protein in it as well so you're getting

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.510 
protein in it as well so you're getting
really<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.450> nice<00:00:46.990> profile<00:00:47.800> not<00:00:48.040> only<00:00:48.250> from<00:00:48.400> an

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
really a nice profile not only from an

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.360 
really a nice profile not only from an
amino<00:00:48.850> acid<00:00:48.940> standpoint<00:00:49.870> but<00:00:50.380> also<00:00:50.530> a<00:00:50.710> release

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
amino acid standpoint but also a release

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.650 
amino acid standpoint but also a release
standpoint<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.150> that's<00:00:52.270> really<00:00:52.420> what

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
standpoint and that's really what

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.780 
standpoint and that's really what
they're<00:00:52.840> kind<00:00:52.990> of<00:00:53.200> marketing<00:00:54.190> this<00:00:54.310> as<00:00:54.520> is

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
they're kind of marketing this as is

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.940 
they're kind of marketing this as is
something<00:00:55.090> that<00:00:55.210> has<00:00:55.330> sustained<00:00:55.840> release<00:00:56.230> so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
something that has sustained release so

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.400 
something that has sustained release so
opposed<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.940> like<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.180> say<00:00:58.660> just<00:00:58.900> a<00:00:59.020> strictly

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
opposed to like a say just a strictly

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.680 
opposed to like a say just a strictly
whey<00:00:59.740> protein<00:01:00.250> isolate<00:01:00.880> that's<00:01:01.450> going<00:01:01.630> to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
whey protein isolate that's going to

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.960 
whey protein isolate that's going to
absorb<00:01:01.780> within<00:01:02.590> 30<00:01:03.220> minutes<00:01:03.580> to<00:01:03.790> an<00:01:03.820> hour

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
absorb within 30 minutes to an hour

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.940 
absorb within 30 minutes to an hour
you've<00:01:04.809> got<00:01:05.019> something<00:01:05.409> that's<00:01:05.560> going<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.830> be

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
you've got something that's going to be

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.550 
you've got something that's going to be
continuing<00:01:06.640> releasing<00:01:07.240> hours<00:01:07.840> after<00:01:08.380> you've

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
continuing releasing hours after you've

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.890 
continuing releasing hours after you've
consumed<00:01:09.100> your<00:01:09.340> shake<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:09.970> far<00:01:10.659> as<00:01:10.780> the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
consumed your shake as far as the

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.660 
consumed your shake as far as the
calorie<00:01:11.290> count<00:01:11.590> goes<00:01:11.800> on<00:01:12.010> it<00:01:12.160> you<00:01:12.280> have<00:01:12.370> a<00:01:12.400> nine

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
calorie count goes on it you have a nine

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.480 
calorie count goes on it you have a nine
hundred<00:01:13.150> ninety<00:01:13.450> calories<00:01:14.040> 23<00:01:15.040> grams<00:01:15.220> of

hundred ninety calories 23 grams of

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.390 
hundred ninety calories 23 grams of
protein<00:01:16.000> there's<00:01:16.510> 11<00:01:17.230> grams<00:01:17.440> of<00:01:17.650> carbs<00:01:17.980> and<00:01:18.130> 5

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
protein there's 11 grams of carbs and 5

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.880 
protein there's 11 grams of carbs and 5
grams<00:01:18.700> of<00:01:18.910> fat<00:01:19.150> that<00:01:20.020> are<00:01:20.050> in<00:01:20.290> this<00:01:20.530> but<00:01:20.770> over

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
grams of fat that are in this but over

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.550 
grams of fat that are in this but over
those<00:01:21.040> carbs<00:01:21.520> 5<00:01:21.940> or<00:01:22.210> 5<00:01:22.570> grams<00:01:22.780> or<00:01:23.020> fiber<00:01:23.290> as

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
those carbs 5 or 5 grams or fiber as

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.920 
those carbs 5 or 5 grams or fiber as
well<00:01:23.590> so<00:01:24.490> when<00:01:24.940> you<00:01:25.090> look<00:01:25.240> at<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> nutritional

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
well so when you look at the nutritional

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.620 
well so when you look at the nutritional
profile<00:01:26.470> it's<00:01:26.950> actually<00:01:27.490> somewhat<00:01:28.060> more<00:01:28.420> of<00:01:28.450> a

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
profile it's actually somewhat more of a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.810 
profile it's actually somewhat more of a
snack<00:01:29.110> than<00:01:29.470> anything<00:01:29.740> else<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.370> wouldn't

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
snack than anything else I wouldn't

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.220 
snack than anything else I wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:31.240> consider<00:01:31.420> this<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.840> meal

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
necessarily consider this a meal

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.290 
necessarily consider this a meal
replacement<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.400> it's<00:01:33.520> also<00:01:33.760> not<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.210> to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
replacement but it's also not going to

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.480 
replacement but it's also not going to
be<00:01:34.390> necessarily<00:01:35.260> just<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.650> strict<00:01:35.979> protein

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
be necessarily just a strict protein

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.860 
be necessarily just a strict protein
shake<00:01:36.790> that<00:01:36.970> you're<00:01:37.120> gonna<00:01:37.210> want<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.450> take<00:01:37.630> say

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:37.870 
shake that you're gonna want to take say

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.020 
shake that you're gonna want to take say
after<00:01:38.200> your<00:01:38.320> workout<00:01:38.740> or<00:01:38.770> first<00:01:39.580> thing<00:01:39.850> in<00:01:39.940> the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
after your workout or first thing in the

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.550 
after your workout or first thing in the
morning<00:01:40.360> when<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.630> want<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:40.900> get<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.140> protein

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
morning when you want to get the protein

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.960 
morning when you want to get the protein
into<00:01:41.740> your<00:01:41.890> system<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.340> little<00:01:42.580> bit<00:01:42.700> quicker

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
into your system a little bit quicker

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.540 
into your system a little bit quicker
than<00:01:43.300> what<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.170> fusion<00:01:44.680> seven<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.190> gonna<00:01:45.340> do

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
than what the fusion seven is gonna do

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.060 
than what the fusion seven is gonna do
but<00:01:46.180> all<00:01:46.300> in<00:01:46.420> all<00:01:46.510> it's<00:01:46.780> a<00:01:46.870> great<00:01:47.170> protein<00:01:47.920> to

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
but all in all it's a great protein to

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.520 
but all in all it's a great protein to
take<00:01:48.250> again<00:01:48.550> throughout<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.360> day<00:01:49.600> I'd<00:01:49.900> really

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530
