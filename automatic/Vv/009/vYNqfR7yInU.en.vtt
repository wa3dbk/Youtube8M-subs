00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.089
 welcome to neutral and today I bring you the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.070
 new game of the wwf that for those who 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:16.020
 do not know what it is about a game 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.400
 wrestling based on a program of 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.040
 television that is currently being 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.110
 issuing the game is accompanied by some 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.940
 good graphics and they have also known 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.250
 through videos of what would be the 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.850
 program and audio make us have the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.050
 feeling that we are part of the ww 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.940
 before I see a fight I think it's 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.649
 important that we see what it would be 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.530
 writer and the sprint in mind so that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.600
 you see how it would be used and I say this 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.780
 It is very important because the issue of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.640
 controls are quite uncomplicated 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.999
 but there are a lot of ways to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.309
 to make a fight to hit and all this 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.199
 and as we are not clear about more or less 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.319
 how is it going to be very complicated can we 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.120
 do a decent combat here this would be 

00:00:55.319 --> 00:00:58.679
 a free training simply because 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.030
 we would do what we wanted but if 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.729
 click on the top where 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.559
 put training touches to start there 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.439
 would teach us the different 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.930
 movements attacks keys locks 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.820
 submission is all that it would be to be able 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 understand well how to use the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.770
 movements when making a 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 combat the first one that teaches us would be 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.939
 the movement that I think is the most 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.649
 important to know how to move to 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.689
 through the track and good in general 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.220
 it would teach us a little power all that 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.229
 we would need to know to be able to do 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.659
 a more or less decent fight and power 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.759
 really do away with the opponent who 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.759
 It is not as easy as it may seem 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.259
 I will not do everything that would be 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.030
 the tutorial because if not in the end the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.069
 video would not make much sense either 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.080
 what can you do when 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.700
 download , try it, I recommend 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200
 really you see all these 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.479
 movements because if you do not go to 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.770
 learn how to play 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.530
 well more things that we would find 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.420
 we could for example play 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.640
 multiplayer race we would have also 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.140
 the training from here and in part 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.750
 we would also have the option to create 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.090
 our own superstar own 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.390
 superstar we can put the body 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.890
 we integrate the height skin the hair 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.780
 we can practically do it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.600
 but well we're not going to mess with 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.220
 this where we fight as good as 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.530
 we would enter what would be the first 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.630
 combat we can do it from the game 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.220
 quick or we can give him to play and in this 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.350
 individual case 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.450
 and from here we will appear in the part 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.160
 below how I want to play 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.200
 I will put for example in what would be 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.650
 the cage that is a section that I like 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.300
 We will give you a choice in what would be 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.970
 the people that we want 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.170
 I can always sergio cambista and 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.810
 sliding we will choose our 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.340
 opponent now we would give event 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.290
 and then we turned it around 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.680
 let's give it to grau and we would give 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.680
 start 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.610
 with which it would start was all we see how 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.980
 is going down the cage inside of which 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.319
 we are going to fight and now they will start us 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.390
 put then a series of videos as 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.640
 that would be sponsoring the entrance of the 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.950
 two fighters the first series of 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.900
 batista that good will put the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.810
 video footage behind as if you can 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.880
 be really program and the next 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.620
 It would be a young man's but well 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 to pass it also and we already started with the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.670
 Fight 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.380
 well here we see that the left I'm 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.170
 I would be with cambric on the right 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.180
 conjugate and already to start fighting for 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.850
 start to give it as you have seen 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.250
 a little on the subject of assistant tutorial 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.190
 we have to click on the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.540
 opponent to go giving him and once 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.860
 that such floors also if we push 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.250
 we would kick him but there will be 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.400
 could give it and good maximum key in 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.890
 the theme of the keys to be able to avoid 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.330
 I have some arrows that 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.100
 indicate an exit to one of the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.500
 sides from top to bottom towards a 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.510
 side and if you're lucky and right then 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.940
 you can dodge it and make a counter 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.920
 technique in this case I give it to the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.850
 right and as you see you put one against 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.850
 lying technique 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.970
 and good in general the game is not that 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.970
 it's complicated but it has 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.340
 very many controls many types of 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.560
 combos and all this then acordate of 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.080
 everything is very complicated , his is that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.819
 shows the tutorial once and little to 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.409
 little then with practice because you will go 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.730
 remembering everything and now apart 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.769
 of three or four movements I do not 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.239
 I agree a lot and on top so that 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.979
 go out to the first one is very complicated 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:23.290
 on this side also in front you have 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.030
 opponent that is giving you there was a 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.160
 movement that was sliding with the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.169
 two fingers to one side is supposed to 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.600
 what he did will be dodge it and throw it 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.500
 to the side but there's no way it 's very 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.970
 complicated 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.969
 it seems to me that I have left a couple of 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.099
 times 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:39.019
 and little else this is what the game would be 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.910
 you see that at the graphics level it's very 

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:43.980
 It is very well managed the issue of 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:47.430
 are the wrestlers look pretty 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.290
 to those who would be the real ones and to me 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.880
 liked has the subject of controls 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.639
 that is a little bit has said a little 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.560
 complicated when cutting everything 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.840
 what like all the games is a bit 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.599
 get used to practice and in the end then 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:02.509
 it can be a very entertaining game like that 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:05.180
 that nothing this is the game of the wwf of 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.499
 this 2015 I hope you are liking 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.629
 I'm going to leave the rest of the fight in case 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.490

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.810

 You can download it for free 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.999
 I'll leave you for mediafire and also for

 medium so you can download it and 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:21.710
 install it would be the prod 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:23.060
 data over time so good if it has 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.069
