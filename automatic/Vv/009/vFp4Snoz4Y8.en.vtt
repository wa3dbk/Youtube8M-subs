hi I'm Kaylen and I'm going to show you
my<00:00:06.450> functional<00:00:07.020> vision<00:00:07.290> assessment<00:00:07.440> kit<00:00:09.019> the

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
my functional vision assessment kit the

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.640 
my functional vision assessment kit the
very<00:00:10.200> first<00:00:10.469> thing<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.769> have<00:00:10.980> is<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.849> light<00:00:12.650> it

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
very first thing I have is a light it

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.120 
very first thing I have is a light it
provides<00:00:14.219> natural<00:00:14.549> lighting<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.859> this<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:16.980> in

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
provides natural lighting and this is in

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.550 
provides natural lighting and this is in
case<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.609> working<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.720> an<00:00:18.869> area<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.260> doesn't

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
case I'm working in an area that doesn't

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.920 
case I'm working in an area that doesn't
have<00:00:19.680> very<00:00:19.830> good<00:00:20.220> lighting<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.820> don't<00:00:21.689> want<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
have very good lighting I don't want to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.170 
have very good lighting I don't want to
say<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.380> student<00:00:22.740> has<00:00:22.980> worst<00:00:23.760> vision

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
say that my student has worst vision

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.609 
say that my student has worst vision
than<00:00:24.330> they<00:00:24.420> really<00:00:24.689> do<00:00:24.840> just<00:00:25.140> because<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
than they really do just because of the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.690 
than they really do just because of the
lighting<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:30.679> have<00:00:31.700> different

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
lighting so I have that I have different

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.650 
lighting so I have that I have different
colored<00:00:33.149> cloths<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.870> put<00:00:34.170> materials<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.660> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
colored cloths to put materials on to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.090 
colored cloths to put materials on to
see<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> helps<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.500> students<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.950> see

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
see if that helps the students to see

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.779 
see if that helps the students to see
better<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.640> have<00:00:41.270> white<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:43.100> white<00:00:44.100> cloth<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.640> put

and I have a black cloth that can be put

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.200 
and I have a black cloth that can be put
down<00:00:57.330> and<00:00:57.840> both<00:00:58.650> of<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.220> be<00:00:59.250> washed<00:00:59.580> in

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
down and both of those can be washed in

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.509 
down and both of those can be washed in
between<00:01:00.600> students<00:01:01.640> and<00:01:03.890> then<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:04.920> also<00:01:05.190> have<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
between students and then I also have a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.570 
between students and then I also have a
black<00:01:05.850> rubber<00:01:06.810> mat<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.400> another

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
black rubber mat just for another

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.850 
black rubber mat just for another
texture<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.810> also<00:01:16.140> if<00:01:16.260> you're<00:01:16.410> working<00:01:16.560> with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
texture it's also if you're working with

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
texture it's also if you're working with
things<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.670> sliding<00:01:18.660> all<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:18.960> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
things that are sliding all over the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
things that are sliding all over the
place<00:01:19.410> it<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.619> gives<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.040> bit<00:01:20.340> more

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
place it just gives a little bit more

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:35.300 
place it just gives a little bit more
grip<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:24.510> I<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.750> all<00:01:24.990> those<00:01:25.520> here<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:35.040> next

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
grip so I have all those here the next

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
grip so I have all those here the next
thing<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.550> have<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.090> color<00:01:36.540> vision<00:01:36.840> testing

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
thing I have is color vision testing

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.880 
thing I have is color vision testing
made<00:01:38.009> easy<00:01:38.690> this<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:39.930> really<00:01:40.410> quick<00:01:40.649> easy

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
made easy this is a really quick easy

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.930 
made easy this is a really quick easy
way<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> test<00:01:41.820> color<00:01:42.780> vision<00:01:43.399> if<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.610> student

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
way to test color vision if the student

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.889 
way to test color vision if the student
can<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.539> shape<00:01:47.240> then<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.450> means<00:01:48.660> that

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
can see the shape then that means that

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.410 
can see the shape then that means that
they<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.410> see<00:01:49.560> those<00:01:49.710> colors<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.369> there's<00:01:51.360> a

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
they can see those colors and there's a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.270 
they can see those colors and there's a
whole<00:01:51.660> bunch<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.200> different<00:01:52.530> cards<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:53.070> here

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
whole bunch of different cards in here

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.359 
whole bunch of different cards in here
to<00:01:53.399> test<00:01:53.640> different<00:01:53.850> colors<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:55.039> they<00:01:56.039> show

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
to test different colors and they show

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
to test different colors and they show
you<00:01:56.430> what<00:01:56.580> you<00:01:56.700> shouldn't<00:01:57.090> see

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:15.820 

I<00:02:10.039> have<00:02:11.039> an<00:02:11.460> hltv<00:02:12.210> card<00:02:12.870> for<00:02:13.800> just<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.090> test

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I have an hltv card for just to test

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.550 
I have an hltv card for just to test
nearer<00:02:17.210> visual<00:02:18.210> acuity<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.160> I<00:02:20.160> also<00:02:20.400> have

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
nearer visual acuity and I also have

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.620 
nearer visual acuity and I also have
this<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:22.740> a<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.730> read<00:02:23.940> another<00:02:24.300> card

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
this is a just to read another card

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.620 
this is a just to read another card
that's<00:02:24.870> similar<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:26.010> uses<00:02:26.400> real<00:02:26.820> words<00:02:27.240> in

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
that's similar but it uses real words in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.320 
that's similar but it uses real words in
fonts<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.709> must<00:02:28.950> typically<00:02:29.670> find<00:02:29.940> in

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
fonts that you must typically find in

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:41.680 
fonts that you must typically find in
children's<00:02:30.900> books

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.610 

and<00:02:41.810> their<00:02:42.650> directions<00:02:43.870> on<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.050> back<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.440> both

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
and their directions on the back of both

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.830 
and their directions on the back of both
of<00:02:45.830> those<00:02:50.440> okay<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.550> also<00:02:52.790> have<00:02:53.210> a<00:02:53.240> couple<00:02:53.750> of

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
of those okay so I also have a couple of

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.780 
of those okay so I also have a couple of
balls<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:55.730> can<00:02:55.910> have<00:02:56.750> children<00:02:57.580> see<00:02:58.580> if<00:02:58.670> they

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
balls you can have children see if they

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.490 
balls you can have children see if they
can<00:02:58.970> catch<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.630> can<00:02:59.780> test<00:03:00.020> their<00:03:00.230> depth

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
can catch it you can test their depth

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.830 
can catch it you can test their depth
perception<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.340> way<00:03:01.550> it's<00:03:02.150> also<00:03:02.360> just<00:03:02.600> kind

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
perception that way it's also just kind

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
perception that way it's also just kind
of<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:03.020> fun<00:03:03.290> warm-up<00:03:04.280> activity<00:03:05.270> and<00:03:05.710> you<00:03:06.710> get<00:03:06.830> a

of a fun warm-up activity and you get a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.500 
of a fun warm-up activity and you get a
little<00:03:07.220> bit<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.400> my<00:03:07.580> d<00:03:07.640> of<00:03:07.910> their<00:03:08.060> motor<00:03:08.390> skills

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
little bit of my d of their motor skills

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.870 
little bit of my d of their motor skills
as<00:03:09.050> well<00:03:09.230> with<00:03:09.500> those<00:03:09.680> and<00:03:10.070> these<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.850> be

secondary<00:03:27.350> colors<00:03:33.190> there<00:03:34.190> are<00:03:34.220> lots<00:03:35.090> of<00:03:35.240> basic

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
secondary colors there are lots of basic

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.550 
secondary colors there are lots of basic
there's<00:03:36.260> basic<00:03:36.740> shapes<00:03:37.010> like<00:03:37.420> squares

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.530 

there's<00:03:42.560> triangles<00:03:44.590> circles<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.330> these<00:03:47.330> are

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
there's triangles circles and these are

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.560 
there's triangles circles and these are
good<00:03:47.780> size<00:03:48.110> even<00:03:48.890> small<00:03:49.370> children<00:03:49.610> can<00:03:49.850> pick

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
good size even small children can pick

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.960 
good size even small children can pick
them<00:03:50.750> up<00:03:50.900> and<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.900> then<00:03:54.110> there's<00:03:54.260> also<00:03:54.470> like<00:03:54.980> a

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
them up and and then there's also like a

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.550 
them up and and then there's also like a
flower<00:03:56.330> shape<00:03:57.250> stars<00:03:58.959> rectangles<00:03:59.959> ovals<00:04:00.380> and

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
flower shape stars rectangles ovals and

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.070 
flower shape stars rectangles ovals and
I<00:04:00.680> think<00:04:00.890> there's<00:04:01.040> some<00:04:01.190> charts<00:04:01.489> in<00:04:01.670> here<00:04:01.820> too

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
I think there's some charts in here too

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.220 
I think there's some charts in here too
so<00:04:03.080> these<00:04:03.530> can<00:04:03.770> be<00:04:03.860> used<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:05.720> sample<00:04:06.080> student

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
so these can be used the sample student

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.440 
so these can be used the sample student
can<00:04:06.470> identify<00:04:06.590> their<00:04:07.220> colors<00:04:07.580> identify

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
can identify their colors identify

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.759 
can identify their colors identify
shapes<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:10.370> test<00:04:10.640> for<00:04:11.090> if<00:04:11.900> you<00:04:12.080> have<00:04:12.260> them<00:04:12.410> on<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
shapes to test for if you have them on a

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.759 
shapes to test for if you have them on a
mat<00:04:13.090> to<00:04:14.090> test<00:04:14.330> for<00:04:14.540> over-and-under<00:04:15.110> reaching

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
mat to test for over-and-under reaching

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.090 
mat to test for over-and-under reaching
some<00:04:16.160> depth<00:04:16.400> perception<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:18.440> can<00:04:18.620> also<00:04:18.769> see

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
some depth perception you can also see

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.280 
some depth perception you can also see
if<00:04:19.250> students<00:04:19.640> can<00:04:19.790> match<00:04:20.000> shapes<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:22.640> colors

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.290 
if students can match shapes and colors

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.440 
if students can match shapes and colors
sorting<00:04:24.610> so<00:04:25.610> these<00:04:25.760> are<00:04:25.910> useful<00:04:26.060> for<00:04:26.270> a

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
sorting so these are useful for a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:32.950 
sorting so these are useful for a
variety<00:04:26.630> of<00:04:26.960> things<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:32.240> last<00:04:32.510> thing<00:04:32.840> I

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
variety of things and the last thing I

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.380 
variety of things and the last thing I
have<00:04:33.169> is<00:04:33.560> stuff<00:04:34.010> it's<00:04:34.430> just<00:04:34.610> sort<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.150> for

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
have is stuff it's just sort of for

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.800 
have is stuff it's just sort of for
myself<00:04:35.870> I<00:04:36.200> have<00:04:37.190> double<00:04:37.640> sided<00:04:37.880> tape<00:04:38.060> in<00:04:38.660> case
