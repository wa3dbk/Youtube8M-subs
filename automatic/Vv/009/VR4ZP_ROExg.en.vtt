 just to be four years old they are on 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.150
 the distance is 2700 meters from the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.250
 great track and to decrypt this 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.109
 race support of the fifth 5,5 that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.880

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.719
 all I leave you from the outset 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 proposed his selection in 8 for this 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.469
 event then i have place at the top of my 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.750
 selection number 10 bauloise at the fort 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.760
 in front of 11 bridget landemer the 12 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.010
 beautiful of happy the 15th black rosa 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.039
 France the 13 stepdaughter of guez 6 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.110
 botany the belinda ace of beaum and finally 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.329
 the 2 baiia of the rib go one enters everything from 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.579
 following in the heart of the subject and it evokes 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.110
 the one that should logically have rallied 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.399
 majority of the votes we have already seen at 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.719
 honor this winter at vincennes in 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.250
 many times she often told us 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.480
 typed in the eye if the number 10 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.620
 bauloise au fort yeah it's a mare 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.559
 in my opinion of high class 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.670
 she has not succeeded yet on the 2700 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 meters from the big track since it has 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.600
 been referred she was presented two 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.000
 time on that distance she was 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.380
 disqualified twice it's a mare 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.670
 of high quality she had to do 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.350
 crying the quilters at several 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.189
 times because she was all the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.170
 time crushed money 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.820
 there I find that she faces a lot to 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.860
 its reach everything will be a matter of 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 wisdom of course you have and decided 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.640
 to put in second position of your 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.280
 prognosis number 11 this is 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.600
 competing landemer bridget that was 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.700
 barefooted all four feet at his most 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.290
 recent release and as by chance that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.640
 tilts yes it 's tilted it's a 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.820
 mare that it's a little transformed the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.610
 iron removal 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.170
 she was a mean mare before 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.060
 she arrived in match boxes 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.470
 abrivard there is little i think she is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.830
 able to take an active part in 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.330
 the arrival 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.460
 with a hidden path she 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.290
 absolutely seems to me precisely arnaud 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.810
 lecomte one of our journalists from 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.900
 field of the agent what type to contact 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.490
 mathieu abrivard which is well evokes the 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.210
 chances of this famous bridget 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.200
 Landemer is the famous ground minute 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.300
 place he same course a world 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.570
 category nicely she will be again 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.979
 free of four for the occasion of 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.230
 conditions appears very well finally on 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.220
 does not have a big walk but on this 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.320
 she did her best to pick up 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.340
 a little excessive to do four 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.959
 feet salary to have it improved 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.700
 yeah yeah that's right what sprint 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.540
 much better and rhythm exchanges 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.640
 usually she is a little bit 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.920
 tractor like that so holding her 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.390
 has refused to refer the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.340
 improve it now that's why 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 that we have too much 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.650
 outside but if I get to the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.920
 preserve 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.540
 bah type in the right combination 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.820
 then behind bauloise at the fort and 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.130
 bridget landemer jérémy you decided to 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.989
 place the number 12 beautiful of happy 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.430
 talented but delicate 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.350
 we are very complicated especially 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.850
 moment of departure I think the 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.019
 nc scan harmonies does a lot of 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.410
 white hair with this early mare 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.030
 careers 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.880
 we often saw her galloping and 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
 make very interesting returns she 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.180
 was imposed on the 2700 meters of the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.739
 great track will be deferré 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.790
 later for the first time I 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.130
 think it's a mare that the 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.080
 déferrage sees a lot of advantage 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.000
 if she is wise of course she 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.030
 will be in the third m then you placed 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.860
 at the head of tea time prognosis of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 mare who are very talented obviously 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.410
 but which are complicated because that 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.900
 leave room if she showed herself 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.280
 possibly at fault to other mares 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.680
 from this county to make the arrival 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.790
 yeah of course it's fillies so 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920
 they are they are really 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.540
 inconstant but but very good I 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.370
 think blake rosa france on the 15th 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.630
 is not necessarily easy either 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.620
 a mare last time 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.180
 there was a lot of noise 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.230
 who were circulating about her she was 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.150
 faced lots of better quality 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.220
 so so why not and to go 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.110
 in the bravest I chose the 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.680
 hold belinda ace of dome and in the end 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.420
 combination 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.710
 she loved the friend adrien 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.390
 lately it was a pretty mare 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.680
 average when it evolves and shoe and 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.450
 there really real facts showed a 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.980
 any other face so there will be a 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.970
 nice odds and it's a very outsider 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.860
 fun so she's obviously 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.480
 able according to what you say to ride from 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.920
 brilliant category yes that's it she can 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.210
 mount category brilliantly more for 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.470
 fourth or fifth place but 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.400
 puts in good odds 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.620
 Thank you Jeremy for 7 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.180
