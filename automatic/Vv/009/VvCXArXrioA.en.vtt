00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.020
 no more 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.260
 hello f1latam car friends we 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.660
 we find today once again presenting 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.739
 a new model of the chevrolet brand in 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.110
 this case the new chevrolet cobalt 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.880
 version with a special version that 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.250
 brings the transmission as attractive 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.620
 automatic that was not in the 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.780
 previous versions and a version 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.020
 automatic very special because it is a 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 vehicle with a box of six changes 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.870
 forward which makes it much more 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.140
 Nice to drive is fun and with 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.930
 very high performance standards 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 in terms of both its performance 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:11.369
 dynamic as gasoline consumption and more 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 the sales are stable the market came 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.280
 falling until roughly last month 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.799
 started to fall in July of last year already 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.770
 we are seeing similar levels between 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.259
 the months of July August and September 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.390
 what we are seeing now let's say that 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.770
 we have a slightly more stable picture 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.560
 lower than we were 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.880
 accustomed and very in line with what 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 has been finding happening with the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.649
 economy an economy that will grow going 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.619
 to grow at levels of 4% and a half 4% and 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.509
 which is good growth but not a 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.659
 extraordinary growth the same happens 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.300
 with the vehicle market of our 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.539
 bile action at a high level below 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 of the best years in the history of 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.929
 Colombia 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.240
 now I invite you to hear ricardo osorio 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.550
 with all the technical explanation of this 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.460
 new model chevrolet cobalt 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.070
 many thanks, thank you very much for 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.100
 be here with us in cars f1latam 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:15.240
 my name Jorge MejÃ­a president of 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.240
 general motors colmotores 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.540
 hello f1latam car friends today we are 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.670
 in this new release the falcon cob 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.220
 new chevrolet with a transmission 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.120
 fantastic automatic that we are going to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.790
 teach to use at this time 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.340
 today we are in full release is a 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.659
 novelty let's start and admire all 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.819
 What's new in them? 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.489
 counting little by little we will go 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.409
 using in the cobalt chevrolet alone 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.120
 there was a manual version of five 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.610
 speeds this is an automatic of 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 six that has a management option 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.569
 sequential and that's where we're going to 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.610
 take advantage of the best way and we 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:57.040
 we installed mirrors well we are in 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.980
 position drive and there we will start to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.040
 driving we are in the facilities of 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.440
 the club the lizards in full 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.620
 release and novelty for you to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.220
 that they know him of first mark 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.400
 as a first response we will have the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.709
 104 horsepower engine with a lot of torque 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.799
 a very fast response 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.319
 the torque develops quickly and I 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:25.799
 I can have with a touch of the accelerator 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.420
 and an immediate response that the 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.970
 transmission torque converter 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.660
 it helps me a lot 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:36.590
 let's go through an area where 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.890
 a little traffic but taking advantage of that 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.930
 slightly irregular terrain let's feel 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.490
 that smoothness of the suspensions and what 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.180
 that has characterized the colon in all 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.490
 its versions 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.250
 the stiffness of the rigid body 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.440
 how quiet and comfortable the interior 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.150
 here we are going to simulate a part of 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.000
 driving 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.620
 on the daily traffic routes of 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.790
 our cities where the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.799
 automatic transmission makes the 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.459
 difference I forget the left pedal 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.709
 I will be very soft very rich and 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.650
 attending the road I do not have to do 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:10.840
 changes I'm in a condition where there 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.209
 stops starts and is extremely 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.340
 interesting to have a transmission 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.530
 automatic in a vehicle of this size 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.530
 we are in the lt version there are two 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.020
 ltz and lt versions a difference in 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.130
 equipment such as mirrors or 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:29.560
 abs brakes on LTZ version 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.419
 remains are very similar already starts 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.630
 from very good prices we have 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:37.300
 then here the condition and where is it going 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 advancing the transmission going through the 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.110
 changes very quickly to what I have 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.630
 asked in this release is good 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.410
 but an automatic transmission is 11 is 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.490
 slow and delayed changes everything 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.259
 otherwise have these transmissions 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.340
 agile live 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.650
 I am progressing the changes 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.960
 in third but if I turned around 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.979
 immediately to the previous change and we 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.630
 will be able to carry some speeds 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:04.850
 considerable, it is important that 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.949
 everyone knows that today's broadcasts 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.389
 they also have a sequential mode that 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.580
 is going to show you at this time 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:14.120
 we come to a final part here I'm going to 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.520
 make a comeback and just put the 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.180
 sequential mode what will be the mode 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.520
 sequentially it's going to be very simple 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.370
 I can do it on the fly I'm on try step 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.139
 sequential is just let me know in 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.479
 the board there is an indicator where I 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.060
 shows what march I'm going on is important 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.220
 know something and in m2 or what you want 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.229
 say manual in 2nd speed remember 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.200
 that has six automatic changes 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:42.110
 when I stop completely he passes 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.419
 first automatically that if it does not advance 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.479
 of the following changes of today second 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.789
 I press the third button I press the button 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.610
 fourth and I receive the changes very 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:54.860
 it quickly helps me to return them 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:56.630
 this for a road condition 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.420
 for a condition 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:02.090
 and I have to have the best of the engine 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.490
 pass a vehicle a truck in a 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:08.510
 pending is very important to use 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.340
 in clear sequential mode that requires 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.920
 of more attention to be much more 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.750
 attentive to engine revolutions to 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.060
 see what change today so for 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.560
 road is an important condition or 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.550
 the first second 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.550
 third 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:28.509
 it came to another one highlighted it stopped me I return 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.070
 to change and he speeds up a little bit 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.500
 engine for the change to enter the 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:34.600
 right moment with that there are not these 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.979
 vehicle movements simply 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.220
 I can do a quiet ride 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:42.310
 but I 'm the one driving the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.410
 changes not the computer of the of the 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.560
 transmission or the tsm that is called 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:49.720
 technically again here we go third 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.639
 and something that happened to me there I wanted to put 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.699
 third before the revolutions that 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:57.820
 they are the one on the board the indicator is going 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:59.470
 to twinkle a couple of times telling me not to 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.400
 we will be able to engage that change 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:04.030
 because it is not in the conditions 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.940
 appropriate then that's the way to 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:10.210
 feedback to the driver 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.580
 we advance second third and in any 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:15.610
 moment you can go back to drive and I'm 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.460
 in the simplest and quietest way 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.009
 of using 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.560
 automatic I invite all friends 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.850
 of cars that 1 can for a given 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.919
 back in the woods in those in the 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.460
 chevrolet dealers is the demo 

00:07:24.919 --> 00:07:30.710
 so they know him is a version 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.530
 limited from which it also differs 

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:35.539
 for the Colombia country brand that is in 

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.699
 the lateral achievements because it's a 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:39.910
 automatic proudly manufactured in 

00:07:37.699 --> 00:07:39.910
 colour
