00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
so here we are once again with my most

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990 
so here we are once again with my most
ambitious<00:00:07.080> project<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.770> date<00:00:07.979> I<00:00:08.280> will<00:00:08.879> show

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
ambitious project to date I will show

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.310 
ambitious project to date I will show
how<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.090> undo<00:00:09.450> the<00:00:09.600> burner<00:00:09.809> into<00:00:10.139> allies

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
how to undo the burner into allies

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.820 
how to undo the burner into allies
pointer<00:00:10.940> obviously<00:00:11.940> first<00:00:12.150> an<00:00:12.299> individual

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
pointer obviously first an individual

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.310 
pointer obviously first an individual
this<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> not<00:00:14.099> broken<00:00:14.339> what<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> had<00:00:15.020> came<00:00:16.020> at<00:00:16.139> my

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
this is not broken what I had came at my

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.409 
this is not broken what I had came at my
friend's<00:00:17.220> computer<00:00:19.369> it<00:00:20.369> reads<00:00:20.640> this<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.300> the

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:21.419 
friend's computer it reads this so the

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:23.859 
friend's computer it reads this so the
laser<00:00:21.570> works<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.529> doesn't<00:00:22.649> read<00:00:22.829> properly

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
laser works but it doesn't read properly

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.850 
laser works but it doesn't read properly
so<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:24.930> hoping<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.349> just<00:00:25.380> problem<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:25.860 
so I'm hoping it's just problem with the

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.370 
so I'm hoping it's just problem with the
motor<00:00:26.009> so<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.540> do<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.840> remove<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.259> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
motor so what one do is remove all the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.069 
motor so what one do is remove all the
screws<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.800> bottom<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.040> it<00:00:31.250> and<00:00:32.809> then<00:00:33.809> pop

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
screws on the bottom of it and then pop

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.520 
screws on the bottom of it and then pop
the<00:00:34.260> Baths<00:00:35.750> revealing<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> load<00:00:36.929> of<00:00:37.079> circuitry

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the Baths revealing a load of circuitry

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.139 
the Baths revealing a load of circuitry
and<00:00:37.769> complex<00:00:38.579> things<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:38.940> don't<00:00:39.000> understand

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
and complex things I don't understand

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.279 
and complex things I don't understand
now<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> next<00:00:42.420> thing<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> do<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.140> get

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
now the next thing we want to do is get

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.410 
now the next thing we want to do is get
this<00:00:43.379> front<00:00:43.620> plate<00:00:43.800> off<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.210> we<00:00:45.300> have

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
this front plate off to do that we have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
this front plate off to do that we have
to<00:00:45.539> open<00:00:45.749> the<00:00:45.809> drive<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.249> see<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.429> hole

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
to open the drive so you see little hole

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.310 
to open the drive so you see little hole
there<00:00:47.999> what<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:48.929> did

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
there what I did

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
there what I did
I<00:00:49.350> followed<00:00:49.769> a<00:00:49.829> paper<00:00:50.100> clip<00:00:50.249> well<00:00:50.789> unfold<00:00:51.059> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
I followed a paper clip well unfold a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.720 
I followed a paper clip well unfold a
paper<00:00:51.420> clip<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.769> shoved<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.159> hole<00:00:53.280> this

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
paper clip and shoved in the hole this

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.759 
paper clip and shoved in the hole this
activates<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> drives<00:00:54.690> quick<00:00:54.929> release<00:00:55.309> yep

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
activates the drives quick release yep

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.520 
activates the drives quick release yep
so<00:00:58.769> let's<00:00:58.980> go<00:00:59.190> on<00:00:59.690> the<00:01:00.690> front<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.140> pops<00:01:01.350> off

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
so let's go on the front then pops off

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.250 
so let's go on the front then pops off
you<00:01:01.679> push<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:01.979> from<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> month<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
you push it from the month and then that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.090 
you push it from the month and then that
bit<00:01:04.440> slides<00:01:04.650> out<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.760> from<00:01:06.690> there<00:01:06.990> top<00:01:07.860> four

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
bit slides out and from there top four

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.930 
bit slides out and from there top four
jobs<00:01:08.310> come<00:01:08.520> up

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.880 

there<00:01:15.940> we<00:01:16.000> go

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
there we go

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.860 
there we go
place<00:01:17.890> little<00:01:18.100> bit<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.370> effort<00:01:18.870> revealing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
place little bit of effort revealing

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.570 
place little bit of effort revealing
everything<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.500> me<00:01:20.680> and<00:01:20.830> here<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.280> can<00:01:21.400> see

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
everything to me and here you can see

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.100 
everything to me and here you can see
the<00:01:22.300> laser<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:24.010> is<00:01:24.160> the<00:01:24.220> bit<00:01:24.370> we<00:01:24.460> want<00:01:25.110> now

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
the laser this is the bit we want now

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.420 
the laser this is the bit we want now
all<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.590> assembly<00:01:26.860> is<00:01:26.920> holding<00:01:27.220> with<00:01:27.310> these

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
all the assembly is holding with these

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.490 
all the assembly is holding with these
little<00:01:27.610> rubber<00:01:27.760> thingies<00:01:28.510> and<00:01:28.780> some<00:01:29.290> ribbon

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
little rubber thingies and some ribbon

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.830 
little rubber thingies and some ribbon
cables<00:01:30.180> there's<00:01:31.180> a<00:01:31.270> little<00:01:31.480> rubber<00:01:31.600> things

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
cables there's a little rubber things

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.630 
cables there's a little rubber things
yeah<00:01:32.350> not<00:01:32.740> very<00:01:32.770> hard<00:01:33.040> there's<00:01:33.280> some<00:01:33.400> screws

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
yeah not very hard there's some screws

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.600 
yeah not very hard there's some screws
in<00:01:33.790> them<00:01:33.940> but<00:01:34.150> just<00:01:34.360> take<00:01:34.480> them<00:01:34.600> out<00:01:34.660> simple

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
in them but just take them out simple

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.760 
in them but just take them out simple
then<00:01:36.610> once<00:01:36.730> you<00:01:36.790> got<00:01:36.880> all<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.180> out<00:01:37.620> you<00:01:38.620> want

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
then once you got all that out you want

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.050 
then once you got all that out you want
to<00:01:38.830> remove<00:01:39.010> the<00:01:39.160> motor<00:01:39.310> there's<00:01:39.610> four<00:01:39.790> screws

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
to remove the motor there's four screws

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.240 
to remove the motor there's four screws
and<00:01:41.040> yeah

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
and yeah

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.520 
and yeah
have<00:01:42.550> a<00:01:42.610> listen<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:44.680> was<00:01:44.800> the<00:01:44.920> motor<00:01:49.229> then<00:01:50.229> you

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
have a listen it was the motor then you

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.630 
have a listen it was the motor then you
can<00:01:50.650> see<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.860> writing<00:01:51.100> on<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.250> right<00:01:51.400> thing

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
can see that writing on the right thing

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.130 
can see that writing on the right thing
not<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.390> drill<00:01:52.600> shape<00:01:52.810> thing<00:01:52.990> in<00:01:53.080> the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
not the drill shape thing in the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.100 
not the drill shape thing in the
background<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:55.270> what<00:01:55.390> I'll<00:01:55.540> do<00:01:55.660> is<00:01:55.690> remove<00:01:56.050> all

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
background so what I'll do is remove all

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.040 
background so what I'll do is remove all
the<00:01:56.410> little<00:01:56.500> screws<00:01:56.860> around<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.900> holding<00:01:58.900> in

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the little screws around the holding in

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.490 
the little screws around the holding in
the<00:01:59.950> wires<00:02:00.780> remove<00:02:01.780> all<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.110> screws<00:02:02.260> that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
the wires remove all the screws that

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.450 
the wires remove all the screws that
holding<00:02:02.830> around<00:02:03.160> the<00:02:03.460> wires<00:02:05.310> melt<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.340> bit

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
holding around the wires melt a bit

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.980 
holding around the wires melt a bit
comes<00:02:06.700> up<00:02:06.850> then<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.180> wires<00:02:07.330> are<00:02:07.479> free<00:02:07.630> which

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
comes up then the wires are free which

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.020 
comes up then the wires are free which
then<00:02:08.170> releases<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.560> rails<00:02:11.070> yeah

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:28.160 

now<00:02:15.600> we<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.140> laser<00:02:16.320> assembly<00:02:27.020> so<00:02:28.020> I'd

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
now we have the laser assembly so I'd

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.380 
now we have the laser assembly so I'd
take<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> little<00:02:28.560> screwdriver<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.310> undo<00:02:30.240> all

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
take a little screwdriver and undo all

compartment or nothing a bit perfect my

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.930 
compartment or nothing a bit perfect my
switch<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:23.220> had<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.340> push<00:05:23.520> button<00:05:23.729> switch

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
switch and it had a push button switch

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.059 
switch and it had a push button switch
at<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.479> bottom<00:05:24.660> in<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:24.810> first<00:05:24.990> place<00:05:25.169> that's

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
at the bottom in the first place that's

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:32.059 
at the bottom in the first place that's
even<00:05:26.370> better

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:32.069 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.459 

so<00:05:32.430> it<00:05:32.490> comes<00:05:32.669> back<00:05:32.969> and<00:05:33.300> reveals<00:05:34.050> lots<00:05:34.349> of

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
so it comes back and reveals lots of

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.980 
so it comes back and reveals lots of
space<00:05:34.710> me<00:05:35.069> to<00:05:35.219> put<00:05:35.369> my<00:05:35.460> stuff<00:05:35.639> in<00:05:37.309> there<00:05:38.309> we<00:05:38.430> go

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 
space me to put my stuff in there we go

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.209 
space me to put my stuff in there we go
now<00:05:39.990> here's<00:05:40.139> the<00:05:40.229> circuit<00:05:40.619> to<00:05:40.800> the<00:05:40.919> black

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
now here's the circuit to the black

batteries<00:05:41.610> lead<00:05:41.819> to<00:05:41.879> the<00:05:41.969> safety<00:05:42.180> switch<00:05:42.360> and

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
batteries lead to the safety switch and

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:44.719 
batteries lead to the safety switch and
then<00:05:43.439> to<00:05:43.619> the<00:05:43.710> push<00:05:43.860> button<00:05:44.129> switch<00:05:44.339> got<00:05:44.610> that

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
then to the push button switch got that

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.369 
then to the push button switch got that
one<00:05:44.819> coming<00:05:45.180> on<00:05:45.300> when<00:05:45.539> I<00:05:45.569> don't<00:05:45.779> lead<00:05:46.169> them<00:05:46.289> to

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
one coming on when I don't lead them to

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.450 
one coming on when I don't lead them to
the<00:05:46.439> laser<00:05:46.589> diode<00:05:46.830> now<00:05:49.129> surprisingly<00:05:50.129> this<00:05:50.339> is

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
the laser diode now surprisingly this is

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.730 
the laser diode now surprisingly this is
just<00:05:50.610> an<00:05:50.699> LED<00:05:51.089> and<00:05:51.300> a<00:05:51.389> reflector<00:05:51.809> I<00:05:52.020> thought<00:05:52.680> it

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
just an LED and a reflector I thought it

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.989 
just an LED and a reflector I thought it
would<00:05:52.830> be<00:05:52.889> a<00:05:52.919> bulb<00:05:53.159> of<00:05:53.309> some<00:05:53.490> sort<00:05:53.729> and<00:05:53.939> this

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:53.999 
would be a bulb of some sort and this

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.459 
would be a bulb of some sort and this
torch<00:05:54.240> but<00:05:54.659> no<00:05:55.879> so<00:05:56.879> take<00:05:57.119> it<00:05:57.270> out<00:05:57.360> there<00:05:58.080> we<00:05:58.139> go

00:05:58.459 --> 00:05:58.469 
torch but no so take it out there we go

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:00.200 
torch but no so take it out there we go
why<00:05:58.860> did<00:05:59.069> I<00:05:59.099> cut<00:05:59.369> the<00:05:59.460> pins<00:05:59.639> off<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.909> LED

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
why did I cut the pins off the LED

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.579 
why did I cut the pins off the LED
earlier<00:06:02.479> then<00:06:03.479> I'm<00:06:03.599> going<00:06:03.719> to<00:06:03.749> attach<00:06:03.839> them<00:06:04.169> to

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:04.589 
earlier then I'm going to attach them to

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:06.739 
earlier then I'm going to attach them to
the<00:06:04.710> diode<00:06:05.039> just<00:06:05.399> to<00:06:05.490> make<00:06:05.610> it<00:06:05.699> easier<00:06:05.939> there

00:06:06.739 --> 00:06:06.749 
the diode just to make it easier there

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:11.510 
the diode just to make it easier there
we<00:06:06.809> go<00:06:06.990> i<00:06:07.610> soldered<00:06:08.610> it<00:06:09.300> they're<00:06:10.159> not<00:06:11.159> solder

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
we go i soldered it they're not solder

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.869 
we go i soldered it they're not solder
solder<00:06:12.149> and<00:06:13.110> then<00:06:13.229> glued<00:06:13.559> the<00:06:14.339> lens<00:06:14.610> into

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:14.879 
solder and then glued the lens into

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:18.679 
solder and then glued the lens into
there<00:06:16.639> just<00:06:17.639> so<00:06:17.759> it's<00:06:17.849> got<00:06:17.969> a<00:06:17.999> nice<00:06:18.149> face<00:06:18.389> I'd

00:06:18.679 --> 00:06:18.689 
there just so it's got a nice face I'd

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:22.249 
there just so it's got a nice face I'd
be<00:06:18.809> like<00:06:18.930> do<00:06:19.199> you<00:06:19.289> think<00:06:20.839> here<00:06:21.839> you<00:06:21.960> can<00:06:22.110> see

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
be like do you think here you can see

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:26.839 
be like do you think here you can see
how<00:06:22.409> I<00:06:22.439> put<00:06:22.620> switch<00:06:22.860> in<00:06:24.979> here<00:06:25.979> we<00:06:26.069> go<00:06:26.219> now<00:06:26.759> this

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:26.849 
how I put switch in here we go now this

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:28.100 
how I put switch in here we go now this
is<00:06:26.969> the<00:06:27.029> push-button<00:06:27.240> switch<00:06:27.659> which<00:06:27.930> leads

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
is the push-button switch which leads

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.070 
is the push-button switch which leads
straight<00:06:28.439> the<00:06:28.830> safety<00:06:29.159> switch<00:06:29.869> which<00:06:30.869> then

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
straight the safety switch which then

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.260 
straight the safety switch which then
leads<00:06:31.349> into<00:06:31.559> the<00:06:31.919> node<00:06:32.189> then<00:06:32.939> to<00:06:33.029> the<00:06:33.119> power

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
leads into the node then to the power
