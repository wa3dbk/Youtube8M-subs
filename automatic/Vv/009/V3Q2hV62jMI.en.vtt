00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:16.849 
we did earlier and we'll probably do

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.450 
we did earlier and we'll probably do
assault<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:17.450> engineer<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:18.619> expect<00:00:19.010> very<00:00:19.189> very

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
assault and engineer so expect very very

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.240 
assault and engineer so expect very very
soon<00:00:20.050> instead<00:00:21.050> of<00:00:21.079> that<00:00:21.290> class<00:00:21.770> comparison

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
soon instead of that class comparison

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.069 
soon instead of that class comparison
that<00:00:22.310> people<00:00:22.849> voted<00:00:23.180> up<00:00:23.300> before<00:00:23.599> and<00:00:23.960> I

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
that people voted up before and I

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.409 
that people voted up before and I
channel<00:00:24.470> we're<00:00:24.829> thinking<00:00:25.130> that<00:00:25.160> this<00:00:26.060> is<00:00:26.119> more

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
channel we're thinking that this is more

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.710 
channel we're thinking that this is more
reasonable<00:00:26.630> because<00:00:27.820> personally<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:29.270> think

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
reasonable because personally we think

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.880 
reasonable because personally we think
that<00:00:30.669> it<00:00:31.669> can't<00:00:31.849> be<00:00:32.000> counter<00:00:32.739> weapons<00:00:33.739> which

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
that it can't be counter weapons which

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.940 
that it can't be counter weapons which
certain<00:00:34.309> over<00:00:35.000> weapon<00:00:35.450> yeah<00:00:35.720> this<00:00:36.380> is<00:00:36.470> do<00:00:36.680> it's

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
certain over weapon yeah this is do it's

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.320 
certain over weapon yeah this is do it's
really<00:00:37.190> up<00:00:37.280> to<00:00:37.460> you<00:00:37.580> and<00:00:37.730> how<00:00:37.850> you<00:00:37.910> pave<00:00:38.300> your

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330

squad but anyway let's continue firstly
this<00:00:41.720> video's<00:00:42.200> can<00:00:42.380> be<00:00:42.470> sped<00:00:42.740> up<00:00:42.770> a<00:00:42.950> lot

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
this video's can be sped up a lot

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.670 
this video's can be sped up a lot
because<00:00:43.790> it's<00:00:44.000> really<00:00:44.180> long<00:00:44.420> game<00:00:44.690> it<00:00:45.560> was

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
because it's really long game it was

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.710 
because it's really long game it was
about<00:00:45.830> 20<00:00:46.190> minutes<00:00:46.370> not<00:00:46.670> to<00:00:46.760> cut<00:00:46.940> bit<00:00:47.330> of<00:00:47.450> start

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
about 20 minutes not to cut bit of start

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.620 
about 20 minutes not to cut bit of start
an<00:00:47.900> end<00:00:48.050> because<00:00:48.230> there's<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.650> bit<00:00:48.800> boring<00:00:49.040> but

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
an end because there's a bit boring but

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.490 
an end because there's a bit boring but

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
more often than those so way we tend to

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.940 
more often than those so way we tend to
pay<00:01:43.160> the<00:01:43.220> medic<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:43.850> we<00:01:44.390> don't<00:01:44.570> really<00:01:44.950> stick

to one strategy every time because it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.919 
to one strategy every time because it
really<00:01:48.500> depends<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.160> situation<00:01:49.539> this<00:01:50.539> game<00:01:50.780> is

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
think about the medic range SPECT one

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.779 
think about the medic range SPECT one
where<00:05:12.889> expansive<00:05:13.550> range<00:05:13.729> of<00:05:13.939> healing<00:05:14.659> and

where expansive range of healing and

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.610 
where expansive range of healing and
don't<00:05:16.789> really<00:05:17.060> use<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.270> because<00:05:17.599> Magnum<00:05:18.469> ammo

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
don't really use it because Magnum ammo

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.550 
don't really use it because Magnum ammo
is<00:05:18.800> pretty<00:05:19.039> crucial<00:05:19.550> because<00:05:20.199> medic<00:05:21.199> stolid

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
is pretty crucial because medic stolid

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.290 
is pretty crucial because medic stolid
defend<00:05:21.830> themselves<00:05:22.189> so<00:05:22.520> you<00:05:22.580> can't<00:05:22.819> just<00:05:22.879> be<00:05:23.150> a

medic and grove and healing the LMGs are

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:33.639 
just tend to stick to my squad and just
like<00:06:31.339> a<00:06:31.399> revive<00:06:31.969> them<00:06:32.269> yeah<00:06:33.079> more<00:06:33.319> but<00:06:33.559> you

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:33.649 
like a revive them yeah more but you

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.559 
like a revive them yeah more but you
should<00:06:33.679> generally<00:06:34.189> just<00:06:34.399> assess<00:06:35.299> a<00:06:35.329> situation

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
should generally just assess a situation

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.859 
should generally just assess a situation
first<00:06:36.289> so<00:06:36.679> if<00:06:37.039> it's<00:06:37.279> too<00:06:37.579> much<00:06:37.610> gunfire<00:06:38.179> tanks

00:06:38.859 --> 00:06:38.869 
first so if it's too much gunfire tanks

00:06:38.869 --> 00:06:41.469 
first so if it's too much gunfire tanks
everywhere<00:06:39.399> why<00:06:40.399> sure<00:06:40.610> you<00:06:40.729> will<00:06:40.909> now<00:06:41.059> because

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
everywhere why sure you will now because

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:45.279 
everywhere why sure you will now because
it's<00:06:42.079> too<00:06:42.349> dangerous<00:06:42.559> you<00:06:43.279> should<00:06:44.289> because

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:45.289 
it's too dangerous you should because

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:46.779 
it's too dangerous you should because
the<00:06:45.409> medics<00:06:45.709> probably<00:06:46.189> want<00:06:46.309> to<00:06:46.369> crucial

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
the medics probably want to crucial

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:50.289 
the medics probably want to crucial
things<00:06:47.029> but<00:06:47.389> in<00:06:47.719> a<00:06:48.289> squad<00:06:48.619> really<00:06:49.069> the<00:06:49.610> medic

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:50.299 
things but in a squad really the medic

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:54.399 
things but in a squad really the medic
could<00:06:50.449> be<00:06:50.539> the<00:06:50.659> viroid<00:06:52.839> because<00:06:53.839> the<00:06:54.229> many

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:54.409 
could be the viroid because the many

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:56.709 
could be the viroid because the many
published<00:06:54.889> on<00:06:55.039> rush<00:06:55.369> because<00:06:55.669> of<00:06:55.909> the<00:06:56.089> running

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:56.719

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
good gun what of the finger it was in

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.040 
good gun what of the finger it was in
the<00:07:01.069> patch<00:07:01.249> is<00:07:01.279> you<00:07:02.089> can't<00:07:02.300> run<00:07:02.479> run<00:07:02.749> really

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
the patch is you can't run run really

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.180 
the patch is you can't run run really
because<00:07:03.259> uh<00:07:03.289> because<00:07:04.300> Anaka<00:07:05.300> see<00:07:05.599> problem

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:07.190 
because uh because Anaka see problem

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:10.839 
because uh because Anaka see problem

00:07:10.839 --> 00:07:10.849 
so it's more of a drop and shoot

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.589 
so it's more of a drop and shoot
and<00:07:11.800> definitely<00:07:12.800> not<00:07:13.009> like<00:07:13.240> the<00:07:14.240> bunny<00:07:14.419> hop
