00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:07.470
 hello, today we attend 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.690
 the exhibition Arsenal 2013 and one of the stands 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.090
 I caught and caught my eyes 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.980
 interesting knives 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.640
 andy who looks at the channel textures. 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.970
 frontalka special here and I have 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.800
 some under the relationship 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.920
 This situation is presented here. 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.670
 let's say already 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.910
 quite hell let's frontalka that is it 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.450
 we can say that in Kostanay 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.450
 then we 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.200
 3000 details, respectively, also 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.110
 it's like 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.270
 practically non civic 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.760
 and what's interesting about these knives in knives is 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.290
 their processing quality is well by 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.840
 at least at first sight 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.880
 eyes don't throw no shoals all 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.950
 made keeping neat 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.450
 forms of course some will be familiar 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:00.310
 at least those who are familiar with 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.870
 microtek creativity why 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.730
 and while there is some variety 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.680
 Blades, that is, like here such 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.720
 aggressive interesting there then asked 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.700
 me 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.469
 so let's say 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.980
 such here beat over that is the shape of the blade 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.810
 bayonet and 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.390
 there is also no longer possible with us here 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.870
 we just have a group here 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.580
 also here is such an interesting 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 what catches your eye first 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.880
 interesting knife thickness 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.110
 that is, here we have the thickness when it goes 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.770
 about 3 bedrooms 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.770
 there is also 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.260
 double-edged blades that is, it is already 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.030
 dagger and unlike the same 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.650
 makro since they have no such reparations 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.390
 which honestly annoys some 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.490
 at least 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.060
 The score is very smooth and neat 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.009
 if such an interesting cry 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.930
 there is already some kind of coverage 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.409
 that she is a public blade thickness 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.409
 whip 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.910
 Little 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.470
 we have become the principle here except 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.470
 powders here to them up to 2 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.830
 here we have 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.020
 this is the result well and accordingly 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 values ​​150 to sochi 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.650
 but I can say at least 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.110
 this is comparable to what my critics are worth 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.450
 and if we had a choice 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.970
 between mine 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 motorcycle and anything like that i would 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.750
 very likely to take hair 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.030
 just something like that since 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.739
 purely in terms of aesthetics 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.379
 there is simply nothing superfluous 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.920
 generally attracted there are no 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.930
 catchy logos 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.160
 there is no clip that basically is 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.800
 some disadvantage 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.319
 on the other hand what is awesome here 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.510
 practically no backlash 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.010
 least i really appreciate and if 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.840
 compared with the same culture Tecom 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.080
 then we can say that it is practically 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.310
 Fix the least fond of the knife which have 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.330
 I have and wiped the rantals 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.950
 labor there is absolutely minimal but here 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.959
 he has a feeling that even less with 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.990
 such a serious enough wizard. 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.580
 so well 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:11.850
 I believe that the knives are surrounded by attention and 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:14.510
 who are interested to find them on the site 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.500
 intense to the point ru here 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.430
 Titov workshop 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.430
 Here is such a review
