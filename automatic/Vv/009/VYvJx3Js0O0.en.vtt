00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.619
 page called jogging dotcom 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.960

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.810
 description and once being here in the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:31.009
 dotcom page we are going to 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.550
 fifa we are not going to players we are going to have 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.989
 editors to create the letter or tab I do not know 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.940
 what do you call them for the same purpose 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.270
 that now good if it's a letter 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.280
 we practically wait for it to load and 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.650
 here we will leave the main one that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.530
 would be the table and after here 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.270
 they can change the player directly 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.220
 we talk like here 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 Christian ronaldo and change directly 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.720
 by physics in round or we can 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.790
 change it directly part by part 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.170
 here you communicate let's say we remove the 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.850
 meat if we put falcao for saying something 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.360
 we can put in either of the two 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.880
 markets is let 's say it 's here after you 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.350
 we can change the shield and we can 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.150
 put 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.030
 what can he be 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 to say something 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.140
 the children valley 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
 then it is becoming and by 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.880
 say something I bought him a nationality him 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.040
 we put costa rica if it's easy and we're going 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.170
 thus creating our own plate what 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.520
 better that has this is that good 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 we can summarize here the image if 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.190
 we want the associated signal you can 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.830
 put the type of letter the one of legend 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.090
 that leaves for xbox only for what 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.820
 I would fight 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.980
 all these players of the tengue efe that 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.860

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.960

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.079
 there is also blue with red and good 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.239
 pretty well you can change the 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:11.880
 level and mÃ¡laga I can not put that 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.770
 missing level 99 and that his name 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.980
 logically it is not messi how to put 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 Falcao or I can even change the 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.129
 name as in the black 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.519

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.519
 column 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:32.880
 I can change the goalie so it's easy 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.400
 you can stay for brito even 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.190
 you can upload your image or the image of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 'and here you can change the 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.950
 statistics also directly by 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.180

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:47.610
 12 pass equal to who shot I can 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.569
 uploading this will not affect anything and then 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.569
 do not
