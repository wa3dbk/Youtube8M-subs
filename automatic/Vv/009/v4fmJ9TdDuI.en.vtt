00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.750
 What will happen to my bills after 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.809
 April how much will I pay we throw a little 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.370
 light let's start at the beginning the 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.290
 main problem is that the energy 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.339
 electrical can not be stored in 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.130
 large quantities 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.579
 you have to produce exactly and in time 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.309
 Real the light that the market needs 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:27.070
 exactly but how do you calculate how much 

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.719
 is needed at every moment in function 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.610
 who is willing to produce the 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.010
 energy that the system needs in that 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.710
 time the price will be cheaper or more 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.890
 expensive in this way you will have a price 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.300
 different for each hour in your energy 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.519
 this is how you will buy your energy 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.710
 from April as if you were buying in the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.800
 bag as do the big companies 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.829
 and that would be great if you could consume 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.899
 in the cheapest hours but be careful 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.819
 counter is not so smart as to 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.960
 know how much energy is consumed each 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.179
 hour 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.179
 then how will you know how much you have to 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.429
 pay for your energy you need another 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:04.930
 counter that is called counter 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.600
 telemanagement 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.030
 even if they changed it recently and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.000
 they installed a digital counter can 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.710
 be that this is not telemanagement if the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.720
 that you have was not prepared as 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.060
 us for all these changes by 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.000
 part of the government will need some 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.550
 modification 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.260
 and when it arrived then the only thing 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.260
 we can tell you so far is that 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.700
 today by law in 2018 all the 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.340
 new counters must be 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.190
 working and meanwhile how I 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.960
 they bought in the meantime the government has 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.450
 decided that profiles will be applied 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
 standard to transform the reading of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.520
 counter less ready in a reading of 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.860
 counter ready monthly prices for 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.470
 each rate that you will know at the end of 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.810
 each month 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.730
 this decision makes everything that you 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.070
 we just told is not valid until 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.170
 have an intelligent meter and the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.409
 distributors can read it in a way 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.539
 smart 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.609
 here we leave you more information about 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.749
 how the sector works and how do you 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.749
 will affect these changes
