00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's a fully automatic mob drowning trap
and<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:28.019> similar<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.439> design<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.250> that

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
and it's very similar to design of that

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.479 
and it's very similar to design of that
of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> mob<00:00:30.570> grinder<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.070> also<00:00:32.250> very

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
of the mob grinder but it's also very

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.590 
of the mob grinder but it's also very
different<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:32.850> well<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.149> we're<00:00:33.270> gonna<00:00:33.360> head<00:00:33.570> on

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
different as well so we're gonna head on

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.090 
different as well so we're gonna head on
over<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.590> gonna<00:00:34.710> tell<00:00:34.860> you<00:00:34.890> guys

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
exactly how it works so that room at the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.010 
exactly how it works so that room at the
way<00:00:37.950> top<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.610> is<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> mob<00:00:39.149> spawning<00:00:39.480> room<00:00:39.719> so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
way top that is the mob spawning room so

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.600 
way top that is the mob spawning room so
there<00:00:40.260> are<00:00:40.320> four<00:00:40.559> platforms<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.309> room

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
there are four platforms in this room

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.270 
there are four platforms in this room
one<00:00:41.820> at<00:00:41.940> each<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> four<00:00:42.870> corners<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.469> on

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
one at each of the four corners and on

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.680 
one at each of the four corners and on
these<00:00:44.489> platforms<00:00:45.000> that's<00:00:45.180> where<00:00:45.360> mobs<00:00:45.510> are

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
these platforms that's where mobs are

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450 
these platforms that's where mobs are
gonna<00:00:45.809> spawn<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.469> between<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.980> platforms

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
gonna spawn and in between the platforms

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
gonna spawn and in between the platforms
there<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.730> four<00:00:47.940> streams<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> water<00:00:48.539> or

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
there are four streams of water or

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.560 
there are four streams of water or
canals<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> water<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.670> lead<00:00:50.969> towards

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
canals of water that all lead towards

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.510 
canals of water that all lead towards
the<00:00:51.629> middle<00:00:52.050> room<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> long-stem<00:00:53.250> over

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the middle room that long-stem over

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.299 
the middle room that long-stem over
there<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> chute<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.440> basically

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
there which is the chute and basically

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.529 
there which is the chute and basically
how<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.640> work<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.059> mobs<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.449> gonna

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
how it's gonna work is mobs are gonna

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750 
how it's gonna work is mobs are gonna
spawn<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> room<00:00:58.320> or<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.070> platforms

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
spawn in the room or on the platforms

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.040 
spawn in the room or on the platforms
and<00:00:59.850> then<00:01:00.059> they're<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.270> walk<00:01:00.629> around<00:01:00.809> all

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
and then they're gonna walk around all

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.280 
and then they're gonna walk around all
dumb<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.800> oh<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:03.210> they're<00:01:03.899> gonna<00:01:04.019> end<00:01:04.170> up

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
land in this secondary source of water

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
land in this secondary source of water
and<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.790> cool<00:01:17.970> thing<00:01:18.090> about<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and the cool thing about this is it's a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.530 
and the cool thing about this is it's a
lot<00:01:19.380> different<00:01:19.680> because<00:01:20.340> normally<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.360> mob

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
lot different because normally in a mob

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.359 
lot different because normally in a mob
grinder<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.140> would<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:22.710> wait<00:01:23.220> for

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
grinder you would have to just wait for

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.399 
grinder you would have to just wait for
the<00:01:23.490> mops<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> fall<00:01:24.000> onto<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> hard<00:01:24.930> surface

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the mops to fall onto the hard surface

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
the mops to fall onto the hard surface
like<00:01:25.439> hearts<00:01:25.830> brick<00:01:26.610> stone<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:26.970> cobblestone

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
like hearts brick stone or cobblestone

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
like hearts brick stone or cobblestone
and<00:01:27.900> you'd<00:01:27.990> hear<00:01:28.110> that<00:01:28.350> sound<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:29.520> you'd

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
and you'd hear that sound and then you'd

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.640 
and you'd hear that sound and then you'd
have<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.880> walk<00:01:30.060> over<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.200> collect<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
have to walk over and go collect the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
have to walk over and go collect the
loot<00:01:31.799> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.430> risk<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.939> actually<00:01:33.270> getting<00:01:33.479> hit

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
loot at the risk of actually getting hit

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
loot at the risk of actually getting hit
by<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.320> bunch<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.280> random<00:01:35.850> falling<00:01:36.030> mobs<00:01:36.360> from

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
by a bunch of random falling mobs from

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.770 
by a bunch of random falling mobs from
the<00:01:36.720> sky<00:01:37.579> but<00:01:38.579> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> completely

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.690 
the sky but this is a completely
risk-free<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.979> I'm<00:01:41.130> gonna<00:01:41.250> show<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.520> guys

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
risk-free and I'm gonna show you guys

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
risk-free and I'm gonna show you guys
how<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> works<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.450> mobs<00:01:43.049> like<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.500> said<00:01:43.710> are

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
how it works so mobs like I said are

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.170 
how it works so mobs like I said are
gonna<00:01:43.890> land<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> secondary<00:01:44.970> source

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
gonna land here in the secondary source

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
gonna land here in the secondary source
of<00:01:45.420> water<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:46.470> they're<00:01:46.740> gonna<00:01:46.860> drown<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
of water and they're gonna drown and the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
of water and they're gonna drown and the
reason<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:49.049> mobs<00:01:49.290> think<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
reason for that is the mobs think that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.460 
reason for that is the mobs think that
they<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> swim<00:01:50.909> upwards<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.479> over<00:01:52.229> here

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
they can swim upwards because over here

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.429 
they can swim upwards because over here
on<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> bottom<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.720> source<00:01:54.720> blocks<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.200> water

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
on the bottom is source blocks of water

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.249 
on the bottom is source blocks of water
and<00:01:55.710> whenever<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.579> mob<00:01:56.850> sees<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.659> source<00:01:57.930> block

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
and whenever a mob sees a source block

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.959 
and whenever a mob sees a source block
of<00:01:58.530> water<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.100> thinks<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.729> swim

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of water it thinks that it can swim

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.660 
of water it thinks that it can swim
upwards<00:02:00.450> and<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.740> gonna<00:02:01.860> continue<00:02:02.130> trying

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
upwards and it's gonna continue trying

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.670 
upwards and it's gonna continue trying
to<00:02:02.729> swim<00:02:02.939> upwards<00:02:03.450> even<00:02:03.630> though<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.469> block

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to swim upwards even though the block

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.499 
to swim upwards even though the block
above<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.310> water<00:02:05.579> which<00:02:05.909> will<00:02:06.119> drown<00:02:06.329> them

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
above it is water which will drown them

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
above it is water which will drown them
up<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.930> that's<00:02:07.140> why<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.799> mobs<00:02:08.069> are<00:02:08.190> not<00:02:08.340> gonna

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
up so that's why the mobs are not gonna

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.949 
up so that's why the mobs are not gonna
fall<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> reason<00:02:09.330> why<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.690> water

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
fall down and the reason why the water

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.660 
fall down and the reason why the water
is<00:02:10.110> floating<00:02:10.709> like<00:02:10.860> in<00:02:11.009> midair

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is floating like in midair

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.309 
is floating like in midair
cuz<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.880> use<00:02:12.060> signs<00:02:12.420> here<00:02:12.780> on<00:02:12.930> each<00:02:13.110> of<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
cuz I use signs here on each of the

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.830 
cuz I use signs here on each of the
corners<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.890> make<00:02:13.920> sure<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.240> water

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
corners to make sure that the the water

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.170 
corners to make sure that the the water
doesn't<00:02:16.170> flow<00:02:16.380> downwards<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.280> mobs<00:02:17.940> are<00:02:18.090> gonna

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
doesn't flow downwards so mobs are gonna

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.670 
doesn't flow downwards so mobs are gonna
continue<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.750> drown<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.230> in<00:02:19.349> fact<00:02:19.500> we're

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
continue to drown and in fact we're

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.990 
continue to drown and in fact we're
gonna<00:02:19.739> watch<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.130> zombie<00:02:20.459> right<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:20.760> drown

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
gonna watch the zombie right here drown

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
gonna watch the zombie right here drown
he's<00:02:21.209> drowning<00:02:21.690> he's<00:02:22.530> dying<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.190> think

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
he's drowning he's dying and I think

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.740 
he's drowning he's dying and I think
it's<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> lot<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.760> fun<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> lot<00:02:24.239> of<00:02:24.480> fun<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.720> just

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
it's a lot of fun a lot of fun to just

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.839 
it's a lot of fun a lot of fun to just
watch<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.319> zombies<00:02:25.680> or<00:02:25.890> mobs<00:02:26.099> drown<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.760> you

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
watch the zombies or mobs drown as you

watch the zombies or mobs drown as you
can<00:02:26.940> see<00:02:27.150> his<00:02:27.390> loot<00:02:27.750> whatever<00:02:28.170> they<00:02:28.319> drop<00:02:28.620> it's

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
can see his loot whatever they drop it's

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.130 
can see his loot whatever they drop it's
kind<00:02:29.580> of<00:02:29.640> come<00:02:29.880> down<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.300> little<00:02:30.600> canal<00:02:30.959> or

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
kind of come down this little canal or

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.080 
kind of come down this little canal or
stream<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.590> water<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.520> stream<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:32.880> gonna

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
stream of water and the stream is gonna

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.050 
stream of water and the stream is gonna
push<00:02:33.270> it<00:02:33.450> right<00:02:33.750> over<00:02:34.140> here<00:02:34.430> onto<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.790> little

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
push it right over here onto this little

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
push it right over here onto this little
platform<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:37.110> glowstone<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.860> then<00:02:38.430> it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
platform of glowstone and then it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.190 
platform of glowstone and then it's
fully<00:02:38.850> automatic<00:02:39.180> because<00:02:39.569> if<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.840> wanted

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
fully automatic because if you wanted

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.900 
fully automatic because if you wanted
you<00:02:40.500> could<00:02:40.650> maybe<00:02:40.860> say<00:02:41.130> go<00:02:41.280> eat<00:02:41.459> dinner<00:02:41.610> leave

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
you could maybe say go eat dinner leave

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:42.620 
you could maybe say go eat dinner leave
your<00:02:42.120> game<00:02:42.330> on

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
your game on

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.870 
your game on

are<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.880> bunch<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.530> lutes<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.680> have<00:02:58.860> here<00:02:59.069> already

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
are a bunch of lutes I have here already

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.150

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
carrots and potatoes that normally would

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.020

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
get but we already have quite a few of

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.580 
get but we already have quite a few of
those<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.280> it's<00:03:11.819> very<00:03:12.209> beneficial<00:03:12.390> very<00:03:13.260> very

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
those so it's very beneficial very very

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.340 
those so it's very beneficial very very
useful<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:15.120> think<00:03:15.540> that's<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.750> lot<00:03:15.989> nicer

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
useful and I think that's a lot nicer

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.349 
useful and I think that's a lot nicer
looking<00:03:16.890> than<00:03:16.950> most<00:03:17.310> standard<00:03:17.549> mob<00:03:17.910> grinders

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
cuz whenever I build mob grinders they

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.690 
cuz whenever I build mob grinders they
kind<00:03:21.000> of<00:03:21.060> look<00:03:21.209> kind<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.480> bland<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.350> dull

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
kind of look kind of bland and dull

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.860 
kind of look kind of bland and dull
they're<00:03:23.700> usually<00:03:23.850> made<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.269> stone<00:03:24.600> bricks

you don't want something to take away
from<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.799> sexiness<00:03:35.280> or<00:03:35.549> appeal<00:03:35.790> of<00:03:35.940> it<00:03:36.060> do<00:03:36.209> you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
from the sexiness or appeal of it do you

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.310 
from the sexiness or appeal of it do you
I<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.540> think<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:38.209> so<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.390> I<00:03:39.510> said<00:03:39.780> this<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
I don't think so so like I said this is

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.650 
I don't think so so like I said this is
a<00:03:40.350> fully<00:03:40.769> automatic<00:03:41.190> mob<00:03:41.640> drowning<00:03:42.030> trap<00:03:42.420> and

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
a fully automatic mob drowning trap and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.270 
a fully automatic mob drowning trap and
I<00:03:42.870> think<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.380> awesome<00:03:43.590> personally

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
I think it's really awesome personally

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.620 
I think it's really awesome personally
this<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.459> one<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.850> my<00:03:44.940> favorite<00:03:45.359> things<00:03:45.570> that

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
I've ever built and I like how efficient

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.430 
I've ever built and I like how efficient
it<00:03:48.060> is<00:03:48.209> how<00:03:48.390> you<00:03:48.420> don't<00:03:48.840> even<00:03:48.959> have<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.230> do<00:03:49.410> a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
it is how you don't even have to do a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.280 
it is how you don't even have to do a
single<00:03:49.829> thing<00:03:50.040> aside<00:03:50.579> from<00:03:50.790> building<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.290> you
