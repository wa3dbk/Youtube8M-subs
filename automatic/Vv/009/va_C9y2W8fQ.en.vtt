00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Welcome here is coach Paulo 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.309
 welcome again in my 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:12.840
 kitchen maybe you ask yourself something 

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:14.940
 baby diaper soaked almonds and a 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 little child screaming in the background 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.439
 I 'll tell you in common 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.510
 more and more people are asking too 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.640
 Fitness recipes and healthy things the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 on the car fitness bus channel and the 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.990
 Of course wish very much 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.260
 descendants and accordingly will be here 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.719
 Often give recipes and one 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.530
 important question being raised 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.140
 i need a replacement and i want to 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.899
 Almost today with almonds one 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.399
 Beautiful must show me Let's go 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.590
 for an almond I need more 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.940
 of course, also convert eighth 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.170
 my almonds on a good quality 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 his almonds 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.960
 which should be almonds on 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 be gassed in any case because if you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.010
 be fumigated during production 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 lose many nutrients and many 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.420
 there are also many fumigated in the trade 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.909
 California almonds under the names 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.710
 So perhaps you prefer investing that 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.810
 one or two cents more 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 You will not just make it a nutrient 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.909
 but also the taste of yours 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.060
 almond milk that's worth it 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.600
 almonds I have about 60 grams of almonds 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.759
 and 700 milliliters of water here in mine 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.070
 tupperdose I've got over 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 let it take eight hours and the whole 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.700
 I just do it the way it is in 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700
 my thermomix in 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.220
 a powerful mixa shows is 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.810
 of course very beneficial 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.840
 and now do it all for one 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.229
 minute at the highest level ratzfatzi fed 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:51.729
 a minute later is out of the brown 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.650
 size has become beautiful white milk and in 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.630
 in the meantime because of a tupperdose 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.750
 h h h no i have it very much 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.670
 I just have the cloth 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.760
 put in and you can instead 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.229
 This baby diaper also everything possible 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.330
 Household books should use that 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.130
 every case be very fine with that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 all water comes through well and now 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.870
 know all the magic for me 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.170
 pour mine here, so to speak 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.410
 almond milk in where, of course, a lot 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 pulp 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.950
 So it's natural 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.280
 stay here is no need to go back in the mixer 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 but that is of course here in this 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.770
 short in it 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.800
 yes, and the magic is happening now 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.680
 not all four corners as follows 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.600
 up here together and if only one 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.489
 very fine cloth like this one 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.519
 baby diaper is and now here after 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.730
 then you can live the most out 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.400
 water or most milk already in here 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.350
 and really only that 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.709
 pork and to say the numbers 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.080
 must be in this diaper 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.650

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.400

 of course you continue to use it all the way 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.930
 that's cool, for example, in a cereal 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.670
 to be installed 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.739

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:39.500
