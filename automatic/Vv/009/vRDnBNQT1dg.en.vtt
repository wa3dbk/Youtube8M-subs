00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
right in front of the Torsen tubes just

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.460 
right in front of the Torsen tubes just
cut<00:00:14.350> right<00:00:14.380> across<00:00:14.800> there<00:00:15.570> come<00:00:16.570> on<00:00:16.720> out<00:00:17.050> I<00:00:17.080> put

cut right across there come on out I put

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.070 
cut right across there come on out I put
a<00:00:17.500> couple<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.920> slices<00:00:18.220> here<00:00:18.850> for<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.600> frame<00:00:19.869> is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
a couple of slices here for the frame is

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.000 
a couple of slices here for the frame is
going<00:00:20.230> to<00:00:20.320> go<00:00:20.440> up<00:00:20.590> in<00:00:20.770> there<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.289> we<00:00:23.289> also<00:00:23.500> cut

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010 
going to go up in there and we also cut

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.160 
going to go up in there and we also cut
off<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.330> emergency<00:00:25.410> brake<00:00:26.820> line<00:00:27.820> there<00:00:28.270> where

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
off the emergency brake line there where

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.169 
off the emergency brake line there where
that<00:00:29.350> comes<00:00:29.650> out<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:32.500> heater<00:00:32.739> hose<00:00:33.179> out

00:00:34.169 --> 00:00:34.179 
that comes out and the heater hose out

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:35.790 
that comes out and the heater hose out
we<00:00:34.510> cut<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:34.780> off<00:00:34.929> we're<00:00:35.109> smooth<00:00:35.379> all<00:00:35.530> that<00:00:35.679> up

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
we cut that off we're smooth all that up

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.709 
we cut that off we're smooth all that up
and<00:00:35.829> grind<00:00:36.190> it<00:00:36.339> I<00:00:36.550> cut<00:00:36.969> that<00:00:37.120> one<00:00:37.269> off<00:00:37.390> cut<00:00:37.600> that

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
carrier and get it welded on and we

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.000 
carrier and get it welded on and we
brought<00:01:18.310> it<00:01:18.430> up<00:01:18.550> with<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:19.440> engine<00:01:20.440> hoist<00:01:20.650> and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
brought it up with the engine hoist and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.050 
brought it up with the engine hoist and
set<00:01:21.190> her<00:01:21.280> in<00:01:21.340> place

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
set her in place

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.160 
set her in place
and<00:01:22.650> next<00:01:23.650> we'll<00:01:23.830> start<00:01:24.130> centering<00:01:24.610> and

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and next we'll start centering and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250 
and next we'll start centering and
measuring<00:01:26.170> from<00:01:27.330> point<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.450> point<00:01:28.480> and<00:01:28.930> square

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
measuring from point to point and square

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.860 
measuring from point to point and square
this<00:01:29.440> thing<00:01:29.650> up<00:01:29.830> alright<00:01:30.450> first<00:01:31.450> thing<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:31.750> do

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
this thing up alright first thing we do

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.550 
this thing up alright first thing we do
is<00:01:31.990> level<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.710> frame<00:01:33.600> okay<00:01:34.600> and<00:01:34.930> then<00:01:35.230> we<00:01:35.350> set

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
is level the frame okay and then we set

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.680 
is level the frame okay and then we set
the<00:01:35.590> carrier<00:01:35.890> on<00:01:36.190> and<00:01:37.000> we<00:01:37.120> set<00:01:37.300> the<00:01:37.420> level

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
the carrier on and we set the level

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.420 
the carrier on and we set the level
across<00:01:37.870> there<00:01:38.200> make<00:01:38.350> sure<00:01:38.530> it's<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.770> our<00:01:38.890> nice

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
across there make sure it's in our nice

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
across there make sure it's in our nice
even<00:01:39.970> spot<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.650> we<00:01:41.830> level<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.460> carrier<00:01:42.880> also

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
even spot and we level the carrier also

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.810 
even spot and we level the carrier also
at<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.650> same<00:01:44.830> time<00:01:44.890> is<00:01:45.250> letting<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.580> front

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
at the same time is letting the front

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.390 
at the same time is letting the front
then<00:01:46.120> the<00:01:46.750> next<00:01:47.080> step<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:49.180> degenerate<00:01:50.400> measure

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
then the next step is degenerate measure

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.810 
then the next step is degenerate measure
from<00:01:51.880> that<00:01:52.840> pipe<00:01:53.460> how<00:01:54.460> -<00:01:55.120> oh<00:01:55.870> let's<00:01:56.470> show<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
from that pipe how - oh let's show the

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.770 
from that pipe how - oh let's show the
end<00:01:58.120> of<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.770> plate<00:01:59.770> there<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.600> can

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
end of the plate there but we can

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.990 
end of the plate there but we can
duplicate<00:02:02.170> on<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.470> other<00:02:02.590> side<00:02:02.890> fifteen<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
duplicate on the other side fifteen and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:11.260 
duplicate on the other side fifteen and
a<00:02:04.090> quarter

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:18.700 

put<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.420> up<00:02:12.780> right<00:02:13.230> there<00:02:13.680> 15<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.820> a<00:02:14.880> quarter

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.470 

we<00:02:19.710> got<00:02:19.860> 15<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.520> quarter<00:02:20.670> right<00:02:20.910> there<00:02:21.120> okay

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
we got 15 and a quarter right there okay

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.570 
we got 15 and a quarter right there okay
that's<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.020> then<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.860> next<00:02:23.130> step<00:02:23.340> will<00:02:23.550> be

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that's in it then the next step will be

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.230 
that's in it then the next step will be
to<00:02:23.700> measure<00:02:24.650> from<00:02:25.650> here<00:02:26.130> up<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.880> center

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
to measure from here up to a center

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.040 
to measure from here up to a center
point<00:02:28.130> in<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.280> head<00:02:29.720> we're<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> put<00:02:31.020> a

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
point in the head we're going to put a

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.530 
point in the head we're going to put a
mark<00:02:31.350> right<00:02:31.560> there<00:02:31.940> I'm<00:02:32.940> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> put<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.270> mark

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
mark right there I'm going to put a mark

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.580 
mark right there I'm going to put a mark
right<00:02:33.750> there<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.500> then<00:02:34.950> measure<00:02:35.190> equally<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
right there and then measure equally and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.960 
right there and then measure equally and
triangulate<00:02:37.590> from<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.070> corner<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.940> that

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
triangulate from that corner to that

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.080 
triangulate from that corner to that
corner<00:02:39.170> that<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.500> corner<00:02:40.800> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.940> that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
corner that to this corner and then that

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.600 
corner that to this corner and then that
will<00:02:42.180> be<00:02:42.300> square

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
will be square

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.730 
will be square
right<00:02:44.610> now<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:45.090> am<00:02:45.150> prepping<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.840> seeds<00:02:46.140> for

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
right now I am prepping the seeds for

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.120 
right now I am prepping the seeds for
the<00:02:47.220> fitting<00:02:47.990> so<00:02:48.990> we<00:02:49.140> know<00:02:49.500> where<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.860> put<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
the fitting so we know where to put the

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.980 
the fitting so we know where to put the
seat<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.700> relation<00:02:51.150> to<00:02:51.240> the<00:02:51.360> pedals<00:02:51.750> he's

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
seat in relation to the pedals he's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.180 
seat in relation to the pedals he's
going<00:02:52.170> to<00:02:52.230> come<00:02:52.320> over<00:02:52.500> tomorrow<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:52.950> do<00:02:53.040> that

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
going to come over tomorrow and do that

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.420 
going to come over tomorrow and do that
so<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.210> we've<00:02:54.330> done<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.600> we<00:02:54.750> take<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.050> phone

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
so what we've done is we take this phone

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.250 
so what we've done is we take this phone
and<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:56.610> glue<00:02:56.760> on<00:02:57.060> four<00:02:57.720> layers<00:02:57.960> thick

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
and we glue on four layers thick

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.620 
and we glue on four layers thick
half-inch<00:02:58.680> from<00:02:58.890> four<00:02:59.130> layers<00:02:59.340> thick<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.540> I'm

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
half-inch from four layers thick and I'm

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.150 
half-inch from four layers thick and I'm
not<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.290> into<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> frame<00:03:01.830> because

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
not going to go into the frame because

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.680 
not going to go into the frame because
they<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.370> welding<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:03.000> back<00:03:03.150> here<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.450> tab

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
they got welding to do back here the tab

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.480 
they got welding to do back here the tab
so<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.350> don't<00:03:04.620> want<00:03:04.740> that<00:03:04.830> glue<00:03:05.040> going<00:03:05.250> we'll

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
so you don't want that glue going we'll

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.370 
so you don't want that glue going we'll
burn<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.730> but<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.570> is<00:03:06.720> just<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:06.990> the<00:03:07.050> fitting

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
burn it but this is just for the fitting

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.640 
burn it but this is just for the fitting
and<00:03:07.530> then<00:03:08.130> we're<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.550> take<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:12.650> chopper

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
and then we're going to take a chopper

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.460 
and then we're going to take a chopper
pad<00:03:13.940> glue<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.239> also<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:16.320> what

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
pad glue it on also so that's what

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.370 
pad glue it on also so that's what
she'll<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.680> sitting<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.450> tomorrow<00:03:18.450> when<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.230> do

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
she'll be sitting on tomorrow when we do

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.410 
she'll be sitting on tomorrow when we do
the<00:03:19.500> pedals<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:21.620> that's<00:03:22.620> that<00:03:22.860> the<00:03:23.700> distance

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the pedals and that's that the distance

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.040 
the pedals and that's that the distance
between<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.110> carrier<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.120> pedals<00:03:27.540> here

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
between the carrier and the pedals here

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.820 
between the carrier and the pedals here
to<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.420> determines<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:31.320> length<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
to the determines the length of the

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.570 
to the determines the length of the
trike<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:33.030> height<00:03:33.270> of<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.590> person<00:03:35.310> that

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
trike and the height of the person that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.250 
trike and the height of the person that
you're<00:03:35.910> building<00:03:36.420> the<00:03:36.660> scooter<00:03:37.080> for<00:03:39.080> this<00:03:40.080> one

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you're building the scooter for this one

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.729 
you're building the scooter for this one
here<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:41.209> 55<00:03:42.350> is<00:03:43.350> 55<00:03:43.980> inches<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:45.500> it'll<00:03:46.500> fit

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
somebody that's about between five six

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.810 
somebody that's about between five six
and<00:03:50.239> five<00:03:51.239> nine<00:03:51.720> five<00:03:52.050> ten<00:03:52.400> little<00:03:53.400> kiddos

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and five nine five ten little kiddos

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.380 
and five nine five ten little kiddos
easily<00:03:55.040> move<00:03:56.040> this<00:03:56.220> forward<00:03:56.520> for<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.060> shorter

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
easily move this forward for a shorter

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.380 
easily move this forward for a shorter
person<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.900> back<00:03:58.110> for<00:03:58.820> much<00:03:59.820> taller<00:04:00.120> person

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
person and back for much taller person

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.100 
person and back for much taller person
okay<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:00.930> we<00:04:01.200> measured<00:04:01.560> the<00:04:01.680> frame<00:04:02.480> from<00:04:03.480> this

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
okay so we measured the frame from this

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.580 
okay so we measured the frame from this
point<00:04:04.380> up<00:04:04.590> to<00:04:04.620> X<00:04:05.130> in<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:06.239> head<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.780> little<00:04:07.170> X<00:04:07.410> I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
point up to X in the head a little X I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.680 
point up to X in the head a little X I
put<00:04:07.800> up<00:04:07.890> there<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.310> measured<00:04:08.640> it<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:08.850> squared

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
put up there and measured it and squared

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.000 
put up there and measured it and squared
it<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:09.989> make<00:04:10.080> sure<00:04:10.230> both<00:04:10.410> sides<00:04:10.470> are<00:04:10.950> exactly

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
it and make sure both sides are exactly

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
it and make sure both sides are exactly
the<00:04:11.459> same

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
the same

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.030 
the same
now<00:04:12.390> we<00:04:12.450> cut<00:04:12.780> a<00:04:12.810> couple<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.290> little<00:04:13.470> pieces<00:04:13.590> of

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
now we cut a couple of little pieces of

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.400 
now we cut a couple of little pieces of
square<00:04:14.570> solid<00:04:15.570> stock<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.140> we're<00:04:16.230> going<00:04:16.380> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
square solid stock and we're going to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.340 
square solid stock and we're going to
weld<00:04:16.650> them<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:16.980> my<00:04:17.760> hair<00:04:18.000> joining<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:19.019> frame

to the rear end of the carrier and then
welded<00:04:49.320> down<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:50.700> when<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:51.560> one<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.590> the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
welded down is when it is one of the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.580 
welded down is when it is one of the
major<00:04:53.360> differences<00:04:54.360> between<00:04:55.580> my<00:04:56.580> trikes<00:04:56.940> and

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
major differences between my trikes and

major differences between my trikes and
everybody<00:04:58.590> else<00:04:59.480> this<00:05:00.480> is<00:05:00.720> why<00:05:00.900> we<00:05:01.350> go

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
everybody else this is why we go

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.990 
everybody else this is why we go
off-road<00:05:02.310> anytime<00:05:03.270> anywhere<00:05:04.400> no<00:05:05.400> questions

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
off-road anytime anywhere no questions

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.040 
off-road anytime anywhere no questions
asked<00:05:06.240> because<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:08.480> alright<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.540> have

asked because of that alright I have
determined<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:11.280> exact<00:05:11.700> location<00:05:12.240> of<00:05:12.360> the

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
determined the exact location of the

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.659 
determined the exact location of the
seat<00:05:12.750> because<00:05:13.650> Linda<00:05:14.010> came<00:05:14.190> over<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.550> we<00:05:14.640> had

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
the seat sitting up there went to the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.700 
the seat sitting up there went to the
pedals<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:18.270> figured<00:05:18.930> out<00:05:19.020> what<00:05:19.169> was<00:05:19.350> right<00:05:19.500> so

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
pedals and figured out what was right so

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.040 
pedals and figured out what was right so
I<00:05:19.740> bent<00:05:20.070> this<00:05:20.280> tube<00:05:20.640> here<00:05:21.120> right<00:05:21.810> to<00:05:21.960> the
