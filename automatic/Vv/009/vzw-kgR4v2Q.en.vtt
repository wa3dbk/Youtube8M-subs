00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 They are good and great hope is 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.569
 seeing what we are going to do is not talk 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.519
 of 5 animes as always that I recommend 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.440
 with different genres but of five 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.049
 anime games but which games 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.849
 of anime gloves if we're going to talk about 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.410
 five games that are related to 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.230
 it want is what I consider the 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.609
 most popular best fun 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.189
 control and drastic and things like that in 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.560
 general let's see us fire the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.859
 position number 5 is going to be for the one 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.859
 piece 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 playstation 2 platforms and you already have your 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.149
 years but that to pass the characters not 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.910
 they are as deformed as sagas 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.850
 previous ones that were the famous wampis 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.649
 great father earl that game the idea is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.750
 just go fighting and we got to 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.270
 the saga of waters cern 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.260
 and what happens we also have characters 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.210
 classics like for example that is that 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.730
 to make two it totally seems to me 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.350
 recommended and at the same time is 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.780
 entertaining because the difficulties 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 marigan in the words is the typical 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 game of the ideal that you can not have 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.479
 played if you liked pisco that the 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.490
 techniques are much better represented 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.680
 the Americas and why not invite a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.290
 friend to not save him and play so 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.790
 he feels from position 5 and has 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 to full guys go down the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.060
 internet or buy an ad that 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.659
 have close because they are not going to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.909
 regret 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.770
 at number 4 in the game so 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.840
 let's put that one piece gigant 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.600
 battle as I would say in Japanese or 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.509
 simply the one piece gigant to this 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.060
 game is for nintendo ds and that consists 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.520
 in which he goes simply doing missions 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.459
 and fighting to repeal characters but 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.799
 what's up we're not 10 15 or 20 characters 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.569
 they are a lot of characters without 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.700
 lie to them I think we reached 90 or 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.740
 there is always a portion as it was when 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.409
 they come to get us all out and we have 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.479
 since the beginning of ewan maybe it's 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.700
 quite ahead coming to the saga of 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.229
 the mind for let's say as always 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.239
 presentation in the games I understand of s 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.189
 they are pretty playful and especially the 

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:06.489
 of those I can highlight thomas that 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.140
 will love flight that is going to be very 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.509
 difficult because they do not just have to fight 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.780
 and win they have to fight to win but to do 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.190
 specific missions for example beat him 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.230
 to another opponent of treves doing the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.960
 initial part of use but more attack 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:27.250
 maybe we 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:29.290
 and has a rpg system applied to the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.300
 classics of fight totally of 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.280
 combined deserves the 4th place to end 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.270
 at number 3 will be for the 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.930
 one piece unlimited cruise 2 as it is 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.670
 number 2 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.890
 so you or I previous apple was 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.600
 one piece unlimited cruise la 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.900
 platform is nintendo wii for this 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.430
 game what is it about 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.020
 we started on a fifth island but it's 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.200
 much better than the previous one since it has 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.900
 better graphics and better work since 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.430
 see it quite as it were and the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.960
 minigames as always about fun 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.210
 For example, you have a fish that goes to 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.610
 get out much more according to chapter one 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.880
 Carpathians piece weak and do not want 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.880
 sin of butchers as bait 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.150
 but that the game is going to be more 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.830
 Interesting 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.030
 especially fun since the main thing 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.530
 of the game 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.530
 when not only calm 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.040
 two 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:39.580
 games because the graphics are 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.580
 incredible history 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.239
 two years 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.680
 we started six for the two light years 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.060
 trip with tests the visit and solís eyes 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.480
 and is looking at the bag 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.480
 the post is a super flashback let's say 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.209
 to the characters 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.980
 but no 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:46.670
 suddenly so they have seen how 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:48.920
 its 233 communicants 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.020
 and the number 1 spot the champion of these 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.080
 games want is going to be the good floor 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.510
 for the field that is the carnival of the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.400
 pirates because I deposed him number one 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.780
 because it's just a very game 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.770
 Funny graphic is not going to be the best 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:06.140
 since of playstation 2 and it has its years 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.520
 but fun and addiction fix 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.440
 7 game for friends games is 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.850
 incredible is a game that supports up to 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.220
 four boxes at the same time so 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.260
 it's totally multiple already they have it 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.660
 play because there's nothing questions from 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.520
 with your friends in your to fine and 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.460
 start to see with the same ones that you have 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.680
 this game with which each one half that 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.720
 the other is not out of the crash you're going 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.180
 for playstation one that had everything 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.340
 things and good this is the same 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.860
 much more inventive and creative 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.020
 obviously with a suit with much better 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.880
 so despite not be as play 3 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.980
 one piece jesus as his i give him the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.490
 chivas because it 's totally fun 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.490
 comes a game 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:48.699
 and the gameplay and fun so if 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.330

 and invite them to notify all day with 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:02.089
 that one can repent and die of 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.589
 laugh and it's not only mini-games because if 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:06.379
 we put history or we can also 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:08.240
 friends making history there are like letters 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:12.849
 and a board and you inscribe 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.849
 conquering all panels 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:19.200
 totally position 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.310
 and the number one position will be followed 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:23.440
 unquestionably for me 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.510
