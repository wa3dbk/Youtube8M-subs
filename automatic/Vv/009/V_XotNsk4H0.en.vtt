hi<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:08.069> Alexandra<00:00:08.970> wait<00:00:09.389> Sonic<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.889> is

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
hi I'm Alexandra wait Sonic and this is

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.990 
hi I'm Alexandra wait Sonic and this is
my<00:00:11.160> genome<00:00:11.599> and<00:00:12.599> of<00:00:13.290> course<00:00:13.670> you'll<00:00:14.670> have<00:00:14.759> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
my genome and of course you'll have to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.450 
my genome and of course you'll have to
wait<00:00:15.210> about<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.570> year<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.470> slides<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.279> like

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
wait about a year of slides just like

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.320 
wait about a year of slides just like
this<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.480> my<00:00:18.630> whole<00:00:18.840> genome<00:00:19.260> or

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:20.330 
this to actually see my whole genome or

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.570 
this to actually see my whole genome or
you<00:00:21.330> could<00:00:21.570> download<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.830> Harvard

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580

you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.500> doesn't<00:01:07.500> seem<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.860> bad<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.340> we

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you know doesn't seem so bad when we

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.460 
you know doesn't seem so bad when we
have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> few<00:01:08.909> genomes<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.439> are

sitting on your desk in your lab but

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
sitting on your desk in your lab but
when<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.560> hundreds<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.310> thousands<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
over the world you really start to get

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600 
over the world you really start to get
an<00:01:21.450> idea<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:22.080> wow<00:01:22.259> we<00:01:22.979> need<00:01:23.400> something

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
an idea that wow we need something

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.520 
an idea that wow we need something
better<00:01:23.909> than<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.750> we<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
better than this you know we need a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.899 
better than this you know we need a
platform<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.840> of<00:01:27.840> course<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> internet

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
platform and of course the internet

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.499 
platform and of course the internet
scale<00:01:30.360> companies<00:01:30.930> Microsoft<00:01:31.590> Google<00:01:31.890> Amazon

mean<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.200> awesome<00:01:34.799> platforms<00:01:35.900> but

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
mean they all have awesome platforms but

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.929 
mean they all have awesome platforms but
in<00:01:37.229> biomed<00:01:37.979> there<00:01:38.579> are<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> lot<00:01:38.909> of

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
the need for security we also need to be

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800 
the need for security we also need to be
able<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.310> where<00:02:29.700> this<00:02:30.150> data<00:02:30.390> comes<00:02:30.690> from

able to know where this data comes from

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.140 
able to know where this data comes from
when<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.290> when<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.740> 500,000<00:02:32.670> terabytes

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
when you when you have 500,000 terabytes

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.360 
when you when you have 500,000 terabytes
the<00:02:33.840> vast<00:02:34.050> majority<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.830> data<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.160> work

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
the vast majority of the data you work

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.979 
the vast majority of the data you work
with<00:02:35.550> day<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.730> day<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.660> to<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.810> much

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.100 
with day to day is going to be much
smaller<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:39.120> was<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> process<00:02:39.630> by<00:02:40.080> which

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
smaller so what was the process by which

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.110 
smaller so what was the process by which
you<00:02:40.380> actually<00:02:40.560> generated<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> data<00:02:41.730> set<00:02:41.970> you

later<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:50.250> don't<00:02:50.340> need<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.730> do<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.360> know

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
later you don't need to do that you know

the wheel they're going to want to share

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.450 
the wheel they're going to want to share
and<00:04:56.690> they're<00:04:57.350> not<00:04:57.500> going<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.860> be<00:04:57.950> able<00:04:57.980> to<00:04:58.310> do

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
and they're not going to be able to do

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.110

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
it so I'm Sasha download my genome and I

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.040 
it so I'm Sasha download my genome and I
hope<00:05:05.540> you'll<00:05:05.720> come<00:05:05.900> join<00:05:06.110> arvada<00:05:06.500> at<00:05:06.800> org
