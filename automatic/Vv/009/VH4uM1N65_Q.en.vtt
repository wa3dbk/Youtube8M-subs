the engine from the front we have seen
mid<00:00:33.780> engines<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.290> you're<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.739> running

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
mid engines but you're actually running

what's really when I'm up when I hit the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
what's really when I'm up when I hit the
cars<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.110> launch<00:00:40.379> I've<00:00:40.770> got<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.040> keeps<00:00:41.579> my

front end up in the air a little bit

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
front end up in the air a little bit
better<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:43.620> it's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.100> easier

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
better and it's a lot it's a lot easier

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400
