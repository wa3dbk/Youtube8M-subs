00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
investigate when you have teenagers I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.480 
investigate when you have teenagers I
think<00:04:50.720> there's<00:04:50.900> an<00:04:51.050> added<00:04:51.560> responsibility

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
think there's an added responsibility

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.029 
think there's an added responsibility
for<00:04:52.699> parents<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.150> maintain<00:04:53.660> vigilance<00:04:54.039> not

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
for parents to maintain vigilance not

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.310 
for parents to maintain vigilance not
only<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.699> eating<00:04:55.910> disordered<00:04:56.660> individuals

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
only for eating disordered individuals

only for eating disordered individuals
for<00:04:58.039> any<00:04:58.190> teenager<00:04:58.699> who<00:04:59.000> goes<00:04:59.210> online<00:04:59.660> I<00:05:00.320> think

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.220 
for any teenager who goes online I think

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.920 
for any teenager who goes online I think
all<00:05:01.490> of<00:05:01.520> our<00:05:01.880> teenagers<00:05:02.449> need<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.780> be

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
all of our teenagers need to be

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.170 
all of our teenagers need to be
supervised<00:05:03.340> more<00:05:04.340> so<00:05:04.610> if<00:05:04.789> they<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.150> a

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180
