00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello and welcome then that one 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.450
 while I 'm doing a little tutorial that 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 I love and I use all the time 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.010
 and it's a French knife so it's 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.929
 a soldier is the technique 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.730
 so it's a knife that is not very 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.250
 I'm going to show you everything 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.750
 right now there are several 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.710
 versions so that's interesting for 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.029
 go to the ministers website with a w 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 because on this model for example you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.529
 you can choose between a bet 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 as here a soul was put in your you 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 you can choose the color of the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.630
 hand string which exists in several 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.870
 color but with a phosphorescent mode 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 of memory ah so she is bored so 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.219
 forged steel that is really beefy 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 because I do not know if you see but 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.200
 it's quite thick enough so it's a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.320
 maintaining the share accorded to these 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.550
 blessings someone who is a little 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 something a little bigger with the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 nephew goes through them 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.920
 so we have it well in hand size she 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 is really enough 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 that's enough that's enough and what I 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.660
 find super nice is the squire where he 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.920
 is he who is pretty well done then 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.650
 here with a little clip here for 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 secure the knife we â€‹â€‹will be able to 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.760
 wear in many ways we will be able to 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.220
 obviously wear it here as a rather 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.180
 traditional on the side here that this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.060
 we see it's interesting because 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.770
 that once the passer-by is put in 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.390
 the blue belt the knife goes a little 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.840
 little go out here so that's going to be pretty 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.460
 easy to pull it 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.710
 there is a way that is put on 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.610
 that will allow low is 2 the tightening to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.009
 the thigh is simply to use it 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.590
 that's how expensive it is 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.890
 just here and I think of any 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.509
 way a little weird yet but 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.159
 I found it quite nice it is 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.680
 simply put around to see as well 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.060
 to squeeze it under the armpit and get 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.020
 found with a rather that takes but 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.090
 on the side you that it's not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.950
 disturbing on the front and just 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 this is to have just opened that one 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.700
 find quite easily like 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.799
 in England for to get him out 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.630
 so that's all stupid a string parent 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.579
 here is the blade this is where 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.840
 the simplest possible but here it is 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.640
 what I call really earlier six 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.530
 blows this is enough it's enough 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.340
 amply it's super sharp 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.569
 original it's pretty easy to dropped 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 I not especially used as 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.430
 kanpur knife here do the 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.819
 work go I'll break them wood 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.620
 etc. 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.420
 but we can do it a lot with 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.410
 so I invite you to go see the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 site wheels earth because they have 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.959
 many models 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.540
 they have the same model that exists with 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.360
 a case a little different in 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.349
 plastic for a for a degassing a 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.420
 little bit faster 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.340
 here we can put it on a little 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.830
 Italy on the passers-by soft me 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.080
 find it nice enough even in front of here a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.299
 little a little back we'll be able to a 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.640
 grip and I know how a little 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.830
 plant for example so these French it 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.150
 the can me made in France so that one 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.290
 do not talk badly right now so if 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.760
 you are aisles choice between that or 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.400
 Another thing I really recommend 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.690
 it was going to review their site it is good 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.459
 frankly it is very well done 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.650
 their type and I hope they will 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.599
 continue to develop this kind of tool 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.950
 because it's really well thought out 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.299
 it's really well designed I think 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.260
 these wages all stupid but I think that 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.090
 it's really a reflection 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.280
 that they may have had for for creating 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:18.220
 it's really simple effective net 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.230
 for me if the knife kalachnikov that 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.850
 Enough is enough with the famous part to 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.010
 ropes that can be used if there but 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.030
 is still in the night this because 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.370
 if we really wanted to know how to be 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.560
 hot to put back 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.540
 so that's a great cost to the French 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.980
 from my department I advise you 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.519
 to see if you have the opportunity 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.500
 of having to shut up if I was going to say 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.239
 no I do not think but in armory go 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.069
 see take them in hand etc 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.840
 it's not very heavy in addition to the 85 g 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.519
 it's really beefy it's really 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.290
 good knife so it can be too 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.489
 a gift idea I remind you that if 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.340
 soon Valentine's day 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.450
 so it's a bit odd for those who 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.159
 listen to him tribute while at least 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.040
 cold knives so not really 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:02.090
 so here we go see a little bit 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.959
 for this technical ministry it's written 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.959
 serves these parties
