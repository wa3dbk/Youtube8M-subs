00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
um it's kind of cool because the desert

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:27.259 
um it's kind of cool because the desert
comes<00:00:25.569> right<00:00:25.869> in<00:00:26.050> with<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.319> with<00:00:27.220> the

there's<00:01:56.740> a<00:01:56.859> tree<00:01:57.539> so<00:01:58.979> there<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.009> one<00:02:00.399> tree

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
there's a tree so there is one tree

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120 
there's a tree so there is one tree
fairly<00:02:01.299> close<00:02:01.570> and<00:02:01.960> if<00:02:02.170> you<00:02:02.289> get<00:02:02.439> the<00:02:02.590> saplings

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130
