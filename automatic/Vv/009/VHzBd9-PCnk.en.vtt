covers<00:00:11.160> so<00:00:12.000> let<00:00:12.210> me<00:00:12.240> show<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.450> why<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.900> has<00:00:13.500> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
covers so let me show you why this has a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.480 
covers so let me show you why this has a
nice<00:00:14.330> leather<00:00:15.330> outer<00:00:15.809> cover<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:17.310> it's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
nice leather outer cover to it if it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 
nice leather outer cover to it if it's
not<00:00:17.609> leather<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.359> pretty<00:00:19.289> close<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.830> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
not leather it's pretty close to it you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.140 
not leather it's pretty close to it you
can't<00:00:20.189> tell<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.460> difference<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:20.939> days

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can't tell the difference these days

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
can't tell the difference these days
between<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.630> vinyl<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.080> weather<00:00:22.230> really<00:00:22.470> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
between the vinyl and weather really and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.189 
between the vinyl and weather really and
it<00:00:23.310> also<00:00:23.460> has<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.760> nice<00:00:24.029> contrast<00:00:24.750> stitching

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
it also has this nice contrast stitching

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.720 
it also has this nice contrast stitching
so<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> little<00:00:25.859> bit<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.580> gives

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
so it's a little bit you know it gives

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.849 
so it's a little bit you know it gives
it<00:00:26.880> kind<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.150> a<00:00:27.330> little<00:00:27.960> bit<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.830> different

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
it kind of a little bit of a different

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.139 
it kind of a little bit of a different
look<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> let<00:00:31.289> me<00:00:31.439> show<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.460> Kindle

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
look so let me show you how the Kindle

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.560 
look so let me show you how the Kindle
Touch<00:00:33.390> fits<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.110> there<00:00:34.460> you<00:00:35.460> slide<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.390> down

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
Touch fits in there you slide it down

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.200 
Touch fits in there you slide it down
and<00:00:38.239> it<00:00:39.239> fits<00:00:39.690> tightly<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:41.210> that's

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and it fits tightly in there so that's

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
and it fits tightly in there so that's
really<00:00:42.570> that's<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.350> brings<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> I'm<00:00:44.040> only

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
really that's it brings me to I'm only

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
really that's it brings me to I'm only
concerned<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.090> cover<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.469> there

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
concerned with this cover is that there

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.340 
concerned with this cover is that there
isn't<00:00:47.520> anything<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.239> secure<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.200> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
isn't anything to really secure it in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.130 
isn't anything to really secure it in
place<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:50.129> than<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.670> tension<00:00:51.239> from<00:00:52.110> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
place other than the tension from the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
place other than the tension from the
leather<00:00:52.680> squeezing<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.149> after

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
leather squeezing it in there so after

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
leather squeezing it in there so after
the<00:00:54.809> leather<00:00:55.020> stretches<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.649> while<00:00:56.370> after<00:00:56.820> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the leather stretches a while after a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
the leather stretches a while after a
while<00:00:57.000> that's<00:00:57.660> my<00:00:57.809> only<00:00:57.899> concern<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.500> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
while that's my only concern is that it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
while that's my only concern is that it
might<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.489> start<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> wobble<00:01:00.149> around<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
might you know start to wobble around a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.630 
might you know start to wobble around a
little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.100> doesn't<00:01:02.340> that's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
little bit but if it doesn't that's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.789 
little bit but if it doesn't that's
great<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.449> because<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> feels<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.589> know<00:01:04.619> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
great but because it feels you know it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.800 
great but because it feels you know it's
it's<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> there<00:01:05.250> really<00:01:05.489> secure<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.659> now

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it's in there really secure right now

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's in there really secure right now
there's<00:01:07.049> no<00:01:07.409> way<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.070> come<00:01:08.189> out<00:01:08.250> as

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
there's no way it's going to come out as

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.969 
there's no way it's going to come out as
it<00:01:09.240> stands<00:01:09.479> right<00:01:09.659> now<00:01:09.720> so<00:01:10.080> based<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it stands right now so based on that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
it stands right now so based on that
it's<00:01:11.280> it's<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.760> nice<00:01:11.939> fit<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.840> also<00:01:12.960> has<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.200> lot
