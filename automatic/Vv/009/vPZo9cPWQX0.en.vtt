00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
ending of root a is going to be the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.250

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.020 
instance what if heating never comes to
actually<00:03:04.170> save<00:03:04.440> Carnegie<00:03:05.069> think<00:03:05.700> about<00:03:05.880> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
actually save Carnegie think about that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.610 
actually save Carnegie think about that
for<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> second<00:03:06.599> that<00:03:07.230> would<00:03:07.380> mean<00:03:07.590> that

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
for a second that would mean that

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.800 
for a second that would mean that
Carnegie<00:03:08.130> might<00:03:08.430> die<00:03:08.730> at<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.299> end<00:03:09.330> of<00:03:09.569> her<00:03:09.660> day

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
Carnegie might die at the end of her day

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.390 
Carnegie might die at the end of her day
I<00:03:09.989> mean<00:03:10.110> let's<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.440> about<00:03:10.590> other<00:03:10.799> essence

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
I mean let's think about other essence

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.330 
I mean let's think about other essence
of<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.640> too<00:03:12.140> what<00:03:13.140> also<00:03:13.319> happens<00:03:14.040> since

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
of this too what also happens since

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.610 
of this too what also happens since
technically<00:03:14.880> Kentucky<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.510> ogirri<00:03:15.930> tree<00:03:16.320> and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
technically Kentucky is ogirri tree and

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.289 
technically Kentucky is ogirri tree and
he<00:03:16.920> might<00:03:17.100> already<00:03:17.280> be<00:03:17.400> accused<00:03:17.850> for<00:03:18.030> killing

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
he might already be accused for killing

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:18.740 
he might already be accused for killing

you know Aki dos father he's technically

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.840

still most likely Auriemma is gonna see

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.220 
still most likely Auriemma is gonna see
this<00:03:26.700> and<00:03:27.000> he's<00:03:27.090> probably<00:03:27.299> going<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.959> kill

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
this and he's probably going to kill

this and he's probably going to kill
Carnegie<00:03:28.890> so<00:03:29.549> I<00:03:29.940> personally<00:03:30.660> believe<00:03:30.810> that

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
Carnegie so I personally believe that

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.599 
Carnegie so I personally believe that
the<00:03:31.380> way<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.680> course<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.220> series<00:03:32.400> is

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
the way the course of the series is

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.400 
the way the course of the series is
going<00:03:32.640> in<00:03:33.209> these<00:03:33.420> episodes<00:03:33.720> enroute<00:03:34.140> ain't

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
going in these episodes enroute ain't

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.680 
going in these episodes enroute ain't
general<00:03:34.890> I<00:03:35.069> feel<00:03:35.489> like<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.880> opposite<00:03:36.480> will

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
general I feel like the opposite will

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.449 
general I feel like the opposite will
happen<00:03:37.109> there<00:03:37.290> will<00:03:37.319> not<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.859> Tokyo<00:03:38.190> ghoul

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
happen there will not be a Tokyo ghoul

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.000 
happen there will not be a Tokyo ghoul
ray<00:03:38.730> there<00:03:39.000> will<00:03:39.359> not<00:03:39.510> be<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.690> part<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.170> Carnegie

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
ray there will not be a part to Carnegie

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.110 
ray there will not be a part to Carnegie
will<00:03:41.489> die<00:03:42.180> and<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.139> perfect<00:03:43.440> way<00:03:43.859> for

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
will die and this is the perfect way for

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.259 
will die and this is the perfect way for
Ishida

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
Ishida

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.270 
Ishida
to<00:03:45.660> actually<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.230> split<00:03:46.739> alternate

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
to actually do a split alternate

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.610 
to actually do a split alternate
timeline<00:03:47.790> for<00:03:48.030> instance<00:03:48.420> what<00:03:48.959> would<00:03:49.200> happen

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
timeline for instance what would happen

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.629 
timeline for instance what would happen
if<00:03:49.769> Carnegie<00:03:50.340> had<00:03:50.819> even<00:03:51.299> more<00:03:51.750> tragic<00:03:52.470> life<00:03:52.980> or

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
if Carnegie had even more tragic life or

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.699 
if Carnegie had even more tragic life or
a<00:03:53.670> tragic<00:03:54.359> story<00:03:54.630> line<00:03:55.079> and<00:03:55.260> that's<00:03:55.440> pretty

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
a tragic story line and that's pretty

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.410 
a tragic story line and that's pretty
much<00:03:55.889> what<00:03:56.100> I<00:03:56.130> think<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.519> gonna<00:03:56.670> happen<00:03:56.970> and

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
much what I think is gonna happen and

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.870 
much what I think is gonna happen and
the<00:03:57.810> events<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.260> route<00:03:58.440> a<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.620> think<00:03:59.340> Carnegie

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
the events of route a I think Carnegie

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.940 
the events of route a I think Carnegie
is<00:04:00.030> going<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.359> change<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.750> where<00:04:01.019> he<00:04:01.560> has<00:04:01.769> no

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
is going to change to where he has no

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.009 
is going to change to where he has no
redemption<00:04:02.250> or<00:04:02.579> he's<00:04:02.850> going<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.299> get<00:04:03.780> a<00:04:03.840> lot

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
redemption or he's going to get a lot

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.900 
redemption or he's going to get a lot
more<00:04:04.049> tragic<00:04:04.650> background<00:04:05.220> he's<00:04:05.609> gonna<00:04:05.730> get

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
more tragic background he's gonna get

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.110 
more tragic background he's gonna get
crazier<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.660> he's<00:04:06.959> going<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.500> killed<00:04:07.769> I

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
crazier and he's going to be killed I

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.490 
crazier and he's going to be killed I
believe<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.480> will<00:04:09.660> happen<00:04:09.900> in<00:04:10.200> the<00:04:10.319> future

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
believe that will happen in the future

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.039 
believe that will happen in the future
of<00:04:10.859> season<00:04:11.430> two<00:04:11.639> if<00:04:11.910> that<00:04:12.269> does<00:04:12.510> happen<00:04:12.540> that

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
of season two if that does happen that

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.770 
of season two if that does happen that
kind<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> destroys<00:04:13.620> all<00:04:13.880> possibility<00:04:14.880> of<00:04:15.209> a

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
kind of destroys all possibility of a

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.949 
kind of destroys all possibility of a
season<00:04:16.260> three<00:04:16.470> Tokyo<00:04:16.979> ghoul<00:04:17.130> Rey<00:04:17.370> and<00:04:17.700> so<00:04:18.299> I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
season three Tokyo ghoul Rey and so I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.440 
season three Tokyo ghoul Rey and so I
wonder<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:20.010> wonder<00:04:20.280> if<00:04:20.609> a<00:04:20.760> sheet<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.060> trying<00:04:21.359> to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
wonder I wonder if a sheet is trying to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.360

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
the manga ended it's gonna be a

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.040 
the manga ended it's gonna be a
tearjerker<00:04:44.550> when<00:04:45.090> we<00:04:45.180> see<00:04:45.360> probably<00:04:45.600> kaneki
