00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:13.420 
from Isaac from Morningside Heights who

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.660 
from Isaac from Morningside Heights who
asks<00:00:13.990> what<00:00:14.860> red<00:00:15.250> wines<00:00:15.550> can<00:00:16.119> you<00:00:16.240> drink<00:00:16.539> chill

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
asks what red wines can you drink chill

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.279 
asks what red wines can you drink chill
and<00:00:18.670> there's<00:00:19.029> a<00:00:19.119> kind<00:00:19.359> of<00:00:19.480> like<00:00:19.630> old<00:00:19.929> rule

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:20.289 
and there's a kind of like old rule

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.310 
and there's a kind of like old rule
about<00:00:20.740> white<00:00:21.039> wine<00:00:21.279> is<00:00:21.490> cold<00:00:21.820> and<00:00:22.239> red<00:00:22.659> wine<00:00:22.960> is

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
about white wine is cold and red wine is

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.059 
about white wine is cold and red wine is
room<00:00:23.679> temperature<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:25.199> that's<00:00:26.199> generally<00:00:27.039> I

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:27.069 
room temperature and that's generally I

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.999 
room temperature and that's generally I
guess<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.699> rule<00:00:27.880> is<00:00:28.060> true<00:00:28.419> but<00:00:29.349> the<00:00:29.649> fact<00:00:29.859> of

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
guess the rule is true but the fact of

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.519 
guess the rule is true but the fact of
the<00:00:30.099> matter<00:00:30.159> is<00:00:30.489> that<00:00:30.519> rule<00:00:31.140> at<00:00:32.140> least<00:00:32.169> for<00:00:32.470> the

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
the matter is that rule at least for the

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.590 
the matter is that rule at least for the
red<00:00:32.680> wine<00:00:32.890> was<00:00:33.160> established<00:00:33.730> in<00:00:33.970> the<00:00:34.030> 19th

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
red wine was established in the 19th

so to drink a wine a red wine at 65 to
70<00:00:48.100> degrees<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:49.019> not<00:00:50.019> recommended<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.969> I

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
70 degrees is not recommended but I

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.889 
70 degrees is not recommended but I
would<00:00:52.210> say<00:00:52.359> in<00:00:52.480> general<00:00:52.739> most<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.850> not<00:00:54.940> all<00:00:55.390> red

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.220 
would say in general most if not all red
wines<00:00:56.489> deserve<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.789> be<00:00:57.940> have<00:00:58.179> a<00:00:58.210> little<00:00:58.899> chill

why<00:01:15.070> are<00:01:15.280> red<00:01:15.520> because<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.720> will<00:01:17.320> conceal

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
why are red because that will conceal

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.910 
why are red because that will conceal
the<00:01:18.250> aromas<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.940> wine<00:01:19.030> itself<00:01:19.690> but<00:01:20.410> many

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.160 
I think benefit from a little chill I
think<00:01:23.890> Pinot<00:01:24.160> Noir<00:01:24.570> benefits<00:01:25.570> from<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.900> chill

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
benefit from being a little warmer I

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.490 
benefit from being a little warmer I
would<00:01:57.190> say<00:01:57.340> most<00:01:57.670> the<00:01:57.880> time<00:01:58.150> white<00:01:58.900> wines<00:01:59.230> are

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
would say most the time white wines are

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.220 
would say most the time white wines are
chilled<00:01:59.800> too<00:02:00.160> much<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.700> they're<00:02:01.420> too<00:02:01.660> cold

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
chilled too much and they're too cold

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.510 
chilled too much and they're too cold
and<00:02:02.350> again<00:02:02.770> the

and again the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.910 
and again the

the beauty of the wine is masked by the
