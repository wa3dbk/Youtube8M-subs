00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.259 
biggest difference if you ask me is that
the<00:02:11.299> 900s<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.989> think<00:02:12.200> had<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.530> amazing<00:02:13.269> cross

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
the 900s I think had that amazing cross

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:14.800 
the 900s I think had that amazing cross
fader

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
fader

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.740 
fader
now<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.830> 750<00:02:16.610> unnie<00:02:16.760> has<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.120> standard<00:02:17.510> cross

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
now the 750 unnie has the standard cross

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.350 
now the 750 unnie has the standard cross
fader<00:02:18.019> similar<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.620> find<00:02:18.950> an<00:02:19.040> 800<00:02:19.580> 850<00:02:19.940> or

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
fader similar so you find an 800 850 or

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.570 
fader similar so you find an 800 850 or
the<00:02:20.510> regular<00:02:20.870> 900<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.799> it's<00:02:22.160> bring<00:02:22.370> across

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
the regular 900 and it's bring across

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.600 
the regular 900 and it's bring across
frenemies<00:02:23.120> my<00:02:23.299> bad<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.260> 900<00:02:24.890> SRC<00:02:25.310> has<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
frenemies my bad but the 900 SRC has a

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.910 
frenemies my bad but the 900 SRC has a
magnetic<00:02:26.150> cross<00:02:26.480> fader<00:02:26.720> now<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.290> thing<00:02:27.560> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
magnetic cross fader now this thing this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.070 
magnetic cross fader now this thing this
seems<00:02:28.160> right<00:02:28.489> on<00:02:28.700> par<00:02:29.000> with<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.480> magnetics

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
seems right on par with the magnetics

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.850 
seems right on par with the magnetics
from<00:02:30.410> rain<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:32.510> really<00:02:32.780> high<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.200> scratch

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
from rain really really high in scratch

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.500 
from rain really really high in scratch
mixers<00:02:34.340> it's<00:02:34.730> seriously<00:02:35.120> one<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.450> best

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
mixers it's seriously one of the best

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.830 
mixers it's seriously one of the best
scratch<00:02:36.019> across<00:02:36.350> faders<00:02:36.709> I've<00:02:36.829> ever<00:02:37.010> do

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.090 

and<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.020> is<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.170> back<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.470> unit<00:02:41.770> it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
and this is the back of the unit it

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.250 
and this is the back of the unit it
connects<00:02:42.400> with<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.610> kettle<00:02:43.030> cable<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.140> can

connects with a kettle cable and you can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.900 
connects with a kettle cable and you can
see<00:02:44.350> the<00:02:44.440> planet<00:02:44.770> evenness<00:02:45.070> to<00:02:45.220> master<00:02:45.760> output

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
see the planet evenness to master output

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.690 
see the planet evenness to master output
we've<00:02:46.300> got<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.750> regular<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.800> say<00:02:48.160> master

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700

here what this means that you can plug

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.850 
here what this means that you can plug
in<00:02:54.850> internet<00:02:55.300> to<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:55.720> router<00:02:56.050> and<00:02:56.410> then<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.740> can

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
in internet to a router and then you can

in internet to a router and then you can
connect<00:02:57.070> up<00:02:57.160> all<00:02:57.310> your<00:02:57.430> CDJs<00:02:57.970> together<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
connect up all your CDJs together and it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.990 
connect up all your CDJs together and it
links<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.230> directly<00:02:59.530> up<00:02:59.740> with<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.520> mixer

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
links it directly up with this mixer

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.500 
links it directly up with this mixer
right<00:03:01.120> here

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
right here

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.660 
right here
it<00:03:01.810> also<00:03:01.930> has<00:03:02.140> digital<00:03:02.530> input<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.160> output

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
it also has digital input and output

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400 
it also has digital input and output
what<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.300> means<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.960> you<00:03:05.110> don't<00:03:05.290> have

to fumble around so much you're
connecting<00:03:06.940> all<00:03:07.060> these<00:03:07.150> cables<00:03:07.600> here<00:03:07.900> you<00:03:08.260> can

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
connecting all these cables here you can

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.260 
connecting all these cables here you can
just<00:03:08.500> go<00:03:08.560> straight<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:09.010> with<00:03:09.130> one<00:03:09.490> RCA<00:03:09.910> cable

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
just go straight up with one RCA cable

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.210 
just go straight up with one RCA cable
into<00:03:10.450> digital<00:03:10.570> and<00:03:11.440> there<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> have<00:03:12.070> it

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
into digital and there you have it

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.970 
into digital and there you have it
