 yo everyone it's true we get 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.799
 found today for a new 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.879
 video 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.919
 so today it's a pretty video 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.280
 special so that's how to install 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:16.529
 fashions costumes contents content 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.949
 downloaded on the game the sims rating 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.500
 so I know that there is almost I believe 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 not that he has any French like a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.029
 video on initial aix so I think that 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.449
 I am one of the only French to throw up 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 the videos on the cnce cat 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.380
 how to install modes because 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.450
 it's something you ask me 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.600
 a lot of habit since I'm going to do 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.079

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.760

 North brief seduced I mean me 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:47.280
 endurance download prypiat I 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:52.829
 took the first 4 horses yeah so 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.600
 I took the first four because 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.460
 I really found to end this thing 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.979
 important 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.310
 those who have the sim demo via the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:05.490
 modes that are functional in the demo 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.060
 sims because it does not work in the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.120
 game the sims 4 so I was doing like this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.800
 because it's really important 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.800
 then you will press documents 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:21.880
 so you 're supposed to find something 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.400
 which is called electronic so if you 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.830
 have your game properly installed now 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.630
 me I sims 3 sims like it 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.820
 would thus miss the medieval essays and 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.470
 the unions we will go in the sims 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.080
 Pyatt 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 then there are games actually there are already 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.870
 a folder the bold is already a hero d 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.050
 a fashion folder described so for that 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.410
 it was I was doing it will save you the 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.610
 life 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:51.010
 it's easy, so you were 6th 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.170
 resources here is a game the little potty 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.870
 also you will not be at that it's worth it 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.150
 see the bowl and if you do not have it you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.860
 mode will not work so what is that 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 you do you take your modes that 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:11.200
 you have installed and you put them 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:13.120
 simply bar folder mode which 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.380
 you know of eschyle point package is 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.600
 because they all modes 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.739
 all custom modes count between 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.049
 others a betting assistant 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.190
 so it's still a package because 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.840
 it's the easiest thing 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.120
 so now I'm going to turn on well q 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.459
 was it hills to see if the modes in 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.600
 functional so games we start to 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.540
 y describes hawks crime modifications 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.290
 so they show the three stuff that 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.299
 I downloaded 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.820
 all this to show you that it's going to say 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.769
 he's fashionable and let's go +76 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.049
 baxi did not available first use 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.970
 At your peril 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.709
 but did not make you more used on 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.799
 its not because I believe they 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.620
 would prefer when not using 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.790
 dance that exploits klaus and quinten 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.430
 whether he prefers to buy 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:09.340
 story stuff since the special ag who 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.760
 succeed sims all six pieces 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.760
 marseille 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.450
 search shanghai i'm in love 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.450
 it 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.710
 but it's just that I know for ten 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.710
 years 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.710
 ah yes perfect so in fact pretty cool 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.770
 so we still have the challenge of 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:43.979
 besanÃ§on organizes the fields of us 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.419
 but we can also choose the gardens 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.520
 that I consider myself loaded objects a little 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.800
 shorter 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.720
 pity so in fact you are looking for the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.320
 garden that looks more like what is it 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.360
 what you are what you needed 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:02.370
 to support us I can see things 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.510
 that you have it's not bad that for 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.580
 fashion installation 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.240
 I recommend you to be 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.310
 careful to be very careful when 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.990
 you download content or suit 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.780
 basket modes 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.639
 there are soft power stuff I you 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:22.430
 should five super positions do a lot 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:25.320
 trust me, I commit myself to it 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.729
 because you still want that 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.919
 no car works anymore at 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.280
 continue to install a certain mode or 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.500
 instruction so be careful 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.010
 brief on this it's going to be the end of 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.740
 the episode 1 of tutorials I hope that 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.500
 you are practical is if yes 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.630
 not to the law and to life the video leaves 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.400
