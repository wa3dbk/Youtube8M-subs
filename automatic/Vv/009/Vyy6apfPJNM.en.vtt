00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.910
 the web bar and the potato is already open and there 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.770
 very calm people here is the cricket and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 bringing you another break 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.689
 Brazilian record as you are. 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.539
 seeing I 'm in the role of 85 but in the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 end of the video will pass there round 86 and 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.310
 I received some information some 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.399
 messages from subscribers who arrived in 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.180
 round 84 but remembering that for 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:39.690
 to see a record is everyone has 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 have at least one video ok with five 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.230
 random rounds of snippets to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.050
 record 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.539
 It's no use having the information in the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 leader may or may not with photos this is 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.530
 even the subs community that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.800
 who requests these videos because they 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.870
 very litigation jung then the public leader 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 where it will show only the round that 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.939
 you will fall and will not show the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.790
 plays and had during matches 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.080
 So, you may have gotten there in the role. 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.830
 of 150 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.200
 however within grid then this does not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.080
 account for record and also photo too 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.509
 does not demonstrate is what happened during the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.009
 starting then's there only one small piece 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.380
 and basically 85 and 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.990
 also a 86 round 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.270
 I still have not fallen I left the dna with so much 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.840
 People are asking what's so 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.630
 leaving and missing are not responding 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.280
 there the messages in xbox is just for 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.640
 That's because I have not dropped this game yet. 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.740
 I started on Sunday is afternoon and it was 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.439
 until the continuation of the dollars 5 you 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.840
 can see the same persongens and still 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.600
 I did not fall I mean fell once when 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.899
 I was shopping there, taking money from 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.570
 bank and came a zombie in round 1 and did 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 I fell but I consider it common to consume 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.759
 party in a fall so I go 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.960
 keep making these plays and I 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.580
 I was thinking of doing a light fall. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 tonight but still not right 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.530
 because I'll see if I do not because 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
 sometimes I lose a little 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 while making a snack so I want 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.090
 concentrate a bit since the manager 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.950
 a very high round and it's and I'm close and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.819
 of the mouse world record so I'll try 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.310
 this world record and who knows, it's me 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.989
 I will succeed because until then it is the 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.350
 from running very well but already 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.450
 is beginning to fall frame and has some 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.970
 bugs inside the game for example I 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.760
 I was there in that little corner and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.920
 suddenly the restorer stopped 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 run and disappeared suddenly understood 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.209
 without appearing hidden in anything then 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.220
 I'll try to play a little more 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.720
 Flemish, I have already passed the 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.970
 round 1 86 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.160
 I'm already a little further and I 'm going 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.709
 bring you these attendants there 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.500
 Forward to you then only to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.560
 to form a new Brazilian record at 86 and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.850
 I'll bring one further I hope that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.610
 did you like this information? 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.810
 that I see in the next video was worth the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.810
 all and even more
