00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.650
 true unfortunately not because I have 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.419
 my life there I have preparations 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.090
 again and there I came with a 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.370
 exclusivity which is called hope that 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.639
 I wrote for a guy who has a big 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.419
 heart 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:29.269
 his name is idrissa and his name 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:31.639
 artist and majidi so it's a 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.980
 true story and the reggae precisely this 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.599

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.290
 that's not love but it's not just for 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:47.840

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.120

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:17.930

 of the green cape with the Caribbean Zouk so 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.630

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.460
