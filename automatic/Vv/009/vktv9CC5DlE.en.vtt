00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.210
 and be good inside to see us 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.790
 pretty on the outside this is the premise of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.920
 the attentive beauty coaching workshops 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.860
 because in a moment we tell you all 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.619
 the secrets of this practice the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 naturalness and health the viu ti coach and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.270
 helps us achieve these objectives on 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.250
 coaching we do in slow life house 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.830
 is a coaching oriented to beauty 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.310
 as a result of being well 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.730
 internal of a welfare not then 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.470
 we work first in there so that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.899
 has the outward movement of 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.940
 want to take care of yourself in a society in the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.730
 that bombard us with advice from 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 beauty in many cases we receive about 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.890
 information and we ended up not paying 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.230
 Attention that's why coaching helps us 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.730
 look inside ourselves that is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.340
 an inner state at least what 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.350
 we conceive here so that does not mean that 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.910
 be exclusive that you take care of the skin that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.590
 Take care 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.080
 the hair that takes care of you is the makeup 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.940
 of course but that has to start 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.440
 of an inner desire to be well 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.320
 then the results will be seen 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.900
 it was very ostensibly also because 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.150
 when one is good and is happy is 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.680
 translates into an external beauty and here 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.110
 we will also give many tips from 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.270
 quality antiaging nutrition 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.660
 dream of what activities are good and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.979
 what are the results and not so good 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.020
 it's going to be that we're going to feel more 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.840
 beautiful but it is a content of many 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.820
 things workshops of 10 sessions to which 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.460
 invite you to join the world 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.070
 because he does not want to feel good that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.140
 yes every session is full of emotions 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.780
 there may be games there may be moments 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.660
 of crying I also say it is not done 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.670
 exposes the person is exposed to the group 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.680
 it also has to do with beliefs 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.229
 that we have about ourselves and for 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.950
 we will expose it so much in a group 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.570
 also creates an environment assured saying what 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.110
 what it's about in the workshop is not about 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.270
 outside 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.350
 let's say you fly by, that 's my 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.120
 experience 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.610
 when I do workshops always 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.580
 there is one wanting more so that no longer 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.910
 you have an excuse not to take care of yourself inside and 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 outside 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.920
 yes
