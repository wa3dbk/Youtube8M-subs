00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 and family today I bring you some 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.330
 recommendations for making rice 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.570
 white at your point first thing we're going 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.370
 to obviously need is rice and a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.170
 meter and because a meter os 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.970
 you will ask why it is super 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.850
 important to pour the amount of water 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.670
 just so first thing that we will do 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.740
 will measure the rice that we are going to use and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.410
 about that we will redouble the amount in 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.279
 water for example if we use a half glass 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 of rice then we will use a whole of water 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.510
 in a pan heat a little bit of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.340
 oil this is already optional but if you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.470
 like garlic as much as you can 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 incorporate a pair of teeth to give 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.140
 a little taste we let it 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.309
 sofiane a little bit and then 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.230
 we will add the rice this is very 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.020
 important since it will do what 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.730
 the rice is loose let's go 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.670
 moving for a couple of minutes to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.140
 that the rice takes the oil well and before 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.350
 that it begins to brown , we remove it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.659
 from the fire 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.280
 we measure the exact amount of water as 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:11.590
 we have said before and we put it in a 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.310
 saucepan to heat we incorporate a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.560
 little salt 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.330
 Miami like garlic I like to throw 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 a teaspoon of vegetable broth 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 to give it a tad more flavors 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 we wait for the water to enter 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.770
 boil and we incorporate the rice 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.550
 and we are removing it from time to time 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.840
 when there is still a little water 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:53.229
 we lower the heat to the minimum until the 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.510
 water has evaporated completely and already 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.820
 is already we will have the fair rice just 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.440
 at your point I hope you're 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.240
