00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.920

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.520
 following ingredients for two 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.120
 people

 to prepare our rice at three o'clock 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.299
 delights the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:01.820
 add a splash of sunflower oil 

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:03.500
 in a pan or wok 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.110
 once the oil is hot 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.990
 let's incorporate the egg little by little 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.479
 and we will go around with a spoon 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.090
 of stick to go forming the threads of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.060
 this egg will be more or less the result 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.009
 that we have to get on the other hand 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.780
 let's prepare the rice and the first thing 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.659
 What we are going to do is wash it under the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.959
 tap after we let it drain 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.690
 little and we will add four glasses of water 

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:32.299
 in a pan that we will put on fire 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.119
 strong once it starts to boil 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.780
 we will add the rice and lower the fire 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 to the half 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.170
 we will let the rice cook for 15 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.900
 minutes past that time we drained the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.270
 rice and we will cut the cooking under the 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.780
 tap 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.240
 and we will put it to cool in the fridge 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.490
 meanwhile we are going to incorporate a 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.860
 trickle of sunflower oil in a 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.990
 pan or wok and we will extend it with 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.549
 a napkin we will put the fire to the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.270
 half and once it's hot 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:09.319
 we will add the peas after the 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.360
 carrot we will remove everything well and for 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 last we will incorporate the rice and 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.790
 we will continue removing the next step 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.850
 will rectify the salt to taste and for 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.170
 Last we are going to add the cooked ham and 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.930
 we will remove again 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.660
 to finally finish with the egg in 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.780
 thread that we had prepared 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.860
 we will continue stirring and finally 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.300
 we will add the spoonful of soy sauce 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.850
 and oyster sauce to taste 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.700
 and this will be the final result 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.620
 It has a very particular flavor and me in 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.740
 concrete reminds me very much of the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.810
 restaurant 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.450
