to<00:00:06.299> developing<00:00:06.779> a<00:00:06.930> system<00:00:07.140> smart<00:00:07.770> enough<00:00:08.040> to

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
to developing a system smart enough to

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.600 
to developing a system smart enough to
identify<00:00:08.370> us<00:00:09.000> by<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.300> way<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.840> walk<00:00:10.490> there<00:00:11.490> was

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
identify us by the way we walk there was

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.549 
identify us by the way we walk there was
a<00:00:11.639> time<00:00:11.969> when<00:00:12.150> he<00:00:12.210> wanted<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.719> identify<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
a time when he wanted to identify the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.410 
a time when he wanted to identify the
perpetrators<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> Jamie<00:00:14.940> Bulger<00:00:15.269> case

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
perpetrators in the Jamie Bulger case

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.720 
perpetrators in the Jamie Bulger case
and<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.049> thought<00:00:16.230> would<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:17.100> showcase

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
and I thought would be a good showcase

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.849 
and I thought would be a good showcase
for<00:00:18.119> for<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.810> biometrics<00:00:19.439> yeah<00:00:19.590> but<00:00:19.770> they

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
for for our biometrics yeah but they

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
for for our biometrics yeah but they
were<00:00:19.920> walking<00:00:20.250> away<00:00:20.369> from<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.699> camera<00:00:20.880> so

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
were walking away from the camera so

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.029 
were walking away from the camera so
face<00:00:21.900> recognition<00:00:22.170> wouldn't<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:22.830> much<00:00:22.980> use

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
face recognition wouldn't be much use

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
face recognition wouldn't be much use
and<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> looked<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.570> thought<00:00:24.779> oh<00:00:24.840> well

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
and when I looked at I thought oh well

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.929 
and when I looked at I thought oh well
perhaps<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.740> no<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:25.920> now<00:00:26.550> that's<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.760> hang

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
perhaps it's a no go now that's a hang

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.460 
perhaps it's a no go now that's a hang
on<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.359> actually<00:00:27.599> recognize<00:00:27.810> them<00:00:28.289> by

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
on you can actually recognize them by

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.859 
on you can actually recognize them by
the<00:00:28.529> way<00:00:28.769> they<00:00:28.949> wore<00:00:29.240> according<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.390> Professor

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
the way they wore according to Professor

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.590 
the way they wore according to Professor
Nixon<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.769> way<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.130> walk<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:33.030> as<00:00:33.149> unique

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
Nixon the way we walk can be as unique

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.000 
Nixon the way we walk can be as unique
and<00:00:33.809> distinctive<00:00:34.530> as<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> fingerprint<00:00:37.010> these

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and distinctive as a fingerprint these

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
and distinctive as a fingerprint these
advantages<00:00:38.610> of<00:00:38.670> biometric<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.989> you<00:00:40.140> have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
advantages of biometric is that you have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280 
advantages of biometric is that you have
it<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> distance<00:00:41.030> when<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.390> can't<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it at a distance when you can't see the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
it at a distance when you can't see the
face<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> other<00:00:44.520> biometrics

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
face and you can't see other biometrics

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.450 
face and you can't see other biometrics
like<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> fingerprints<00:00:46.320> or<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.590> year<00:00:46.800> but

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
like the fingerprints or the year but

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.100 
like the fingerprints or the year but
you<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.730> still<00:00:48.000> see<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.360> way<00:00:48.510> people<00:00:48.899> walk

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you can still see the way people walk

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
you can still see the way people walk
and<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.370> recognize<00:00:50.579> them<00:00:51.000> at<00:00:51.120> a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and so you can recognize them at a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
and so you can recognize them at a
distance<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.840> low<00:00:52.020> resolution<00:00:52.649> for

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
distance at low resolution for

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
distance at low resolution for
surveillant<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.390> new<00:00:54.570> technology<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.260> being

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
surveillant the new technology is being

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.950 
surveillant the new technology is being
perfected<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.340> South<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:56.850> England<00:00:57.000> we've

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
perfected in the South of England we've

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
perfected in the South of England we've
got<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.620> tunnel<00:00:59.129> which<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.090> walk

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
got this tunnel which we can walk

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.049 
got this tunnel which we can walk
through<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> special<00:01:02.340> background

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
through and we have a special background

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.780 
through and we have a special background
and<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.320> number<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.979> cameras<00:01:05.489> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and we have a number of cameras and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.330 
and we have a number of cameras and
those<00:01:06.270> cameras<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.960> looking<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:08.100> you

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
those cameras are looking at you as you

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.760 
those cameras are looking at you as you
walk<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.729> from<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.479> data<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.290> we

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
walk and from that data we can we

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.060 
walk and from that data we can we
reconstruct<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:12.060> solid<00:01:12.510> object<00:01:13.010> from<00:01:14.010> that

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
reconstruct a solid object from that

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.190 
reconstruct a solid object from that
looking<00:01:14.820> subject<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> set<00:01:16.020> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
looking subject we then get a set of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.039 
looking subject we then get a set of
numbers<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> those<00:01:17.400> numbers<00:01:17.759> appear<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.750> be

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
numbers and those numbers appear to be

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.460 
numbers and those numbers appear to be
unique<00:01:19.530> for<00:01:20.189> each<00:01:20.220> person<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> as<00:01:22.020> since

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
unique for each person and as since

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.050 
unique for each person and as since
those<00:01:22.650> numbers<00:01:23.040> appear<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> be<00:01:23.640> unique<00:01:23.909> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
those numbers appear to be unique for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.510 
those numbers appear to be unique for
each<00:01:24.180> person<00:01:24.689> then<00:01:25.320> we<00:01:25.470> say<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.130> recognize

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
each person then we say we can recognize

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
each person then we say we can recognize
you<00:01:26.729> by<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.090> way<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.360> walk

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you by the way you walk

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.469 
you by the way you walk
women<00:01:28.619> swing<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> hips<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> men<00:01:30.150> swing

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
women swing the hips and and men swing

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
women swing the hips and and men swing
their<00:01:30.689> shoulders<00:01:31.140> yeah<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.650> if<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.979> walk

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
their shoulders yeah and if you walk

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
their shoulders yeah and if you walk
down<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> street<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.030> can<00:01:33.240> see<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.689> quite

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
down the street you can see that quite

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
down the street you can see that quite
clearly<00:01:34.439> obviously<00:01:35.369> pregnant<00:01:35.909> women<00:01:36.270> walking

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
clearly obviously pregnant women walking

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.590 
clearly obviously pregnant women walking
in<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.259> different<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.909> non<00:01:39.360> pregnant

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
in in a different way to a non pregnant

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.160 
in in a different way to a non pregnant
woman<00:01:40.140> yeah<00:01:40.460> there<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.700> fat<00:01:42.390> people<00:01:42.750> walk<00:01:42.930> in

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
woman yeah there are fat people walk in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.620 
woman yeah there are fat people walk in
a<00:01:43.259> different<00:01:43.470> way<00:01:43.860> too<00:01:43.920> too<00:01:44.700> thin<00:01:45.000> people<00:01:45.270> yeah

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
a different way too too thin people yeah

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.320 
a different way too too thin people yeah
people<00:01:46.409> who<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.680> who<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.890> in

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
people who are who are in

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.240 
people who are who are in
in<00:01:47.420> hurry<00:01:47.720> will<00:01:48.230> of<00:01:48.350> course<00:01:48.590> move<00:01:48.800> differently
