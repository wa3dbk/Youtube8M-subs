okay<00:00:00.960> we<00:00:01.350> are<00:00:01.380> now<00:00:01.560> taxiing<00:00:01.829> to<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.220> runway

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
okay we are now taxiing to the runway

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.010 
okay we are now taxiing to the runway
and<00:00:03.240> just<00:00:03.270> just<00:00:03.870> keep<00:00:04.259> an<00:00:04.380> eye<00:00:04.470> on<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.920> iron.i

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
and just just keep an eye on the iron.i

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.390 
and just just keep an eye on the iron.i
needle<00:00:07.020> I<00:00:07.200> just<00:00:07.890> tuned<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.400> our<00:00:09.150> first<00:00:10.400> just

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
needle I just tuned it's our first just

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820 
needle I just tuned it's our first just
turned<00:00:11.639> into<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.240> admin<00:00:12.750> view<00:00:13.259> our<00:00:13.440> which<00:00:13.679> is

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
turned into the admin view our which is

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.290 
turned into the admin view our which is
frequency<00:00:14.429> 1<00:00:14.670> 1<00:00:14.849> 7<00:00:15.199> decimal<00:00:16.199> 6<00:00:16.830> 0<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.300> that's

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
frequency 1 1 7 decimal 6 0 and that's

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.590 
frequency 1 1 7 decimal 6 0 and that's
also<00:00:18.660> a<00:00:18.840> first<00:00:19.170> Waypoint<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.710> route<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> we

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
also a first Waypoint in our route so we

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.189 
also a first Waypoint in our route so we
are<00:00:21.960> now<00:00:22.170> currently<00:00:22.590> 12<00:00:23.130> miles<00:00:23.810> away<00:00:24.810> from<00:00:24.869> it

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
are now currently 12 miles away from it

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.849 
are now currently 12 miles away from it
on<00:00:25.980> 12<00:00:26.279> T<00:00:26.369> Amelia<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.170> nearly<00:00:28.170> directly

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
on 12 T Amelia and it's nearly directly

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.420 
on 12 T Amelia and it's nearly directly
behind<00:00:29.070> us<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.859> just<00:00:31.859> keep<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.130> eye<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.340> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
behind us so I just keep an eye on that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
behind us so I just keep an eye on that
one<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.500> where<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> ans<00:00:35.640> will<00:00:35.850> take<00:00:36.030> us<00:00:36.239> when

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
one and where the ans will take us when

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.299 
one and where the ans will take us when
I<00:00:36.480> coupled<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> artifact<00:00:37.860> autopilot

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
I coupled it to the artifact autopilot

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.000 
I coupled it to the artifact autopilot
so<00:00:39.239> well<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.809> now<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> will<00:00:40.140> just<00:00:40.350> take<00:00:40.559> off<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so well for now I will just take off and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.389 
so well for now I will just take off and
then<00:00:41.160> we<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:42.020> see<00:00:43.020> about<00:00:43.200> coupling<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> iron

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
then we all see about coupling the iron

00:00:44.399 --> 00:01:49.730 
then we all see about coupling the iron
s<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.910> autopilot<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.890> further<00:00:46.890> flying

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.910 

okay<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> now<00:01:50.729> engaged<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.540> autopilot<00:01:52.259> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
okay and now engaged the autopilot and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
okay and now engaged the autopilot and
I've<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.090> done<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> couple<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.829> first<00:01:57.439> unit<00:01:58.439> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
I've not done a couple the first unit to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.649 
I've not done a couple the first unit to
the<00:02:00.470> to<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.619> autopilot<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.369> put<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.240> switch

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
the to the autopilot just put the switch

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.850 
the to the autopilot just put the switch
to<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.200> enough<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.220> then<00:02:06.229> engage<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.590> heading

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
to on enough and then engage the heading

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.639 
to on enough and then engage the heading
mode<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.280> autopilot<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.780> now<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.470> will

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
mode of the autopilot and now it will

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.120 
mode of the autopilot and now it will
take<00:02:10.709> us<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.000> heading<00:02:12.300> back<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
take us you see the heading back on the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.350 
take us you see the heading back on the
HSI<00:02:14.690> has<00:02:15.690> now<00:02:16.200> changed<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.010> put<00:02:17.250> its<00:02:17.910> position

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
HSI has now changed to put its position

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.340 
HSI has now changed to put its position
and<00:02:18.569> it's<00:02:19.290> directly<00:02:19.800> where<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.310> vor<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:21.350> so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and it's directly where the vor is so

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.160 
and it's directly where the vor is so
yeah<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.640> anis<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.090> now<00:02:24.209> taking<00:02:24.569> us<00:02:24.690> directly

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
yeah the anis is now taking us directly

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.440 
yeah the anis is now taking us directly
to<00:02:25.380> our<00:02:25.410> first<00:02:25.950> web<00:02:26.130> launch<00:02:26.340> which<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:27.000> what<00:02:27.299> we

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
to our first web launch which is what we

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.259 
to our first web launch which is what we
wanted<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:27.950> wanted<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.160> do<00:02:29.310> so<00:02:29.640> it's

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
wanted you wanted it to do so it's

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.509 
wanted you wanted it to do so it's
perfect

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.979 

so<00:02:35.519> we<00:02:35.790> are<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.360> climb<00:02:36.569> out<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.900> we

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
so we are now in the climb out and we

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.110 
so we are now in the climb out and we
can<00:02:37.170> check<00:02:37.410> our<00:02:37.680> position<00:02:38.489> on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:40.400> CDU<00:02:41.430> or<00:02:41.610> our

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
can check our position on the CDU or our

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.240 
can check our position on the CDU or our
distance<00:02:42.660> tweet<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.080> first<00:02:43.769> Waypoint<00:02:43.920> which

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
distance tweet the first Waypoint which

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.380 
distance tweet the first Waypoint which
is<00:02:44.400> 70<00:02:44.730> miles<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:47.280> also<00:02:47.459> indicating<00:02:47.970> 17

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
is 70 miles and it's also indicating 17

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.140 
is 70 miles and it's also indicating 17
DME<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.260> admin<00:02:49.530> vor<00:02:49.950> so<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:50.489> exactly

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
DME to the admin vor so that's exactly

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.410 
DME to the admin vor so that's exactly
what<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.450> wanted<00:02:51.690> to<00:02:51.840> have<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.970> yeah<00:02:53.970> we<00:02:54.120> can

what we wanted to have so yeah we can

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
what we wanted to have so yeah we can
route<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.930> our<00:02:54.959> first<00:02:55.380> Waypoint<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> on

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
route to our first Waypoint in the on

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.780 
route to our first Waypoint in the on

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
our inertial navigation system navigated

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.509 
our inertial navigation system navigated
flight<00:03:00.000> great<00:03:01.670> you<00:03:02.670> might<00:03:02.820> notice<00:03:03.269> that<00:03:03.450> the

the<00:03:32.549> flight<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:33.090> have<00:03:33.600> to<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.230> bit<00:03:34.590> to<00:03:34.709> correct

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
the flight we have to a bit to correct

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.640 
the flight we have to a bit to correct
our<00:03:35.600> correct<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.780> system<00:03:37.139> because<00:03:37.440> it's<00:03:39.650> well

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
our correct the system because it's well

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.030 
our correct the system because it's well
it<00:03:41.430> works<00:03:41.700> fine<00:03:41.940> on<00:03:42.180> the<00:03:42.299> flag<00:03:43.230> but<00:03:43.440> first<00:03:43.889> you

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
it works fine on the flag but first you

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.720 
it works fine on the flag but first you
gotta<00:03:44.850> somehow<00:03:45.450> bring<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.930> into<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.139> position

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
gotta somehow bring it into a position

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.979 
gotta somehow bring it into a position
something<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.940> met<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.590> yeah<00:03:49.819> we<00:03:50.959> yeah<00:03:51.959> we

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
something that met so yeah we yeah we

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.460 
something that met so yeah we yeah we
are<00:03:52.200> now<00:03:52.290> exactly<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:53.389> inbound<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.690> Edmund

video you can see the heading

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.020 
video you can see the heading
here<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:04.040> RMIT<00:04:05.040> needle<00:04:05.520> is<00:04:05.640> also

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
here and the RMIT needle is also

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.760 
here and the RMIT needle is also
pointing<00:04:06.300> directly<00:04:06.630> to<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.970> view<00:04:08.970> our<00:04:09.180> so

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
pointing directly to the view our so

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.110 
pointing directly to the view our so
yeah<00:04:10.770> we<00:04:11.010> are<00:04:11.040> directly<00:04:11.400> in<00:04:11.580> bounds<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:11.970> that

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
yeah we are directly in bounds to that

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:20.080 
yeah we are directly in bounds to that
one<00:04:12.300> and<00:04:13.460> bit<00:04:14.460> rainy<00:04:14.730> outside<00:04:14.970> but<00:04:15.570> well<00:04:16.320> yeah

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.680 

maybe<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.239> did<00:04:22.170> it<00:04:22.260> a<00:04:22.290> bit<00:04:22.470> too<00:04:22.800> quick<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.690> when

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
maybe I did it a bit too quick and when

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.750 
maybe I did it a bit too quick and when
I<00:04:24.720> told<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.620> what<00:04:25.890> that<00:04:25.920> would<00:04:26.250> be<00:04:26.370> Waypoint

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
I told you what that would be Waypoint

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.750 
I told you what that would be Waypoint
change<00:04:26.970> but<00:04:27.750> with<00:04:27.930> that<00:04:28.050> you<00:04:28.110> already<00:04:28.760> learned

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
change but with that you already learned

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.010 
change but with that you already learned
how<00:04:30.000> to<00:04:30.030> navigate<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.530> other<00:04:32.190> waypoints<00:04:32.820> so<00:04:33.450> it

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
how to navigate to other waypoints so it

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
how to navigate to other waypoints so it
works<00:04:34.320> like<00:04:34.650> that

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
works like that

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.450 
works like that
wave<00:04:35.700> one<00:04:35.850> zero<00:04:36.150> always<00:04:36.690> stores<00:04:37.470> our<00:04:37.740> current

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
wave one zero always stores our current

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.020 
wave one zero always stores our current
position<00:04:38.790> and<00:04:39.260> okay<00:04:40.310> right<00:04:41.310> now<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.520> alert

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
position and okay right now the alert

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.800 
position and okay right now the alert
lights<00:04:42.420> came<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:43.200> both<00:04:44.010> CD<00:04:44.310> use<00:04:44.580> which<00:04:45.420> means

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
lights came on both CD use which means

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.760 
lights came on both CD use which means
that<00:04:46.200> we<00:04:46.380> are<00:04:46.940> two<00:04:47.940> minutes<00:04:48.120> or<00:04:49.110> less<00:04:49.140> away

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
that we are two minutes or less away

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.110 
that we are two minutes or less away
from<00:04:50.220> our<00:04:50.900> Waypoint<00:04:51.900> we<00:04:52.530> are<00:04:52.650> going<00:04:52.890> to<00:04:53.120> so

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
from our Waypoint we are going to so

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.560 
from our Waypoint we are going to so
that's<00:04:54.510> typical<00:04:55.170> that's<00:04:55.560> total<00:04:55.950> normally

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
that's typical that's total normally

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.530 
that's typical that's total normally
total<00:04:57.570> normal<00:04:57.660> and<00:04:58.910> well<00:04:59.910> yeah<00:05:00.060> it's<00:05:00.240> just

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
total normal and well yeah it's just

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.760 
total normal and well yeah it's just
indicating<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.020> we<00:05:01.230> are<00:05:01.260> two<00:05:01.440> minutes<00:05:01.590> away

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
indicating that we are two minutes away

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.370 
indicating that we are two minutes away
of<00:05:02.010> our<00:05:02.600> waypoints<00:05:03.600> you<00:05:03.690> you<00:05:03.810> see<00:05:03.960> on<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.230> Left

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
of our waypoints you you see on the Left

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.500 
of our waypoints you you see on the Left
Center<00:05:04.710> distance<00:05:04.860> which<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.940> seven<00:05:06.360> nautical

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
Center distance which is seven nautical

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.920 
Center distance which is seven nautical
miles<00:05:06.870> and<00:05:07.460> on<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.580> right<00:05:08.730> side<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.720> time

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
miles and on the right side the time

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.850 
miles and on the right side the time
which<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.470> one<00:05:10.680> point<00:05:10.950> four<00:05:11.160> minutes<00:05:12.650> now<00:05:13.650> one

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
which is one point four minutes now one

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.580 
which is one point four minutes now one
point<00:05:14.100> three<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.670> yeah<00:05:15.480> 90<00:05:15.930> seconds<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.320> go<00:05:16.530> and

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
point three so yeah 90 seconds to go and

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.260 
point three so yeah 90 seconds to go and
yeah<00:05:19.590> and<00:05:19.890> when<00:05:20.310> we<00:05:20.430> reach<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.880> white<00:05:21.030> point

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
yeah and when we reach the white point

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.030 
yeah and when we reach the white point
it<00:05:21.360> will<00:05:21.480> come<00:05:21.870> it<00:05:22.230> will<00:05:22.380> go<00:05:22.560> off<00:05:22.710> the<00:05:22.890> light

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
it will come it will go off the light

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.000 
it will come it will go off the light
and<00:05:24.950> the<00:05:26.690> numbers<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:28.020> from<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.590> display

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
and the numbers and the from to display

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.560 
and the numbers and the from to display
will<00:05:29.370> change<00:05:29.400> from<00:05:30.030> one<00:05:30.960> -<00:05:31.790> from<00:05:32.790> one<00:05:33.150> to<00:05:33.330> two

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
will change from one - from one to two

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.110 
will change from one - from one to two
so<00:05:34.170> there<00:05:34.350> will<00:05:34.410> be<00:05:34.470> a<00:05:34.560> one<00:05:34.800> and<00:05:34.980> two<00:05:35.250> means

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
so there will be a one and two means

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.180 
so there will be a one and two means
we're<00:05:36.330> going<00:05:36.570> from<00:05:36.690> Waypoint<00:05:37.110> 1<00:05:37.290> to<00:05:37.530> Y<00:05:37.650> point<00:05:37.920> -

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
we're going from Waypoint 1 to Y point -

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.070 
we're going from Waypoint 1 to Y point -
at<00:05:38.670> the<00:05:38.760> moment<00:05:38.910> we're<00:05:39.150> going<00:05:39.270> from<00:05:39.660> Waypoint

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
at the moment we're going from Waypoint

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.110 
at the moment we're going from Waypoint
zero<00:05:40.290> which<00:05:40.800> is<00:05:40.980> our<00:05:41.280> present<00:05:41.670> position<00:05:41.790> to

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 
zero which is our present position to

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.440 
zero which is our present position to
Waypoint<00:05:42.450> one<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:44.520> we<00:05:45.000> will<00:05:45.120> just<00:05:47.210> I'll<00:05:48.210> just

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
Waypoint one so we will just I'll just

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.790 
Waypoint one so we will just I'll just
explain<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:49.020> on<00:05:49.140> the<00:05:49.260> next<00:05:49.740> on<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:51.800> waypoints

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
explain you on the next on the waypoints

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.950 
explain you on the next on the waypoints
how<00:05:52.920> to<00:05:52.980> change<00:05:53.850> position<00:05:54.300> directly<00:05:54.780> to

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
how to change position directly to

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.610 
how to change position directly to
another<00:05:55.050> Waypoint<00:05:56.270> so<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.930> system<00:05:58.350> already

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
another Waypoint so the system already

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.680 
another Waypoint so the system already
is<00:05:59.010> going<00:05:59.460> from<00:05:59.640> weapon<00:06:00.000> one<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.330> two<00:06:00.480> now<00:06:00.660> so

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
is going from weapon one to two now so
