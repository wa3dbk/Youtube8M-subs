00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
I think things changed a little bit and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.710 
I think things changed a little bit and
people<00:00:41.580> want<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.180> judges<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.630> see

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
people want the judges want to see

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.510 
people want the judges want to see
really<00:00:42.930> big<00:00:43.080> move<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:44.190> something

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
really big move and that's something

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.280 
really big move and that's something
that<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.850> because<00:00:45.240> I<00:00:45.540> kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.930> feel<00:00:46.080> more

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
that I like because I kind of feel more

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.620
