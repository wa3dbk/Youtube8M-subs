00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.930
 for someone very special here I teach you 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.930
 how to do it 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.440
 the material is going to be two types 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.560
 different cardboard decoration here 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.230
 I have these two one play and one with a 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.619
 design the plan has glitter are given 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.619
 account 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.050
 These can be found in books 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.050
 who sell well 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.070
 so you can choose the color 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.530
 that you want and the design that 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.050
 you want it or you can do it anyway 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.750
 with cardboard plane with nothing and you 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.420
 You can decorate it to your liking too 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.579
 We are going to need scissors 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.829
 glue 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.560
 a pencil 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.329
 a rule 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.620
 a ribbon 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:06.220
 and stickers so they can decorate their 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.230
 box and accessories to decorate 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.210
 Now what are we going to do with our 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.330
 cardboard that is going to be our base 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.390
 let's make a square of 24 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:19.750
 centimeters by 24 centimeters after 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.110
 we are going to divide it into 8 centimeters and 16 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.500
 centimeters the four sides and so will 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.390
 to be with 9 squares I am 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.940
 marking with pencil so that you 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.250
 can you see what I did what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.760
 they can do nothing else put marquitas 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.540
 here on the banks and with a ruler 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.360
 they can go marking 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:46.100
 to be able to do the folds and not 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 you need to scratch your your box 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.420
 now we are going to cut these four 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 square of the corners but before 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.190
 cut it we're going to make a few tabs 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.260
 so we can paste it when we go to 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.260
 cut the only thing they can do is 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.080
 they can put it that way 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.509
 and cut here 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.230
 and it's going to stay like that and now there's only 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.590
 to hit and so we will have the 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.590
 small box 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.069
 now we're going to put it aside and we're going 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.980
 to continue with the rest now with our 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.250
 another piece of cardboard we are going to do 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.910
 a rectangle of 32 point 10 centimeters 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.020
 by 16 points 5 centimeters 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:46.120
 we are going to divide it into four points 10 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.780
 12 points 30 20 points 50 and 28 points 10 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.250
 centimeters to the width throughout 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.530
 we are going to divide it into four points 10 and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:00.340
 12.30 we will mark it up and down 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:03.790
 go to the sides then let's mark 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.260
 the folds we are going to join the lines and 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.830
 let's cut the 4 rectangles of the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.380
 corners and let's make a little eyelash 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.320
 to be able to paste it like we did with 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.380
 the square will be like this now 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.320
 let's cut the rectangle that is 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.090
 here in the middle up and down and going to 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.850
 stay like this 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.560
 Now let's paste it with the tabs 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.900
 A) Yes 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:38.050
 and since we have it stuck we are going to 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.420
 paste our box here in the center 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.500
 and that's how our box will fit 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:48.100
 surprise we can close 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.650
 and with the ribbon we are going to tie it to 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.570
 that the box does not open and they can 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.070
 use your stickers can put here 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:04:00.970
 inside the gift that they are going to put a 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:03.450
 note what you want and so I 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.100
 I am my little box I hope you liked it 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.300
 and see you in the next tutorial 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.300
 God bless you
