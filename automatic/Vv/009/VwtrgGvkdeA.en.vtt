00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
hanging I have tons of iron so I want to

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.450 
hanging I have tons of iron so I want to
make<00:01:17.610> some<00:01:17.850> minecart<00:01:18.780> track<00:01:19.310> look<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.369> all

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
make some minecart track look at all

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.920 
make some minecart track look at all
that<00:01:20.610> iron<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.970> could<00:01:21.150> make<00:01:21.270> tons<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.659> track

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that iron I could make tons of track

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
that iron I could make tons of track
with<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:23.869> maybe<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:25.290> could<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:26.670> I

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
with that so maybe we could do like I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.120 
with that so maybe we could do like I
don't<00:01:27.090> know<00:01:27.270> pick<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.600> direction<00:01:27.840> okay<00:01:28.710> let's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130

don't know pick a direction okay let's
go<00:01:29.250> outside<00:01:29.400> pick<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> direction<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:31.110> see

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
go outside pick a direction and just see

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.960 
go outside pick a direction and just see
how<00:01:31.439> far<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.920> track<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.340> take<00:01:32.520> me<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.850> then

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
how far the track and take me and then

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.810 
how far the track and take me and then
start<00:01:33.509> something<00:01:33.840> over<00:01:34.020> there<00:01:34.700> let's<00:01:35.700> see

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
start something over there let's see

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.160 
start something over there let's see
here<00:01:36.030> okay<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:38.570> one<00:01:39.570> way<00:01:39.689> we<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.960> go

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
here okay so we have one way we can go

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.630 
here okay so we have one way we can go
is<00:01:40.470> past<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.189> monster<00:01:41.310> spawner<00:01:42.619> um<00:01:43.619> let's<00:01:44.490> see

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
is past the monster spawner um let's see

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.910 
is past the monster spawner um let's see
whether<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> way<00:01:45.090> away<00:01:46.020> could<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.290> towards

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
whether the way away could be towards

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.899 
whether the way away could be towards
the<00:01:47.159> portal<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:48.710> then<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.460> other<00:01:50.490> way<00:01:50.729> would

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the portal and then the other way would

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.200 
the portal and then the other way would
be<00:01:50.970> through<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:53.130> mountain<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.520> guess<00:01:53.729> or<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
be through the mountain I guess or the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
be through the mountain I guess or the
other<00:01:54.329> way<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.600> could<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.840> through<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> tree

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
other way it could be through the tree

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.649 
other way it could be through the tree
farm<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.369> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> preference

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
farm so if you if you have a preference

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
farm so if you if you have a preference
on<00:01:58.110> which<00:01:58.740> way<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> would<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
on which way you would like me to go and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.149 
on which way you would like me to go and
i'll<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.479> create<00:02:00.780> track<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.710> long<00:02:01.920> as<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
i'll just create track for as long as it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.779 
i'll just create track for as long as it
takes<00:02:02.509> until<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.469> run<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.799> traffic

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
takes until I run out of traffic

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.040 
takes until I run out of traffic
creates<00:02:06.789> reckon<00:02:07.090> so<00:02:07.179> I<00:02:07.240> run<00:02:07.420> on<00:02:07.539> track<00:02:07.869> and

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
creates reckon so I run on track and

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.690 
creates reckon so I run on track and
then<00:02:08.170> we'll<00:02:08.349> see<00:02:08.590> what's<00:02:08.800> going<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.489> over
