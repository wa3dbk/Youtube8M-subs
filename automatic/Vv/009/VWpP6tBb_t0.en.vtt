00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
and forth which is really the same thing

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.090 
and forth which is really the same thing
as<00:04:42.870> the

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
as the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.120 
as the
art<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:47.110> get<00:04:47.260> your<00:04:47.410> thumb<00:04:47.560> going<00:04:47.770> back<00:04:47.980> and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
art you get your thumb going back and

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.530 
art you get your thumb going back and
forth<00:04:48.400> between<00:04:49.080> your<00:04:50.080> bass<00:04:50.530> note<00:04:51.540> and

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
forth between your bass note and

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.150 
forth between your bass note and
sometimes<00:04:53.200> you<00:04:53.290> can<00:04:53.410> hit<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.620> fourth<00:04:53.860> string

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
sometimes you can hit the fourth string

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.180 
sometimes you can hit the fourth string
or<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.460> can<00:04:54.580> hit<00:04:54.670> the<00:04:54.790> third<00:04:55.000> string<00:04:55.330> and<00:04:56.190> then

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
or you can hit the third string and then

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.610 
or you can hit the third string and then
you<00:04:57.340> try<00:04:58.240> to<00:04:58.270> get<00:04:58.480> your<00:04:58.600> fingers<00:04:58.960> in<00:04:58.990> there<00:04:59.380> and

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
you try to get your fingers in there and

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.420 
you try to get your fingers in there and
the<00:05:00.340> easiest<00:05:00.520> way<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.150> to<00:05:01.180> go<00:05:01.450> from<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.050> thumb

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
the easiest way is to go from the thumb

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.620 
the easiest way is to go from the thumb
to<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.580> index

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.670 

the<00:05:07.630> thumb<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.229> then<00:05:09.039> back<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.319> second

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
the thumb and then back to the second

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:21.540 
the thumb and then back to the second
finger<00:05:11.860> so<00:05:12.099> that's<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.580> continuous<00:05:17.940> index<00:05:20.550> over

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
finger so that's a continuous index over

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.210 
finger so that's a continuous index over
to<00:05:21.759> the<00:05:21.880> third<00:05:22.060> string<00:05:22.479> with<00:05:22.720> your<00:05:22.750> thumb<00:05:23.220> back

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
to the third string with your thumb back

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.950 
to the third string with your thumb back
to<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.669> first<00:05:25.030> string<00:05:25.300> with<00:05:25.360> your<00:05:25.599> second

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
to the first string with your second

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:34.980 
to the first string with your second
finger<00:05:26.280> it's<00:05:27.280> kind<00:05:27.490> of<00:05:27.520> like<00:05:27.699> a<00:05:27.729> pendulum

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.990 

just<00:05:35.990> do<00:05:36.289> that<00:05:36.530> over<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.069> over<00:05:37.310> again

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.460 

there's<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.090> lot<00:05:43.330> of<00:05:43.480> determination<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:44.320> do

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
there's a lot of determination to do

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.580 
there's a lot of determination to do
that<00:05:45.420> but<00:05:46.420> it's<00:05:46.540> worth<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:46.960> because<00:05:47.170> after<00:05:47.560> a

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
that but it's worth it because after a

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:57.980 
that but it's worth it because after a
while<00:05:47.620> you<00:05:47.950> can<00:05:48.070> get<00:05:48.250> speed<00:05:48.850> up

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.980 

so<00:05:58.889> many<00:05:59.069> songs<00:05:59.370> of<00:05:59.850> the<00:05:59.940> folk<00:06:00.180> era<00:06:00.449> were<00:06:00.750> done

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990 
so many songs of the folk era were done

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:06.409 
so many songs of the folk era were done
like<00:06:01.919> that<00:06:04.069> songs<00:06:05.069> by<00:06:05.340> all<00:06:05.970> kinds<00:06:06.360> of

well-known<00:06:06.630> groups<00:06:08.240> and<00:06:09.240> once<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.599> hear<00:06:09.780> that

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
well-known groups and once you hear that

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.870 
well-known groups and once you hear that
sound<00:06:10.050> you'll<00:06:10.770> know<00:06:10.919> what<00:06:11.099> it<00:06:11.220> is<00:06:11.370> that's

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
sound you'll know what it is that's

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.029 
sound you'll know what it is that's
gonna<00:06:12.120> try<00:06:12.389> to<00:06:12.449> speak<00:06:12.810> so<00:06:13.680> that<00:06:13.710> could<00:06:14.009> mean

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:14.039 
gonna try to speak so that could mean

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:17.240 
gonna try to speak so that could mean
something<00:06:14.400> you<00:06:14.580> can<00:06:14.699> do<00:06:15.740> to<00:06:16.740> kind<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:16.979> break<00:06:17.220> up

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
something you can do to kind of break up

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:23.159 
something you can do to kind of break up
the<00:06:17.430> monotony<00:06:17.789> of<00:06:18.139> passion<00:06:19.139> strong

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:24.510 

it<00:06:23.500> takes<00:06:23.680> a<00:06:23.800> while<00:06:23.949> to<00:06:23.979> be<00:06:24.190> able<00:06:24.310> to<00:06:24.370> change

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
it takes a while to be able to change

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.390 
it takes a while to be able to change
those<00:06:24.789> chords<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:26.289> still<00:06:26.680> be<00:06:26.889> able<00:06:26.979> to<00:06:27.220> keep
