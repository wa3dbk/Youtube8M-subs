00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
tank real quick all right I got it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.090 
tank real quick all right I got it
mounted<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> left<00:01:10.170> side<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.530> tank<00:01:10.830> for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
mounted on the left side of my tank for

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.100 
mounted on the left side of my tank for
a<00:01:11.130> video<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> feel<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> how

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a video and to kind of get a feel of how

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
a video and to kind of get a feel of how
it<00:01:13.409> works<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.580> four<00:01:14.880> inches<00:01:15.119> below

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
it works it's about four inches below

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.780 
it works it's about four inches below
the<00:01:15.420> waterline<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.409> turn<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.280> off<00:01:17.369> all<00:01:17.640> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
the waterline I turn it off all the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.899 
the waterline I turn it off all the
vortex<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> only<00:01:19.890> thing<00:01:20.159> great<00:01:20.490> current

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
vortex so the only thing great current

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.469 
vortex so the only thing great current
in<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> tank<00:01:21.270> right<00:01:21.479> now<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.110> return<00:01:24.140> see

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
in the tank right now is the return see

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
in the tank right now is the return see
that's<00:01:27.479> returned<00:01:28.080> only<00:01:28.320> flow<00:01:31.850> pick<00:01:32.850> up<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that's returned only flow pick up the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.399 
that's returned only flow pick up the
controller<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.579> turn<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.700> off<00:01:38.000> okay

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.090 

all<00:01:41.920> right<00:01:42.100> so<00:01:42.340> on<00:01:42.580> just<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.540> little<00:01:44.100> wrench

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
all right so on just a little wrench

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.580 
all right so on just a little wrench
here<00:01:45.630> light<00:01:46.630> will<00:01:46.780> turn<00:01:46.930> green<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.470> can

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
here light will turn green you can

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
here light will turn green you can
adjust<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.009> speeds

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
adjust the speeds

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.359 
adjust the speeds
spin<00:01:49.869> this<00:01:50.080> way<00:01:50.320> spin<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.340> right

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
spin this way spin to the right

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.680 
spin this way spin to the right
clockwise<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:52.930> turns<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:53.259> pump<00:01:53.470> up<00:01:57.690> see

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
clockwise and it turns the pump up see

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.749 
clockwise and it turns the pump up see
what<00:01:58.869> he's<00:01:58.990> getting<00:01:59.170> right<00:01:59.409> there<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:03.520> just

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
what he's getting right there you just

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:05.430 
what he's getting right there you just
blew<00:02:03.970> that<00:02:04.119> coral<00:02:04.509> over<00:02:04.659> right<00:02:04.990> that<00:02:05.200> hammer

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
blew that coral over right that hammer

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.309 
blew that coral over right that hammer
and<00:02:05.710> that<00:02:05.799> wall<00:02:05.950> hammer<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:07.090> dying<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:07.840> that

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
and that wall hammer is dying and that

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.970 
and that wall hammer is dying and that
was<00:02:08.500> that<00:02:10.050> C<00:02:11.280> pumps<00:02:12.280> had<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> hundred<00:02:12.760> percent<00:02:12.819> I

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
was that C pumps had a hundred percent I

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
was that C pumps had a hundred percent I
don't<00:02:14.980> know<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.190> can<00:02:15.310> see<00:02:15.459> in<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.700> video

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
don't know if you can see in the video

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.259 
don't know if you can see in the video
but<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.360> blowing<00:02:16.630> sand<00:02:16.870> around<00:02:17.140> pretty<00:02:17.440> good

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
but it's blowing sand around pretty good

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.770 
but it's blowing sand around pretty good
turn<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.300> back<00:02:19.510> down<00:02:21.300> tanks<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.330> little<00:02:22.540> cloudy

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
turn it back down tanks a little cloudy

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.940 
turn it back down tanks a little cloudy
now<00:02:24.660> on<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.720> controller<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.709> want<00:02:26.860> to

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
now on the controller if you want to

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.030 
now on the controller if you want to
switch<00:02:27.160> directions<00:02:27.370> of<00:02:28.470> which<00:02:29.470> way<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.800> flows

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
switch directions of which way the flows

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.199 
switch directions of which way the flows
go<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:31.590> if<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.980> lights<00:02:33.459> turn<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:33.790> from<00:02:34.120> the
