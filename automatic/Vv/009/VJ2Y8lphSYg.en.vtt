00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
this is that like some of the lows the

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.170 
this is that like some of the lows the
mids<00:02:22.710> sometimes<00:02:23.520> get<00:02:23.730> kind<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.000> muddy

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
mids sometimes get kind of muddy

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.100 
mids sometimes get kind of muddy
depending<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> song<00:02:26.600> but<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.810> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
depending on the song but that it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.720 
depending on the song but that it
doesn't<00:02:28.440> it's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.710> too<00:02:28.980> bad<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:31.520> they<00:02:32.520> come

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
doesn't it's not too bad and they come

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.460

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.100 
but they sound a lot better I've also
tried<00:03:08.820> some<00:03:09.120> other<00:03:09.240> headphones<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.930> these

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
tried some other headphones and these

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.250 
tried some other headphones and these
are<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.709> lot<00:03:11.610> better<00:03:11.760> too<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:15.959> heard<00:03:16.110> they're

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
are a lot better too but I heard they're

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.990 
are a lot better too but I heard they're
discontinuing<00:03:16.980> them<00:03:17.190> because<00:03:17.550> I<00:03:17.790> think

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
discontinuing them because I think

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.830 
discontinuing them because I think
they're<00:03:18.150> getting<00:03:18.390> rid<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.690> whole

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
they're getting rid of the whole

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.040 
they're getting rid of the whole
Phillips<00:03:19.380> O'Neill<00:03:19.739> thing<00:03:20.810> so<00:03:23.300> better<00:03:24.300> get

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
Phillips O'Neill thing so better get

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.540 
Phillips O'Neill thing so better get
them<00:03:25.200> pretty<00:03:25.380> quick<00:03:25.650> before<00:03:25.980> they<00:03:26.250> all<00:03:26.370> run

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
them pretty quick before they all run

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.500 
them pretty quick before they all run
out<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:29.430> they<00:03:29.580> say<00:03:29.790> they're<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.480> a

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
out and when they say they're like a

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.240 
out and when they say they're like a
snug<00:03:30.870> fit<00:03:30.900> they<00:03:31.350> definitely<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:32.040> they

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
snug fit they definitely are they

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.860 
snug fit they definitely are they
conform<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> your<00:03:33.120> head<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.570> they're

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
conform to your head because they're

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.350 
conform to your head because they're
like<00:03:33.989> they<00:03:34.950> just<00:03:35.130> sit<00:03:35.340> like<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.519> and<00:03:35.970> then

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
like they just sit like this and then

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.170 
like they just sit like this and then
whatever<00:03:36.540> your<00:03:36.840> head<00:03:36.989> sizes<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.220> stays

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
whatever your head sizes it just stays

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.640 
whatever your head sizes it just stays
there<00:03:39.209> it<00:03:39.570> doesn't<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.019> not<00:03:40.110> too<00:03:40.380> loose<00:03:40.590> not

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
there it doesn't it's not too loose not

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.190 
there it doesn't it's not too loose not
too<00:03:41.010> tight<00:03:41.450> and<00:03:44.510> another<00:03:45.510> complaint<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.050> it

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
too tight and another complaint is it

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.870 
too tight and another complaint is it
doesn't<00:03:46.440> have<00:03:46.560> any<00:03:46.709> like<00:03:46.920> inline<00:03:47.370> remote

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
doesn't have any like inline remote

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.509 
doesn't have any like inline remote
control<00:03:48.420> or<00:03:48.630> anything<00:03:49.080> play/pause<00:03:50.040> nothing

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.479 
control or anything play/pause nothing
like<00:03:50.640> that<00:03:51.590> but<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:52.650> guess<00:03:52.830> if<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.100> pay<00:03:53.220> thirty

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
like that but I guess if you pay thirty

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.840 
like that but I guess if you pay thirty
bucks<00:03:53.700> you<00:03:53.820> don't<00:03:54.000> really<00:03:54.090> need<00:03:54.300> that<00:03:55.370> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.670
