think<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:28.550> know<00:02:28.580> I<00:02:28.700> think<00:02:29.170> sometimes<00:02:30.170> it's

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
think you know I think sometimes it's

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.740 
think you know I think sometimes it's
more<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.860> student<00:02:31.280> sections<00:02:31.760> than<00:02:31.970> then

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
more of the student sections than then

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.510 
more of the student sections than then
the<00:02:32.900> actual<00:02:33.230> game<00:02:33.350> on<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.739> field<00:02:33.980> i<00:02:34.130> think<00:02:34.370> is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
the actual game on the field i think is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.670 
the actual game on the field i think is
highly<00:02:34.850> intense<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.540> hard-hitting<00:02:35.870> but

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
highly intense and hard-hitting but

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.710 
highly intense and hard-hitting but
seems<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:37.340> be<00:02:37.430> very<00:02:37.459> respectful<00:02:38.060> in<00:02:38.390> sports
