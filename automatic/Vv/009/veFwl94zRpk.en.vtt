you need a flashlight here you go right
here<00:03:30.780> 650<00:03:31.650> hours<00:03:31.680> worth<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.280> power<00:03:32.490> now<00:03:33.390> as

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
here 650 hours worth the power now as

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.780 
here 650 hours worth the power now as
far<00:03:34.290> as<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.590> charging<00:03:35.010> capabilities<00:03:35.640> with

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
far as the charging capabilities with

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.850 
far as the charging capabilities with
this<00:03:35.940> thing<00:03:36.180> goes<00:03:36.420> this<00:03:37.320> is<00:03:37.500> how<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.650> know

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
this thing goes this is how you know

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.160 
this thing goes this is how you know
where<00:03:38.040> you<00:03:38.130> stand<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.760> simple<00:03:39.390> click<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.900> going

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
where you stand a simple click is going

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.410 
where you stand a simple click is going
to<00:03:40.350> show<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.590> five<00:03:41.100> blue<00:03:41.370> lights<00:03:41.640> each<00:03:41.940> one<00:03:42.300> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
to show you five blue lights each one of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.180 
to show you five blue lights each one of
these<00:03:42.510> represents<00:03:42.810> twenty<00:03:43.530> percent<00:03:43.950> charge

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
these represents twenty percent charge

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.220 
these represents twenty percent charge
so<00:03:44.550> if<00:03:44.670> one<00:03:44.910> is<00:03:45.090> lit<00:03:45.300> up<00:03:45.330> it<00:03:45.810> means<00:03:45.990> this

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
so if one is lit up it means this

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.010 
so if one is lit up it means this
battery<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.680> only<00:03:46.980> charged<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.490> 20<00:03:47.820> percent<00:03:48.020> 40

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
battery is only charged up 20 percent 40

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.860 
battery is only charged up 20 percent 40
60<00:03:49.560> 80<00:03:49.770> 100<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.820> so<00:03:50.910> forth<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.300> so<00:03:51.390> on

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
60 80 100 and so forth and so on

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.750 
60 80 100 and so forth and so on
so<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.470> other<00:03:52.560> words<00:03:52.800> if<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.160> last<00:03:53.430> blue

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
so in other words if this last blue

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.180 
so in other words if this last blue
light<00:03:53.940> is<00:03:54.209> flashing<00:03:54.570> it<00:03:55.380> means<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:55.950> I'm<00:03:56.070> at

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
light is flashing it means that I'm at

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.770 
light is flashing it means that I'm at
about<00:03:56.280> eighty<00:03:56.640> percent<00:03:56.760> charge<00:03:57.360> on<00:03:57.630> this

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
about eighty percent charge on this

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.240 
about eighty percent charge on this
battery<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.380> that's<00:03:58.560> how<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.709> know<00:03:58.950> where<00:03:59.130> you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
battery so that's how you know where you

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.960 
battery so that's how you know where you
stand

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
stand

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.180 
stand
it's<00:04:00.660> really<00:04:00.959> simple<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.380> use<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.709> thing<00:04:01.950> I'm

appropriate side for charging and in

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.180 
appropriate side for charging and in
this<00:04:15.330> case<00:04:15.600> I<00:04:15.900> purposely<00:04:16.410> charged<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:16.950> into

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
this case I purposely charged it into

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
this case I purposely charged it into
the<00:04:17.250> wrong<00:04:17.430> side<00:04:17.730> that's<00:04:18.359> going<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.750> a<00:04:18.780> side

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
the wrong side that's going to be a side

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.710 
the wrong side that's going to be a side
that<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.320> would<00:04:19.470> use<00:04:19.830> for<00:04:20.220> let's<00:04:20.669> say<00:04:20.970> your

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
that you would use for let's say your

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.450 
that you would use for let's say your
tablets<00:04:22.229> it<00:04:22.380> outputs<00:04:22.830> the<00:04:23.040> power<00:04:23.190> at<00:04:23.370> a

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
tablets it outputs the power at a

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.180 
tablets it outputs the power at a
different<00:04:24.140> amperage<00:04:25.140> so<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.650> not<00:04:25.830> going<00:04:26.100> to

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
different amperage so it is not going to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.650 
different amperage so it is not going to
charge<00:04:26.370> my<00:04:26.610> device<00:04:26.940> it's<00:04:27.180> not<00:04:27.240> going<00:04:27.510> to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
charge my device it's not going to

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.150 
charge my device it's not going to
damage<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.230> but<00:04:28.260> it's<00:04:28.500> not<00:04:28.650> going<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.860> charge

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
damage it but it's not going to charge

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.070 
damage it but it's not going to charge
it<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.430> you're<00:04:29.550> gonna<00:04:29.610> swap<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.210> out<00:04:30.330> plug<00:04:30.960> it

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it so you're gonna swap it out plug it

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.830 
it so you're gonna swap it out plug it
into<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.380> appropriate<00:04:31.680> port<00:04:32.160> and<00:04:32.660> there<00:04:33.660> you

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
into the appropriate port and there you

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.780 
into the appropriate port and there you
go<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.080> can<00:04:34.260> see<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:34.920> is<00:04:35.040> now<00:04:35.190> charging

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
go you can see that it is now charging

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:36.770 
go you can see that it is now charging
my<00:04:36.210> iPhone

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:36.780 
my iPhone

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.080

yeah<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.710> that's<00:04:37.830> gonna<00:04:37.980> work<00:04:38.190> just<00:04:38.250> fine<00:04:38.730> so

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
yeah and that's gonna work just fine so

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.780 
yeah and that's gonna work just fine so
and<00:04:39.390> it<00:04:39.660> charges<00:04:40.020> it<00:04:40.170> at<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.710> pretty<00:04:41.160> rapid<00:04:41.580> rate

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790 
and it charges it at a pretty rapid rate

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.940 
and it charges it at a pretty rapid rate
too<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.390> it's<00:04:42.510> not<00:04:42.570> charging<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.320> slowly<00:04:43.650> I

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
too so it's not charging it slowly I
