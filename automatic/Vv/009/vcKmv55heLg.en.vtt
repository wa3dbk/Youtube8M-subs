00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
people the whole host of reasons why

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.160 
people the whole host of reasons why
we've<00:01:22.049> kept<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.380> clean<00:01:22.530> sheet<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:24.990> it

we've kept a clean sheet and you know it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.620 
we've kept a clean sheet and you know it
I<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.740> say<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.310> been<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.240> been<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.420> good

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
I could say it's been a it's been a good

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.530 
I could say it's been a it's been a good
season<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.770> clean<00:01:29.549> sheets<00:01:29.759> don't<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.150> come

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
season but clean sheets don't just come

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
season but clean sheets don't just come
from<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> goalkeeper<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.290> come<00:01:31.439> from

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
from the goalkeeper they come from

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.010 
from the goalkeeper they come from
everywhere<00:01:31.950> I<00:01:32.360> suppose<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> club<00:01:33.630> deserves<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
everywhere I suppose the club deserves a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
everywhere I suppose the club deserves a
fair<00:01:34.590> bit<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.799> craic<00:01:35.009> given<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.369> you've<00:01:35.490> not
