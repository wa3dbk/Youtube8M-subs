00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.809
 and good a goal under the goal and good 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.000
 I did not lower my arms and I think that gave me 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.340
 do not 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.420
 well forward to know that another science 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.099
 will have and good luckily time in 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.630
 that sense that you clicked on her 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.830
 before this rabat area and then as 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.570
 that you could not go back into 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.940
 tuning in the bench I'm sure 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.350
 I want to grow as a player 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:33.570
 well I wish I can continue like this of almeyda 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.040
 this is that they are all the same as you 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.010
 have this confidence that you have it 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.900
 cirigliano mauro dÃ­az chichi and is very 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.230
 important because we know that there is 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.970
 trust us and we have to 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.790
 give it to him with football and if he gives us the 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.720
 opportunity to try to take advantage of them 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.370
 to the maximum so we can either surrender or 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.050
 how important it is for you to do 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.550
 goals when I ask you the sensations 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.040
 they are of skills because now a 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.640
 little bit colder but very happy 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.980
 because he could win as I told you 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.659
 we had three passes of the thread and we knew 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.900
 that we need a victory and for 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.890
 luck we played well and we could go to 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.020
 personar the feeling that you are 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.830
 starting to put in a commitment 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.320
 Almeida and those commitments that 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.320
 technicians says we're sure 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.899
 expected gives you a lot of confidence as 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.820
 amaury toas emiliano and good we have 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.649
 try to take advantage and show inside 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.990
 of the court and try to play out there 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.299
 also with the ball you and your good 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.760
 work is necessary in the countries 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:40.660
 Yes i think 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:42.850
 try to enter well to mount it with my 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.390
 mates we ran everything the same I think 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.010
 we shared that the first one had 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.720
 a lot of anger since you could not convert 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.820
 you have to be strong in your head to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.500
 overcome that moment later when you play 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.510
 the ball felt when it touched the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.620
 ball felt a whisper is the 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.710
 moment that a player has to be 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 well tempered yes sure and apart after 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.860
 of that came to the criminal and well I thought that 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.990
 all the people fell down so but 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.690
 good luckily chichi did his job 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.800
 to stop the penalty and happy for that 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.640
 because it changed the destiny to the party 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.640
 We made a great match and well, neither did 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.510
 people always putea me me silva 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.280
 I think it's normal and as I said people 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.220
 wants results and if we have them that 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.930
 give but good also the people that I 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.250
 prodigo and good he deserves that 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.440
 victory for the people but the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.750
 recognition for the future is 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.490
 important for you yes sure I think 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.610
 the player always wants to be good with 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.610
 people 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.090
 I want to show that I can play and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.090
 happy that people did not lose
