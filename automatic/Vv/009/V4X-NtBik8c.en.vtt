00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910 
pouch and let's make some magic happen
so<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.820> go<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.450> nice<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.200> snug<00:02:01.409> in

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so there you go it's nice and snug in

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.969 
so there you go it's nice and snug in
there<00:02:02.159> almost<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.969> little<00:02:03.390> too<00:02:03.509> snug<00:02:03.780> but<00:02:04.740> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
there almost a little too snug but you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.340 
there almost a little too snug but you
got<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.310> remember<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:06.450> well<00:02:06.719> break<00:02:07.110> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
got to remember that this well break in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.350 
got to remember that this well break in
and<00:02:07.619> it'll<00:02:08.009> eventually<00:02:08.280> become<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.030> little

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and it'll eventually become a little

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.350 
and it'll eventually become a little
more<00:02:09.920> freely<00:02:10.920> moving<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.610> guess<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.000> would<00:02:12.150> say

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
more freely moving I guess you would say

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.700 
more freely moving I guess you would say
because<00:02:12.720> right<00:02:13.470> now

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
because right now

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.590 
because right now
it<00:02:13.890> does<00:02:14.130> have<00:02:14.370> quite<00:02:14.670> a<00:02:14.730> bit<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.210> snug<00:02:15.570> fit

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it does have quite a bit of a snug fit

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.990 
it does have quite a bit of a snug fit
but<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.470> do<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:16.830> mind<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.460> has<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.580> snug<00:02:17.970> fit

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
but I do not mind that it has a snug fit

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.180 
but I do not mind that it has a snug fit
either<00:02:18.480> because<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.170> means<00:02:19.620> my<00:02:19.830> iPhone

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
either because that means my iPhone

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.460 
either because that means my iPhone

big deal the only downside to using a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.520 
big deal the only downside to using a
case<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.730> this<00:03:14.940> is<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.630> fact<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:16.290> you're

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
case like this is the fact that you're

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.650 
case like this is the fact that you're
kind<00:03:16.950> of<00:03:17.130> you<00:03:17.520> know<00:03:17.640> stuck<00:03:18.090> from<00:03:18.330> being<00:03:18.540> able

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
kind of you know stuck from being able

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870 
kind of you know stuck from being able
to<00:03:18.840> check<00:03:19.110> your<00:03:19.290> phone<00:03:19.500> every<00:03:20.190> waking<00:03:20.640> minute

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
to check your phone every waking minute

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.730 
to check your phone every waking minute
because<00:03:21.510> you<00:03:21.540> do<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.930> pull<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.320> out<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
because you do have to pull it out and

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.040 
because you do have to pull it out and
you<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.280> unlock<00:03:23.880> it<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.330> see<00:03:24.510> what's<00:03:24.750> going

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
you know unlock it and see what's going

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.630 
you know unlock it and see what's going
on<00:03:25.140> here<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.770> that's<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.250> only<00:03:26.430> downside

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
on here so that's the only downside

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.010 
on here so that's the only downside
there<00:03:27.180> but<00:03:27.390> if<00:03:27.480> you're<00:03:27.630> somebody<00:03:27.960> that

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
there but if you're somebody that
