 it is busier than normal at the 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.769
 Thursday morning training from fc 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.240
 groningen 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:12.550
 the reason does not have to be long 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.410
 reflected most and occur 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.730
 hedwiges maduro that this morning before 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.230
 The first train with his new 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.000
 club fc groningen 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.590
 the first impression is actually a good thing 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.660
 I expected and plays effortlessly 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.430
 me good choices 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.020
 now great training what can he do 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.699
 contribute to the team 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.039
 it all starts with just a good one 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.119
 playing football of course but in addition 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.550
 the boy who has so many competitions 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.739
 played internationally 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.360
 premier league at major clubs 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.860
 that is important for us 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.200
 we have lost some boys 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.030
 those animals that also have more competitions 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.219
 played those who had a lot of experience 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.930
 which is a category 25 plus and also 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.270
 Keep coaching abilities 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.649
 hedwiges it is whose it can also be it 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.719
 Clearly it's not just for that either 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.190
 for the european tournament or something is me 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.149
 think him for the matches too 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.980
 afterwards 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.420
 so if you play the European Cup on Thursday 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.559
 in need Sunday again 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.719
 It he then again know what is being asked 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.940
 and things can be sharp again 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.130
 so that we also include those competitions 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.899
 to play europe cups very well 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.219
 coming Saturday and FC Groningen 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.590
 visit at fc utrecht 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.240
 but duro is entitled to play so he should 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.189
 could already take action on Saturday 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.479
 he would like to be able to play things he is sitting 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.029
 you look fat he just has one 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.380
 so complete training can participate 

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.880
 he knows the players not so well and 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.039
 the way of playing nothing but I think 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.990
 that he might play a role 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:26.709
 fc utrecht is yet to come for abel tamata 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.749
 asked 

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.700
 On the positive side, we are dealing with tomatoes 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.319
 the field it is on the way back is that 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.630
 He told FC a few weeks ago 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.159
 Twente injured 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.329
 FC Groningen has the traditional 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.770
 difficult in utrecht 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.479
 but the FC Utrecht is from last year 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.990
 another team to the current FC 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.700
 utrecht 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.249
 yes he is something this year 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.359
 otherwise started something else with the hague 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.069
 as a new trainer also with a whole 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:51.549
 new system actually what nobody in it 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.989
 the netherlands plays 532 out of 352 that is you 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.479
 that it requires something else from us 

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:56.590
 so then we have to do something there 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.939
 on adjust 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.499
 we performed today it looked 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.329
 well off a surprise that will be 

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:03.999
 I don't know that I do everyone 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.380
 just have to do what what what n girl 

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.259
 dedicated 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.099
 then we have to see that that is us 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.000
 plan will succeed 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.340
 so of course not a plan with you 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 every week from the caste it has to go 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.560
 but there is one for this competition 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.150
 challenge for us 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.829
 and it also fits a bit in it 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.030
 season what i what i hope the 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.489
 development that we continue to make that 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.890
 We do it ourselves regardless of the opponent 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.939
 what there what what because the public purpose 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.500
 to do things like that just for the sake of it 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.390
 it still be able to be decent and 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.010
 good good play our game for jesper 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.969
 drost is the match against utrecht one 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.099
 chance to show 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.109
 why he came from pec zwolle 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.000
 last week against excelsior 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.590
 spell it in a little awkwardly 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.750
 basically you just don't play whole 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 other than the idea so swollen it 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.409
 getting used to it was not too bad but I do you 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.530
 you have to get used to it 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:48.579
 to players around you and that goes 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.219
 well that goes very fast 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.109
 but yes it is always a while 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.849
 search with you especially during the 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.219
 training that things are going really fast 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.700
 yes exactly i mean actually if you 

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:02.049
 how often played together how 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.480
 also got through a high loop the 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.340
 profile or in the ball and then and then get it 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.230
 you get through each other a little faster 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.969
 FC Groningen will be against FC Utrecht 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.920
 cracks must start because otherwise they will 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.209
 just like the last few years it is a difficult one 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.709
 evening for the fc 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.329
 we must start well you must never 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.680
 knowing what is being asked of you 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.599
 in such a competition audience the lag was full 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.890
 to go they have not won with 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.170
 have played well three times 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.180
 I so they will really be full for you 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.769
 first the first win go to us 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.430
 the job of being ready for that 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.430
 it goes on again and again
