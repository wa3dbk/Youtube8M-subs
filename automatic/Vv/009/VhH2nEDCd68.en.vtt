00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.310
 In case you encounter trolls they want 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.880
 to understand what kind of money 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.270
 have in their pockets, we have created an exercise 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.190
 for workout. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.220
 This is a graphical way to solve systems. 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.080
 The task is to display the system graphically 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.790
 and to decide. 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.850
 And we are given 2 equations. 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.500
 The first is blue, y = 7 / 5x - 5, 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.475
 and this is green, y = 3 / 5x - 1. 

00:00:30.475 --> 00:00:32.100
 Let's picture them graphically, 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.560
 by doing so in the appropriate color. 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.830
 First we depict y = 7 / 5x - 5. 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.820
 The first thing I notice is crossing the line in -5. 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.020
 In other words, when x = 0, y = -5. 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.320
 Let's check this out. 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.470
 If x = 0, then y = 7/5 * 0 - 5 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.230
 y = -5 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 There is logic. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.850
 And we see that the angular coefficient is 7/5. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.320
 Very convenient, the equation is in the form of an angular coefficient and an intersection with Ou. 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.310
 So we have an elevation to displacement. 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.540
 Every time we "move" with 5 to the right, 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.080
 "move" and 7 up. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.420
 Move 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to the right. 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.610
 and shifts 7 upwards. 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.920
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.342
 So we'll be here. 

00:01:18.342 --> 00:01:20.050
 Another way to do this, 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.760
 is by testing some values. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.356
 We could notice that when x = 0, y = -5. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:32.540
 When x = 5, y = 7/5 * 5 - 5 = 2. 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.380
 I think we have correctly depicted the blue. 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.000
 Now let's do the second. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 At x = 0, y = -1. 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.930
 The angular coefficient is 3/5. 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 Therefore, if we move 5 to the right, we move 3 upwards. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.580
 And we'll be here. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.760
 It seems they are crossing at this point, 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.400
 At point x = 5, y = 2. 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.120
 We will answer with x = 5, y = 2. 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.810
 And we can check by substituting these values 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 in the two equations to show, 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.250
 that we have equality. 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.580
 Let's check ... 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.931
 It's a blame!
