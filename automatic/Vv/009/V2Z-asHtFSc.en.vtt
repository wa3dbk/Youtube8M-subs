00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:11.130
 first video here today I have one 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.340
 bit of calcium carbide brought and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.140
 the wastewater pours then it arises 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.029
 gas this team gas is naturally high 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.600
 flammable and that's why I'm you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:30.269
 that today just show how 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:31.590
 yes, how good that burns so here I have 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.690
 a bit of water so in this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.070
 container here I can be 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.570
 That's why that's why 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.280
 a bit black here I have mine 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.300
 calcium broken here a gas stove igniter 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.300
 always 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.200
 So here we go, I will 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.320
 Just reinstetten a bit 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.210
 Of course not everything because that's all 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.090
 I had to work well now 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.400
 nowhere to put the camera down where they are 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.869
 Nothing had from court does so by 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.670
 It should be good enough here 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.110
 and now if I just go 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.110
 pure pour and tighten 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.750
 so that 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.970
 that was a very small amount 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.970
 and now that times more Never 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 I still have enough to do even more 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.079
 and I will too now 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.079
 still do 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.200
 that 's how it was with the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:36.660
 calcium carbide saw but ever 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:52.950
 quite funny from Warsaw we still 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:56.790
 a little something can ignite too 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.860
 got a bit warm so you can see it 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.360
 is quite good when I'm up now 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.550
 once set would have been the water 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.340
 no longer have and still have one 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.600
 a little more popped but that was me 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.110
 so good that you just 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.800
 let's see 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:14.040
 that is really too little 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.690
 It burns pretty well that's it 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.720
 then catch again from mine 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.100
 video i know that my first video 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.410
 that's why it's not all that good yet 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.810
 when you could tell me what you still have 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.120
 for suggestions for improvement have and 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.020
 subscribe main channel and thank the 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.020
