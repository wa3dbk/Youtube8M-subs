that's totally wrong can't do it like
that<00:00:58.410> learn<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.280> away<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.670> doing

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
that learn that right away I was doing

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.420 
that learn that right away I was doing
that<00:00:59.879> mistake<00:01:00.270> myself<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.809> bunch<00:01:00.989> of<00:01:01.079> times<00:01:01.430> um

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
that mistake myself a bunch of times um

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.570 
that mistake myself a bunch of times um
so<00:01:03.320> starting<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.350> one<00:01:04.589> just<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.250> used<00:01:05.400> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so starting with one just get used to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.289 
so starting with one just get used to
throwing<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.030> from<00:01:06.180> one<00:01:06.299> hand<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> other

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
throwing it from one hand to the other

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
throwing it from one hand to the other
very<00:01:09.299> simple<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.860> add<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> second

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
very simple and then just add a second

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
very simple and then just add a second
one<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.640> cross<00:01:11.880> them<00:01:12.590> as<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.100> they

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
one and cross them as you can see they

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.490 
one and cross them as you can see they
cross<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.700> air<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:18.140> not<00:01:19.140> too<00:01:19.320> difficult

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
cross in the air right not too difficult

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.600 
cross in the air right not too difficult
um<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:21.500> guess<00:01:22.500> one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.040> main<00:01:23.159> points<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.490> want

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
um I guess one of the main points I want

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.039 
um I guess one of the main points I want
to<00:01:23.640> make<00:01:23.700> before<00:01:23.909> I<00:01:24.090> get<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.330> three<00:01:24.540> balls<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to make before I get that three balls is

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.569 
to make before I get that three balls is
that<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:26.100> ball<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.549> choose<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.750> make<00:01:28.170> or

inside wrapped him in electrical tape it

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.380 
inside wrapped him in electrical tape it

write crossing over across over just get

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.690 
write crossing over across over just get
used<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.210> and<00:02:34.920> try<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.160> just<00:02:36.370> used<00:02:36.550> to

used to that and try to get just used to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.610 
used to that and try to get just used to
like<00:02:36.850> where<00:02:37.060> they<00:02:37.180> land<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.690> stuff<00:02:37.990> that's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
like where they land and stuff that's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.380 
like where they land and stuff that's
the<00:02:38.800> big<00:02:38.980> part<00:02:40.080> get<00:02:41.080> used<00:02:41.260> to<00:02:41.380> how<00:02:41.830> far<00:02:42.100> apart

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the big part get used to how far apart

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
the big part get used to how far apart
usually<00:02:43.390> your<00:02:43.540> hands<00:02:43.930> are<00:02:44.110> about<00:02:44.380> shoulder

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
usually your hands are about shoulder

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.699 
usually your hands are about shoulder
length<00:02:44.920> apart<00:02:45.360> you're<00:02:46.360> lining<00:02:47.200> up<00:02:47.410> pretty

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
length apart you're lining up pretty

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.740 
length apart you're lining up pretty
much<00:02:47.890> with<00:02:48.070> your<00:02:48.220> shoulders<00:02:48.630> from<00:02:49.630> this

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
much with your shoulders from this

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.210 
much with your shoulders from this
perspective<00:02:49.959> it's<00:02:50.530> a<00:02:50.620> foreshortening

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
perspective it's a foreshortening

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.100 
perspective it's a foreshortening
perspective<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.390> doesn't<00:02:52.690> look<00:02:52.780> like<00:02:52.840> my

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
perspective so it doesn't look like my

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.690 
perspective so it doesn't look like my
shoulders<00:02:53.440> are<00:02:53.530> lined<00:02:53.800> up<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.130> could<00:02:54.430> go<00:02:54.520> like

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
shoulders are lined up I could go like

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.190 
shoulders are lined up I could go like
this<00:02:54.880> and<00:02:54.940> then<00:02:55.180> they<00:02:55.270> actually<00:02:55.660> aren't<00:02:55.930> there

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
this and then they actually aren't there

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.470 
this and then they actually aren't there
in<00:02:56.290> too<00:02:56.470> close<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.580> from<00:02:57.880> here<00:02:58.180> they're

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
in too close but from here they're

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.390 
in too close but from here they're
actually<00:02:58.840> lined<00:02:59.080> up<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:01.830> okay<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.070> you'll

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
actually lined up so okay and you'll

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.650 
actually lined up so okay and you'll
start<00:03:03.610> to<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:03.850> used<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.209> weight<00:03:04.480> of

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
start to get used to that weight of

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.600 
start to get used to that weight of
those<00:03:04.840> two<00:03:05.110> once<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.770> feel<00:03:05.920> very<00:03:06.340> comfortable

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
those two once you feel very comfortable

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.870 
those two once you feel very comfortable
with<00:03:07.030> doing<00:03:07.239> that<00:03:07.420> crossover<00:03:08.550> let's<00:03:09.550> go<00:03:09.700> for

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
with doing that crossover let's go for

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.310 
with doing that crossover let's go for
three<00:03:10.090> now<00:03:10.360> when<00:03:10.570> you<00:03:10.660> start<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:10.989> three<00:03:11.200> the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
three now when you start with three the

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.600 
three now when you start with three the
first<00:03:11.470> thing<00:03:11.680> is<00:03:11.800> you're<00:03:12.040> only<00:03:12.280> going<00:03:12.520> to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
first thing is you're only going to

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.699 
first thing is you're only going to
throw<00:03:12.820> up<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:13.300> ball<00:03:13.540> okay<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.440> then

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
throw up one ball okay and then

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:15.990 
throw up one ball okay and then
immediately<00:03:15.010> throw<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.580> next<00:03:15.790> one<00:03:15.940> and

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
immediately throw up the next one and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.030 
immediately throw up the next one and
switch<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.690> this<00:03:16.840> hand<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.680> pretty<00:03:17.980> much

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
switch with this hand and pretty much

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.260 
switch with this hand and pretty much
what<00:03:18.280> you're<00:03:18.400> doing<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:18.820> you're<00:03:18.850> only

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
what you're doing is you're only

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.350 
what you're doing is you're only
touching<00:03:19.959> two<00:03:20.110> balls<00:03:20.320> at<00:03:20.500> a<00:03:20.530> time<00:03:20.860> and<00:03:21.360> keeping

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
touching two balls at a time and keeping

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.900 
touching two balls at a time and keeping
three<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> air<00:03:23.110> by<00:03:24.010> constantly<00:03:24.700> moving

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
three in the air by constantly moving

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.060 
three in the air by constantly moving
around<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.050> can<00:03:26.170> go<00:03:26.260> this<00:03:26.410> way<00:03:26.620> you<00:03:26.680> go<00:03:27.040> that

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
around you can go this way you go that

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.310 
around you can go this way you go that
way<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.730> guess<00:03:28.239> for<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> first<00:03:28.720> time<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.020> start

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
way I guess for the first time you start

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.990 
way I guess for the first time you start
going<00:03:29.590> counterclockwise<00:03:30.220> if<00:03:30.880> you're

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
going counterclockwise if you're

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.050 
going counterclockwise if you're
right-handed<00:03:31.239> is<00:03:31.720> easiest<00:03:32.140> and<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:33.040> suppose<00:03:33.520> if

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
right-handed is easiest and I suppose if

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.400 
right-handed is easiest and I suppose if
you're<00:03:34.239> left-handed<00:03:34.540> which<00:03:34.900> I've<00:03:35.050> never<00:03:35.230> been

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
you're left-handed which I've never been

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.980 
you're left-handed which I've never been
in<00:03:35.530> my<00:03:35.620> life<00:03:35.830> going<00:03:36.670> clockwise

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
in my life going clockwise

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.810 
in my life going clockwise
but<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.620> can't<00:03:38.920> confirm<00:03:39.100> that<00:03:40.950> here<00:03:41.950> we<00:03:42.100> go<00:03:42.280> so

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
but I can't confirm that here we go so

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.510 
but I can't confirm that here we go so
three<00:03:43.180> balls<00:03:43.800> as<00:03:44.800> you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.070> see<00:03:45.220> I<00:03:45.250> threw<00:03:45.490> up

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
three balls as you can see I threw up

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.150 
three balls as you can see I threw up
one<00:03:45.850> first<00:03:46.150> like<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.630> just<00:03:47.080> one<00:03:47.290> wrote<00:03:48.040> this

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
one first like this just one wrote this

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.500 
one first like this just one wrote this
one<00:03:48.340> first<00:03:48.580> you're<00:03:48.730> gonna<00:03:48.790> kind<00:03:49.060> of<00:03:49.090> cross<00:03:49.330> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
one first you're gonna kind of cross it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.080 
one first you're gonna kind of cross it
over<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.980> go<00:03:50.980> with<00:03:51.160> that

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.210 

there<00:03:56.930> we<00:03:57.050> go<00:03:57.170> and<00:03:57.440> then<00:03:57.560> you<00:03:57.680> decide<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.099> get

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
there we go and then you decide to get

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.690 
there we go and then you decide to get
used<00:03:58.430> to<00:03:58.580> it<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.959> longer<00:04:00.349> you<00:04:00.379> do<00:04:00.620> this<00:04:00.860> the

used to it the longer you do this the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.280

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290
