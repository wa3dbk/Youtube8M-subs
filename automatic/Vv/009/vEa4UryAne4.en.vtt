00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.160
 I propose cream recipe 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.790
 carambar because it's a recipe 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.849
 very simple kind spreads that we spread 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.299
 can leave in the fridge and refill one to 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.009
 two times 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.660
 and then because I'm a mother of one 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:20.890
 little boy who is they love 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.110
 many carambars so it was a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 way for me to make a recipe 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.390
 simple with him that please him 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.250
 for this recipe you need him 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.900
 carambar 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:42.460
 vincenti liters of milk 2 40 g of sugar 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.670
 semolina 20 g of cornflour 200 g of butter 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 soft 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:59.090
 so realize the creamy pour the milk 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.340
 in a saucepan thrill to god 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.560
 but the plate is careful of no 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.699
 to boil note the same whether one is 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:11.060
 relatively hot to melt 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:14.450
 carambars so lifted warm we crushed 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.550
 with a knife the small hambach areas that 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.960
 out of the fridge actually little fate of 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.790
 fridge they are good last what breaks 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.229
 well 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.800
 meanwhile we will mix our two 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:35.960
 whole eyes with the sugar so we 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:57.380
 incorporate the sugar then we will add 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:02:00.979
 our live in at on to sift mix 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.830
 well homogeneous now we're going to finish 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:09.350
 to melt carambar so that 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.799
 carambar is well melted we pour on 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.799
 mix well 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:24.280
 we reverse another pan and we go 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.849
 cook for the purpose it's not the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.150
 to hang 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.440
 so you have to go like apple or 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.450
 did it please me gently 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.880
 so we will not stop at the stage of 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 custard we will cook more pay 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.209
 the sauce obtained in a container is 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.310
 glued a sheet of food film to 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.209
 contact with the cream to prevent it 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.420
 does not cost filming well on contact 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.250
 cream that is not air that 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.970
 does not oxidize in fact and is left 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.970
 cool to room temperature 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.599
 so here is the pastry and temperature 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.420
 ambient 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.540
 so we will gradually integrate the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.540
 Butter 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 mix with an electrical device so 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.640
 to get a flame between them 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.320
 no more 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.430
 placed near
