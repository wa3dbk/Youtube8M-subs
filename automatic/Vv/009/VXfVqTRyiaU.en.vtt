for you to be specific in your motion
and<00:01:22.770> our<00:01:22.890> detection<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.150> kind<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and our detection is actually kind of

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.940 
and our detection is actually kind of
what<00:01:24.479> makes<00:01:24.659> those<00:01:24.840> games<00:01:25.110> special<00:01:25.710> right

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
what makes those games special right

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.530 
what makes those games special right
that's<00:01:26.100> what<00:01:26.189> makes<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.700> better<00:01:27.060> dance<00:01:27.330> game

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
that's what makes it a better dance game

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.300 
that's what makes it a better dance game
and<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.750> dance<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.350> thing<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.680> not<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and just dance the thing that's not you

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.590 
and just dance the thing that's not you
know<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.490> vertical<00:01:29.820> blinds<00:01:30.000> blowing<00:01:30.360> behind

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
know the vertical blinds blowing behind

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.500 
know the vertical blinds blowing behind
you<00:01:30.689> are<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> beat

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
you are not going to beat

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.050 
you are not going to beat
in<00:01:31.870> central<00:01:32.380> as<00:01:33.130> they<00:01:33.370> might<00:01:33.520> another<00:01:33.730> titles

in central as they might another titles

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.210 
in central as they might another titles
but<00:01:34.240> in<00:01:35.200> this<00:01:35.410> game<00:01:35.590> it's<00:01:35.770> a<00:01:35.830> little<00:01:36.010> bit<00:01:36.100> less

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
but in this game it's a little bit less

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.100 
but in this game it's a little bit less
about<00:01:36.430> the<00:01:36.550> prescriptive<00:01:36.970> sort<00:01:37.840> of<00:01:37.900> died

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
about the prescriptive sort of died

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.810 
about the prescriptive sort of died
acted<00:01:38.500> like<00:01:38.620> you<00:01:38.770> must<00:01:38.950> play<00:01:39.100> this<00:01:39.250> exact<00:01:39.580> path

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
acted like you must play this exact path

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.070 
acted like you must play this exact path
this<00:01:40.030> exact<00:01:40.330> choreography<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.810> much<00:01:40.930> more

this exact choreography and much more

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.810 
this exact choreography and much more
about<00:01:41.260> being<00:01:41.320> expressed<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:41.980> creative<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.490> in

can use either hand in that performance

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.370 
can use either hand in that performance
gameplay<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.040> you<00:01:48.520> won<00:01:48.970> Miss<00:01:49.090> morphine<00:01:49.690> okay

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380

you can get your feet high enough to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.730 
you can get your feet high enough to
actually<00:01:52.210> cue<00:01:52.930> one<00:01:53.020> of<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.170> cues<00:01:53.350> on<00:01:53.470> screen

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
think that's the freedom we want if you

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.300 
think that's the freedom we want if you
want<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.140> spin<00:01:59.320> around<00:01:59.410> if<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.770> want<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.100> know

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
want to spin around if you want you know

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.520 
want to spin around if you want you know
you<00:02:00.370> want<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.640> play<00:02:01.360> up<00:02:01.480> both<00:02:01.690> arms<00:02:02.050> huge<00:02:02.380> want

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
you want to play up both arms huge want

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.020 
you want to play up both arms huge want
to<00:02:02.590> make<00:02:02.710> small<00:02:02.980> robotic<00:02:03.310> gestures<00:02:03.729> all<00:02:03.880> these

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
to make small robotic gestures all these

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.219 
to make small robotic gestures all these
things<00:02:04.180> to<00:02:04.240> be<00:02:04.300> valid<00:02:04.600> inputs<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.110> they're

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
things to be valid inputs and they're

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.420 
things to be valid inputs and they're
the<00:02:05.380> choices<00:02:05.680> that<00:02:05.800> you're<00:02:05.890> making<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.220> will

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
the choices that you're making that will

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.710 
the choices that you're making that will
make<00:02:06.550> they'll<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.820> reflected<00:02:07.210> individuals

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
make they'll be reflected individuals

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.930 
make they'll be reflected individuals
and<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.350> audio<00:02:08.619> you<00:02:08.740> see<00:02:08.890> on-screen<00:02:09.010> so<00:02:09.490> it's

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
and the audio you see on-screen so it's

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.640 
and the audio you see on-screen so it's
really<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.149> performance<00:02:10.360> is<00:02:10.630> about<00:02:10.690> you<00:02:10.929> that's

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
really a performance is about you that's

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.620 
really a performance is about you that's
what<00:02:11.770> the<00:02:11.830> games<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:12.130> about<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:16.180> have<00:02:16.300> cues

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
what the games all about you have cues

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.520 
what the games all about you have cues
on<00:02:16.780> screen

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.260 

useless<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.069> you<00:02:21.220> can<00:02:21.430> use<00:02:21.790> I<00:02:21.940> belong

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
useless to that you can use I belong

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.570 
useless to that you can use I belong
yeah<00:02:23.080> so<00:02:23.260> specificity<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> timing<00:02:24.459> right

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
yeah so specificity in the timing right

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.100 
yeah so specificity in the timing right
it<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:24.970> be<00:02:25.120> match<00:02:25.300> gameplay<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:25.959> about

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
it is be match gameplay so it's about

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.990 
it is be match gameplay so it's about
hitting<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.950> notes<00:02:27.250> that<00:02:27.459> are<00:02:27.550> on<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.700> screen

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
hitting the notes that are on the screen

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.250 
hitting the notes that are on the screen
at<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.390> time<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.720> supposed<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.959> hit<00:02:29.080> them

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
at the time you supposed to hit them

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260 
at the time you supposed to hit them
which<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.040> a<00:02:30.069> pretty<00:02:30.250> solidly<00:02:31.150> established

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
which is a pretty solidly established

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.760 
which is a pretty solidly established
harmonics<00:02:31.900> trope<00:02:32.110> at<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.319> point<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.680> know

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
harmonics trope at this point you know

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.080 
harmonics trope at this point you know
whether<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.130> be<00:02:33.220> even<00:02:33.550> if<00:02:33.640> damned<00:02:33.760> sense<00:02:34.000> with

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
whether it be even if damned sense with

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.520 
whether it be even if damned sense with
the<00:02:34.150> indium<00:02:34.390> hitting<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> beat<00:02:34.990> it'll

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
the indium hitting on the beat it'll

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.840 
the indium hitting on the beat it'll
connect<00:02:35.740> you<00:02:35.890> the<00:02:35.980> music<00:02:36.310> and<00:02:36.430> what<00:02:36.520> keeps<00:02:36.730> you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
connect you the music and what keeps you

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.850 
connect you the music and what keeps you
grounding<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.450> song<00:02:37.660> but<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.320> think<00:02:38.620> the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
grounding the song but I think the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.620 
grounding the song but I think the
difference<00:02:39.340> here<00:02:39.520> is<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:40.180> expressivity

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
difference here is that the expressivity

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.690 
difference here is that the expressivity
you<00:02:40.870> have<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.440> intentionality<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.520> can

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
you have the intentionality you can

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.540 
you have the intentionality you can
bring<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.390> it<00:02:43.540> he's<00:02:43.690> way<00:02:44.650> more<00:02:44.680> deep<00:02:45.250> than<00:02:45.280> it's

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
bring to it he's way more deep than it's

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:46.890 
bring to it he's way more deep than it's
ever<00:02:45.640> been<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:45.970> Hamas<00:02:46.239> came<00:02:46.420> before<00:02:46.570> instead

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
ever been and Hamas came before instead

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.530

school and I think that the cool thing
in<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:41.030> terms<00:03:41.269> of<00:03:41.420> how<00:03:41.540> varied<00:03:42.410> it<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.800> based<00:03:43.040> on

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
in in terms of how varied it is based on

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.500 
in in terms of how varied it is based on
your<00:03:43.400> performance<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:43.970> what<00:03:44.390> you're

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
your performance and what you're

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.210 
your performance and what you're
interested<00:03:44.600> in<00:03:44.930> is<00:03:45.080> that<00:03:45.290> different<00:03:46.040> players

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
interested in is that different players

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.140 
interested in is that different players
will<00:03:46.370> probably<00:03:46.610> gravitate<00:03:46.940> towards

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
will probably gravitate towards

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.729 
will probably gravitate towards
different<00:03:47.300> things<00:03:47.630> the<00:03:48.080> actual<00:03:48.380> define

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
different things the actual define

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.680 
different things the actual define
player<00:03:49.040> loop<00:03:49.280> is<00:03:49.580> you'll<00:03:50.209> enter<00:03:50.360> into<00:03:50.570> a

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
player loop is you'll enter into a

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.509 
player loop is you'll enter into a
discovery<00:03:51.290> realm<00:03:51.680> what<00:03:52.069> we're<00:03:52.190> calling<00:03:52.430> them

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
discovery realm what we're calling them

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:53.979 
discovery realm what we're calling them
one<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.790> these<00:03:52.880> worlds<00:03:53.180> against<00:03:53.420> it's<00:03:53.600> created

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
one of these worlds against it's created

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.380 
one of these worlds against it's created
and<00:03:54.380> it'll<00:03:54.620> be<00:03:54.680> pretty<00:03:54.800> quiet<00:03:55.069> and<00:03:55.340> docile<00:03:56.090> at

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
and it'll be pretty quiet and docile at

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.940 
and it'll be pretty quiet and docile at
the<00:03:56.450> beginning<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:56.959> you're<00:03:57.050> sort<00:03:57.680> of<00:03:57.800> bring

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
the beginning and you're sort of bring

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.620 
the beginning and you're sort of bring
it<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.130> life<00:03:58.160> I<00:03:58.580> knew<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.120> by<00:03:59.269> finding

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
it to life I knew that by finding

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.910 
it to life I knew that by finding
musical<00:04:00.019> interactions<00:04:00.380> but<00:04:00.470> also<00:04:00.530> by<00:04:00.709> playing

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
musical interactions but also by playing

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.650 
musical interactions but also by playing
songs<00:04:01.250> so<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.580> song<00:04:01.730> sort<00:04:02.000> of<00:04:02.090> baked<00:04:02.269> into<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
songs so the song sort of baked into the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.990 
songs so the song sort of baked into the
discovery<00:04:03.470> worlds<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.160> then<00:04:04.459> by<00:04:04.700> playing<00:04:04.850> the

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
discovery worlds and then by playing the

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.160 
discovery worlds and then by playing the
songs<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.390> bring<00:04:05.510> more<00:04:05.630> energy<00:04:05.660> in<00:04:06.080> which

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
songs you bring more energy in which

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.080 
songs you bring more energy in which
unlocks<00:04:06.590> more<00:04:06.830> musical<00:04:07.610> interactions<00:04:08.030> and

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
unlocks more musical interactions and

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.330 
unlocks more musical interactions and
instruments<00:04:08.540> which<00:04:08.720> brings<00:04:09.019> more<00:04:09.230> songs<00:04:09.440> so

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
instruments which brings more songs so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.860 
instruments which brings more songs so
that<00:04:10.370> loop<00:04:10.610> there<00:04:10.790> is<00:04:11.030> pretty<00:04:11.720> well
