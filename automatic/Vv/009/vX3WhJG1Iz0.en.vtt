front<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:02.100> me<00:01:02.250> but<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.609> still<00:01:02.820> saying<00:01:03.089> I'm

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
front of me but it's still saying I'm

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.109 
front of me but it's still saying I'm
hidden<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.489> bit<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.670> actually

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hidden and this is the bit that actually

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.280 
hidden and this is the bit that actually
gets<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.509> level<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:08.450> now<00:01:09.450> I'm<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> too<00:01:10.049> sure

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
gets your level up now I'm not too sure

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.100 
gets your level up now I'm not too sure
but<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.770> think<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.729> moving<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.210> when

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
but I think just moving around when

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.929 
but I think just moving around when
you're<00:01:13.290> hidden<00:01:13.470> gets<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.250> snake<00:01:14.460> level<00:01:14.790> up

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
you're hidden gets your snake level up

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.160 
you're hidden gets your snake level up
i'm<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.240> sure<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:15.750> another<00:01:15.960> way<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
i'm not sure if there's another way of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.760 
i'm not sure if there's another way of
doing<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.530> but<00:01:17.270> this<00:01:18.270> seemed<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.289> work<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.590> me

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
doing it but this seemed to work for me

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.450 
doing it but this seemed to work for me
and<00:01:20.039> it<00:01:20.310> got<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.880> snake<00:01:21.119> level<00:01:21.479> up

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460
