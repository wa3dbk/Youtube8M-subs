we at Nissan tried to visualize the

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.859 
we at Nissan tried to visualize the
smart<00:01:29.840> city<00:01:30.170> by<00:01:30.799> creating<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.429> dioramas<00:01:32.060> but

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.899 
smart city by creating the dioramas but
it<00:01:32.990> was<00:01:33.140> difficult<00:01:33.380> to<00:01:33.799> fully<00:01:34.009> express<00:01:34.609> the

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
it was difficult to fully express the

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.630 
it was difficult to fully express the
detail<00:01:35.299> benefit<00:01:35.869> and<00:01:36.249> experience<00:01:37.249> the

detail benefit and experience the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.279 
detail benefit and experience the
functionality<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:41.240> we<00:01:41.359> decided<00:01:41.749> to<00:01:41.899> develop

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
functionality so we decided to develop

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.039
