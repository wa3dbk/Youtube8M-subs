00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:31.180 

first<00:00:17.580> tech<00:00:18.000> challenge

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.500 

the<00:00:32.190> game<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.520> different<00:00:32.640> every<00:00:33.030> year<00:00:33.060> so<00:00:33.390> we

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the game is different every year so we

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.730 
the game is different every year so we
start<00:00:33.720> the<00:00:33.810> season<00:00:33.990> off<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.260> a<00:00:34.440> kickoff

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
start the season off with a kickoff

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.650 
start the season off with a kickoff
that's<00:00:35.310> where<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> rulebook<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
that's where we get the rulebook for the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.660 
that's where we get the rulebook for the
new<00:00:36.780> year<00:00:37.080> so<00:00:37.470> we<00:00:37.560> get<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.920> into<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> field

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
new year so we get a go into the field

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
new year so we get a go into the field
and<00:00:38.940> play<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.750> new<00:00:40.110> elements<00:00:40.560> and<00:00:40.710> see

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and play with the new elements and see

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.100 
and play with the new elements and see
how<00:00:41.130> things<00:00:41.580> could<00:00:41.880> work<00:00:41.940> well<00:00:42.330> like<00:00:42.600> actually

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
how things could work well like actually

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
how things could work well like actually
playing<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.620> it<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:44.160> really<00:00:44.340> interesting

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
playing with it it's really interesting

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.760 
playing with it it's really interesting
to<00:00:44.850> take<00:00:45.030> notes<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.989> what<00:00:46.020> everyone's

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to take notes on and see what everyone's

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.940 
to take notes on and see what everyone's
thinking<00:00:47.900> hey<00:00:48.900> guys<00:00:49.110> we<00:00:49.260> got<00:00:49.290> our<00:00:49.470> kids<00:00:49.680> today

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
thinking hey guys we got our kids today

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.390 
thinking hey guys we got our kids today
yeah<00:00:50.790> let's<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> look<00:00:51.570> at<00:00:51.720> him<00:00:51.809> okay<00:00:55.400> we

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:56.400 
yeah let's have a look at him okay we

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.500 
yeah let's have a look at him okay we
have<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.580> do<00:00:56.700> three<00:00:56.850> things<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.330> have<00:00:57.420> to

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
have to do three things we have to

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.630 
have to do three things we have to
design<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.989> robot<00:00:58.379> we<00:00:59.040> have<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> build<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
design this robot we have to build the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.729 
design this robot we have to build the
robot<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.180> then<00:01:00.690> we<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.019> program<00:01:01.379> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
robot and then we have to program it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.530 
robot and then we have to program it
through<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.129> little<00:01:02.309> module<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.269> that<00:01:03.300> we

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
through this little module so that we

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.140 
through this little module so that we
can<00:01:03.660> run<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> okay<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.790> decided<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
can run it okay I decided to take on

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
can run it okay I decided to take on
becoming<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> builder<00:01:06.930> actually<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:07.980> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
becoming a builder actually one of the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
becoming a builder actually one of the
main<00:01:08.280> builders<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:08.940> team<00:01:09.090> this<00:01:09.180> year<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
main builders for our team this year I

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.620 
main builders for our team this year I
like<00:01:09.990> electronics<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.800> like<00:01:10.980> things<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.630> take

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
like electronics I like things that take

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.750 
like electronics I like things that take
things<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> move<00:01:13.320> because<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.100> type<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:14.670> out

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
things that move because you type it out

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.719 
things that move because you type it out
to<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.980> right<00:01:16.980> guys<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.580> saw<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
to all right guys so we just saw the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.130 
to all right guys so we just saw the
game<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.300> now<00:01:18.390> when<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.630> strategize<00:01:19.110> before

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
game and now when you strategize before

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
game and now when you strategize before
reset<00:01:19.620> designing<00:01:20.070> what<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.610> it's

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
reset designing what do you think it's

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.310 
reset designing what do you think it's
important<00:01:21.120> about<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> game<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:22.020> seemed<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
important about the game it seemed to

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.930 
important about the game it seemed to
emphasize<00:01:22.710> on<00:01:22.950> putting<00:01:23.370> racket<00:01:23.670> balls<00:01:23.790> and

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
emphasize on putting racket balls and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.980 
emphasize on putting racket balls and
the<00:01:24.000> crates<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.390> lifting<00:01:24.659> them<00:01:24.780> as<00:01:24.870> high<00:01:24.930> as

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the crates and lifting them as high as

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.200 
the crates and lifting them as high as
we<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.170> also<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.010> the<00:01:26.070> bowling<00:01:26.370> ball<00:01:26.400> getting

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
we can also at the bowling ball getting

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.790 
we can also at the bowling ball getting
the<00:01:27.360> woolly<00:01:27.510> ball<00:01:27.690> into<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> goal<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.409> 20

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
the woolly ball into the goal is 20

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.200 
the woolly ball into the goal is 20
points<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.370> have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.760> different<00:01:30.090> people

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
points we have a lot of different people

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.359 
points we have a lot of different people
on<00:01:30.450> our<00:01:30.479> team<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.740> kind<00:01:31.890> of<00:01:31.950> hard<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.189> come

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
on our team so it's kind of hard to come

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.310 
on our team so it's kind of hard to come
up<00:01:32.399> with<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> mutual<00:01:33.270> decision<00:01:33.479> but<00:01:33.930> when<00:01:34.200> you

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
up with a mutual decision but when you

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
up with a mutual decision but when you
draw<00:01:34.680> things<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.490> work<00:01:36.240> through

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
draw things out and work through

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.510 
draw things out and work through
everything<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.590> will<00:01:37.770> help<00:01:37.979> so<00:01:38.369> why

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
everything then it will help so why

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.179 
everything then it will help so why
don't<00:01:38.700> we<00:01:38.759> put<00:01:39.360> something<00:01:39.719> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.049> back<00:01:40.740> it's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
don't we put something on the back it's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.100 
don't we put something on the back it's
like<00:01:41.310> an<00:01:41.490> elevator<00:01:41.789> ringing<00:01:42.539> them<00:01:42.750> all<00:01:42.869> up

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like an elevator ringing them all up

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
like an elevator ringing them all up
something<00:01:43.860> attaching<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> kraid<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.719> can

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
something attaching to the kraid we can

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.389 
something attaching to the kraid we can
get<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.049> points<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.680> all<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> balls<00:01:47.219> we

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
get more points with all the balls we

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.910 
get more points with all the balls we
put<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.180> front<00:01:48.420> okay<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.799> all

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
put in it for front okay so these all

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.080 
put in it for front okay so these all
look<00:01:49.979> really<00:01:50.219> nice<00:01:50.430> let's<00:01:50.759> go<00:01:50.850> start

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
look really nice let's go start

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.940 
look really nice let's go start
prototyping

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.179 

we<00:01:55.640> pretty<00:01:55.820> much<00:01:55.939> just<00:01:56.439> collaborated<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:58.039> see

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
we pretty much just collaborated to see

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.800 
we pretty much just collaborated to see
like<00:01:58.430> which<00:01:58.670> design<00:01:59.030> would<00:01:59.149> work<00:01:59.329> better<00:02:01.810> from

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
like which design would work better from

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.969 
like which design would work better from
this<00:02:02.930> black<00:02:03.170> box<00:02:03.380> you<00:02:03.619> can<00:02:03.740> pretty<00:02:03.920> much

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
this black box you can pretty much

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.719 
this black box you can pretty much
program<00:02:04.610> these<00:02:05.500> motors<00:02:06.500> are<00:02:06.590> here<00:02:06.860> to<00:02:07.369> go<00:02:07.610> in

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
program these motors are here to go in

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.759 
program these motors are here to go in
which<00:02:08.060> direction<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.660> want<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.229> what<00:02:09.530> speed

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
which direction you want or what speed

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.070 
which direction you want or what speed
you<00:02:09.800> want<00:02:09.979> based<00:02:10.489> on<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.940> controller<00:02:11.360> all

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
you want based on the controller all

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.210 
you want based on the controller all
right<00:02:12.290> it's<00:02:12.590> done<00:02:12.860> finally<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:15.530> programming

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
right it's done finally the programming

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.610 
right it's done finally the programming
is<00:02:16.310> basically<00:02:16.730> writing<00:02:17.180> everything<00:02:17.750> down<00:02:17.959> for

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
is basically writing everything down for

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.039 
is basically writing everything down for
the<00:02:18.739> robot<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.430> computer<00:02:20.030> at<00:02:20.360> first<00:02:20.599> it

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
the robot in the computer at first it

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.170 
the robot in the computer at first it
was<00:02:21.230> does<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.620> work<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.069> once<00:02:22.790> we<00:02:22.849> got<00:02:22.970> that

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
was does it work and once we got that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.750 
was does it work and once we got that
down<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.660> was<00:02:23.780> more<00:02:24.170> tweaked<00:02:24.739> this<00:02:25.099> fix<00:02:25.549> this

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
down it was more tweaked this fix this

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.430 
down it was more tweaked this fix this
then<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.269> if<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.480> works<00:02:26.720> with<00:02:26.959> whole<00:02:27.140> design

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
then see if it works with whole design

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.259 
then see if it works with whole design
and<00:02:27.709> any<00:02:28.040> time<00:02:28.250> there<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.519> problem<00:02:28.819> it<00:02:29.150> was

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
and any time there was a problem it was

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.120 
and any time there was a problem it was
generally<00:02:29.750> we<00:02:30.170> may<00:02:30.470> have<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.799> edit<00:02:30.950> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
generally we may have to edit the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.580 
generally we may have to edit the
programming<00:02:31.870> all<00:02:32.870> right<00:02:33.019> guys<00:02:33.200> here's<00:02:33.470> our

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590

there are two parts of inspection the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.820 
there are two parts of inspection the
first<00:04:22.180> one<00:04:22.360> is<00:04:22.390> the<00:04:22.780> inspection<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.470> the<00:04:23.590> robot

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
first one is the inspection of the robot

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.190 
first one is the inspection of the robot
itself<00:04:24.419> for<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.450> second<00:04:25.810> part<00:04:26.020> which<00:04:26.169> is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
itself for the second part which is
