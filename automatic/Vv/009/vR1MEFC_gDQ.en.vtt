 I have two on two thumb drives and the 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.310
 disc 4 and 5 this year says with 43 thousand 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.750
 eight hundred mega is just the pendrive 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.750
 4 gigs 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:28.440

 the other two here are thank you 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.320
 other larger pendants that is not the case 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.890
 very careful because the command formats 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.340
 Actually, the disco is fine, so let's go. 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.690
 the next command is the website says no 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.690
 my case 4 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:06.929
 the disc four discs related ok ok 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:14.180
 to clean a new disc from the year 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:14.180
 now I will create no primary participation 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:30.450
 and created with I am the justified partition 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:36.659
 or select that partition activates there and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:39.470
 Now I'm going to the informant way too. 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:44.090
 fs 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.090
 He will wait for it, okay? 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.350
 why formatting is almost 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.520
 completed 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:01.560
 It is a time consuming process to take an imac 15 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.560
 minutes to 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.180
 he successfully formatted a name 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:16.780
 Let's apply another one with a boss there and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:23.060
 assigned with that tone within the unit 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:27.230
 neotop boxe already understood him out here 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.600

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.600
 we leave it prepared by right butch 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.470
 now what I'm going to do 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:46.370
 I will now go to the unit where you are 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.790
 where is the windows installer on my 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.260
 if it is on the hd on disk i in the folder o 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.489
 insight 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.049
 if you have the installer image and 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:09.180
 In cd you access the letter of the cd and 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:14.010
 there is access to the boot folder with this 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:19.320
 command there to boot then 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:23.580
 apply the following command bugs ect a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:30.539
 60 reluctance and pen drive letter that 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:33.800
 in my case is the letter h assigned the letter 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:33.800
 h pen drive 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:51.770
 here he has already done the called operation there 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:54.300
 put it on g g looks only copy the content 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:58.289
