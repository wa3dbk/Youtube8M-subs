tee<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.570> I<00:03:36.690> really<00:03:36.959> believe<00:03:37.170> that<00:03:37.200> 300<00:03:37.830> C<00:03:37.980> is

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
tee and I really believe that 300 C is

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.920 
tee and I really believe that 300 C is
going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.400> a<00:03:38.430> ball<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.090> I<00:03:39.180> can<00:03:39.360> compliment

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
going to be a ball that I can compliment

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.830 
going to be a ball that I can compliment
off<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.290> 505<00:03:40.860> T<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:42.120> use<00:03:42.239> this<00:03:42.390> ball<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.660> the

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
off the 505 T I can use this ball on the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.720 
off the 505 T I can use this ball on the
fresh<00:03:43.080> sometimes<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:44.130> gets<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> be<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> little

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
fresh sometimes it gets to be a little

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.940 
fresh sometimes it gets to be a little
bit<00:03:44.820> too<00:03:44.970> much<00:03:45.209> TV<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.750> toy<00:03:45.989> lanes<00:03:46.290> get<00:03:46.470> very<00:03:46.650> dry

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
bit too much TV a toy lanes get very dry

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.610 
bit too much TV a toy lanes get very dry
very<00:03:47.220> quickly<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> 300<00:03:49.110> T<00:03:49.260> is<00:03:49.350> going<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.530> be

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
very quickly so the 300 T is going to be

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.289 
very quickly so the 300 T is going to be
a<00:03:49.650> perfect<00:03:49.920> complement<00:03:50.489> where<00:03:50.940> I<00:03:50.970> can<00:03:51.150> maybe

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
a perfect complement where I can maybe

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.820 
a perfect complement where I can maybe
move<00:03:51.510> by<00:03:51.690> feedback<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> little
