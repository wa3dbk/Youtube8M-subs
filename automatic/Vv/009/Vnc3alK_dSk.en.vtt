gonna do put our cam bearings and

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.810 
gonna do put our cam bearings and
freeze-out<00:00:25.070> plugs<00:00:25.369> in<00:00:25.640> it

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
freeze-out plugs in it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.939 
freeze-out plugs in it
okay<00:00:26.300> of<00:00:26.900> course<00:00:27.079> we're<00:00:27.289> gonna<00:00:27.349> put<00:00:27.710> number

okay of course we're gonna put number

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:29.529 
okay of course we're gonna put number
five<00:00:28.189> and<00:00:28.460> then<00:00:28.520> we<00:00:28.610> go<00:00:28.759> from<00:00:28.910> back<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.180> front

the<00:00:30.619> newly<00:00:31.039> it's<00:00:31.160> because<00:00:31.429> the<00:00:31.580> sizes<00:00:31.849> of<00:00:32.090> the

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:32.269 
the newly it's because the sizes of the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:33.549 
the newly it's because the sizes of the
bearings<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:32.809> you<00:00:32.900> can<00:00:33.080> fit<00:00:33.290> through<00:00:33.470> the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
bearings so you can fit through the

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.229 
bearings so you can fit through the
journals<00:00:35.710> correct<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:37.910> particular

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
journals correct in this particular

journals correct in this particular
block<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:40.460> oil<00:00:40.640> galleys<00:00:41.199> coming<00:00:42.199> off<00:00:42.290> the

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
block the oil galleys coming off the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.470 
block the oil galleys coming off the
mains<00:00:42.650> and<00:00:42.860> feeding<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.250> cam<00:00:43.489> yeah<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.360> what

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
mains and feeding the cam yeah so what

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.970 
mains and feeding the cam yeah so what
we're<00:00:44.570> going<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.780> do<00:00:44.960> every<00:00:45.710> one<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.860> these

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
we're going to do every one of these

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.979 
we're going to do every one of these
bearings<00:00:46.460> has<00:00:46.610> a<00:00:46.640> hole<00:00:46.879> in<00:00:46.909> it<00:00:47.119> okay<00:00:47.780> we're

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
bearings has a hole in it okay we're

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.380 
bearings has a hole in it okay we're
gonna<00:00:48.110> line<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:48.379> up<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.850> holes<00:00:50.089> right<00:00:50.239> here

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
gonna line it up the holes right here

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.859 
gonna line it up the holes right here
okay<00:00:51.229> main<00:00:51.470> so<00:00:51.799> if<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.339> don't<00:00:52.610> it'll<00:00:53.420> cut<00:00:53.720> off

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
okay main so if you don't it'll cut off

00:00:53.869 --> 00:01:13.359 
okay main so if you don't it'll cut off
flow<00:00:54.080> to<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.379> cam<00:01:11.049> okay<00:01:12.049> and<00:01:12.920> next<00:01:13.070> thing<00:01:13.280> I'm

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
flow to the cam okay and next thing I'm

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.700 
flow to the cam okay and next thing I'm
gonna<00:01:13.490> do<00:01:13.610> is<00:01:13.729> check<00:01:14.060> my<00:01:14.180> camshaft<00:01:14.750> make<00:01:15.530> sure

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
gonna do is check my camshaft make sure

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.219 
gonna do is check my camshaft make sure
it<00:01:15.830> goes<00:01:15.979> in<00:01:16.250> turns<00:01:16.640> fine<00:01:17.030> it's<00:01:17.689> before<00:01:17.900> I<00:01:18.049> put

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
it goes in turns fine it's before I put

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:19.720 
it goes in turns fine it's before I put
the<00:01:18.320> end<00:01:18.500> cap<00:01:18.740> on<00:01:18.860> down<00:01:19.070> there<00:01:19.220> every<00:01:19.340> once<00:01:19.610> in

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
the end cap on down there every once in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.950 
the end cap on down there every once in
a<00:01:19.790> while<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:19.970> might<00:01:20.090> get<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.330> block<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.750> there<00:01:20.870> a

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
a while you might get a block in there a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.840 
a while you might get a block in there a
little<00:01:21.050> bit<00:01:21.230> tight<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:22.160> you<00:01:22.370> got<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.610> work<00:01:22.700> on

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
little bit tight and you got to work on

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.130 
little bit tight and you got to work on
your<00:01:23.000> cam<00:01:23.180> bearing<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.480> little<00:01:23.660> bit<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.900> get<00:01:23.990> the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
your cam bearing a little bit to get the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.110 
your cam bearing a little bit to get the
clearance<00:01:24.530> so<00:01:24.710> it'll<00:01:24.860> spin<00:01:24.980> okay<00:01:25.610> give<00:01:25.940> it<00:01:25.970> its

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:26.120 
clearance so it'll spin okay give it its

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.490 
clearance so it'll spin okay give it its
oil<00:01:26.360> clearance<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:29.180> put<00:01:29.450> it<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:29.690> dry<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.050> see

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
oil clearance you put it in dry to see

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.360 
oil clearance you put it in dry to see
yeah<00:01:31.370> I've<00:01:31.520> already<00:01:31.730> cleaned<00:01:32.150> this<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:32.659> okay

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.100 

it<00:01:37.370> doesn't<00:01:37.700> hurts<00:01:37.820> a<00:01:38.000> little<00:01:38.150> dab<00:01:38.390> of<00:01:38.600> oil<00:01:38.840> on

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
it doesn't hurts a little dab of oil on

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.930 
it doesn't hurts a little dab of oil on
it<00:01:40.480> just<00:01:41.480> keep<00:01:41.690> Amaury<00:01:42.280> yes<00:01:43.280> that<00:01:43.490> we<00:01:43.640> try<00:01:43.880> to

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
it just keep Amaury yes that we try to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:02:05.670 
it just keep Amaury yes that we try to
avoid

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.790 

there<00:02:06.680> we<00:02:06.800> go<00:02:06.950> where<00:02:07.190> phrase<00:02:07.700> can<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.710> put<00:02:09.710> our

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
there we go where phrase can be put our

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.580 
there we go where phrase can be put our
end<00:02:10.009> cap<00:02:10.250> on<00:02:10.460> down<00:02:10.790> there<00:02:11.290> we're<00:02:12.290> down<00:02:12.410> another

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
end cap on down there we're down another

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.830 
end cap on down there we're down another
cam<00:02:12.890> bearings<00:02:14.680> next<00:02:15.680> thing<00:02:15.830> we'll<00:02:15.980> do<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.160> put

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
cam bearings next thing we'll do is put

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.290 
cam bearings next thing we'll do is put
our<00:02:17.840> fries<00:02:18.080> out<00:02:18.230> plugs<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.890> our<00:02:19.070> core<00:02:20.030> plugs

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
our fries out plugs and our core plugs

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.990 
our fries out plugs and our core plugs
in<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.720> why<00:02:21.590> does<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> engine<00:02:22.310> have<00:02:22.580> fries<00:02:22.820> out

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
in it why does the engine have fries out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.530 
in it why does the engine have fries out
plugs<00:02:23.270> okay<00:02:24.130> well<00:02:25.130> actually<00:02:25.280> their<00:02:26.270> core

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
plugs okay well actually their core

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.110 
plugs okay well actually their core
plugs<00:02:26.930> it's<00:02:27.890> part<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.250> casting<00:02:28.700> technique

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
plugs it's part of the casting technique

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.340 
plugs it's part of the casting technique
they<00:02:29.270> have<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.540> put<00:02:29.720> them<00:02:29.870> in<00:02:29.990> there<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.290> I'll

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
they have to put them in there and I'll

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.830 
they have to put them in there and I'll
cast<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.800> block<00:02:31.070> but<00:02:31.850> they<00:02:32.420> work<00:02:32.630> as<00:02:32.810> a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
cast the block but they work as a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.290 
cast the block but they work as a
freezeout<00:02:33.290> plug<00:02:33.560> basically<00:02:33.860> later<00:02:34.430> if<00:02:34.790> the

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
freezeout plug basically later if the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.480 
freezeout plug basically later if the
block<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.380> know<00:02:36.500> actually<00:02:36.920> freeze<00:02:37.220> up

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
block was you know actually freeze up

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.490 
block was you know actually freeze up
taking<00:02:38.300> pop<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> plug<00:02:38.780> out<00:02:38.930> without<00:02:39.110> cracking

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
taking pop a plug out without cracking

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.890 
taking pop a plug out without cracking
okay<00:02:40.370> but<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.640> lot<00:02:40.940> of<00:02:40.970> times<00:02:41.240> they<00:02:41.450> do<00:02:41.630> freeze

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
okay but a lot of times they do freeze

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
okay but a lot of times they do freeze
they<00:02:42.140> crack<00:02:42.380> anyhow<00:02:44.590> correct<00:02:50.680> down<00:02:51.680> this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
they crack anyhow correct down this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.590 
they crack anyhow correct down this
until<00:02:52.160> we<00:02:52.250> start<00:02:52.550> showing<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:52.940> bevel<00:02:53.300> around

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
until we start showing the bevel around
