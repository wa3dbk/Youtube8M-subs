00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.270

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.420
 what I thought was actually a color I 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.380
 think semi permanent and that's going to talk 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.330

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.630

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:06.790

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:08.800
 brown with some golden copper highlights 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.000

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.980
 we do not really see the reflections but 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.660
 I was expecting it to be a 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.070
 little bit I'm not going to see in 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.660
 a few dot fields then of any 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.100

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.030
 a hair color united from top to 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.130
