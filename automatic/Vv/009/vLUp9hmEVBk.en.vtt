went<00:02:41.210> ahead<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:41.420> unravel<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.440> whole<00:02:42.560> thing

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
went ahead and unravel the whole thing

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.580 
went ahead and unravel the whole thing
and<00:02:43.010> there's<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.310> ton<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.610> paracord<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.930> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and there's a ton of paracord the the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:46.750 
and there's a ton of paracord the the
interesting<00:02:45.950> thing<00:02:46.130> is<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.580> two

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
interesting thing is that the two

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.030 
interesting thing is that the two
strands<00:02:47.180> are<00:02:47.420> melted<00:02:47.750> together<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.500> ends<00:02:48.890> are

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
strands are melted together the ends are

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460 
strands are melted together the ends are
melted<00:02:49.490> too<00:02:49.670> which<00:02:50.000> is<00:02:50.210> typical<00:02:50.930> on<00:02:51.020> nylon

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
melted too which is typical on nylon

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:52.750 
melted too which is typical on nylon
cord<00:02:51.770> let<00:02:51.890> me<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.100> if<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.370> fire<00:02:52.520> one<00:02:52.670> of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
cord let me see if I can fire one of

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.400 
cord let me see if I can fire one of
those<00:02:52.850> ends<00:02:53.150> and<00:02:53.330> so<00:02:53.840> you<00:02:53.900> don't<00:02:54.200> actually

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
those ends and so you don't actually

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.120 
those ends and so you don't actually
have<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.920> cut<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.310> just<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.880> find<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
have to cut it you just have to find the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.020 
have to cut it you just have to find the
melted<00:02:58.130> ends<00:02:58.490> there<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.530> open<00:03:00.530> it<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:01.030> what's

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
melted ends there and open it up what's

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.210 
melted ends there and open it up what's
interesting<00:03:02.480> here<00:03:03.290> and<00:03:03.500> let<00:03:03.680> me<00:03:03.710> see<00:03:03.800> if<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.100> can

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
interesting here and let me see if I can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.870 
interesting here and let me see if I can
open<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.990> is<00:03:05.990> that<00:03:06.350> once<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.770> unroll<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.250> that

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
open it is that once you unroll it that

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.880 
open it is that once you unroll it that
metal<00:03:08.330> ring<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.810> I<00:03:08.930> wanted<00:03:09.320> to<00:03:09.380> keep<00:03:09.560> getting

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
metal ring and I wanted to keep getting

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.300 
metal ring and I wanted to keep getting
some<00:03:10.040> suspense<00:03:10.610> here<00:03:10.880> is<00:03:11.330> actually<00:03:11.959> a<00:03:11.990> tool<00:03:12.350> in

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
some suspense here is actually a tool in

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.550 
some suspense here is actually a tool in
and<00:03:13.520> of<00:03:13.580> itself<00:03:13.910> as<00:03:14.240> well<00:03:14.390> so<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:14.840> holds<00:03:15.380> the

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
and of itself as well so it holds the

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.280 
and of itself as well so it holds the
bracelet<00:03:16.130> together<00:03:16.490> but<00:03:17.240> this<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.959> also<00:03:18.140> a

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
bracelet together but this is also a

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.960 
bracelet together but this is also a
pretty<00:03:18.560> useful<00:03:18.920> little<00:03:19.310> tool<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.790> good

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
pretty useful little tool so it's good

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.449 
pretty useful little tool so it's good
it<00:03:20.360> has<00:03:20.540> two<00:03:20.750> things<00:03:21.110> or<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:21.950> really<00:03:22.310> has

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
it has two things or it really has

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.440 
it has two things or it really has
multiple<00:03:23.380> uses<00:03:24.380> it<00:03:24.800> has<00:03:25.070> a<00:03:25.100> razor<00:03:25.760> fine<00:03:26.209> edge

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
multiple uses it has a razor fine edge

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.810 
multiple uses it has a razor fine edge
this<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.990> super<00:03:27.350> thick<00:03:27.620> it's<00:03:28.490> a<00:03:28.580> little

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
this is not super thick it's a little

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.820 
this is not super thick it's a little
thicker<00:03:29.030> than<00:03:29.270> a<00:03:29.300> typical<00:03:29.600> razor<00:03:29.990> blade<00:03:30.320> but

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
thicker than a typical razor blade but

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.800 
thicker than a typical razor blade but
it<00:03:30.950> has<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.130> razor<00:03:31.490> edge<00:03:31.640> on<00:03:32.090> both<00:03:32.300> sides<00:03:32.570> and

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
it has a razor edge on both sides and

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.630 
it has a razor edge on both sides and
actually<00:03:33.140> what<00:03:33.740> that's<00:03:33.950> gonna<00:03:34.100> allow<00:03:34.280> me<00:03:34.610> to

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
actually what that's gonna allow me to

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.210 
actually what that's gonna allow me to
do<00:03:34.910> here<00:03:35.300> is<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:36.200> should<00:03:36.440> be<00:03:36.530> able<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.709> just<00:03:36.920> cut

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
do here is I should be able to just cut

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.320 
do here is I should be able to just cut
off<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:38.750> end<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:39.050> this<00:03:39.170> paracord

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
off the end of this paracord

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.380 
off the end of this paracord
without<00:03:41.330> having<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> go<00:03:41.780> find<00:03:42.020> another<00:03:43.390> piece

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
without having to go find another piece

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.810 
without having to go find another piece
of<00:03:44.590> another<00:03:45.590> knife<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.790> you've<00:03:47.450> got<00:03:47.750> a<00:03:48.140> a<00:03:48.980> a

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
of another knife so you've got a a a

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.340 
of another knife so you've got a a a
pretty<00:03:50.120> sharp<00:03:50.390> blade<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.480> bracelet

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
pretty sharp blade in the bracelet

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.410 
pretty sharp blade in the bracelet
itself<00:03:54.970> and<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.480> other<00:03:56.660> thing<00:03:56.959> is<00:03:58.300> it's<00:03:59.300> not

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
itself and the other thing is it's not

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.509 
itself and the other thing is it's not
very<00:03:59.480> big<00:03:59.840> but<00:03:59.870> you<00:04:00.200> can<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:00.860> know<00:04:00.890> get<00:04:01.489> a

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
very big but you can you know get a

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.850 
very big but you can you know get a
little<00:04:01.790> more<00:04:01.910> leverage<00:04:02.300> on<00:04:02.600> this<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:03.739> could

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
little more leverage on this you could

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.280 
little more leverage on this you could
also<00:04:04.090> potentially<00:04:05.090> bend<00:04:05.570> this<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:05.959> then<00:04:06.050> put

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
also potentially bend this and then put

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.479 
also potentially bend this and then put
a<00:04:06.320> stick<00:04:06.650> through<00:04:06.830> there<00:04:07.010> and<00:04:07.190> use<00:04:07.459> some

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
a stick through there and use some

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.210 
a stick through there and use some
paracord<00:04:07.940> at<00:04:08.269> cordage<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:08.930> actually<00:04:09.260> create

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
paracord at cordage and actually create

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.009 
paracord at cordage and actually create
a<00:04:10.250> little<00:04:10.459> knife<00:04:10.730> by<00:04:10.940> having<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.690> on<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.870> end

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
a little knife by having it on the end

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.970 
a little knife by having it on the end
but<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.920> has<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.100> serrated<00:04:13.610> edge<00:04:14.030> here<00:04:14.510> and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
but it has a serrated edge here and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.250 
but it has a serrated edge here and
you'd<00:04:15.980> be<00:04:16.100> like<00:04:16.220> well<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.930> would<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.049> saw

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
you'd be like well you would you saw

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.289 
you'd be like well you would you saw
with<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.620> these<00:04:19.220> this<00:04:19.549> is<00:04:19.700> actually<00:04:20.150> very

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
with that these this is actually very

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.140 
with that these this is actually very
useful<00:04:20.479> for<00:04:20.930> if<00:04:21.049> you<00:04:21.169> have<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.350> ferrous<00:04:21.859> rod<00:04:22.150> to

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
useful for if you have a ferrous rod to

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.520 
useful for if you have a ferrous rod to
scrape<00:04:23.720> off<00:04:24.050> kind<00:04:24.800> of<00:04:24.890> grind<00:04:25.220> off<00:04:25.580> some<00:04:26.060> of<00:04:26.090> the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
scrape off kind of grind off some of the

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.230 
scrape off kind of grind off some of the
some<00:04:27.530> metal<00:04:27.830> shavings<00:04:28.100> so<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.820> can<00:04:29.030> use

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
some metal shavings so that you can use

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.490 
some metal shavings so that you can use
the<00:04:29.510> striker<00:04:30.250> to<00:04:31.570> make<00:04:32.570> a<00:04:32.600> spark<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.110> catch<00:04:33.320> it

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
the striker to make a spark and catch it

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.830 
the striker to make a spark and catch it
so<00:04:33.650> if<00:04:34.040> you<00:04:34.130> have<00:04:34.280> one<00:04:34.430> of<00:04:34.520> those<00:04:34.640> first<00:04:35.570> rods

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
so if you have one of those first rods

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.110 
so if you have one of those first rods
and<00:04:36.080> magnesium<00:04:36.740> sticks<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.640> can<00:04:37.669> actually

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
and magnesium sticks you can actually

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.800 
and magnesium sticks you can actually
create<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:39.380> fire<00:04:40.010> with<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.880> think<00:04:41.240> in

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
create I fire with this so I think in

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.390 
create I fire with this so I think in
the<00:04:42.020> advertisement<00:04:42.650> for<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:43.040> or<00:04:43.220> in<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
the advertisement for this or in the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.490 
the advertisement for this or in the
listing<00:04:43.729> they<00:04:44.180> call<00:04:44.419> it<00:04:44.600> a<00:04:44.660> fire<00:04:44.870> starter<00:04:45.290> but

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
listing they call it a fire starter but

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.080 
listing they call it a fire starter but
it's<00:04:45.979> actually<00:04:46.310> pretty<00:04:46.490> nice<00:04:46.669> because<00:04:46.789> it<00:04:46.970> has

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
it's actually pretty nice because it has

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.210 
it's actually pretty nice because it has
like<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.419> said<00:04:47.660> it's<00:04:48.080> pretty<00:04:48.349> sharp<00:04:48.620> blade<00:04:48.950> as

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
like I said it's pretty sharp blade as

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.300 
like I said it's pretty sharp blade as
well

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
well

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.000 
well
you<00:04:50.940> know<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.300> it's<00:04:51.720> not<00:04:51.960> going<00:04:52.230> to<00:04:52.500> be<00:04:52.980> a

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
you know it's it's not going to be a

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:56.300 
you know it's it's not going to be a
survival<00:04:53.520> knife<00:04:53.940> but<00:04:54.300> it's<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.800> is<00:04:56.010> going<00:04:56.220> to

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
survival knife but it's this is going to

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.970 
survival knife but it's this is going to
be<00:04:56.400> extremely<00:04:57.240> useful<00:04:57.270> to<00:04:57.750> have<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.530> I'm<00:04:58.770> just

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
be extremely useful to have so I'm just

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.740 
be extremely useful to have so I'm just
wanting<00:04:59.160> to<00:04:59.280> fray<00:04:59.640> the<00:04:59.850> edge<00:05:00.000> here<00:05:00.390> as<00:05:00.570> you<00:05:00.720> can

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
wanting to fray the edge here as you can

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.540 
wanting to fray the edge here as you can
see<00:05:00.870> you've<00:05:01.650> got<00:05:01.680> kind<00:05:02.070> of<00:05:02.100> this<00:05:02.250> woven

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
see you've got kind of this woven

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.180 
see you've got kind of this woven
outside<00:05:03.330> nylon<00:05:03.840> edge<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.350> then<00:05:04.710> inside

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
outside nylon edge and then inside

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.680 
outside nylon edge and then inside
paracord<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.330> have<00:05:07.910> any<00:05:08.910> number<00:05:09.270> of<00:05:09.300> other

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
paracord you have any number of other

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.730 
paracord you have any number of other
wound<00:05:10.410> strands<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.670> this<00:05:11.790> one<00:05:12.000> has<00:05:12.740> seven

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
wound strands and this one has seven

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.490 
wound strands and this one has seven
wild<00:05:14.070> strands<00:05:14.400> so<00:05:14.550> you<00:05:15.030> know<00:05:15.150> 500<00:05:15.960> pound

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
wild strands so you know 500 pound

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.040 
wild strands so you know 500 pound
cordage<00:05:17.070> you<00:05:17.640> divide<00:05:18.000> that<00:05:18.030> by<00:05:18.450> seven<00:05:18.930> and

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
cordage you divide that by seven and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.170 
cordage you divide that by seven and
that's<00:05:19.260> what<00:05:19.590> each<00:05:19.770> of<00:05:19.920> these<00:05:20.040> cords<00:05:20.490> could

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
that's what each of these cords could

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.350 
that's what each of these cords could
potentially<00:05:21.810> support<00:05:22.020> so<00:05:23.000> particularly<00:05:24.000> if

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
potentially support so particularly if

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.560 
potentially support so particularly if
you're<00:05:24.480> trying<00:05:24.780> to<00:05:24.900> make<00:05:25.080> fishing<00:05:25.560> line<00:05:25.770> or

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
you're trying to make fishing line or

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:31.310 
you're trying to make fishing line or
tie<00:05:27.570> a<00:05:27.600> boot<00:05:28.020> or<00:05:28.410> even<00:05:29.690> sew<00:05:30.690> suture<00:05:31.200> or

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
tie a boot or even sew suture or

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.660 
tie a boot or even sew suture or
something<00:05:31.620> like<00:05:31.800> that<00:05:32.040> you<00:05:32.520> don't

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
something like that you don't

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.090 
something like that you don't
necessarily<00:05:32.790> need<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:33.930> full<00:05:34.290> court<00:05:34.710> here<00:05:34.980> and

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 
necessarily need the full court here and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.670 
necessarily need the full court here and
so<00:05:35.310> this<00:05:35.490> actually<00:05:35.850> makes<00:05:36.120> a<00:05:36.690> paracord<00:05:37.440> go<00:05:37.650> a

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
so this actually makes a paracord go a

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.140 
so this actually makes a paracord go a
long<00:05:37.980> way<00:05:38.160> because<00:05:38.370> you<00:05:38.640> can<00:05:38.790> use<00:05:38.910> some<00:05:39.120> of

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
long way because you can use some of

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.410 
long way because you can use some of
these<00:05:39.270> two<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:41.310> tie<00:05:41.490> things<00:05:41.550> together<00:05:42.000> without

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
these two to tie things together without

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
these two to tie things together without
having<00:05:43.020> to<00:05:43.260> sacrifice<00:05:44.100> the<00:05:44.250> entire<00:05:45.230> length<00:05:46.230> of

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
having to sacrifice the entire length of

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.410 
having to sacrifice the entire length of
court<00:05:46.710> now<00:05:47.040> the<00:05:47.100> other<00:05:47.400> thing<00:05:47.670> is<00:05:47.700> this<00:05:48.360> is

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
court now the other thing is this is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.810 
court now the other thing is this is
like<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.080> said<00:05:49.320> pretty<00:05:49.800> long<00:05:50.130> as<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.460> can<00:05:50.670> see

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
like I said pretty long as you can see

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.400 
like I said pretty long as you can see
in<00:05:50.910> the<00:05:51.000> time-lapse<00:05:51.450> took<00:05:52.020> me<00:05:52.140> a<00:05:52.200> while<00:05:52.350> to

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
in the time-lapse took me a while to

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.930 
in the time-lapse took me a while to
unravel<00:05:53.220> this<00:05:53.310> thing<00:05:53.370> I<00:05:53.580> don't<00:05:53.640> know<00:05:53.850> if

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
unravel this thing I don't know if

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.520 
unravel this thing I don't know if
there's<00:05:54.090> any<00:05:54.210> quick<00:05:54.390> way<00:05:54.510> to<00:05:54.570> do<00:05:54.750> it<00:05:54.870> but<00:05:55.020> you

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
there's any quick way to do it but you

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:57.080 
there's any quick way to do it but you
know<00:05:55.650> it's<00:05:56.010> really<00:05:56.160> only<00:05:56.580> meant<00:05:56.790> to<00:05:56.940> be

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
know it's really only meant to be

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.410 
know it's really only meant to be
unraveled<00:05:57.960> for<00:05:58.170> that<00:05:59.040> survival<00:06:00.000> need<00:06:00.180> that

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
unraveled for that survival need that

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.480 
unraveled for that survival need that
you<00:06:00.540> have<00:06:00.750> not<00:06:01.020> just<00:06:01.050> any<00:06:01.710> time<00:06:02.190> you<00:06:02.370> need

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
you have not just any time you need

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.910 
you have not just any time you need
cordage<00:06:02.910> because<00:06:03.270> once<00:06:03.750> it's<00:06:03.960> like<00:06:04.140> this<00:06:04.290> it's

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
cordage because once it's like this it's

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.310 
cordage because once it's like this it's
no<00:06:05.160> longer<00:06:05.400> a<00:06:05.580> bracelet<00:06:06.120> so<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:07.080> cool<00:06:07.290> thing

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:07.320 
no longer a bracelet so the cool thing

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.500 
no longer a bracelet so the cool thing
about<00:06:07.470> this<00:06:07.800> this<00:06:08.370> particular<00:06:08.610> one<00:06:09.060> survival

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
about this this particular one survival

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.080 
about this this particular one survival
bracelet<00:06:09.930> is<00:06:10.110> it<00:06:10.680> has<00:06:10.860> a<00:06:10.890> survival<00:06:11.460> tool<00:06:11.670> in<00:06:11.940> it

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
bracelet is it has a survival tool in it

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.880 
bracelet is it has a survival tool in it
too<00:06:12.270> so<00:06:12.570> keep<00:06:13.320> that<00:06:13.470> in<00:06:13.530> mind

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:13.890 
too so keep that in mind

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
too so keep that in mind
and<00:06:14.100> also<00:06:14.190> keep<00:06:14.430> in<00:06:14.490> mind<00:06:14.550> as<00:06:14.790> you're

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
and also keep in mind as you're

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.990 
and also keep in mind as you're
unraveling<00:06:15.600> it<00:06:15.890> that<00:06:16.890> this<00:06:17.310> thing<00:06:17.580> is<00:06:17.760> pretty

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
unraveling it that this thing is pretty

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.530 
unraveling it that this thing is pretty
sharp<00:06:18.240> not<00:06:18.780> for<00:06:18.990> kids<00:06:19.250> to<00:06:20.250> be<00:06:20.370> taken<00:06:20.670> seriously

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
sharp not for kids to be taken seriously

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.360 
sharp not for kids to be taken seriously
I<00:06:21.630> did<00:06:21.870> kind<00:06:22.440> of<00:06:22.470> Knick<00:06:22.710> myself<00:06:23.160> a<00:06:23.220> little

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
I did kind of Knick myself a little

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.210 
I did kind of Knick myself a little
unravel<00:06:23.910> on<00:06:23.970> it<00:06:24.090> but<00:06:24.240> not<00:06:24.420> bad<00:06:24.660> and<00:06:24.890> so<00:06:25.890> cool

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
unravel on it but not bad and so cool

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.700 
unravel on it but not bad and so cool
