just<00:02:34.170> random<00:02:34.560> black<00:02:34.739> lines<00:02:39.110> like<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:41.599> see

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
just random black lines like that see

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:47.870 
just random black lines like that see
that<00:02:45.110> um<00:02:46.110> keep<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.829> mind<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.160> i<00:02:47.370> really<00:02:47.670> don't

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
that um keep in mind that i really don't

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.660 
that um keep in mind that i really don't
have<00:02:48.090> any<00:02:48.360> idea<00:02:48.480> what<00:02:48.989> I<00:02:49.049> about<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> do<00:02:50.280> I<00:02:50.310> just

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
have any idea what I about to do I just

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.479 
have any idea what I about to do I just
once<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.329> start<00:02:51.540> designing<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.530> just<00:02:52.739> keep<00:02:53.160> going

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
once I start designing I just keep going

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.479 
once I start designing I just keep going
and<00:02:53.549> see<00:02:53.640> what<00:02:53.910> comes<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:55.190> okay<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.400> i'm

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
and see what comes up okay now i'm

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.849 
and see what comes up okay now i'm
taking<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.850> yellow<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:59.000> making<00:03:00.000> even<00:03:00.150> more

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
taking the yellow and making even more

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.849 
taking the yellow and making even more
random<00:03:01.859> lines<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.630> i<00:03:03.750> think<00:03:04.019> right<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.620> i'm

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
random lines and i think right here i'm

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.870 
random lines and i think right here i'm
gonna<00:03:05.010> cross<00:03:05.579> it<00:03:05.609> off<00:03:08.900> like<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.819> then<00:03:11.819> I'm

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
gonna cross it off like that then I'm

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.670 
gonna cross it off like that then I'm
going<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.090> come<00:03:12.269> down<00:03:12.450> here<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:13.139> go<00:03:13.530> another

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
going to come down here and go another

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.210 
going to come down here and go another
line<00:03:15.829> I'm<00:03:16.829> going<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.190> cross<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.609> one<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.850> small

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
line I'm going to cross this one a small

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:27.080 
line I'm going to cross this one a small
and<00:03:20.220> then<00:03:21.290> another<00:03:22.290> one<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:26.090> so

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and then another one here like that so

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.190 
and then another one here like that so
far<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.000> course<00:03:30.030> if<00:03:30.450> your<00:03:30.569> notes<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:30.959> a

far and of course if your notes are a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.039 
far and of course if your notes are a
lot<00:03:31.500> smaller<00:03:31.859> than<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:33.359> notes<00:03:33.569> i'm<00:03:33.720> working

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.199 
lot smaller than the notes i'm working
with<00:03:34.079> now<00:03:34.380> which<00:03:34.620> more<00:03:35.549> than<00:03:35.579> likely<00:03:35.730> they

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
with now which more than likely they

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.759 
with now which more than likely they
will<00:03:36.420> be<00:03:39.200> disproportionate<00:03:40.200> your<00:03:40.380> lines<00:03:40.590> or

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
will be disproportionate your lines or

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.069 
will be disproportionate your lines or
leave<00:03:40.920> off<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.400> bottom<00:03:41.819> design<00:03:42.000> the<00:03:42.750> bottom

section<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.769> design<00:03:44.239> okay<00:03:45.239> i<00:03:45.920> forgot<00:03:46.920> to

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
section of the design okay i forgot to

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.210 
section of the design okay i forgot to
mention<00:03:47.069> on<00:03:47.400> with<00:03:47.519> using<00:03:47.819> gold<00:03:48.000> but<00:03:48.920> i'm<00:03:49.920> just

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
mention on with using gold but i'm just

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.120

a<00:03:50.310> glitter<00:03:50.549> kind<00:03:50.819> of<00:03:50.880> person<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:51.889> I'm<00:03:52.889> gonna

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
a glitter kind of person so I'm gonna

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:59.630 
a glitter kind of person so I'm gonna
fill<00:03:53.400> in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.269> green<00:03:54.569> line<00:03:54.810> so<00:03:55.109> that<00:03:55.139> we<00:03:55.349> drew

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:08.820 

we<00:04:00.640> thought<00:04:02.459> going<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.580> curbing<00:04:04.090> them

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.780 

with<00:04:09.490> that<00:04:10.920> Anton's<00:04:11.920> there's<00:04:12.100> enough<00:04:12.460> lines

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
with that Anton's there's enough lines

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.480 
with that Anton's there's enough lines
in<00:04:13.000> there<00:04:13.120> already<00:04:13.330> I<00:04:13.950> think<00:04:14.950> I'll<00:04:15.070> just<00:04:15.100> use

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
in there already I think I'll just use

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.390 
in there already I think I'll just use
white<00:04:16.239> dots<00:04:16.570> instead<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:17.080> white<00:04:17.320> striped<00:04:18.190> bees

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
white dots instead of white striped bees

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.880 
white dots instead of white striped bees
in<00:04:18.640> there<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:20.140> let<00:04:20.290> me<00:04:20.380> go<00:04:20.500> ahead<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.680> check

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
in there so let me go ahead and check

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.970 
in there so let me go ahead and check
this<00:04:21.070> open<00:04:21.400> poor<00:04:21.670> someone's<00:04:21.970> on<00:04:22.120> paper<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.860> use

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980

time you decide the dots i mean the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.210 
time you decide the dots i mean the
otter<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:58.450> numbers<00:04:58.810> night<00:04:59.680> I<00:04:59.710> mean<00:04:59.890> otters

otter the numbers night I mean otters
and<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.430> unemployment<00:05:00.700> otter<00:05:01.510> as<00:05:01.780> an<00:05:01.990> odd<00:05:02.340> um

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
and the unemployment otter as an odd um

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.020 
and the unemployment otter as an odd um
the<00:05:04.180> better<00:05:04.360> it<00:05:04.510> will<00:05:04.600> come<00:05:04.780> out<00:05:05.050> at<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.560> end

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
the better it will come out at the end

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.110 
the better it will come out at the end
and<00:05:07.030> I'm<00:05:07.150> just<00:05:07.390> gonna<00:05:08.100> make<00:05:09.100> two<00:05:09.490> three<00:05:09.910> dots

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
and I'm just gonna make two three dots

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.310 
and I'm just gonna make two three dots
right<00:05:10.390> there<00:05:11.310> and<00:05:12.630> even<00:05:13.630> cheeks<00:05:13.960> to<00:05:14.080> stop

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
right there and even cheeks to stop

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.659 
right there and even cheeks to stop
there<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.710> could<00:05:14.860> keep<00:05:15.010> going<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.490> think

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
there you could keep going I think

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.080 
there you could keep going I think
that's<00:05:15.820> a<00:05:15.880> pretty<00:05:16.060> good<00:05:16.270> look<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.880> this<00:05:18.880> is

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
that's a pretty good look and this is

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.530 
that's a pretty good look and this is
the<00:05:19.510> design<00:05:19.840> hope<00:05:20.830> you<00:05:20.919> guys<00:05:21.100> like<00:05:21.340> it<00:05:21.370> and<00:05:21.910> I

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
the design hope you guys like it and I
