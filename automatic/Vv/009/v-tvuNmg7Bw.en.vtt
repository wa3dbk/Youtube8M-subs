open up for a cross body lead okay I go

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.880 
open up for a cross body lead okay I go
one<00:01:42.500> two<00:01:42.850> three<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.540> course<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.170> she

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
now the difference between this and a

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:50.710 
now the difference between this and a
regular<00:01:49.520> cross<00:01:49.910> body<00:01:50.119> lead<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.390> that<00:01:50.509> I'm

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
regular cross body lead is that I'm

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.600 
regular cross body lead is that I'm
actually<00:01:50.930> gonna<00:01:51.170> lead<00:01:51.680> across<00:01:51.890> my<00:01:52.160> lead<00:01:52.340> with

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
actually gonna lead across my lead with

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.820 
actually gonna lead across my lead with
a<00:01:52.640> turn<00:01:53.030> except<00:01:53.869> I'm<00:01:53.990> gonna<00:01:54.140> stop<00:01:54.350> her<00:01:54.530> to<00:01:54.649> make

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
a turn except I'm gonna stop her to make

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.139 
a turn except I'm gonna stop her to make
sure<00:01:54.979> she's<00:01:55.190> facing<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.670> same<00:01:55.910> direction

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149

movie pattern now from here I have

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.930 
movie pattern now from here I have
multiple<00:02:17.330> options<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:19.400> start<00:02:19.610> off<00:02:19.730> with

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
multiple options for to start off with

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.850 
multiple options for to start off with
right<00:02:20.239> I<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:20.959> give<00:02:21.200> her<00:02:21.260> a<00:02:21.320> simple<00:02:21.650> spin

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
right I can just give her a simple spin

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.220 
right I can just give her a simple spin
a<00:02:22.100> she's<00:02:22.820> coming<00:02:23.120> down<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:23.570> step<00:02:23.840> she's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
a she's coming down to this step she's

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.430 
a she's coming down to this step she's
gonna<00:02:24.380> settle<00:02:24.709> into<00:02:24.980> your<00:02:25.040> step<00:02:25.340> four<00:02:25.910> one<00:02:26.780> two

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
gonna settle into your step four one two

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.620 
gonna settle into your step four one two
three<00:02:28.190> that<00:02:28.790> step<00:02:29.060> is<00:02:29.180> very<00:02:29.360> crucial

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
three that step is very crucial

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.300 
three that step is very crucial
depending<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.320> what<00:02:30.500> movie<00:02:30.799> you<00:02:30.890> do<00:02:31.010> because

it's gonna provide you with some

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.240 
it's gonna provide you with some
momentum<00:02:32.900> or<00:02:33.260> where<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> girl<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:33.830> gonna<00:02:34.070> go

because I'm gonna just give her a simple

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.140 
because I'm gonna just give her a simple
spin<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.799> start<00:02:37.070> off<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.370> I'm<00:02:37.519> gonna<00:02:37.730> use<00:02:37.910> my

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
spin to start off with I'm gonna use my

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.780 
spin to start off with I'm gonna use my
right<00:02:38.330> hand<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.810> guide<00:02:39.380> this<00:02:39.560> hand<00:02:39.830> around<00:02:40.070> to

right hand to guide this hand around to
give<00:02:41.000> her<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> spin<00:02:41.480> okay<00:02:42.320> now<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.730> steps

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
give her a spin okay now with the steps

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.810 
give her a spin okay now with the steps
that<00:02:45.200> would<00:02:45.290> look<00:02:45.440> something<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.769> this<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.280> do

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
that would look something like this I do

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.940 
that would look something like this I do
one<00:02:47.810> two<00:02:48.410> three<00:02:49.299> five<00:02:50.299> six<00:02:50.330> seven

one two three five six seven

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.740 
one two three five six seven
and<00:02:52.040> of<00:02:52.400> course<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.850> end<00:02:52.970> up<00:02:53.060> here<00:02:53.269> coming<00:02:53.570> on

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
and of course I end up here coming on

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.660 
and of course I end up here coming on
one<00:02:54.650> two<00:02:55.100> three<00:02:55.640> okay<00:02:56.030> another<00:02:56.720> option<00:02:57.670> as

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
one two three okay another option as

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.600 
one two three okay another option as
she's<00:02:59.000> open<00:02:59.360> I<00:02:59.570> can<00:03:00.110> actually<00:03:00.470> move<00:03:00.860> her<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.459> my

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
she's open I can actually move her to my

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.390 
she's open I can actually move her to my
right<00:03:01.790> hand<00:03:02.090> side<00:03:02.980> again<00:03:03.980> using<00:03:04.280> that

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
right hand side again using that

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.729 
right hand side again using that
settling<00:03:04.880> step<00:03:05.180> she<00:03:05.959> can<00:03:06.079> come<00:03:06.260> forward<00:03:06.650> on

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
settling step she can come forward on

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.620 
settling step she can come forward on
one<00:03:07.489> two<00:03:08.180> three<00:03:08.959> now<00:03:10.060> because<00:03:11.060> I'm<00:03:11.180> using<00:03:11.360> my

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
one two three now because I'm using my

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.260 
one two three now because I'm using my
right<00:03:11.840> hand

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
right hand

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.720 
right hand
left<00:03:12.540> hand<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.840> can<00:03:12.990> now<00:03:13.170> use<00:03:13.200> both<00:03:13.710> hands<00:03:14.220> to

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
left hand I can now use both hands to

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.600 
left hand I can now use both hands to
actually<00:03:14.880> guide<00:03:15.450> her<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.260> my<00:03:16.380> right<00:03:16.610> making

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
actually guide her to my right making

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.830 
actually guide her to my right making
sure<00:03:17.760> she's<00:03:18.000> still<00:03:18.090> facing<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.600> same

and a one two three okay my last option

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.800 
and a one two three okay my last option
is<00:03:52.290> basically<00:03:52.800> not<00:03:53.580> only<00:03:53.790> just<00:03:53.940> mover<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.720> the

in<00:03:57.270> now<00:03:57.990> this<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> little<00:03:58.680> bit<00:03:58.770> more

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
in now this is a little bit more

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.490 
in now this is a little bit more
complicated<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.520> just<00:04:00.180> work<00:04:00.690> work<00:04:01.230> your<00:04:01.350> way

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
complicated so just work work your way

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.290 
complicated so just work work your way
from<00:04:01.560> basic<00:04:01.950> intermediate<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.760> advanced

from basic intermediate and advanced
right<00:04:03.830> now

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
right now

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.850 
right now
using<00:04:05.520> both<00:04:05.670> hands<00:04:05.940> same<00:04:06.600> kind<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.170> mechanic

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
using both hands same kind of mechanic

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.770 
using both hands same kind of mechanic
except<00:04:08.340> my<00:04:08.610> left<00:04:08.820> hand<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.090> gonna<00:04:09.210> play<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.540> much

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
except my left hand is gonna play a much

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.770 
except my left hand is gonna play a much
larger<00:04:10.140> role<00:04:10.830> instead<00:04:11.790> of<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.150> guiding<00:04:12.600> her

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
larger role instead of just guiding her

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.310 
larger role instead of just guiding her
on<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:14.100> side<00:04:14.370> I'm<00:04:15.240> actually<00:04:15.600> gonna<00:04:15.900> try<00:04:16.170> and

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
on this side I'm actually gonna try and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680 
on this side I'm actually gonna try and
start<00:04:17.130> facing<00:04:17.609> her<00:04:17.760> in<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.299> opposite

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
start facing her in the opposite

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.020 
start facing her in the opposite
direction<00:04:18.810> okay<00:04:19.650> so<00:04:19.709> that's<00:04:20.220> where<00:04:20.489> my<00:04:20.850> left

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030
