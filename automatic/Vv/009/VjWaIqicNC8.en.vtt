just<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.629> poor<00:00:45.899> photonic<00:00:46.500> crusher

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
just so good and a poor photonic crusher

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.490 
just so good and a poor photonic crusher
here<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.190> making<00:00:47.550> me<00:00:47.640> stronger<00:00:47.910> than<00:00:48.210> that

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
here is making me stronger than that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.939 
here is making me stronger than that
number<00:00:49.500> 17<00:00:50.870> never<00:00:51.870> too<00:00:52.020> soon<00:00:52.110> photons<00:00:52.559> blew<00:00:52.770> an

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
number 17 never too soon photons blew an

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.950 
number 17 never too soon photons blew an
honest<00:00:53.460> comes<00:00:53.670> out<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> be

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
honest comes out so that's going to be

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.049 
honest comes out so that's going to be
pretty<00:00:55.110> darn<00:00:55.410> good<00:00:55.500> as<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> response<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.910> it'll

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
pretty darn good as a response so it'll

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:05.149 
pretty darn good as a response so it'll
be<00:00:57.120> taking<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.449> thousand<00:00:57.719> damage<00:01:04.100> okay<00:01:05.100> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is but I do definitely to cast these

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
is but I do definitely to cast these
games<00:01:14.640> where<00:01:14.850> people<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:16.110> speak<00:01:16.409> English

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
games where people don't speak English

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.440 
games where people don't speak English
because<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.520> see<00:01:17.700> what<00:01:17.850> different<00:01:18.299> decks

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
because you can see what different decks

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.670 
because you can see what different decks
that<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> play<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.259> what's<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
that they like to play and what's the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.749 
that they like to play and what's the
meta<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.820> those<00:01:20.970> areas<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:22.340> many<00:01:23.340> photons

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
meta and of those areas so many photons

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.780 
meta and of those areas so many photons
are<00:01:23.939> meta<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.630> where<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.049> are<00:01:25.200> um<00:01:25.790> although

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
are meta over where they are um although

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.429 
are meta over where they are um although
I<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.119> personally<00:01:27.630> haven't<00:01:27.750> seen<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.049> photons

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
I I personally haven't seen the photons

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.060 
I I personally haven't seen the photons
really<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.799> too<00:01:29.549> well<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.720> there's<00:01:30.960> um<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
really do too well I know there's um is

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
really do too well I know there's um is
that<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.340> twin<00:01:32.579> photon<00:01:32.759> lizard<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.140> i

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that the twin photon lizard thing and i

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.399 
that the twin photon lizard thing and i
carted<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.860> decent<00:01:35.220> just<00:01:35.369> because<00:01:36.409> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
carted pretty decent just because you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.679 
carted pretty decent just because you
know<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.040> can<00:01:38.250> use<00:01:38.820> future<00:01:39.180> fusion<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
know I you can use future fusion with it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
know I you can use future fusion with it
and<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.900> works<00:01:40.049> quite<00:01:40.320> well<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.340> can

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and it works quite well because you can

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
and it works quite well because you can
even<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.970> double<00:01:42.329> dot<00:01:42.479> C<00:01:42.689> eyes<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.140> he

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
even get out double dot C eyes and he

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.889 
even get out double dot C eyes and he
takes<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:45.000> know<00:01:45.149> let<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.420> only<00:01:45.540> take<00:01:45.689> four

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
takes you know let you only take four

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.440 
takes you know let you only take four
thousand<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:49.100> yeah<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
thousand from that but yeah you know it

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.389 
thousand from that but yeah you know it
takes<00:01:51.570> maybe<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.530> put<00:01:52.860> 20,000

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
takes maybe he actually put 20,000

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.899 
takes maybe he actually put 20,000
button<00:01:53.640> yeah<00:01:53.899> so

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
button yeah so

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590 

I<00:01:57.469> mean<00:01:58.789> prix<00:01:59.789> de<00:01:59.909> semanas<00:02:00.119> kind<00:02:00.539> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
I mean prix de semanas kind of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
I mean prix de semanas kind of
aggressive<00:02:00.810> push<00:02:01.109> although<00:02:01.859> all<00:02:02.159> these

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
aggressive push although all these

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.059

interesting<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.959> thought<00:02:12.959> he<00:02:13.049> was<00:02:13.140> going<00:02:13.230> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
interesting I thought he was going to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.990 
interesting I thought he was going to
make<00:02:13.379> an<00:02:13.560> exceed<00:02:13.920> which<00:02:14.370> could<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.819> viable

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
make an exceed which could be a viable

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.770 
make an exceed which could be a viable
option<00:02:15.209> either<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.730> ooh<00:02:17.730> dark<00:02:18.660> hole

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
option either so it's ooh dark hole

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.030 
option either so it's ooh dark hole
comes<00:02:18.989> out<00:02:19.140> sounds<00:02:19.379> kind<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.590> unfortunate<00:02:19.890> oh

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.729 

yeah<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.280> banish<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:27.319> both<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.470> monsters

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
yeah if you banish the both of monsters

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.949 
yeah if you banish the both of monsters
get<00:02:28.860> banished<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.280> XYZ<00:02:29.640> arterials<00:02:30.599> don't<00:02:30.810> get

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
get banished the XYZ arterials don't get

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.289 
get banished the XYZ arterials don't get
back<00:02:31.140> go<00:02:31.470> back<00:02:31.620> on<00:02:31.829> apparently<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.670> he's

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
back go back on apparently so he's

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.380 
back go back on apparently so he's
basically<00:02:33.480> an<00:02:33.810> anti<00:02:34.170> XYZ<00:02:34.709> card<00:02:35.239> since<00:02:36.239> our

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
basically an anti XYZ card since our

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.270 
basically an anti XYZ card since our
player<00:02:36.629> in<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> blue<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.440> did<00:02:38.040> someone

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
player in the blue I did someone

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.000 
player in the blue I did someone
targeted<00:02:38.610> earlier<00:02:39.470> kind<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.530> really<00:02:40.769> he<00:02:40.890> was

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
targeted earlier kind of really he was

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.860 
targeted earlier kind of really he was
at<00:02:41.220> least<00:02:41.370> plenty<00:02:41.610> exceeds<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.390> don't

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
at least plenty exceeds but I don't

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.300 
at least plenty exceeds but I don't
think<00:02:42.959> someone<00:02:43.230> would<00:02:43.349> go<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> exceed<00:02:44.069> I

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
think someone would go for a exceed I

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.800 
think someone would go for a exceed I

sorry just targeting it so yeah if

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.440 
sorry just targeting it so yeah if
you're<00:03:49.459> treating<00:03:49.760> would<00:03:49.910> go<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.270> I

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
you're treating would go to it I

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.570 
you're treating would go to it I
personally<00:03:51.020> think<00:03:51.290> you<00:03:51.470> should<00:03:51.620> always<00:03:51.800> chain

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
personally think you should always chain

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.790 
personally think you should always chain
MSC<00:03:53.060> just<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:53.630> your<00:03:53.750> opponent<00:03:54.050> doesn't<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.440> get

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
MSC just so your opponent doesn't I get

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.520 
MSC just so your opponent doesn't I get
those<00:03:54.920> cards<00:03:55.160> on<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.310> graveyard<00:03:56.530> because

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
those cards on the graveyard because

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:58.449 
those cards on the graveyard because
getting<00:03:57.709> those<00:03:57.860> cars<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.190> rear<00:03:58.310> end

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
getting those cars in the rear end

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.100 
getting those cars in the rear end
doesn't<00:03:58.580> does<00:03:59.209> just<00:03:59.480> kind<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.810> know<00:03:59.840> deck

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
doesn't does just kind of you know deck

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.960 
doesn't does just kind of you know deck
them<00:04:00.349> as<00:04:00.470> well<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:04.250> looks<00:04:04.610> like<00:04:04.640> when<00:04:04.790> we<00:04:04.880> see

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
them as well so looks like when we see

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.309 
them as well so looks like when we see
some<00:04:05.120> beat<00:04:05.300> down<00:04:05.480> here<00:04:05.690> from<00:04:05.810> you<00:04:05.900> that<00:04:06.020> hyper

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
some beat down here from you that hyper

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.449 
some beat down here from you that hyper
chaos<00:04:06.709> player<00:04:08.860> every<00:04:09.860> chance<00:04:10.010> is<00:04:10.130> actually

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
chaos player every chance is actually

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.830 
chaos player every chance is actually
getting<00:04:10.580> really<00:04:10.819> popular<00:04:10.970> I've<00:04:11.209> seen<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.660> lot

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
getting really popular I've seen a lot

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.949 
getting really popular I've seen a lot
of<00:04:12.080> duels<00:04:12.970> people<00:04:13.970> playing<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:14.420> it's<00:04:14.840> pretty

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
of duels people playing and it's pretty

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.719 
of duels people playing and it's pretty
interesting<00:04:15.290> deck<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:15.739> para<00:04:16.040> has<00:04:16.669> a

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
interesting deck just para has a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.879 
interesting deck just para has a
relatively<00:04:17.180> decent<00:04:17.299> pace<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:18.109> doesn't<00:04:18.560> take

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
relatively decent pace it doesn't take

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.610 
relatively decent pace it doesn't take
maybe<00:04:19.220> one<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.609> turn<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.229> set<00:04:21.229> up<00:04:21.410> though

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
maybe one to turn to set up though

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.370 
maybe one to turn to set up though
because<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:22.100> can't<00:04:23.000> accept<00:04:23.240> the<00:04:23.450> explode<00:04:23.990> first

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
because I can't accept the explode first

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.520 
because I can't accept the explode first
turn<00:04:24.970> I<00:04:25.970> guess<00:04:26.810> maybe<00:04:26.960> if<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.110> have<00:04:27.229> a<00:04:27.260> foolish

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
turn I guess maybe if you have a foolish

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.350 
turn I guess maybe if you have a foolish
pearl<00:04:27.740> but<00:04:28.010> that<00:04:28.520> wouldn't<00:04:28.700> be<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:28.850> very<00:04:28.880> viable

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
pearl but that wouldn't be a very viable

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.350 
pearl but that wouldn't be a very viable
time<00:04:30.370> sheet<00:04:31.370> dimensional<00:04:31.910> prison<00:04:32.030> come<00:04:32.270> out

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
time sheet dimensional prison come out

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.580 
time sheet dimensional prison come out
and<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:32.810> gonna<00:04:32.900> get<00:04:33.080> rid<00:04:33.229> of<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.380> Cal

ical sorcerer which I know that's worth

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.760 
ical sorcerer which I know that's worth
it<00:04:39.650> because<00:04:40.960> well<00:04:41.960> it's<00:04:42.169> like<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.410> dark<00:04:42.650> hole

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
judgment should be a card used

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.230 
judgment should be a card used
essentially<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.210> stop<00:05:08.479> the<00:05:09.820> but<00:05:10.820> having

essentially to stop the but having

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.640 
essentially to stop the but having
cancer<00:05:11.660> sir<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:11.930> wasn't<00:05:12.080> really<00:05:12.260> control

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
cancer sir it wasn't really control

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.029 
cancer sir it wasn't really control
anyways<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:14.180> I<00:05:15.080> mean<00:05:15.229> you<00:05:15.380> usually<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.919> run

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
anyways and I mean you usually can run

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.100 
anyways and I mean you usually can run
three<00:05:16.400> of<00:05:16.520> those<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.850> there<00:05:16.970> so<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.539> wasn't

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
three of those in there so it wasn't

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.020 
three of those in there so it wasn't
really<00:05:18.260> what<00:05:18.410> song<00:05:18.650> judgment<00:05:19.100> in<00:05:19.220> and<00:05:19.760> we<00:05:19.850> see

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
really what song judgment in and we see

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.390 
really what song judgment in and we see
an<00:05:20.090> effect<00:05:20.390> better<00:05:20.570> come<00:05:20.780> out<00:05:20.930> and<00:05:21.250> that's<00:05:22.250> my

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
an effect better come out and that's my

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.940 
an effect better come out and that's my
software<00:05:22.610> guy<00:05:22.990> from<00:05:23.990> by<00:05:24.140> making<00:05:24.470> that<00:05:24.590> levy<00:05:24.830> a

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
software guy from by making that levy a

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.290 
software guy from by making that levy a
most<00:05:25.310> likely<00:05:26.919> so<00:05:27.919> one<00:05:28.880> of<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.030> tour<00:05:29.150> guides

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
most likely so one of the tour guides

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.930 
most likely so one of the tour guides
was<00:05:29.510> back<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.340> that's<00:05:31.340> unfortunate<00:05:31.520> because

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:31.940 
was back and that's unfortunate because

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.340 
was back and that's unfortunate because
our<00:05:32.240> player<00:05:32.510> dad<00:05:32.690> can<00:05:32.870> draw<00:05:32.960> a<00:05:32.990> photon

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
our player dad can draw a photon

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.800 
our player dad can draw a photon
Thrasher<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.280> attack<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.750> Oratory<00:05:35.750> guy

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
Thrasher and just attack the Oratory guy

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.690 
Thrasher and just attack the Oratory guy
with<00:05:35.990> only<00:05:36.169> one<00:05:36.410> thousand<00:05:36.830> attack<00:05:36.890> and<00:05:37.370> that

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
with only one thousand attack and that

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.240 
with only one thousand attack and that
would<00:05:37.820> be

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
would be

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.270 
would be
so<00:05:39.250> see<00:05:39.400> we<00:05:39.520> see<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.699> photon<00:05:40.120> Thrasher

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
so see we see a photon Thrasher

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.189 
so see we see a photon Thrasher
everybody<00:05:42.280> so<00:05:43.060> perhaps<00:05:43.479> he's<00:05:43.780> gonna<00:05:43.870> be<00:05:43.990> Allah
