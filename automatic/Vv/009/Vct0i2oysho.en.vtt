00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.870
 or the youtube peÃ±a here is bad in 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.440
 online gta today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:13.270
 get the benefactor dukes is this 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.180
 everything I want, they want 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:19.570
 say all terrain which appears in 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.900
 this location always tuned very 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:26.409
 very bullied gold or color 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:30.880
 silver is worth the truth is that it is the car 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:33.100
 what else costs 20 for now and if and if 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.550
 we also apply the trick of the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.680
 suspension that still follows my childhood 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.830
 we can get a lot more money 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.250
 it's worth a lot very much more money like 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:47.350
 I will always show the car variants 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.270
 time locations and then the 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.460
 topic that interests us to sell them all 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.860
 my guides or almost all end up selling 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.040
 and get good easy money we have 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.370
 that going to this location is worth this 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.520
 closed enclosure usually appears what is 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.010
 this car usually people usually 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:11.510
 wait here here 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.210
 here is also valid and here you can also 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.940
 other points like here for example but 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.730
 it is important that it be at a point 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.230
 of them specifically not normally what 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.580
 said some of you have told me 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.110
 commented that the pedals in this 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.390
 corner in this in this one in this 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.730
 another in this or another one is worth 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.680
 In total, the route would be this 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.010
 let's see right now with the above 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.590
 car but said will say let's say more or 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.500
 less for these parts of the tour is 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.440
 where can we find it worth the car 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.950
 the car the car we will find it in a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.460
 schedule 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:53.009
 more or less accessible from 8 in the morning 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.229
 it is worth remembering from 8 in the morning to 2 in 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.939
 the afternoon although there have been times that 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.649
 some of you have told me 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.960
 that until 4 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.460
 you have caught it true but good I 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:09.720
 I would say that the schedule would be from 8 to 2 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.549
 Afternoon worth 8 to 2 pm and 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.330
 that nothing when it comes to driving this 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.430
 car what is said is as if it were a 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.709
 everything is normal, the only thing is 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.250
 difference is that this one is fine 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.950
 well tuned and that as I have been saying 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.410
 it's worth it to get him out 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.950
 money is worth here are the two models 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:36.030
 the one on the left is the silver that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.560
 like the truth more and the one on the right 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.510
 it's the gold one too very very nice 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.549
 it does not differ in anything worth 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.250
 practically all the complements that 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.200
 they come free because nothing 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.150
 the only thing that changes is the color already 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.650
 we have I will always try in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.050
 all the tutorials sorry is that I was 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.970
 escapes in some teaching the time in the 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.100
 mobile is worth for you to see what it is 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.860
 true there we have it at 10 o'clock 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.570
 early morning pulling almost for 11 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.209
 Well, I have not got the car 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.800
 waiting for him there in particular what was said 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.470
 can wait in any of the 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.060
 corners that I have told you before or if 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.920
 they simply want to be doing the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.560
 travel all the time and get dizzy 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.330
 just do not leave anything for a while if you 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.580
 they put in a corner then simply 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.610
 be attentive do not be looking 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.770
 the mobile now or anything like that 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.750
 and put on the music, try to procure not 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.980
 entertain yourself with other things and if you 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.320
 entertain then talk to the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.900
 comrades and other stories here we see 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.510
 like this one I put it a little hard 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.520
 the lady I say where she goes where she went down 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.790
 with that car you go with that car 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.390
 champion that that car is worth that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.520
 car is worth 23 thousand dollars it seems to me with 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.770
 the trick of suspension reaches 27 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.900
 a thousand so do not run so much that gives me 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.790
 a lot of courage is worth it so nothing 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.790
 when talking about the vehicle 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.409
 if it's worth you'll have different states but 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.689
 always on that same route and now 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.249
 you have to force the respawn that is to say 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:09.379
 You can go with the same vehicle or with 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:11.450
 or other vehicle other than the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:14.019
 yours personal 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.340
 to me the truth at the beginning I started 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.530
 just going with vehicles that do not 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.900
 they were mine that were not my staff and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.120
 after having it like the one that says 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.330
 fish for the first time nothing I caught what 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.789
 secure and just now I'm going with the 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.740
 same car to what is the site here what 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:35.750
 we have benefactor dukes is there what 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:38.570
 we have 23 thousand 250 dollars to sell it 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.240
 So it's ok, but remember the 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.620
 trick how is the good trick the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.199
 trick not forgive first let's see 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.090
 the complements that they have worth here 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:49.190
 we are seeing that everything marked what 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.620
 I'm going to equipped it is something that is not 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.320
 delivered totally free especially 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.720
 so the hood is most noticeable worth 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.480
 the capo in what you notice is the capo is 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:03.560
 what you notice 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.120
 well said 23,005 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.800
 $ 250 now I do not remember what 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.050
 numbers I touched what I just saw but 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.230
 good nothing said what they say stay 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.050
 with the copies this is worth the same 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.540
 do not change the model from gold to 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.610
 silver does not change anything and now we're going to 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.550
 do the suspension trick 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.920
 remember to buy the series 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.490
 rented equip the standard and now 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.650
 we are going to mount the horn which by the 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.630
 glitch that in something that still continues in 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.030
 valid after having done those 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.980
 simple steps will give us totally 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.840
 free and we will sell it next to the car 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:44.910
 there we have it 27 thousand 50 dollars price 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.350
 increased and we have 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.990
 spent 1200 are worth of my 200 we have 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.780
 made the vehicle win a lot 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.250
 very much value now and as always 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.350
 teaching the sleeve cut because the 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.160
 it really deserves a lot, it's worth it 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.050
 trick 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.580
 remember that all my guides again 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.440
 I repeat myself for the second time without 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.750
 the 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.030
 theme is to get free vehicles 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:10.640
 handsome and if they can be selling the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.100
 thanks to your support and others and others 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.380
 history get money we are interested 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.270
 that always get money really that 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.190
 is what is of clear interest because 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.540
 we want to have a handsome car and also 

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:25.490
 we can have a handsome car and full of 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.680
 money our pockets then nothing 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.170
 I hope that the guides have 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.830
 liked remember benefactor dubstep 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:37.130
 comes out in silver version 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:39.980
 also gold is worth the same can be 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:43.250
 increase the value thanks to the trick 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.150
 remember to go from 8 in the morning to 2 in 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:48.440
 the afternoon is a car that really is a 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:50.900
 I like to drive because it's not very 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.090
 powerful but it is also not very slow and 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.890
 not be too slow or very powerful, 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.530
 within what fits your driving is 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.270
 good and easy and it's an all-rounder is 

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.850
 to say we could have left him in all kinds 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.430
 of because I never better way and 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.010

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:20.900
