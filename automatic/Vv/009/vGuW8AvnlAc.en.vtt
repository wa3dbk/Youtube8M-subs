is a transient stove this is really
light<00:02:34.140> weight<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.530> nothing's<00:02:34.890> gonna<00:02:35.040> happen

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
light weight and nothing's gonna happen

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.259 
light weight and nothing's gonna happen
to<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.579> thing<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.820> not<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.090> break

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
to this thing it's not going to break

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.660 
to this thing it's not going to break
right<00:02:36.299> so<00:02:37.019> I<00:02:37.079> have<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.190> bit<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.430> fuel

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
right so I have a little bit of fuel

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.410 
right so I have a little bit of fuel
it's<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.209> methyl<00:02:39.630> hydrate<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:41.430> think<00:02:42.150> that's

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's a methyl hydrate and I think that's

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.599 
it's a methyl hydrate and I think that's
what<00:02:42.660> alcohol<00:02:43.049> but<00:02:43.440> basically<00:02:43.739> you<00:02:43.980> use<00:02:44.370> this

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
what alcohol but basically you use this

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.330 
what alcohol but basically you use this
on<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.209> base<00:02:45.359> of<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.600> if<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.750> want<00:02:45.870> or<00:02:46.320> you<00:02:46.980> use

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
on the base of it if you want or you use

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.120 
on the base of it if you want or you use
sticks<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.420> have<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.630> fire<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.799> I'm<00:02:49.859> gonna<00:02:49.980> get

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
sticks and have a fire so I'm gonna get

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.620 
sticks and have a fire so I'm gonna get
that<00:02:50.220> going<00:02:50.459> right<00:02:50.489> now<00:02:53.299> you'll<00:02:54.299> be<00:02:54.420> amazed

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970 
from homes all right there we go make
sure<00:03:08.970> you're<00:03:09.209> on<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.440> bit<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.470> rock<00:03:10.709> here

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
sure you're on a bit of rock here

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.680 
sure you're on a bit of rock here
because<00:03:11.190> we<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.459> want<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.670> start<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
because we don't want to start the

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:21.130 
because we don't want to start the
forest<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.109> fire

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.590 

now<00:03:22.140> there's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.590> bit<00:03:22.710> of<00:03:22.800> a<00:03:22.890> breeze<00:03:23.600> coming

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
now there's a bit of a breeze coming

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.360 
now there's a bit of a breeze coming
this<00:03:24.840> way<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:25.050> these<00:03:25.590> holes<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:26.040> the<00:03:26.100> front

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
this way so these holes in the front

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.590 
this way so these holes in the front
that's<00:03:26.580> the<00:03:26.790> trick<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.150> get<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.420> breeze

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
that's the trick you get the breeze

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.910 
that's the trick you get the breeze
going<00:03:27.810> through<00:03:27.900> docks<00:03:28.380> Nate<00:03:28.560> look<00:03:28.740> at<00:03:28.860> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
going through docks Nate look at the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.950 
going through docks Nate look at the
flames<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:31.850> it's<00:03:32.850> really<00:03:33.030> windy<00:03:33.240> then<00:03:33.780> you

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:33.960 
flames and it's really windy then you

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:42.500 
flames and it's really windy then you
just<00:03:34.200> move<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.710> the<00:03:34.830> other<00:03:34.860> way<00:03:41.210> are<00:03:42.210> we<00:03:42.330> got<00:03:42.480> a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
just move it the other way are we got a

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.390 
just move it the other way are we got a
we<00:03:42.840> got<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:42.990> good<00:03:43.140> fire<00:03:43.350> going<00:03:43.380> here<00:03:43.680> now<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.280> it

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
we got a good fire going here now so it

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.340 
we got a good fire going here now so it
should<00:03:44.550> only<00:03:44.610> take<00:03:44.880> four<00:03:45.420> minutes<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.170> boil

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
should only take four minutes to boil

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.530 
should only take four minutes to boil
water<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:47.220> doesn't<00:03:47.970> take<00:03:48.060> long<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.360> this

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
water it doesn't take long with this

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.190 
water it doesn't take long with this

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
not lightweight you got to take you

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.810 
not lightweight you got to take you
through<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.200> Bodom<00:04:04.650> or<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.860> percolator

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
the true lightweight coffee unless you

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.070 
the true lightweight coffee unless you
take<00:04:08.670> instant<00:04:09.120> which<00:04:09.240> is<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.810> wrong

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
take instant which is just this wrong

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.760 
take instant which is just this wrong
it's<00:04:10.440> just<00:04:10.470> wrong

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
it's just wrong

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.530 
it's just wrong
you<00:04:11.040> don't<00:04:11.190> take<00:04:11.340> instant<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:12.180> idea<00:04:12.450> of

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
you don't take instant the idea of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.750 
you don't take instant the idea of
actually<00:04:12.840> using<00:04:13.020> real<00:04:13.590> or<00:04:13.890> making<00:04:14.250> real<00:04:14.490> camp

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
actually using real or making real camp

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.289 
actually using real or making real camp
coffee<00:04:15.030> real<00:04:15.780> camp<00:04:15.990> coffee<00:04:16.260> is<00:04:16.590> well<00:04:17.400> grounds

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
coffee real camp coffee is well grounds

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.199 
coffee real camp coffee is well grounds
coffee<00:04:19.109> grounds<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:20.220> boil<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.640> water<00:04:20.700> and

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
coffee grounds you boil this water and

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.940 
coffee grounds you boil this water and
the<00:04:21.420> idea<00:04:21.690> behind<00:04:21.870> this<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:22.560> got<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> boil

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
the idea behind this is we got a boil

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
the idea behind this is we got a boil
going<00:04:23.190> right<00:04:23.340> now<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.580> going<00:04:23.700> to<00:04:23.730> take<00:04:23.850> it

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
going right now it's going to take it

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.580 
going right now it's going to take it
off<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:25.320> got<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.620> water<00:04:25.770> boiling<00:04:25.920> and<00:04:27.590> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
off you got the water boiling and the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.930 
off you got the water boiling and the
idea<00:04:28.860> behind<00:04:28.980> this<00:04:29.220> is<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:29.430> put<00:04:29.640> coffee

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
idea behind this is you put coffee

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.170 
idea behind this is you put coffee
grounds<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:31.050> water<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.790> think<00:04:32.790> two<00:04:32.970> cups

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
grounds in the water I think two cups

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.370 
grounds in the water I think two cups
would<00:04:33.330> be<00:04:33.420> good<00:04:33.570> or<00:04:33.810> two<00:04:33.990> cups<00:04:34.200> two

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
would be good or two cups two

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.620 
would be good or two cups two
tablespoons<00:04:34.860> to<00:04:34.950> be<00:04:35.040> good<00:04:35.220> you<00:04:35.400> never<00:04:36.330> put<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
tablespoons to be good you never put the

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:38.840 
tablespoons to be good you never put the
coffee<00:04:36.900> back<00:04:37.230> on<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.620> heat<00:04:37.770> because<00:04:37.980> tannic

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
coffee back on the heat because tannic

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.850 
coffee back on the heat because tannic
acids<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.390> coffee<00:04:39.960> are<00:04:40.110> released<00:04:40.380> three

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
acids of coffee are released three

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.980 
acids of coffee are released three
degrees<00:04:41.190> above<00:04:41.370> boiling<00:04:42.060> point<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:42.360> if<00:04:42.840> you

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
degrees above boiling point so if you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.210 
degrees above boiling point so if you
actually<00:04:43.140> put<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.440> back<00:04:43.590> on<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.800> heat<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.190> will

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
actually put it back on the heat it will

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.580 
actually put it back on the heat it will
taste<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.520> shoe<00:04:44.850> leather<00:04:44.900> if<00:04:45.900> you<00:04:46.380> actually

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
taste like shoe leather if you actually

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.940 
taste like shoe leather if you actually
let<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:46.980> sit<00:04:47.340> for<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:48.360> bit<00:04:48.510> though<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:49.320> flavors

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
let it sit for a bit though the flavors

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.760 
let it sit for a bit though the flavors
of<00:04:50.070> coffee<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.760> oil<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.450> flavored<00:04:51.990> oils<00:04:52.260> come

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
of coffee the oil the flavored oils come

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.010 
of coffee the oil the flavored oils come
out<00:04:52.919> three<00:04:53.250> degrees<00:04:53.580> below<00:04:53.880> boiling<00:04:54.180> point<00:04:54.630> so

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
out three degrees below boiling point so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.930 
out three degrees below boiling point so
letting<00:04:55.410> it<00:04:55.500> sit<00:04:55.770> actually<00:04:56.220> creates<00:04:56.669> really

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
letting it sit actually creates really

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.860 
letting it sit actually creates really
good<00:04:57.210> camp<00:04:57.780> coffee<00:04:58.050> really<00:04:58.950> taste<00:04:59.190> good

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
good camp coffee really taste good

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.850 
good camp coffee really taste good
disadvantage<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.080> method<00:05:01.140> is<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.680> only

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
disadvantage of this method is the only

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.890 
disadvantage of this method is the only
disadvantage<00:05:02.220> is<00:05:02.640> that<00:05:03.060> you've<00:05:03.180> got<00:05:03.360> grounds

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
disadvantage is that you've got grounds

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.950 
disadvantage is that you've got grounds
in<00:05:04.290> this<00:05:04.470> coffee<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.400> uh<00:05:05.570> there's<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.630> number<00:05:06.840> of

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
in this coffee so uh there's a number of

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.510 
in this coffee so uh there's a number of
ways<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.140> settle<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.710> grounds<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.160> bottom

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
ways to settle the grounds to the bottom
