00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
video in this video I'm going to talk to

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.570 
video in this video I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.200> new<00:00:04.319> sandybridge<00:00:04.770> chips<00:00:05.400> from

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
you about the new sandybridge chips from

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.820 
you about the new sandybridge chips from
Intel<00:00:06.170> basically<00:00:07.170> they're<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.440> new<00:00:07.560> series

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
Intel basically they're the new series

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.339 
Intel basically they're the new series
of<00:00:08.130> i3<00:00:08.610> i5<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.389> i7<00:00:10.219> CPUs<00:00:11.450> so<00:00:12.450> Intel<00:00:12.780> plans<00:00:13.049> to

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
of i3 i5 and i7 CPUs so Intel plans to

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.660 
of i3 i5 and i7 CPUs so Intel plans to
release<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:14.150> dual<00:00:15.150> core<00:00:15.330> quad<00:00:16.170> core<00:00:16.440> six<00:00:17.430> core

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
release a dual core quad core six core

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.779 
release a dual core quad core six core
and<00:00:17.910> eight<00:00:18.119> course<00:00:18.420> if<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.140> series

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:19.789 
and eight course if you in this series

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.070 
and eight course if you in this series
with<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.029> quad<00:00:21.300> core<00:00:21.480> set<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.960> be<00:00:22.050> released

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
with the quad core set to be released

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.920 
with the quad core set to be released
first<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> 9th<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.519> January<00:00:23.910> followed<00:00:24.810> by

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
first on the 9th of January followed by

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.859 
first on the 9th of January followed by
the<00:00:24.990> jewel<00:00:25.230> The<00:00:25.710> Jewel<00:00:25.740> cause<00:00:26.689> there's<00:00:27.689> not

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the jewel The Jewel cause there's not

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.490 
the jewel The Jewel cause there's not
much<00:00:28.439> information<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> six<00:00:29.730> cause<00:00:29.910> or<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
much information on the six cause or the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.060 
much information on the six cause or the
eight<00:00:31.500> cores<00:00:31.920> yet<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.270> I'm<00:00:34.200> sure<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.770> will

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
eight cores yet but I'm sure that will

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.400 
eight cores yet but I'm sure that will
come<00:00:35.100> very<00:00:35.610> soon<00:00:38.960> alright<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.140> there's<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.379> few

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
come very soon alright so there's a few

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.450 
come very soon alright so there's a few
differences<00:00:40.980> over<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.370> last<00:00:41.700> series<00:00:43.219> one<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
differences over the last series one of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340 
differences over the last series one of
the<00:00:44.579> major<00:00:44.730> differences<00:00:45.270> would<00:00:45.450> be<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.870> this

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the major differences would be that this

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.380 
the major differences would be that this
series<00:00:46.920> all<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.610> chips<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> 32

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
series all the chips are on the 32

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
series all the chips are on the 32
nanometer<00:00:48.600> process<00:00:48.989> we're<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> last

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
nanometer process we're on in the last

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.619 
nanometer process we're on in the last
series<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.600> only<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.620> few<00:00:52.829> er<00:00:53.329> which<00:00:54.329> means

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
series are only a few er which means

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.680 
series are only a few er which means
more<00:00:55.230> transistors<00:00:55.710> less<00:00:56.219> heat<00:00:56.520> less<00:00:56.910> power

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
more transistors less heat less power

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.290 
more transistors less heat less power
consumption<00:00:58.199> less<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.550> know<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> whole<00:01:00.059> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
consumption less you know a whole a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.080 
consumption less you know a whole a
whole<00:01:00.390> range<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.160> benefits<00:01:02.160> which<00:01:02.670> means<00:01:02.910> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
whole range of benefits which means you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.170 
whole range of benefits which means you
could<00:01:03.239> achieve<00:01:03.780> higher<00:01:04.049> clock<00:01:04.680> speeds

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
could achieve higher clock speeds

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.219 
could achieve higher clock speeds
because<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.540> temp<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
because the temp you know the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.530 
because the temp you know the
temperature<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.950> too<00:01:08.130> high

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
temperature is not going to be too high

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.609 
temperature is not going to be too high
because<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.840> easier<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> keep<00:01:10.260> cool<00:01:10.470> because

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
because it's easier to keep cool because

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.560 
because it's easier to keep cool because
it's<00:01:10.830> smaller<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.299> there's<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it's smaller you know like there's a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's smaller you know like there's a
whole<00:01:12.720> whole<00:01:13.320> huge<00:01:13.680> range<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.340> benefits<00:01:15.110> now

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
whole whole huge range of benefits now

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.350 
whole whole huge range of benefits now
they're<00:01:16.320> saying<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:17.119> graphics<00:01:18.119> chips

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
they're saying that the graphics chips

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.920 
they're saying that the graphics chips
on<00:01:18.570> these<00:01:19.020> processes<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.570> up<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.750> three

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
on these processes will be up to three

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.499 
on these processes will be up to three
times<00:01:22.110> more<00:01:22.259> powerful<00:01:22.590> than<00:01:22.770> their<00:01:23.009> previous

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
times more powerful than their previous

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.800 
times more powerful than their previous
intel<00:01:24.509> HD<00:01:24.869> graphics<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.939> they're<00:01:27.150> saying<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
intel HD graphics and they're saying you

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.569 
intel HD graphics and they're saying you
can<00:01:27.960> actually<00:01:28.080> play<00:01:28.409> most<00:01:28.710> games<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:29.280> these

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
can actually play most games on these

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.249 
can actually play most games on these
chips<00:01:29.990> although<00:01:30.990> I'm<00:01:31.409> pretty<00:01:33.049> doubtful<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
chips although I'm pretty doubtful of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.030 
chips although I'm pretty doubtful of
that<00:01:35.659> you<00:01:36.659> know<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.409> enjoy<00:01:37.530> you

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that you know like to really enjoy you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.499 
that you know like to really enjoy you
probably<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> highest<00:01:39.000> graphics<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.479> I

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
probably want the highest graphics and I

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.469 
probably want the highest graphics and I
doubt<00:01:39.720> that<00:01:39.960> Intel's<00:01:40.520> actually<00:01:41.520> made<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
doubt that Intel's actually made that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
doubt that Intel's actually made that
much<00:01:42.600> progress<00:01:42.899> although<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> images

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
much progress although there is images

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.200 
much progress although there is images
of<00:01:45.170> games<00:01:46.170> such<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.520> civilization<00:01:47.520> 5<00:01:47.759> being

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
of games such as civilization 5 being

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.469 
of games such as civilization 5 being
played<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.570> these<00:01:48.869> chips<00:01:49.399> alright<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.790> i3

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
played on these chips alright so the i3

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
played on these chips alright so the i3
is<00:01:51.509> set<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.079> release<00:01:52.350> next<00:01:52.979> month<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.399> February

the i5 is apparently supposed to be the
first<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:59.040> release<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.360> quad
