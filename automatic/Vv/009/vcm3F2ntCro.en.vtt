00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.289
 heavy injuries but how exactly 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.210
 did roman alessandrini catch the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.039
 football virus to answer this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439

 cuques to meet a man but 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.349

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.960
 particular is happening in the years

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.329
 educator's name was serge facing the lot 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.210
 and I see him playing I say to myself 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.129
 what a good little and that's fine for 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.179
 me next year at least two of 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.979
 samoa january to a friend of his father who 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.809
 had his son play in my team 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.210
 asked me if I could pana 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.500
 training with me they 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.149
 were weekends he said of course 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.920
 there's no problem and it started there 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.989
 every wednesday afternoon venaissin 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.789
 fear with me and my team of 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.210
 own the morning train with the 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:12.729
 beginners Wednesday morning and afternoon 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.770
 come with me and equip teams 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.340
 chicks were doing the training 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.409
 but he was at the technical level after 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.289
 physical it was really a little piece 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.700
 of cabbage at the time in May he had 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.440
 all the qualities that needed to be 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.119
 from 7 to 10 years old and therefore to the athletic club 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.100
 plan-de-cuques he begins to tread 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.750
 lawns including the stadium 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.299
 Paul and we find his old 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.819
 nostalgic educator who remembers 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.520
 it was on this soil and where he scored 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:47.769
 many goals 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:49.750
 huge and manu it's here that he and he 

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:52.000
 take the first steps that remains 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.009
 so from this period will you not tell me 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.069
 video unfortunately but pictures 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.170
 clippings article too and the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:00.910
 memories of that man so who 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.160
 also evokes for us the continuation of his 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.720
 young career at the om this time and 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.640
 especially the reasons for his departure 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.630
 he arrived 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.440
 a season like that younger epoxy tkd 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.920
 is preparing to om he did not have so much 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.520
 grown up and good it did not go very well 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.680
 on Marc and his educator of the time there 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:29.400
 play defender hierro of her and had 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.470
 not so much his temperament and he has he 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.690
 could go home at night their 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 racing car after the decision to stop a 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.260
 small size an educator who does not 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.510
 not allow to flourish in the field 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.090
 at 15 years after a break in some 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.489
 Roman month who so his city and his 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.440
 entourage direction gueugnon he 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.760
 will then discover league 2 with 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.950
 Clermont is where he 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.570
 begins to make him talk about him 22 goals 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.180
 and 11 assists in two seasons 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.440
 it attracts the eyes necessarily during the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.330
 second match of preparation in 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.290
 auvergne against benfica in this stadium 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.330
 gabriel montpied 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.980
 force is also to note that 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.570
 the fans have not forgotten roman 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.190
 but in 2007 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.870
 it's the tile tearing out of 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 cruciate ligaments that deprives him almost 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.870
 of a whole season 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.920
 he will recover will also leave early 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.049
 year 2013 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.170
 the cruciate ligaments again 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.780
 but the attacker is stubbornly perseverant 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.180
 and workers leaving even at 9 years 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.920
 gilad is respected are very persistent 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.190
 had grades only strength of character 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.170
 even small and I would even say it's 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.430
 thanks to that if he got there it's up to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.610
 say to his very great strength of character 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.549
 and the trials he suffered 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.260
 will leave kenzan to gueugnon to face and by 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.790
 a level of a host family 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.900
 you have to have a very strong force of 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.260
 character and 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.180
 and thanks to that I spend tonight he was able to 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.180
 get out of his wounds two 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.940
 demont recovers to have in life one 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.980
 often says that succeeding at the om is more 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.739
 difficult for a player born in Marseille 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.599
 putting himself under more pressure is there a 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.910
 greater expectation on the part of 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.980
 supporters' entourage one thing is 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.480
 sure in any case Roman Alessandrini is 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.700
 Ready to take the challenge 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.660
 in all humility as emphasized by his 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.720
 former educator 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.060
 what exactly does serge nasi think about 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.540
 he obviously no reason 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.000
 to doubt 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.500
 I think he'll succeed because 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.479
 Again I return well his 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.889
 character to his strength that he has a 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.919
 inside then it's a big 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.389
 worker who never cheats and that 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.940
 I think that fans like it 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.860
 Marseille we get the qualities 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.860
 techniques and everything that can have 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:39.590
 but I think that compared to his 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.590
 character and he amazed me more than one
