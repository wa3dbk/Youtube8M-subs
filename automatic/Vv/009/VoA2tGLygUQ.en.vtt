 it's the music right now because it's the only language you don't create 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.650
 differences between us 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.070
 in our children today they come from various schools in Turin province and

 and you will hear how all together they have made a few hours of common testing 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.129
 our message is that among these children there is a respect one 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.519
 incredible solidarity and we must learn from them adults 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.249
 this feeling of peace 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:32.249
 serenity 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.539

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:37.490

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.089

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:14.259

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.939
 that adult musicians would not be able to reach 

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.150
 a loved one 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.059
 how to say 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.989
