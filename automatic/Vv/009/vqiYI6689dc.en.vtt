00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.620
 we are back with a delicious chicken 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.090
 baked a recipe that I love 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.429
 it always gets me out of trouble and it's also 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.040
 given to do just need a few 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.570
 thighs some breasts termites the 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.380
 Little part of the chicken that we are leaving 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.640
 to put a little olive oil takes 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.210
 Garlic carries some onion potatoes in addition 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.830
 a little white wine broth beef 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.769
 let's put and also a little bit of 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.070
 thyme and salt and pepper obviously 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.380
 we are going to 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.030
 add a little salt and pepper to 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.040
 our chicken pieces the chick the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.180
 neck and kofi annan has said this 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 song the own chicken 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 It's like good tongue twister 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:01:01.339
 put a little salt to our chick 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.339
 it's already arito and we're going to put 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.630
 with this part from bottom to bottom in 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.650
 our pan let's put a 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.500
 bit 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:17.170
 and we will relate it from the other side 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.920
 to brown the chicken 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.460
 and it is very tasty 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.470
 Here is my little salt described on 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.450
 chicken is a source of lean protein 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520
 I love this roll, whatever it is 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 lean protein but I get a ya 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.380
 it tastes hot cold because they put them 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.940
 so many hormones to these chicks not that 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.970
 I feel that we always put ourselves 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.250
 diet and we're going to eat chicken 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.539
 I think chicken is not an option anymore 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.299
 I think that if we are going to put on a diet 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.509
 we can look for another type of base the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.180
 little fish peacock or the chicharrón mike ya 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.880
 that at dinner 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.370
 the chicken already has so much hormones that 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 of best tacos chicharrón 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.940
 also the mike that already has already has 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.330
 many tell us that they already have a lot 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.330
 hormone 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.810
 then macro suits us for the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.640
 diet not only in the mike oven not 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.750
 they perceived the chicharrón gorditas 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.750
 they sell here on the corner 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.609
 some caps and they are white are like that 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.010
 delgada of the habitat but today with the 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:28.980
 salsita throw 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.319
 the salsita is 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.450
 son of killing someone very good 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.189
 and good and we are well my feet 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.250
 chicken and now what I'm going to do is that 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.530
 I'm going to add in the onion 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.550
 so that it lasts a little they separate it 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:49.540
 many and pretty 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.400
 add the onion and once the potato 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.400
 and we're going to let them brown 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.680
 with a little salt and pepper I do not 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.540
 I know if you like the audience 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.060
 marica mityc 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.189
 but if true that tastes good then 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.049
 let's add the garlic once but 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.049
 let me put these fabrics and 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.960
 aita and the eyes and always complain 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:18.740
 but he really eats it 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.740
 Y 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:26.090
 and now let's let all this 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.980
 drop down and let's go up the chicken and 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.950
 let's let down potatoes and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.700
 onion so that they also start 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 to brown I love the potato it makes me 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.650
 an incredible source of carbohydrates 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.540
 they fascinate the content that the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.170
 starch because there are many people who 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.080
 think the potato is fattening I think so 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.780
 it is clear that it gets fat if the obvious skin does not 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.370
 but one for Peter life or a potato like that 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:55.519
 that they were bitten together that here 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.680
 follow the oil I did not put that no no 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.180
 it implies or I do not know that you are going to get fat 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.709
 for nothing on the contrary will help 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.230
 very much to your insulin levels 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.319
 are gradually segregated irregularly 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.450
 He quoted and this happens prevents me from giving you 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.110
 hungry then if that is important 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.420
 certain points have this remedy of I 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.750
 I do not know if suddenly there are days not that we 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:20.510
 It's more hungry like today 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.310
 as today for example it is good to eat 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.240
 a nugget in food or mashed potatoes 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.040
 or something rich to help that 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.730
 our body does not make you so hungry 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.980
 today is not a good obituary here 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.129
 it started to brown everything then I'm going to 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.469
 add white wine 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.839
 let's let it reduce a little bit to 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:47.179
 that remains for this alcohol that is 

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:49.479
 soler llama calls we fight like this even if 

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:49.479
 do not 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.660
 we let it go a little bit the 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:59.560
 alcohol and if they were fixed paint the 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.960
 juice here is here is 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.290
 to see you need the girl you look there 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.900
 taica aythami played is already coffee 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:13.290
 this little head was seen and it's because he picked 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.600
 from below not all the golden ones that 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.400
 there was chicken and onion and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.870
 dawn now what we are going to do is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.640
 that we are going to add the 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:26.640
 I committed and agree team 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:32.370
 you're going to put some thyme 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.440
 and what are we going to do that we're going to 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:38.940
 cover 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.010
 to finish things the chicken what 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.620
 also in houses if they want or can 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.290
 take to the oven and in the oven leave it 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.060
 about 20 minutes until it is finished 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.670
 cook the chicken as they rummage through their 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.530
 little bit and that juice is released the juice 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.470
 also of the chicken when they serve 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.300
 put the chips put the chick and what 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:00.150
 they bathe with the salsita I do not know in what things 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.980
 they will stay but as kings they will 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.720
 fascinate with a mojito says 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.820
 with arrocito was invented with more than lemon 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.950
 but with a routine too but that is 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.540
 that white with white with the 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:20.760
 batch not and a saved cited is a good 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:24.830
 little but with legs I do not know or with 

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:24.830
 facilitate young children
