you<00:00:29.240> can<00:00:29.540> tell<00:00:29.960> what<00:00:30.260> temperature<00:00:31.000> your

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
you can tell what temperature your

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.330 
you can tell what temperature your
kombucha<00:00:32.360> is<00:00:32.599> so<00:00:32.989> you<00:00:33.050> can<00:00:33.289> graduate<00:00:34.010> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
kombucha is so you can graduate the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.000 
kombucha is so you can graduate the
temperature<00:00:34.820> when<00:00:35.090> you<00:00:35.329> know<00:00:35.960> that<00:00:36.140> it's<00:00:36.290> not

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
temperature when you know that it's not

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.690 
temperature when you know that it's not
too<00:00:37.220> hot<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.610> not<00:00:37.670> too<00:00:37.790> cold<00:00:38.920> I<00:00:39.920> do<00:00:40.430> it<00:00:40.670> a

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
too hot and not too cold I do it a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.720 
too hot and not too cold I do it a
little<00:00:40.850> different<00:00:41.329> than<00:00:41.480> everyone<00:00:41.870> else

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
little different than everyone else

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.050 
little different than everyone else
most<00:00:43.730> people<00:00:44.060> will<00:00:44.210> take<00:00:44.480> a<00:00:45.550> serving<00:00:46.550> from<00:00:46.850> it

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
most people will take a serving from it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.530 
most people will take a serving from it
and<00:00:47.680> then<00:00:48.680> once<00:00:48.980> they<00:00:49.700> drink<00:00:49.970> their<00:00:50.149> serving

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:50.540 
and then once they drink their serving

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.780 
and then once they drink their serving
they<00:00:50.690> top<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:50.930> off<00:00:51.260> with<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.800> Z<00:00:52.040> equal<00:00:52.489> amount

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
they top it off with the Z equal amount

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.250 
they top it off with the Z equal amount
I<00:00:53.059> on<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.020> other<00:00:54.050> hand<00:00:54.230> I<00:00:55.000> find<00:00:56.000> that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
I on the other hand I find that

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.389 
I on the other hand I find that
sometimes<00:00:57.260> it<00:00:57.380> should<00:00:57.530> play<00:00:57.739> with<00:00:57.890> changes

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
sometimes it should play with changes

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.069 
sometimes it should play with changes
that<00:00:58.430> saves<00:00:58.790> go<00:00:59.059> on<00:00:59.210> if<00:00:59.540> you<00:00:59.660> don't<00:00:59.809> drink<00:00:59.930> it

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
that saves go on if you don't drink it

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.459 
that saves go on if you don't drink it
fasting<00:01:00.559> so<00:01:01.430> what<00:01:01.610> I<00:01:01.640> do<00:01:01.730> is<00:01:02.030> once<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.450> week<00:01:02.630> I'd

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:03.469 
fasting so what I do is once a week I'd

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.130 
fasting so what I do is once a week I'd
fill<00:01:03.770> up<00:01:03.920> six<00:01:04.879> of<00:01:05.000> these<00:01:05.149> bottles<00:01:05.570> when<00:01:05.750> I<00:01:05.780> find

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
fill up six of these bottles when I find

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.340 
fill up six of these bottles when I find
the<00:01:06.260> flavors<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.890> like<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.840> it'll<00:01:09.080> hold<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
the flavors I like so it'll hold the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.899 
the flavors I like so it'll hold the
flavor<00:01:09.650> consistently<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.400> refrigerator

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.600 
flavor consistently in the refrigerator
will<00:01:11.030> stop<00:01:11.890> fermenting<00:01:13.630> then<00:01:14.630> once<00:01:14.840> I<00:01:15.520> fill<00:01:16.520> up

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610
