00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 my name is marine and I will take care of 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.260
 monday I already have one by one chain 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.090
 personal that I think I'm you 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 will put in the info bar or in link 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.969
 somewhere that way I do not know and 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.190
 so what do you say more I 'm going to have 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.879
 17 years old in october i'm in 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.579
 literary terminus and that's it and you 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.570
 can find Olympian tomorrow and all 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.460
 the days of the week line girls 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
 will be able to present a new video 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.230
 so I started right away with the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.300
 theme of the week is the routines 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.030
 popular and then I'll answer you 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.030
 at the question of weeks so here 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.710
 for me hawtin already I use all the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.869
 days finally once every two days 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 the 200 m regulating shampoo so 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.939
 it's for those with roots 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.890
 fat and dry ends just 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.509
 great because if you're like me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 have dry tips and roots 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.430
 fat you know it's a little bit 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.780
 galley to find a good field takes 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.110
 so this will be especially your case if by 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.880
 example you made commented linda 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.350
 dries the spikes a lot and after 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.270
 you found hair that is not 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.369
 regular so it's bibi because otherwise 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.869
 I do not use after shampoo and I 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.939
 do not often do masks and when 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.740
 I 'm doing it's houses 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.710
 so I did a hair routine 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.299
 on mount on marchienne I think 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.990
 the more you put the link of this video 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.350
 where somewhere 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.450
 and if not I use oils 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.880
 and serums so before montchamp 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.759
 prolong uses oil elixir because 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.990
 was 6 Marseille is enough 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.880
 great but you still need the 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.420
 rub in the teeth the hands before 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.939
 to apply it 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.240
 otherwise it will tend to be a little 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.649
 Too fat or the leu bikila kill him 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 I think he is way too much 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.250
 powerful blow it does not like 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.410
 you put on your hair that makes 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.160
 as a trace 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.890
 that was not enough why I use 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.650
 if not also a small shine gesture 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.450
 Marseille always and what I like 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.000
 a lot it's the smell it gives a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.440
 pretty fresh smell in the hair and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.630
 it still gives me enough shine 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.320
 heart is a little indispensable for 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.990
 me and finally a serum the 200 games 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.670
 always care and shine it's for 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.410
 colored hair and when you 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.630
 actually mix it up a little 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.240
 pink product and it comes out the bubble like 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.530
 I think a little I think that's it 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.990
 yeah it's a little bubble gum 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.460
 so I like and then if you have 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.860
 hair as a fact but just by 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.660
 example not like me point this allows 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.110
 to really just protect an area of 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.720
 pretty precise hair otherwise I use 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.140
 a lot of dry shampoo that like you 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.070
 can see it I can subscribers built 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.420
 this time there is the xxl volume that I like 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.820
 a lot but that makes hair too much 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.100
 ladle finds the brunette 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.920
 but I do not find he has as much 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.270
 of efficiency than that others and my 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.820
 preferred that if while asking bag to 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.380
 hand bluff then he makes hair 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.540
 under nice clean hair 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.040
 in short I love them because I had it 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.360
 I can all the other two and that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.340
 sometimes the second day when you are 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:30.440
 all day in nice and finished 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.320
 to have roots a little style thanks 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.550
 and that makes you crazy but really 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.230
 mia and this is where I go 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.050
 my little dry shampoo and my girlfriends 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:43.610
 take me for a crazy jr but if the 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.390
 cave of ali baba in her purse 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.390
 Yes Yes 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.240
 and my for the hair routine I 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.690
 think that's all so I mean 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.970
 I tell you if you have other 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.460
 questions to see them in my video and 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.280
 for the question the week it was the 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.959
 books so we love the series of 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.430
 freney your good ben me I have no 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.709
 series of books apart from 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.690
 rougon-macquart zola so I think 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.370
 that it does not interest you necessarily 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.340
 super flight tight is a series but 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.040
 it's not it's not like twilight where 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.630
 I have not hurt and what else it 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.980
 point he has el prat he link this I 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.990
 know more what's the title exactly 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.250
 while I like I do not know anymore 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.520
 me my favorite book is anna 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.770
 karenine of tolstoy so you know 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.980
 probably because last year there 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.030
 is an adaptation of the wolf in film that I 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.190
 did not have for that matter and for me 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.430
 it's just a beautiful book and 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:55.210
 magic and we all have great words 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.040
 on earth what and that's it and finally the 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.960
 last book I read once I have 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.210
 finished rather than I still have a full meal 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.880
