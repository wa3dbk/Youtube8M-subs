after that click on this little
right<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.670> you<00:02:15.390> check<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:15.870> that's<00:02:16.050> your

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
right here you check it that's your

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.960 
right here you check it that's your
controller<00:02:16.680> basically<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.370> showing<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
controller basically just showing and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.800 
controller basically just showing and
then<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.570> go<00:02:18.660> load<00:02:18.960> driver<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:21.600> should

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
then just go load driver then it should

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.940 
then just go load driver then it should
pop<00:02:21.990> up<00:02:22.050> down<00:02:22.380> here<00:02:23.330> BAM<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.020> after<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:25.650> click

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
pop up down here BAM so after that click

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.890 
pop up down here BAM so after that click
on<00:02:26.100> profiles<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:29.120> now<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> should<00:02:30.540> see

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.140 
controller game can they're controlled
game<00:02:34.050> controllers<00:02:34.770> we're<00:02:35.580> connected<00:02:36.030> I'm

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
game controllers we're connected I'm

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.000 
game controllers we're connected I'm
sorry<00:02:36.480> I'm<00:02:36.660> all<00:02:36.780> screwed<00:02:37.140> up<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.800> right<00:02:37.860> so

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
sorry I'm all screwed up all right so

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.870 
sorry I'm all screwed up all right so
there<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.730> dual<00:02:39.060> shock<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.570> have<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.110> I

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
there it is dual shock I have the I

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.860 
there it is dual shock I have the I
actually<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.210> the<00:02:42.420> dual<00:02:42.570> shock<00:02:42.840> 3<00:02:44.330> 6<00:02:45.330> access

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
actually have the dual shock 3 6 access

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.740 
actually have the dual shock 3 6 access
and<00:02:46.230> all<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.820> recommend<00:02:48.630> actually

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
and all that so I recommend actually

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.810 
and all that so I recommend actually
getting<00:02:49.080> one<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> newer<00:02:49.680> controllers<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
getting one of the newer controllers and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.310 
getting one of the newer controllers and
all<00:02:50.880> that<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.450> if<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.470> guys<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.490> the

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
all that so if you guys don't have the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.460 
all that so if you guys don't have the
what<00:02:55.320> is<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:56.000> dual<00:02:57.000> shock<00:02:57.360> 3<00:02:57.390> if<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.050> just

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
what is it the dual shock 3 if you just

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.070 
what is it the dual shock 3 if you just
have<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.980> 6<00:02:59.340> access<00:02:59.790> it<00:03:00.480> actually<00:03:00.900> will<00:03:01.050> not

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
have the 6 access it actually will not

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.580 
have the 6 access it actually will not
vibrate<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:03.330> actually<00:03:03.720> recommend<00:03:04.440> getting

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
vibrate so I actually recommend getting

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.110 
vibrate so I actually recommend getting
the<00:03:04.740> newer<00:03:04.920> one<00:03:05.130> so<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.580> picked<00:03:05.790> up<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.000> new

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
the newer one so I just picked up a new

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.070 
the newer one so I just picked up a new
one<00:03:06.240> by<00:03:06.360> the<00:03:06.420> way<00:03:06.540> so<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:08.660> first<00:03:09.660> off<00:03:09.870> you're

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
one by the way so to first off you're

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.800 
one by the way so to first off you're
gonna<00:03:10.170> want<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.530> actually<00:03:11.040> don't<00:03:11.640> use<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.120> ps3

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
gonna want to actually don't use the ps3

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.530 
gonna want to actually don't use the ps3
mode<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.470> here<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.940> actually<00:03:15.060> want<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> go

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
mode on here you actually want to go

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.330 
mode on here you actually want to go
down<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> Xbox<00:03:16.260> 360<00:03:16.800> click<00:03:17.040> on<00:03:17.190> that

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
down to the Xbox 360 click on that

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.430 
down to the Xbox 360 click on that
highlight<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.090> then<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.140> even<00:03:19.290> go

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
highlight that and then you can even go

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.160 
highlight that and then you can even go
into<00:03:19.620> options<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.780> create<00:03:21.780> all<00:03:22.110> your

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
into options and create all your

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.600 
into options and create all your
settings<00:03:22.860> but<00:03:23.280> I<00:03:24.320> recommend<00:03:25.320> using<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.770> Xbox

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
settings but I recommend using the Xbox

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.060 
settings but I recommend using the Xbox
360<00:03:27.300> emulator<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:28.350> the<00:03:28.560> ps3<00:03:29.040> controller

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
360 emulator for the ps3 controller

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.330 
360 emulator for the ps3 controller
because<00:03:29.880> it<00:03:30.030> works<00:03:30.270> a<00:03:30.510> lot<00:03:30.810> better<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.800> it

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
because it works a lot better and it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.790 
because it works a lot better and it
sets<00:03:32.580> it<00:03:32.730> up<00:03:32.790> very<00:03:33.060> nicely<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.870> just<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.560> test

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
sets it up very nicely so just to test

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.150 
sets it up very nicely so just to test

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
click on that and your controller should

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.460 
click on that and your controller should
