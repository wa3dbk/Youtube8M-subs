00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.700
 the attacking city accompanies those who defend the lava volcano 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.650
 arboletes as andigital and tourist patrimony and to the department the volcano 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.869
 state 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:18.410
 this is the municipality of arboletes located in the urabá antioqueño shores 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.220
 of the Caribbean Sea 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.310
 It is here in this humble town where a mythological battle was unleashed. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.199
 in addition incentives tries to gain ground to his heterogeneous manna the 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.279
 land 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.160
 I can deny his firmness and more and more love happens to you are in the area of 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.630
 Uraba in the northern Caribbean 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.050
 there is a mountain range with this type of formation or what is said enough 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.590
 all the chain of mud volcanoes 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.870
 we are great assets all the wear of the sea plaza the beaches of this 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.360
 zone already begins to have its best conquest 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.560
 the deterioration of the well-known mud volcano that is increasingly 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.060
 near the water and that slowly released the sea through this 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.310
 huge crack 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.620
 the problem is not of the volcano the problem has been a problem of 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.380
 electoral 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.470
 for bad habits 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.920
 conditions protested from this region 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.090
 the type of soil 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.330
 p bad practices because sands have traditionally been used 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 land for the construction of population centers 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.950
 more than 20 years in huesca 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.740
 one of the greatest economic and tourist treasures of Antioquia separated from 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 water by 1500 meters of dry land 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.030
 now scarcely 50 meters separate from the water at the end 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.539
 as the property of a private 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.330
 you can not make investments 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.580
 for private have to yield a public good for making investments 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.590
 corresponding 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.610
 tusk 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.350
 in the world there are only 700 stores of this type and in Colombia and Qatar 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 arboletes of unique characteristics the only part the country 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 where can we 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.360
 have a volcano divided a few meters I can put it in a 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 beach is a natural people and in many people come with problems of 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.700
 stress and put the volcano ii 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.430
 the truth comes out 6 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.120
 very happy you feel a totally different feeling than the one applied 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.620
 three others for 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.210
 skin problems are I pulled comical anti is attributed many properties 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.309
 medicinal 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.519
 were also the battle the consequences would be disastrous for the 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.130
 marine ecosystem due to the high concentration of gases per day suffer 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.669
 and for half the court 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:23.289
 if pujols live on tourism the economy the controversy is divided in two 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.199
 in the first mind buoy that has to do with tourism and the second one has 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:28.949
 to do with agriculture but 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:32.629
 for us very important but extremely important part tourism 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.969
 the contribution that the sea could suffer 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:37.609
 for what he believed about him 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:38.560
 of the portal 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.230
 despite being ready designs and plans to save the volcano that this 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.090
 is located on private land represents a major obstacle 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.730
 the authorities try to silence the resources to buy the properties that 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.849
 perform the necessary works first to make the appraisal right on the premises for 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.790
 then it is expected to have a knowledge the trade agreement for 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.679
 enter to negotiate with other parties 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.179
 may be necessary the land will be expropriated as in this battle 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:06.809
 between the sea and the land, the Antioquia authorities bet their 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:08.609
 chips for saving the ground below zero
