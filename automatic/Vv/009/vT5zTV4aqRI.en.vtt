up<00:02:18.370> Miguel<00:02:18.700> Cotto

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
up Miguel Cotto

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.119 
up Miguel Cotto
but<00:02:20.010> those<00:02:21.010> injuries<00:02:21.430> worry<00:02:21.790> me<00:02:22.000> a<00:02:22.030> little<00:02:22.090> bit

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
but those injuries worry me a little bit

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.530 
but those injuries worry me a little bit
but<00:02:24.129> it's<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.430> good<00:02:24.610> thing<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.879> guess<00:02:25.090> for<00:02:25.269> Miguel

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
but it's a good thing I guess for Miguel

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.309 
but it's a good thing I guess for Miguel
Cotto<00:02:25.780> because<00:02:26.459> he<00:02:27.459> might<00:02:27.670> actually<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:29.290> it

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
Cotto because he might actually do it

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.539 
Cotto because he might actually do it
and<00:02:29.680> make<00:02:29.830> history<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:31.980> yeah<00:02:32.980> what<00:02:33.159> else<00:02:33.280> did

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
and make history and yeah what else did
