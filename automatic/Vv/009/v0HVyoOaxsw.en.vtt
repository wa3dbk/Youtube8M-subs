00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
anything like that we just went to the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
anything like that we just went to the
nearest<00:00:44.640> crossroad<00:00:45.360> followed<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> map<00:00:46.170> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
nearest crossroad followed the map that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.650 
nearest crossroad followed the map that
we<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.610> said<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.000> ten<00:00:48.360> miles

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
we could and it said it was ten miles

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.810 
we could and it said it was ten miles
away<00:00:48.899> exactly<00:00:49.500> from<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.280> intersection

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
away exactly from this one intersection

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.680
