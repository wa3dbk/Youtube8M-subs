00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
I think the most exciting thing about

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.830 
I think the most exciting thing about
this<00:00:17.279> oness<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.640> social<00:00:18.029> integration<00:00:18.240> of

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
this oness is social integration of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720 
this oness is social integration of
course<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.500> needed<00:00:19.920> but<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.279> beyond<00:00:20.550> nim

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
course is needed but it's beyond nim

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.040 
course is needed but it's beyond nim
because<00:00:20.970> we<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.240> have<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.600> soundcloud

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
because we also have the soundcloud

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.630 
because we also have the soundcloud
integration<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.680> studio<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.490> also

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
integration in studio one and we also

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.269 
integration in studio one and we also
have<00:00:23.850> presonus<00:00:24.660> exchange<00:00:25.170> in<00:00:25.439> studio<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.039> and

have presonus exchange in studio one and

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.089 
have presonus exchange in studio one and
so<00:00:26.609> community<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.689> sharing<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.380> ideas<00:00:28.529> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
so community and sharing of ideas is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.099

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
the time it's about education because

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.900 
the time it's about education because
the<00:02:13.560> products<00:02:13.860> can<00:02:13.950> be<00:02:13.980> kind<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.340> complicated

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
the products can be kind of complicated

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.880 
the products can be kind of complicated
not<00:02:15.390> because<00:02:15.750> we<00:02:15.900> make<00:02:16.080> them<00:02:16.260> complicated

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
not because we make them complicated

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.559 
not because we make them complicated
because<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.370> do<00:02:17.580> as<00:02:17.880> an<00:02:18.090> audio<00:02:18.390> engineer

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
because what you do as an audio engineer

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.839 
because what you do as an audio engineer
is<00:02:19.349> technical<00:02:19.920> but<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.280> doesn't<00:02:20.430> have<00:02:20.549> to<00:02:20.819> be

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
is technical but it doesn't have to be

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.780 
is technical but it doesn't have to be
hard<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.299> do<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.319> get<00:02:22.950> online<00:02:23.129> every<00:02:23.760> week

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
hard to do so we get online every week

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 
hard to do so we get online every week
and<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.390> live<00:02:24.629> stream<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.500> educate<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.099> little

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.430 
and do a live stream to educate a little
more<00:02:26.549> and<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.540> course<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:28.049> fed<00:02:28.410> through

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
more and that of course is fed through

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.979 
more and that of course is fed through
the<00:02:28.920> social<00:02:29.370> media<00:02:29.489> outreach<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.630> we<00:02:30.690> have
