00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.370
 this is the third and final part of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.859
 organize your own wedding 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.780
 I hope you like it and serve them 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.670
 talked a lot about the bride's bouquet of the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.980
 decor 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 and the knights 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.260
 in this part we have a couple of ideas from 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.140
 scale points 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.369
 before her that is the one 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.369
 smaller so big 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.110
 see the salads 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.550
 yes me but world 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.570
 this is rap 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.430
 of this button jr 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.740
 also good oil 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.740
 types of roses and veronicas 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.370
 this button and he is a white rose 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.990
 i 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.910
 and parakeet and down and we have finished 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.840
 such as 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.840
 in white 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.600
 it's really very simple very nice with 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:10.770
 natural stems compact dome like 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.360
 of grade 5 at the end 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.060
 It is really very simple but very good 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.570
 the dome is that the bottom part under 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.760
 a blank bow 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.670
 and that would be all we leave a part nothing 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.220
 easy 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.460
 put it in water and ready 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.650
 this other button jr is original because the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.550
 girlfriend did not want her to take flowers 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:37.230
 no type at the end leads 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.230
 the lizard florets 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.680
 and the rest of the bouquet of her 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.970
 this is the bouquet this is with the technique 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.470
 of groups this takes carnations in green and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.909
 so that it would not be so boring I would 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.450
 I put pearls 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.359
 make ducks in amaranth whites and 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:00.009
 emergencies also blank 639 better 

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:00.009
 the groups is the audience 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.770
 and he 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.990
 this in the photo that follows in this we see 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:14.890
 the finish that is with sheets of salalah 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.310
 below and if you do not see one of the 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.590
 waves of all the needles it carries and so 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.170
 should always be a perfect bouquet that 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.420
 do not see the mistakes this is another idea 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.670
 also original and very beautiful a 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 bracelet with natural flowers with flowers 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.409
 Gallo row hornito 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.740
 the fact and with decorative wire of 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.720
 aluminum space 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.670
 this other button to go is very simple but 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.180
 at the same time also beautiful a red rose a 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.769
 little bit of green 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.680
 and that was all in the bottom 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:47.719
 it's always time all 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.610
 or with anything else but the same 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:53.220
 perfect that you do not see municipalism 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.560
 Here is a combination who said that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.140
 the combinations are not pretty roses 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.069
 red with white roses and are rows 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.069
 welbeck jazz 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.819
 the compact and the popular 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.019
 this is the decoration of the place 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.019
 there were some accounts 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.970
 to those of white and red roses 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.250
 floating 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.260
 but not 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.850
 it so that there would not be seems like 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.020
 bored and improved the petals 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.900
 pacific 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.640
 outside so they would not see each other 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.190
 with very simple 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.590
 and the strong decoration were the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.209
 bent 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.790
 and I was telling you a video of how to do 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.160
 copy is in two ways well this is 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.810
 completely different chandeliers 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.400
 normal 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.790
 we assemble a floral foam match to the 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.390
 half and there 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.849
 we made the red roses green arrangements 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.260
 green material for two leads and 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.260
 he preached a serum 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.360
 well what the place looks like completely 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.980
 full and you do not need anything else your skin 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.990
 and they are really beautiful or big not 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.970
 they really need a lot 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:16.769
 the tables were already counted 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.989
 and I took advantage of the fact that they have left me 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.110
 petals of roses but it is possible to have 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.310
 taken for the work back but 

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.820
 for my house wherever I wanted 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.500
 but since they were ready and I took advantage 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.660
 and throw them on the tables that they saw 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.330
 really the document chewed it and everything 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.610
 it seems good to you if you liked this video 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.070

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.160
