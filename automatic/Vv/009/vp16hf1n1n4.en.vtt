00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.650
 the vote took place in this republic 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.210
 this year 5 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
 at 10 am 1 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.959
 Elysium 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.810
 to stop them this year 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.679
 about the iphone 4 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.860
 so why I was in the video that I had done 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.490
 to him dream 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.489
 simply because I thought he was going to buy back January 7 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.590
 order them at home the victims 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.220
 I realized that I had five weeks of delay 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.530
 so I do not know 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.780
 but I preferred protector 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.580
 this is for those who want it 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
 they will be dealing with some sort of experience to buy 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.360
 the president coming out of his car bomb and the other from the city that is 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.320
 a little bit 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.840
 so it's a false debate but it's not there 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.539
 so we go a little bit that happens to do a little test then tested 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 she's there 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.310
 so here's the same podium technician program four dom against 48 bp key 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.130
 of the kingdom the microphone they are 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.720
 the intake m 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 jack 3 5 millimeters a small foam 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.840
 his side that there is nothing at all 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 they tend to favor the good deal the specifications 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
 so that the condenser microphone tons 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.570
 2 with a difficult position 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.549
 that is to say that to take lesson it is 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:32.030
 cross him like that 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.610
 a bit like on the 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 the plume hachlaf the blood 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.680
 you will find either your boxes 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 with the pac and what is clear it is well done because 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.650
 open the box if you wish to do 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.650
 so if you saw the microphone 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.220
 by fear 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.230
 So the little microphone when you bite your ports 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.990
 the Congress 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.330
 gaudin here a principle we had the key is already in 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.059
 small foams for sound 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.040
 which means 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.139
 the consul during his voice got the right result 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:19.759
 then he even raises the match to death the four-year time limit 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.889
 if your bet allows you to mitigate the wind outside 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.759
 art 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.569
 in France by cons we suffer 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.109
 even if the use 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.079
 what I could hope for 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.079
 it was a small crowd going to the skull 

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:41.829
 we can as well finished with the places are at stake the microphone and its 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.799
 bce accessories 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.290
 so here is so no way his sister stella 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.189
 his world stereo knows how because within a month 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.029
 three small parties a note a note and on it 

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:57.599
 our sister sister party by then that thoughts of 15 to 30 centimeters 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:59.819
 after 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.159
 drifting mission to make them can be typical no one protests after 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.269
 more psg 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.790
 the typical flash with as in these tops the possibility of greenhouse then if 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.619
 if I think it's a little bit less powerful 

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:16.509
 which means that he exiles launching the shuttle 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:20.009
 and there I find it a little lead not very well finished to show a small 

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:21.619
 little 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.299
 they have to say and whose components are 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.069
 the initiative of the site 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 I am like the little sheep 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:36.169
 focus 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.559
 a button for a teacher 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.559
 we are fighting here tonight 

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:46.249
 so that's a little thing with them foam a little bit warmer 

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.329
 to try to do 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.289
 vincent 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:53.289
 the moment so hard hit by the wind but political 

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:56.349
 right here 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.349
 we can be skeptical bonithon moussoulens 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:06.409
 so it's not very very fast and then when we want to put under the 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:07.899
 eyes of the requests 

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:10.899
 when you return you have to get everything in 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:14.609
 it's a totally different mouth it's true that it's pretty classy that you 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.549
 take out your camera SLR with its terraces 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.650
 and that you have it is above the ground I wonder if you fillon 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.939
 as for municipal professionals 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.039
 then we kept the mouth on a reflex 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.099
 so 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.900
 for this shock g the site 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.680
 8,300 places 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.999
 quick here nycomed contrast frankly while an officer make sure to flash 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:45.039
 ect ect 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:48.479
 cf. 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.479
 so it immediately took place any other place 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.830
 so a feature to the possibility of shifting a little bit the microphone towards 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.629
 front 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:59.270
 facing the small square 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.330
 here 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 p at the back his will impoverish the panel 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.699
 a control because I know that everyone plugs in 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.059
 micro focus father 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.059
 p the new decline is their audience 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:17.029
 for their part against the only small drawback is that to put in 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.309
 road must always run the voucher what I find it a little expensive 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:21.499
 but the thief 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:24.229
 so we'll go right to the microphone test right away 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.770
 by reading a simple little text 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.849
 Spanish 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.099
 worse any looter but at the dawn of the 2000s this technology has 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.650
 upset our image of the net 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.070
 consumption habits he jostled the model and the little ones 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.070
 technical circuits put together success and entertainment 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.169
 the group spent 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:46.930
 a few minutes 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.550
 him 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.550
 he is the highest 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.580
 him 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.180
 ap 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.979
 that's why there's so soon after the handmade facts of the artist 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.300
 she sperm that 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.430
 concerning the question is conclusive for you as it has been for me 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.529
 to know everything was not shown an extraordinary microphone professionals sfr 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.339
 but you have to know that that 

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:20.089
 his mother Sylvie bories casing that's kind of like you're using the 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:21.029
 built-in microphone 

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:24.919
 that's where the little crackles of candles and the gross profit of 60 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:26.660
 his friend 

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:27.710
 completely gone 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.900
 so yes it's already a positive point 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.030
 so this weekend I will test in full size I think I'm going 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.580
 try to put a video online after 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.560
 to show a little what that gives in normal conditions 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.219
 of internet use 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.299
 here I think I went around the question so it's antoine for the 

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:47.469
 trust and test of this whim 84 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:48.639
 assassin
