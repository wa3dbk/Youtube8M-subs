00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
is you start from the very bottom left

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.930 
is you start from the very bottom left
hand<00:00:41.930> corner<00:00:42.140> and<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:42.860> kind<00:00:43.040> of<00:00:43.100> press<00:00:43.339> harder

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
hand corner and you kind of press harder

press kind of hard and then you go wing
it<00:00:46.489> out<00:00:46.670> so<00:00:47.570> that<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:47.839> kind<00:00:48.019> of<00:00:48.140> from

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
it out so that it's kind of from

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.700 
it out so that it's kind of from
thickest<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:49.220> less<00:00:49.670> thick<00:00:50.110> then<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.260> opposite

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
thickest to less thick then the opposite

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.310 
thickest to less thick then the opposite
direction<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.370> same<00:00:52.550> exact<00:00:52.790> thing<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:54.199> you

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
direction the same exact thing and you

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.719 
direction the same exact thing and you

kind of want to play around with the UM
with<00:00:56.269> the<00:00:56.540> quick<00:00:57.199> where<00:00:57.440> it<00:00:57.620> goes<00:00:57.800> if<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:58.250> goes

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
with the quick where it goes if it goes

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.240 
with the quick where it goes if it goes
maybe<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.420> little<00:00:59.510> more<00:00:59.719> up<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.590> this<00:01:00.859> one<00:01:01.070> can

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
maybe a little more up and this one can

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.329 
maybe a little more up and this one can
go<00:01:01.280> kind<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.670> going<00:01:01.910> down<00:01:02.120> a<00:01:02.149> little<00:01:02.359> bit<00:01:02.600> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
to play around with it let's see we put

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.410 
to play around with it let's see we put
this<00:01:12.320> little<00:01:12.500> guy<00:01:12.710> like<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.280> goes<00:01:14.060> like<00:01:14.119> that

little up and then maybe this one you
can<00:01:21.110> put<00:01:21.320> put<00:01:21.500> one<00:01:21.619> right<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:21.950> between<00:01:22.100> here

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
can put put one right in between here

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.790 
can put put one right in between here
like<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.610> small<00:01:22.880> one<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:24.020> one<00:01:24.259> can<00:01:24.470> go<00:01:24.619> right

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
like a small one then one can go right

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.859 
like a small one then one can go right
here<00:01:25.159> going<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.490> down<00:01:26.710> he<00:01:27.710> can<00:01:27.920> go<00:01:28.039> straight

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
here going like down he can go straight

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.870 
here going like down he can go straight
you<00:01:29.869> can<00:01:30.079> call<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:30.320> up<00:01:30.579> and<00:01:31.579> then<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.729> have<00:01:31.850> a

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
you can call it up and then you have a

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.429 
you can call it up and then you have a
design<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.079> sippy<00:01:33.380> go<00:01:33.729> look<00:01:34.729> that<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:36.140> then

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
design so sippy go look that and then

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.490 
design so sippy go look that and then
maybe<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.770> want<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.990> really<00:01:39.290> all<00:01:39.470> about

maybe you want to it's really all about
just<00:01:39.890> creating<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.250> whole<00:01:40.460> bunch<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.729> stripes

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
just creating a whole bunch of stripes

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.389

all over your nails but you need a play
around<00:01:43.640> with<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:44.000> thickness<00:01:44.740> because<00:01:45.740> if

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
around with the thickness because if

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.990 
around with the thickness because if
they're<00:01:46.009> all<00:01:46.189> like<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.549> same<00:01:46.579> amount<00:01:46.969> of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
they're all like the same amount of

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.130 
they're all like the same amount of
thickness<00:01:47.420> it's<00:01:47.630> not<00:01:47.750> going<00:01:47.869> to<00:01:47.960> look<00:01:48.079> good

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
thickness it's not going to look good

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.950 
thickness it's not going to look good
after<00:01:48.890> all<00:01:49.070> I<00:01:49.100> kind<00:01:49.520> of<00:01:49.549> like<00:01:49.670> lined<00:01:49.969> up<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.899> a

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
after all I kind of like lined up in a

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.120 
after all I kind of like lined up in a
straight<00:01:51.200> line<00:01:51.229> it's<00:01:51.649> all<00:01:51.740> it's<00:01:51.829> not<00:01:51.920> going<00:01:52.040> to

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
straight line it's all it's not going to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.380 
straight line it's all it's not going to
look<00:01:52.189> good<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:52.549> want<00:01:52.729> to<00:01:52.909> play<00:01:53.030> around<00:01:53.119> with

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
look good you want to play around with

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.209 
look good you want to play around with
the<00:01:53.539> positioning<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.439> thickness<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:54.979> start

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
the positioning and thickness you start

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.679 
the positioning and thickness you start
really<00:01:55.399> thick<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.909> then<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.479> get<00:01:56.600> really

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
really thick and then you get really

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.120 
really thick and then you get really
thin<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.110> it's<00:01:57.200> kind<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.380> like<00:01:57.469> winged<00:01:57.740> out<00:01:57.890> it

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
thin so it's kind of like winged out it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.359 
thin so it's kind of like winged out it
looks<00:01:58.280> really<00:01:58.520> cool<00:01:58.820> when<00:01:59.149> you<00:01:59.240> do<00:01:59.360> that<00:02:00.369> then

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
looks really cool when you do that then

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.770 
looks really cool when you do that then
maybe<00:02:01.759> like<00:02:01.969> one<00:02:04.360> like<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:07.209> my<00:02:08.209> pointer

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
maybe like one like that I my pointer

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.630 
maybe like one like that I my pointer
finger

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 

and<00:02:16.730> on<00:02:17.360> one<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.720> cool<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.200> really<00:02:18.230> pretty

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530
