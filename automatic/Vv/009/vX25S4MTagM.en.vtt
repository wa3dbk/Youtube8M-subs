00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.280
 hello hello let's start with our 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.530
 spiral woven 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.530
 let's prepare 7 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.690
 little tubes of paper and we are going to put the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.690
 league at the end 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.370
 tightly packed 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.899
 the previous fabric that we learned is 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.710
 weaved from bottom to top this we will 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.710
 to knit 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:55.310
 from top to bottom 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.310
 let's start with this 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.500
 let's start with this we accommodate 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.500
 as a stool 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.120
 we're going to pass it in front of the one 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 follow 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:21.040
 for this we are going to go through 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:26.250
 of the one who follows and behind the others 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.250
 so that they form on this side 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 and this is the one that follows, what will happen 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.119
 in front of the next 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.750
 and behind the others 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.479
 they are seven little tubes I think I did not tell them 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.479
 it is staying like this 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.659
 according to the same this is the one that follows 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.759
 we passed it in front of the next one and 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.759
 behind the others 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.750
 and this is the one that follows we went through 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.080
 in front of the next and back or by 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.560
 below the others if they are set here 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.210
 they are forming on this side 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.240
 and here they are surely ending 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:31.400
 we had the one that follows in this 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:34.310
 follow in front of the next one and for 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.970
 behind the only one that is already swimming 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.970
 we have one 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.480
 with two we can not keep doing the 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.290
 what we're going to do is we're going 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.260
 to take 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.829
 and this one from above and we're going to pass it 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.829
 for here 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.600
 when we pass it here we have three of 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.950
 this side and we can already weave 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.190
 the one that follows that is this 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.970
 above the next and below the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.970
 what we add 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.849
 we already have two again we can no longer 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.849
 keep subject then 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.680
 we passed the one on the top but here 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.530
 and now we can already before the next 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.590
 we pass it above the one that follows and 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.510
 below which someone and we give 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 this is what we are going to be doing 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.640
 we're just going to see that it's going to go 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:44.900
 coughing tissue we pass the one above 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.900
 for this side 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.400
 and the one that follows from the left 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.760
 we pass it above the one that follows and 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:04.110
 below which we add are given 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.110
 account they look 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.360
 we passed this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.360
 mouth 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.180
 and the one that follows we pass it over the 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.090
 next and below which we arrived 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.440
 we will always be leaving one loose 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.440
 without knitting 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.610
 we passed another one because we need three 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.120
 to make the fabric 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.510
 we had it 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:44.050
 above 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.860
 of the next one and below that 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.860
 we add 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.830
 and so we continue to the length that 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:59.060
 we say 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.190
 This is a very nice fabric too 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.360
 that is going to decorate our arrangements a lot 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.980
 floral 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.670
 we passed this 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.670
 for here 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.620
 the following 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.930
 below the next one above 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.280
 forgiveness of the next and then down 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.280
 from which we add 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.199
 we have two we can not weave we have to 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.770
 add the first one above that we have to 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.770
 the right 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:38.190
 and what follows is this this simple 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.819
 we passed it over the next one and 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.390
 below which to light greg are fixed 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.950
 that is going 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:50.090
 doing something else 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.090
 for the termination 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:56.389
 let's put glue on it 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.389
 we add 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.380
 and we are going to fasten it with a brooch 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.380
 until it dries 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.510
 let's cut 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.919
 the leftovers in this way 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.889
 If it's going to stay like this 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.280
 another thing we can do with this 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.280
 tissue 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.110
 It's a rose 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.500
 look 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.550
 how nice is it 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.000
 we can do some things like that 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:07:00.710
 but we put glue and we have left 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.710
 a very nice thing 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:15.110
 now the next tutorial we are going to 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:18.249
 perform this flower at general request 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:22.179
 let's start 

00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:24.599
 with the tissue of the pistils I do not know 

00:07:22.179 --> 00:07:24.599
 lose
