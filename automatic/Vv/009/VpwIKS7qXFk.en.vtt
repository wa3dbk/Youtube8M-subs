00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
check it out this is the de clases yes

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.190 
check it out this is the de clases yes
it's<00:01:52.350> called<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.710> LED<00:01:53.430> matrix<00:01:53.840> shades<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it's called the LED matrix shades I

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.219 
it's called the LED matrix shades I
think<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:56.009> call<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.399> like<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.909> matrix

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
think you just call it like the matrix

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.060 
think you just call it like the matrix
classes<00:01:58.229> or<00:01:58.500> something

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
classes or something

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.450 
classes or something
but<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:01.020> cooler<00:02:01.460> than

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
but I think this is much cooler than

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.850 
but I think this is much cooler than
like<00:02:02.729> Google<00:02:03.060> glasses<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.840> wear<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> party

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
because it's actually you know has some

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.290 
because it's actually you know has some
cool<00:02:07.290> features<00:02:07.640> whereas<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.729> Google<00:02:09.030> glass

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
cool features whereas the Google glass

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
matrix shades LED matrix chase look like

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.569 
matrix shades LED matrix chase look like
you<00:02:24.189> have<00:02:24.400> an<00:02:24.549> exposed<00:02:26.159> PCB<00:02:27.159> there<00:02:27.370> with<00:02:27.549> a

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
you have an exposed PCB there with a

you have an exposed PCB there with a
bunch<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.000> chips<00:02:28.360> obviously<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:29.200> not

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
bunch of chips obviously so I'm not
