00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.450
 vacation 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.280
 I could change direction that much 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.920
 just two steps away in my texts 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.930
 but I tell myself that for those who 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.090
 argue it's worth saying that s 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.150
 price played just a star of the price 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.440
 late at night so that a glimmer of hope 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.970
 I am at the same time do 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.520

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390
 glimmer of hope I am a loser and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.190
 that's what I take away will not believe your 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.930
 promises to heal us but thrones with 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.910

 I wanted so much to make money 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.090
 but I have not seen the time pass 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.370

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.980
 heaped up sometimes confuse I saturate myself 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.239
 get up every morning to rub shoulders with 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.850
 cartons they take us for 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.260
 quotas 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.330
 and we hide booty ben yeah that 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.980
 However, I am not shocked to titrate 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.820
 two days at markets like blackrock that 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.890
 becomes worrying 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.930
 I do not take myself for what I 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.820
 did not come from nowhere they 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.320
 do not know what I would not do it is 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.270
 too late to backtrack 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.430
 that I'm treated to batna will not suffice 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.110
 like barry for all those who 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.490
 are dear to my heart I will make sound to 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.820
 large scale I have to be at the 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240
 height 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.980
