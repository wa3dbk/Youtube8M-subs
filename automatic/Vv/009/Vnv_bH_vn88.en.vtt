00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
maneuverability and camber now the deck

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.180 
maneuverability and camber now the deck
actually<00:00:42.450> has<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> fairly<00:00:43.020> stiff<00:00:43.290> flex<00:00:43.800> rating

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
actually has a fairly stiff flex rating

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180 
actually has a fairly stiff flex rating
of<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.180> seven<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> feels<00:00:46.289> like<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.920> and

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
of a seven and it feels like that and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.250 
of a seven and it feels like that and
then<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.730> also<00:00:48.120> has<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> maneuverability

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
then it also has a maneuverability

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
then it also has a maneuverability
rating<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.800> seven<00:00:50.070> point<00:00:50.280> five<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> then<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
rating of a seven point five and then a

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.330 
rating of a seven point five and then a
traditional<00:00:51.960> camber<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.710> six<00:00:53.010> millimeter

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
traditional camber of a six millimeter

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.850 
traditional camber of a six millimeter
rise<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.570> quite<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.809> bit<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.410> I'll

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
rise so it's quite a bit in that I'll

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.680 
rise so it's quite a bit in that I'll
see<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.550> traditional<00:00:57.000> camber<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
see that the traditional camber in the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.439 
see that the traditional camber in the
MLF<00:00:58.199> feels<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> camber<00:00:59.730> board<00:01:00.000> should

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
MLF feels like a camber board should

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.840 
MLF feels like a camber board should
ride<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:01.680> responsive<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.670> has

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
ride it's it's really responsive it has

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.840 
ride it's it's really responsive it has
absolutely<00:01:03.180> tons<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.199> pop<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> it's<00:01:05.519> just<00:01:05.760> a

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
absolutely tons of pop and it's just a

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.090 
absolutely tons of pop and it's just a
it's<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.840> blast<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.320> ride<00:01:07.439> whether<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
it's it's a blast to ride whether it be

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.640 
it's it's a blast to ride whether it be
just<00:01:08.369> cruising<00:01:08.790> around<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.720> blasting

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
this thing off of jumps inside it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.719 
this thing off of jumps inside it's
gonna<00:01:13.229> be<00:01:13.439> an<00:01:13.560> impact<00:01:13.979> core<00:01:14.340> that's<00:01:14.549> a

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
gonna be an impact core that's a

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.090 
gonna be an impact core that's a
combination<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.509> both<00:01:15.689> poplar<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.350> ash<00:01:16.770> which

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
combination of both poplar and ash which

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
combination of both poplar and ash which
are<00:01:17.250> both<00:01:17.850> lightweight<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.630> responsive

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
are both lightweight but responsive

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.030 
are both lightweight but responsive
woods<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.799> there's<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.220> carbon<00:01:20.580> quadratic

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
woods and there's a carbon quadratic

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.399 
woods and there's a carbon quadratic
fiberglass<00:01:23.040> carbon<00:01:23.790> combination<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
fiberglass carbon combination it's

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.620 
fiberglass carbon combination it's
powerful<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.220> drives<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.759> board<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
powerful and it drives this board to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.020 
powerful and it drives this board to
places<00:01:28.320> where<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.829> can't<00:01:29.070> even<00:01:29.250> imagine

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
places where you can't even imagine

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.749 
places where you can't even imagine
oh<00:01:30.229> yeah<00:01:31.229> literally<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:31.979> can't<00:01:32.250> get<00:01:32.369> over<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
oh yeah literally I can't get over this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
oh yeah literally I can't get over this
is<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> super<00:01:33.750> fun<00:01:33.780> deck<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.650> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
is a super fun deck you know I have a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.830 
is a super fun deck you know I have a
quite<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> few<00:01:35.610> freestyle<00:01:36.329> boards<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.780> are

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
quite a few freestyle boards that are

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.039 
quite a few freestyle boards that are
you<00:01:37.290> know<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.409> my<00:01:37.650> top<00:01:38.040> favorites<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.509> MLF

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
you know in my top favorites and the MLF

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.630 
you know in my top favorites and the MLF
over<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.409> last<00:01:40.560> couple<00:01:40.770> years<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.340> kind

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
over the last couple years is like kind

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.910 
over the last couple years is like kind
of<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.790> gradually<00:01:42.750> gotten<00:01:43.350> closer<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
of like gradually gotten closer and

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.200 
of like gradually gotten closer and
closer<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.790> top

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
closer to the top

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.109 
closer to the top
I<00:01:45.240> think<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.720> all<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.350> DC<00:01:46.979> freestyle<00:01:47.759> boards

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
I think of all the DC freestyle boards

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.200 
I think of all the DC freestyle boards
or<00:01:48.439> that<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.770> DC<00:01:49.920> line<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
or that are in the DC line this is this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.340 
or that are in the DC line this is this
is<00:01:51.390> my<00:01:51.570> favorite<00:01:51.840> one

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
is my favorite one

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.149 
is my favorite one
