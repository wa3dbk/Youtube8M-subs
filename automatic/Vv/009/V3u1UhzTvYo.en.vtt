00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.849
 hello my name is david and you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 are on the techno control my portal 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.139
 hand huawei s7 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.210
 smartphone is primarily unusual in 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.660
 first days but the most important thing is 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 by its design and thickness is thickness 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.449
 only six and a half smartphones 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.460
 millimeters it's really not very 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.470
 a lot and the smartphone is perceived as 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 Strongly so subtle thin 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.410
 the device is worth noting that with both 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 parties 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.930
 smartphone material glass and sides 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.170
 he has aluminum metal experience 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 looks pretty nice on the side 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.420
 Tray for one micro sim card for 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 micro sd memory card power button 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.770
 shutdown and volume rocker on top 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.719
 headphone jack in principle design 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.730
 something may be someone sony remind 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.399
 someone does not remember their design turned out 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.379
 quite interesting and practical that 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.690
 concerns technical specifications 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.699
 detailed you can of course look 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 on the portal of those on control link under 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.650
 this video is some kind of processor and so 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.540
 I will note only by battery 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.340
 battery playback visibility 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.530
 Breaks 5:45 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.479
 it's not bad enough but not bad then 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.290
 the average result is slightly above average for 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.920
 five inch 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 display ips resolution full hd 1920 on 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.220
 1080 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.170
 that's how it felt to me that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.420
 the battery sits fast enough 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.799
 even with power saving enabled I would 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.799
 said that in full use 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.780
 Well, one and a half days it can be two 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.250
 the best case most likely 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.490
 need to charge every day when 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.750
 such an average continuous use 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.540
 on the quality of the display in my china 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.979
 no no display quite well no 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.350
 to say that he is just like a blister girl 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.250
 Whether she paints sho but quite neat 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.950
 good on the shell itself the shell stands 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.399
 in the style of ios there is no menu button but 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.090
 This is the android version android 4 4 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.759
 of course if you wish you can 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.799
 put any third-party launcher any 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 can do anything you want 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.390
 for example, this shell does not like 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.420
 test results if you take antutu 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.629
 antutu test gives 26 thousand points if 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.370
 FPS per second let's say 125 index 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.129
 average enough here 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.950
 they when the review is filmed is october 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:20.430
 2014 , the average cost is about 16 thousand 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.530
 rubles on camera camera here 2 13 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.349
 megapixels are tall plus of course 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.629
 flash and frontal attention as much as 8 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.370
 megapixels while I can not say 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.140
 that the quality of the photos is some kind of super 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.060
 space at least with 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.640
 front camera but from the rear 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.200
 by the way more or less normal and in the album 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.510
 these photos print is not ashamed 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.700
 put the main feature that is again 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.290
 this design is really a smartphone 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.620
 beautiful thin 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.540
 sophisticated in terms of technical let's say 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.150
 so slightly above average 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.859
 features which principle is another one in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.780
 principle feature is interesting these are two 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.790
 Antenna built in Moscow of course 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.019
 check for reception network I mean 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.209
 here and here 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.920
 Moscow I can not check in my opinion 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.810
 they all somehow smartphones that I test 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.640
 more or less equally well accept 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.650
 maybe this will be true where 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.569
 cell towers and far from each other 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.970
 friend and maybe this phone will 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.209
 The best but I personally did not check the information 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.540
 taken from the site huawei russia in principle 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.400
 probably we are all personal rating of course 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.139
 which I give away with a smartphone can also 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.980
 portal of these to look plus 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.230
 national rating 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.120
 of course urge come to our 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.739
 portal of those on control register 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.750
 there you can click the register button 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.940
 Vkontakte you are authorized user and 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.359
 put a rating write your questions 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.620
 write questions to us and my colleagues 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.900
 for those in control 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.579
 write questions to manufacturers we 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.319
 We talk with manufacturers 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.299
 and some firms have already agreed 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.489
 answer questions on our portal 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.470
 that is, we do it all now when 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.109
 review removed October 14, the desk 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.849
 constantly evolving so here if 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:56.129
 a brief summary of this review 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.680
 smartphone interesting first and foremost yet 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.810
 since the yard is interesting in appearance and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.340
 quite good enough by itself 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.220
 could i use the only thing not 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.709
 like this battery sound quality 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.540
 not bad if you take in the headphones completely 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:12.090
 as always wish you be healthy be 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.980
 successful will be positive home releases 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.980
 addition to all david happy
