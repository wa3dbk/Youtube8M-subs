00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.970
 Hi everybody 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.619
 so today I would like to approach 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.720
 with you the topic of the inflator 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.090
 it's a pejorative term we hear 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.630
 nonstop that would designate muscle 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.830
 not functional it muscle without force 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.270
 muscles get just by one 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.520
 multitude of series and repetitions 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.750
 without progression, unlike 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.270
 muscles obtained by the power lifters 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.460
 to the weightlifters so the first 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.540
 confusion over the subject 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.930
 we are told in the formations 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.980
 who train future coaches 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.809
 which are taught by young sympathy 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.730
 that there are two hypertrophies 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.039
 the hypertrophy sarko klasnic and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.570
 the hypertrophy of sarko sea ​​so the one 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.940
 trade his name are outsourced 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.620
 contractile muscle and liverpool zarko 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.410
 plasmic would be all there around 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.949
 muscle cell filled with water 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.840
 etc. 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.220
 then as we have seen in different 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.190
 podcast with our different specialists 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.240
 in physical preparation 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.070
 the Sarko belgic hypertrophy has never 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.350
 been proven is what stands out 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.370
 most of the time it is 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.140
 the hypertrophy sarko mii place that is 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.070
 proportional to the hypertrophy of 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.799
 sarcomas well is that everything is 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.689
 develops proportionately on 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.549
 can not only take a freedom 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.320
 plasma sarko or only seas 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.909
 does the sarcomas wander then in the 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.619
 degrees for those who his coach you 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.909
 will feel way to talk to you on 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.079
 tells you to do 10 x 10 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.149
 for the hyper her son roam when the 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:36.829
 smic and then 6 x 6 for the four 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.790
 girls and sea sarko but how much to see 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.920
 it's not really I do not know 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.140
 all justified before a big 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.979
 fumigation we can not develop 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.659
 one without the other 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.850
 So it's the same it had to make a 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.350
 little point on it some do 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.719
 make mass volume cycles 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.009
 as if the mass and hypertrophy of 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:53.240
 sea sarko and volume hypertrophy 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.540
 serves as for smic 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.100
 as if we could influence one or 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.880
 the other and so do make 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.469
 diet changes depending on the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.740
 bogus cycle they just put in 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.079
 square 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.080
 so that forget hold on there 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.450
 that we can not develop one without 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.700
 the other that hypertrophy is performed 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.430
 proportionally between all 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.510
 the elements of the muscle cell 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.130
 the second point that can lend to 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.080
 confusion is that often we have 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.150
 tend to compare themselves to others and 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.849
 so we see people in the room who are 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.470
 very muscular and 4 and remus that very 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.569
 muscular and raises less weight than 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.859
 others next door that helps me a lot 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.959
 heavier and who do not have a physical 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.219
 in proportion so I have already done 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.260
 several articles on the subject at 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.189
 the written on rudy caya point com as well 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.290
 only on super physics 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.590
 it's the worst mistake to make 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.969
 compare to others according to 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.889
 each one if we take the bench press 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.840
 the length of the arms of the size 

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:48.790
 rib cage of your mobility the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.519
 length of pectorals the length of sorting 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.560
 this length of your shoulders etc from 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.319
 your flexibility 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.819
 you are not going to be identical to your 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.010
 or your stars and so inevitably there will be 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.829
 differences of demonstration of 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.849
 cost strength at intel can be 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.560
 shorter and really has a peace than 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.359
 because he does not have the morphology for 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.349
 the pectorals whereas conversely if 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.549
 we never film in full taste and 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.609
 pectorals I can put less heavy than 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.019
 my neighbor and have more pecs 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:15.879
 so that's pretty simple to see them 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.620
 in this there are plenty of examples like that 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.269
 so this is not the strongest who the 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.280
 more muscular what you need to remember 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.349
 you do not have to compare yourself 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.540
 that you yourself progress 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.469
 finally the third point which incites the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.780
 people talking about inflate 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.980
 is that most of the time in 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.109
 magazines we are shown the 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.000
 athletes who are doped who train 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.729
 somehow namely that 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.769
 we come this is at the beginning a lot of 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.569
 series a lot of repetitions a lot 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.220
 exercise without ever trying to 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.150
 progress 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.099
 I like to say just to make 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.769
 circulate the blood as exaggerating a little 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.849
 but who against all 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.090
 what to do to progress 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.489
 when we are natural and we 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.299
 wish to take muscle the only 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.489
 way to get there 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.259
 as I explained including no money 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.359
 book number 2 but these famous points of 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.609
 mu volume 2 in the forced chapter llamas 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.919
 is that of course if you do not 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:08.079
 do not know about your exercises you 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:09.340
 do not take muscles it's not 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.469
 magic is logic everything 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.430
 simply 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.109
 so when we take products we 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.389
 is doped and it's inevitably we do not have 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.759
 need to progress to take 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.699
 muscle that's the products go 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:23.259
 intensify the benefits the results 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:25.120
 of training then make it natural 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.000
 and although there is no choice but 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.340
 to progress and to deserve his muscles 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.690
 really the only solution then 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.669
 obviously these food tips 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.070
 applies to most of us I 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.289
 re not on it in a next video 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.550
 but remember that if you progress 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.810
 not at your level 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.310
 you're not going to take any muscles to 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.660
 earth then on the short term maybe 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.370
 in finland techniques etc 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.190
 but in the long run everything is connected to 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.600
 progression so here is the 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.430
 inflator now you know that 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.360
 does not exist it is a vast fumistery 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.130
 that we try to boiled years base we are 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.720
 sure dudes who are doped who do 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.950
 part of the training that we of them 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.340
 on scientific evidence that 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.350
 does not exist but really not at all 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.300
 and third point do not compare yourself 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.040
 your neighbor because inevitably he does not 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.790
 will not be like you it will be completely 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:14.290
 different and therefore will not explode noted 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.540
 will not be force the same way to 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.970
 you on the exercises so again a 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.590
 times does everything compared also you 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.470
 progress in the right range of 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.820
 repetition you will take muscle and to 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.350
 the inverted do not progress and you 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.450
 train like the guys who take 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:31.030
 products and ben you will not take 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.740
 of muscles at term so here is now 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.720
 you know the inflator does not exist 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.460
 so I'm counting on you to do 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.660
 turn this video on we're fed up 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.430
 that I am especially tired of hearing 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.100
 this term of the inflator 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.600
 so thank you for your sharing and 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.600
 see you soon for a new video
