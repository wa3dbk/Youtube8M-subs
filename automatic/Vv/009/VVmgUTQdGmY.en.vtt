dramatically you have the widgets

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.470 
dramatically you have the widgets
connected<00:05:14.980> in<00:05:15.190> parallel<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:16.000> whatever<00:05:16.450> toast

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.480 
connected in parallel to whatever toast

functionality in the widgets and finally

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.550 
functionality in the widgets and finally
the<00:05:24.670> GMs<00:05:25.090> apps<00:05:25.390> have<00:05:25.780> been<00:05:26.080> completely

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:26.560 
the GMs apps have been completely

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.870 
the GMs apps have been completely
redesigned<00:05:26.980> and<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:29.170> there<00:05:30.100> is<00:05:30.190> one<00:05:30.400> in

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
redesigned and I there is one in

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.820 
redesigned and I there is one in
particular<00:05:31.090> that<00:05:31.450> I<00:05:31.600> would<00:05:31.870> like<00:05:31.990> to<00:05:32.050> show<00:05:32.770> you

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
particular that I would like to show you

00:05:32.830 --> 00:06:15.670 
particular that I would like to show you
here<00:05:33.220> real<00:05:33.460> quickly<00:05:33.700> it's<00:05:34.420> the<00:05:34.600> Maps<00:05:34.870> app

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.610 

so<00:06:16.680> as<00:06:17.130> you<00:06:17.640> saw<00:06:17.880> there<00:06:17.910> but<00:06:18.480> the<00:06:19.080> hardware

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
so as you saw there but the hardware

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.490 
so as you saw there but the hardware
working<00:06:20.280> of<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.660> vector<00:06:21.660> maps<00:06:21.960> have<00:06:22.350> been

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
working of the vector maps have been

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.280 
working of the vector maps have been
done<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:22.890> a<00:06:23.070> completely<00:06:23.610> new<00:06:23.910> way<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:24.420> think<00:06:25.140> the

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
done in a completely new way I think the

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.230 
done in a completely new way I think the
YouTube<00:06:25.980> application<00:06:26.160> has<00:06:26.700> been<00:06:26.730> completely

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
YouTube application has been completely

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.830 
YouTube application has been completely
redesigned<00:06:28.370> the<00:06:29.370> hook<00:06:29.940> application<00:06:30.660> is

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
redesigned the hook application is

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.620 
redesigned the hook application is
delivered<00:06:31.620> for<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.830> first<00:06:32.130> time<00:06:32.400> so<00:06:33.270> all<00:06:33.600> of

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:33.630 
delivered for the first time so all of

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.200 
delivered for the first time so all of
these<00:06:34.080> things<00:06:34.410> I<00:06:34.650> think<00:06:35.100> deliver<00:06:35.430> experience

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
these things I think deliver experience

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.260 
these things I think deliver experience
which<00:06:36.960> make<00:06:37.610> Android<00:06:38.610> 30<00:06:39.150> not<00:06:39.480> applet

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
which make Android 30 not applet

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.120 
which make Android 30 not applet
probably<00:06:42.270> in<00:06:42.360> my<00:06:42.510> opinion<00:06:42.810> most<00:06:43.290> competitive

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.130 
probably in my opinion most competitive

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:45.890 
probably in my opinion most competitive
