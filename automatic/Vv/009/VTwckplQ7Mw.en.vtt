00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 the situation starts to get out of 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.800
 control when a power failure happens like this 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.479

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.450

 hell that is created in the world of 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.760
 Outlast is a pretty difficult one to 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.649
 survive since it has about 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.050
 monsters created from fears 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.700
 most basic of the human mind achieving 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.410
 a true horror experience 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.430
 hide you since you have no way of 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.620

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:34.620
 the same team that developed blog 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.739
 condemned software is a game of 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.849
 survival in a cement jungle 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.430
 becoming one of the most games 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.290
 brutal and unforgivable that I've seen in 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.269
 This game takes the role of Thomas Etan 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.129
 an agent that must solve the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.170
 mystery behind a series of crimes 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.909
 unusual as you pursue it is a 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.769
 serial killer and by means of a 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.599
 city that is lost more and more in the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.400
 madness this title manages to create a 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.200
 true dark atmosphere full of 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.940
 terror and chilling moments to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.859
 as you get into locations 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.510
 like the tunnels of the subway houses 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.889
 abandoned and other types of places 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.780
 urban decadence 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.639
 game developers have commented 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.319
 that films like the silence of 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.299
 innocent and they look like they served as 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.099
 inspiration to build the world in 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:16.019
 which is carried out this adventure 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.209
 moment that makes you jump out of fright 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.670
 be scanning a corpse and that of 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.920
 suddenly this one jumps and chases you number 3 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.780
 fatal frame this game uses one of 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.670
 the most cruel and petty mechanics 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.590
 that exist in the horror genre and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.880
 that you're only equipped with a camera 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.980
 that can capture fantasy 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.900
 so to fight with all the 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.850
 evil spirits that are in 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.770
 the haunted mansion the player must 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.390
 focus those with the camera and wait for 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.090
 that they approach to take a photo 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.950
 what a fatal beauty frame takes inspiration 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.810
 with all the horror movies 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.820
 Japanese that began to emerge 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.950
 from the year 2000 after the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.810
 success of the ring so all the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.970
 atmosphere of the game has a touch of 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.160
 Japanese mythology that may result 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.440
 quite exotic and strange to those who do not 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.460
 they know that culture one more reason to 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.590
 play it 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.360
 Ultimately fatal frame is a game 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.250
 that redefines the word fear with a 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.680
 excellent atmosphere and a concept 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.900
 bright moment that makes you jump from the 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.550
 I scare the moment you realize 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.980
 that instead of running from the ghosts 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.230
 you have to take them a motorcycle number 2 if 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.940
 read shots in a time where games 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.920
 of the survival horror genre wanted 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.049
 achieve the success of 'resident evil' a 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.150
 title developed by konami exceeded 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.250
 all expectations and created its own 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.900
 paradigm defining a series of games 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.370
 to come that they became a 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.320
 saga that we definitely 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.180
 terrified and in the process they took away the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.640
 I dream and we got a good pair of 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.480
 nightmares after the success of silence and 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.640
 in Asia 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.350
 Konami set out to overcome the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.330
 success of the first silent and two the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.130
 They took the stage and created what 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.320
 for many it is the best survival game 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.270
 horror that there is the fascinating thing about sil 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.160
 in you and it's that it was developed as a 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.230
 experience that instead of focusing on 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.880
 the combat directed his attention on the 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.800
 fear of the unknown and the state 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.200
 psychological of the protagonist but of the 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.390
 moment player that makes you jump out of the 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.310
 scare when pyramid head you 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.560
 chase through labyrinth number 1 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.630
 amnesia in this game we take the role of 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:08.580
 daniel a character who suffers from amnesia 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.500
 and can not remember who he is or why 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.390
 is in the brain group castle 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.700
 but that through different pages 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.160
 of a newspaper begins to rebuild its 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.950
 past the history of this game has 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.470
 place in the year 1839 where our 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.300
 protagonist only remembers three things his 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.340
 name the place where you live and what there 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.410
 something that is pursuing that yes 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.660
 when this adventure begins Daniel 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.340
 It is clear his mission to kill Alexander 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.870
 the baron of the castle the best of 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.880
 amnesia is that it is not limited to 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.530
 classic scares of monsters coming out 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.690
 from a closet or they run to you for a 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.610
 hallway but it offers a large dose 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.230
 of horror based on tales of torture and 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.240
 the loss of humanity 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.370
 there is no combat mechanics anymore 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.200
 you are forced to run and hide yourself 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.120
 As you defend in the corridors 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.400
 start to do and listen to things that are not 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.650
 they are there and to finish moment that 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.720
 makes you jump out of fear the whole game is 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.310
 a torture thank you for watching the video if
