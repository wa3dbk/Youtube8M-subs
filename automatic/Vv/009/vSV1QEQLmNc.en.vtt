hardware's the very part over here is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.760 
hardware's the very part over here is
that<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.829> Ubisoft<00:00:53.250> blames<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.300> AMD<00:00:55.050> company

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that the Ubisoft blames the AMD company

that the Ubisoft blames the AMD company
for<00:00:56.039> their<00:00:56.219> own<00:00:56.370> mistake<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.030> they<00:00:57.989> even<00:00:58.140> fail

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
for their own mistake and they even fail

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.139 
for their own mistake and they even fail
to<00:00:58.739> notice<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.489> particular<00:00:59.699> problem

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to notice that this particular problem

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
to notice that this particular problem
had<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.170> been<00:01:01.320> observed<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.859> Intel<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
had also been observed in Intel and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.910 
had also been observed in Intel and
NVIDIA<00:01:02.550> Hardware<00:01:03.239> too<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> high-end

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
NVIDIA Hardware too so when the high-end

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.149 
NVIDIA Hardware too so when the high-end
pcs<00:01:05.339> offer<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> performance<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:07.229> it's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
pcs offer this performance then it's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.130 
pcs offer this performance then it's
obvious<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.909> dual<00:01:09.060> core<00:01:09.330> gamers<00:01:09.930> like

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
obvious that the dual core gamers like

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.469 
obvious that the dual core gamers like
us<00:01:10.350> are<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.860> suffer<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> most<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.820> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
us are gonna suffer the most in this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.969 
us are gonna suffer the most in this
video<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> graphics<00:01:13.290> settings<00:01:13.619> are<00:01:13.799> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
video the graphics settings are the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
video the graphics settings are the
default<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.939> been<00:01:15.150> altered<00:01:15.630> though

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
default and have not been altered though

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
default and have not been altered though
I<00:01:16.290> have<00:01:16.670> experimented<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> settings

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
I have experimented on the settings

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
I have experimented on the settings
after<00:01:18.780> making<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.320> video<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.549> settings

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
after making this video and the settings

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.200 
after making this video and the settings
were<00:01:21.450> set<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> lowest<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.310> checked<00:01:24.030> and

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
were set to the lowest and I checked and

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.570 
were set to the lowest and I checked and
I<00:01:24.509> found<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.740> was<00:01:25.890> only<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.220> difference

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
I found that there was only a difference

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
I found that there was only a difference
about<00:01:26.820> 2<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.420> 3<00:01:27.659> frames<00:01:27.930> per<00:01:28.200> second<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:28.710> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
about 2 to 3 frames per second so I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.440 
about 2 to 3 frames per second so I
thought<00:01:29.460> it's<00:01:29.640> better<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.090> show<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> the

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
thought it's better to show you the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999 
thought it's better to show you the
gameplay<00:01:30.869> at<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> default<00:01:31.439> settings<00:01:31.770> I

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
gameplay at the default settings I

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.429 
gameplay at the default settings I
haven't<00:01:32.880> edited<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.420> video<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.259> I

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
haven't edited this video much and I

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.609 
haven't edited this video much and I
think<00:01:34.920> it's<00:01:35.579> better<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> show<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
think it's better to show you the

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.620 
think it's better to show you the
unedited<00:01:37.619> version<00:01:37.979> because<00:01:38.280> by<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
unedited version because by this you

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
unedited version because by this you
will<00:01:39.659> only<00:01:40.049> understand<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.619> performance<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
will only understand the performance and

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
will only understand the performance and
I<00:01:41.790> mean<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.270> level<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.659> performance<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:44.220> can

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
I mean the level of performance we can

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.520 
I mean the level of performance we can
get<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.909> this<00:01:45.030> processor<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> had<00:01:46.409> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
get from this processor so I had this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
get from this processor so I had this
game<00:01:46.829> running<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.250> about<00:01:47.369> 30<00:01:47.759> frames<00:01:47.939> per

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
game running at about 30 frames per

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.210 
game running at about 30 frames per
second<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.720> maximum<00:01:49.380> that's<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:50.100> I'm

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819 
game at better frame rates and which the

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.940 
game at better frame rates and which the
game<00:02:28.000> has<00:02:28.239> really<00:02:28.630> pulled<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.380> been<00:02:29.590> poorly

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
game has really pulled it been poorly

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.080 
game has really pulled it been poorly
optimized<00:02:30.489> and<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.780> me<00:02:31.959> this<00:02:32.230> game<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:32.850> not<00:02:33.850> so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
optimized and for me this game is not so

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.150 
optimized and for me this game is not so
impressive<00:02:34.480> though<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.989> story<00:02:35.739> was<00:02:35.950> really

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
impressive though the story was really

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.699 
impressive though the story was really
interesting<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.150> me<00:02:37.180> but<00:02:37.540> as<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.170> performance

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
interesting to me but as the performance

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.820 
interesting to me but as the performance
did<00:02:38.890> not<00:02:38.920> allow<00:02:39.250> me<00:02:39.430> to<00:02:40.230> create<00:02:41.230> further<00:02:41.470> spy

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
did not allow me to create further spy

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.350 
did not allow me to create further spy
