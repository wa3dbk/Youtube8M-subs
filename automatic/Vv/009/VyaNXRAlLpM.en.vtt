we're going to do a quick little

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.590 
we're going to do a quick little
demonstration<00:00:06.100> on<00:00:06.580> the<00:00:06.760> calibration<00:00:07.390> of<00:00:07.540> the

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:07.600 
demonstration on the calibration of the

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.430 
demonstration on the calibration of the
link<00:00:08.020> maker<00:00:08.230> 9000<00:00:09.690> you<00:00:10.690> have<00:00:10.780> to<00:00:10.900> do<00:00:11.020> this<00:00:11.170> each

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
link maker 9000 you have to do this each

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.600 
link maker 9000 you have to do this each
time<00:00:11.470> you<00:00:12.220> swap<00:00:12.780> manufacturers<00:00:13.780> on<00:00:14.140> links<00:00:14.890> for

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:15.610 
time you swap manufacturers on links for

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.250 
time you swap manufacturers on links for
this<00:00:15.760> one<00:00:15.970> we're<00:00:16.660> going<00:00:16.750> to<00:00:16.810> go<00:00:16.900> ahead<00:00:16.960> and<00:00:17.050> set

unit<00:00:35.859> here<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.340> we<00:00:36.520> were<00:00:36.640> going<00:00:36.879> to<00:00:37.030> press

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
unit here and we were going to press

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.869 
unit here and we were going to press
forward<00:00:37.690> where<00:00:38.410> these<00:00:38.620> two<00:00:38.920> links<00:00:39.190> meet<00:00:39.579> here

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879 
forward where these two links meet here

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.049 
forward where these two links meet here
we're<00:00:40.149> going<00:00:40.239> to<00:00:40.329> make<00:00:40.539> that<00:00:40.719> so<00:00:41.050> that<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.469> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
we're going to make that so that it is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.029 
we're going to make that so that it is
perfectly<00:00:43.059> in<00:00:43.660> line<00:00:43.690> with<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.500> opening<00:00:44.859> of

00:00:45.029 --> 00:00:45.039 
perfectly in line with the opening of

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:47.099 
perfectly in line with the opening of
the<00:00:45.100> tube<00:00:45.670> here<00:00:45.969> so<00:00:46.510> we're<00:00:46.600> going<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.780> push<00:00:46.960> it

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 
the tube here so we're going to push it

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.660 
the tube here so we're going to push it
there<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.640> go<00:00:48.879> slightly<00:00:49.480> forward<00:00:50.379> okay<00:00:51.190> and

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
there just go slightly forward okay and

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.310 
there just go slightly forward okay and
we're<00:00:51.850> going<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.000> lock<00:00:52.210> that<00:00:52.420> down<00:00:52.629> now<00:00:52.929> the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
we're going to lock that down now the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.650 
we're going to lock that down now the
intersection<00:00:53.980> of<00:00:54.070> these<00:00:54.160> two<00:00:54.219> links<00:00:54.579> is<00:00:54.879> right

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
intersection of these two links is right

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.410 
intersection of these two links is right
even<00:00:55.899> with<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.890> opening<00:00:57.219> this<00:00:57.429> now<00:00:58.059> we're

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
even with the opening this now we're

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.810 
even with the opening this now we're
going<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.719> adjust<00:00:59.140> our<00:00:59.500> limit<00:01:00.370> switch<00:01:00.609> on<00:01:00.789> the

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
going to adjust our limit switch on the

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000 
going to adjust our limit switch on the
back<00:01:01.059> here<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:02.320> can<00:01:02.410> see<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.829> LED

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
back here and you can see on the LED

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.790 
back here and you can see on the LED
here<00:01:03.519> if<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.760> LED<00:01:03.940> is<00:01:04.420> on<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:05.080> we're<00:01:05.650> going<00:01:05.770> to

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:05.800 
here if the LED is on and we're going to

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.120 
here if the LED is on and we're going to
slowly<00:01:06.130> turn<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.670> in<00:01:07.060> or<00:01:07.829> there<00:01:08.829> we<00:01:08.950> go<00:01:09.100> just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
slowly turn that in or there we go just

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.740 
slowly turn that in or there we go just
a<00:01:09.490> little<00:01:09.520> bit<00:01:09.850> now<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.150> can<00:01:10.360> see<00:01:10.509> that<00:01:10.600> it's

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
a little bit now we can see that it's

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.810 
a little bit now we can see that it's
off<00:01:10.990> we're<00:01:11.229> going<00:01:11.320> just<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:12.100> go<00:01:12.490> back<00:01:12.520> a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
off we're going just just go back a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.240 
off we're going just just go back a
little<00:01:13.090> bit<00:01:13.240> right<00:01:13.479> there<00:01:13.720> so<00:01:14.409> that's<00:01:14.799> the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
little bit right there so that's the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.700 
little bit right there so that's the
stop<00:01:15.579> point<00:01:15.880> so<00:01:16.720> now<00:01:16.750> that<00:01:17.079> we<00:01:17.170> know<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.530> once

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
stop point so now that we know so once

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.649 
stop point so now that we know so once
again<00:01:17.860> if<00:01:18.310> this<00:01:18.729> was<00:01:18.909> screwed<00:01:19.149> all<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.360> way<00:01:19.479> in

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
again if this was screwed all the way in

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.620 
again if this was screwed all the way in
we<00:01:19.869> just<00:01:20.140> slowly<00:01:20.439> back<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:21.220> out<00:01:21.369> now<00:01:22.329> we<00:01:22.390> got

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
we just slowly back it out now we got

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.510 
we just slowly back it out now we got
our<00:01:22.780> green<00:01:22.960> LED<00:01:23.320> you're<00:01:23.680> going<00:01:23.799> to<00:01:23.860> go<00:01:23.979> in

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
our green LED you're going to go in

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.810 
our green LED you're going to go in
right<00:01:24.880> there<00:01:25.360> so<00:01:25.899> that's<00:01:26.049> just<00:01:26.259> right<00:01:27.070> at<00:01:27.430> the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
right there so that's just right at the

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.810 
right there so that's just right at the
off<00:01:28.000> point<00:01:28.479> and<00:01:29.399> that's<00:01:30.399> we're<00:01:30.610> going<00:01:30.729> to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
off point and that's we're going to

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.330 
off point and that's we're going to
leave<00:01:30.939> it<00:01:31.140> okay<00:01:32.140> so<00:01:32.200> now<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:32.590> have<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.100> thing

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
leave it okay so now we have this thing

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.969 
leave it okay so now we have this thing
set<00:01:33.369> up<00:01:33.640> calibrated<00:01:34.509> 0<00:01:34.869> for<00:01:35.290> this<00:01:35.409> brand<00:01:35.710> link

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
set up calibrated 0 for this brand link

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.760 
set up calibrated 0 for this brand link
now<00:01:36.840> let's<00:01:37.840> just<00:01:38.049> pretend<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:38.530> this

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
now let's just pretend for this

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.889 
now let's just pretend for this
demonstration<00:01:39.009> the<00:01:39.610> manufacturer<00:01:40.270> says<00:01:40.540> this

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
demonstration the manufacturer says this

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.010 
demonstration the manufacturer says this
link<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.350> supposed<00:01:41.649> to<00:01:41.770> be<00:01:42.149> 42<00:01:43.149> millimeters

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
link is supposed to be 42 millimeters

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.319 
link is supposed to be 42 millimeters
long<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:44.740> we're<00:01:44.950> going<00:01:45.040> to<00:01:45.130> set<00:01:45.369> this<00:01:45.579> front

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
long so we're going to set this front

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.630 
long so we're going to set this front
face<00:01:46.570> right<00:01:46.869> here<00:01:47.079> on<00:01:47.799> the<00:01:47.920> graduated<00:01:48.430> scale

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
face right here on the graduated scale

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.730 
face right here on the graduated scale
we're<00:01:48.880> going<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.090> go<00:01:49.180> up<00:01:49.299> here<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.570> 42<00:01:50.409> and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
we're going to go up here to 42 and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.050 
we're going to go up here to 42 and
we're<00:01:51.670> going<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.939> lock<00:01:52.180> this<00:01:52.420> down<00:01:53.130> now<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.520> just

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
we're going to lock this down now I just

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.600 
we're going to lock this down now I just
need<00:01:55.329> to<00:01:55.479> give<00:01:55.689> these<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.250> help<00:01:57.369> her

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
need to give these just just to help her

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.490 
need to give these just just to help her
twist<00:01:57.909> here<00:01:58.210> just<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.689> them<00:01:58.840> on<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.259> things

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
twist here just to get them on so things

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.670 
twist here just to get them on so things
are<00:01:59.649> lined<00:01:59.859> up<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.990> we're<00:02:02.320> going<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.530> go<00:02:02.649> ahead

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
are lined up and we're going to go ahead

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.499 
are lined up and we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:02.890> pull<00:02:03.070> back<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> spring<00:02:03.789> here<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.240> we<00:02:04.359> got

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
and pull back the spring here so we got

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.980 
and pull back the spring here so we got
room<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.780> load<00:02:05.109> this<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.939> I<00:02:06.939> didn't<00:02:07.780> tighten

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
room to load this and I didn't tighten

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.690 
room to load this and I didn't tighten
that<00:02:08.229> down<00:02:08.289> very<00:02:08.830> good<00:02:09.130> so<00:02:09.369> we're<00:02:09.490> going<00:02:09.610> to

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that down very good so we're going to

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.860 
that down very good so we're going to
move<00:02:09.850> it<00:02:10.000> forward<00:02:10.330> there

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.479 

42<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.800> we<00:02:16.010> go<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:17.110> load<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.409> in<00:02:18.769> here

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.160 

okay<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.670> we've<00:02:22.760> got<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.180> set<00:02:23.690> up<00:02:23.720> right<00:02:23.989> now

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
okay and we've got this set up right now

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.080 
okay and we've got this set up right now
we're<00:02:24.349> just<00:02:24.379> using<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.860> 4.8<00:02:25.400> receiver<00:02:25.790> pack

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
we're just using a 4.8 receiver pack

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.699 
we're just using a 4.8 receiver pack
which<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:26.510> play<00:02:26.690> every<00:02:26.720> super<00:02:27.200> pacs<00:02:27.409> laying

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
which we play every super pacs laying

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.199 
which we play every super pacs laying
around<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.220> that's<00:02:28.370> why<00:02:28.519> this<00:02:28.580> does<00:02:28.849> not<00:02:29.030> come

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
around so that's why this does not come

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.009 
around so that's why this does not come
with<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.420> power<00:02:30.230> supply<00:02:30.470> ok<00:02:31.310> now<00:02:31.459> just

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
with a power supply ok now just

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.920 
with a power supply ok now just
basically<00:02:33.019> ZZ<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.620> pushing<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.099> button<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
basically ZZ is pushing the button and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.080 
basically ZZ is pushing the button and
you'll<00:02:35.930> see<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.230> tail<00:02:36.950> stock<00:02:37.129> is<00:02:37.519> keep<00:02:37.760> coming

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
you'll see the tail stock is keep coming

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.330 
you'll see the tail stock is keep coming
forward<00:02:38.390> until<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.440> get<00:02:39.650> to<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.890> intersection

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
forward until we get to the intersection

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.140 
forward until we get to the intersection

part<00:02:44.450> about<00:02:44.480> it<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.230> will<00:02:46.120> screw<00:02:47.120> these<00:02:47.299> in

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
part about it is it will screw these in

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:56.170 
part about it is it will screw these in
the<00:02:47.900> same<00:02:48.110> amount<00:02:48.260> on<00:02:48.590> each<00:02:48.620> side

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.449 

get<00:02:56.989> right<00:02:57.200> up<00:02:57.349> there<00:02:57.560> were<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.890> stop<00:02:58.189> right

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
get right up there were to stop right

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.750 
get right up there were to stop right
there<00:02:58.670> okay<00:02:59.180> so<00:02:59.480> now<00:02:59.629> we<00:02:59.689> take<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.200> thing<00:03:00.379> out

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
there okay so now we take this thing out

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.699 
there okay so now we take this thing out
measure<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.879> up<00:03:02.060> now<00:03:02.510> we've<00:03:02.719> got<00:03:02.930> 42

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
measure it up now we've got 42

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.709 
measure it up now we've got 42
millimeters<00:03:04.280> on<00:03:04.519> here<00:03:04.790> so<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.090> piece<00:03:05.420> of<00:03:05.450> cake

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:05.719 
millimeters on here so a piece of cake

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.000 
millimeters on here so a piece of cake
just<00:03:06.049> need<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.260> remember<00:03:06.439> to<00:03:06.709> do<00:03:06.980> that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
just need to remember to do that

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.270 
just need to remember to do that
calibration<00:03:07.790> on<00:03:08.209> this<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.379> you<00:03:09.829> were<00:03:09.950> going<00:03:10.189> to

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
calibration on this if you were going to

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:16.600 
calibration on this if you were going to
change<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:11.000> size<00:03:11.239> of<00:03:11.420> the<00:03:11.510> link

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.920 

and<00:03:17.610> here<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.030> see<00:03:18.180> measuring<00:03:18.690> it<00:03:18.780> up

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
and here you can see measuring it up

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.610 
and here you can see measuring it up
that<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.410> indeed<00:03:19.770> have<00:03:20.060> 40<00:03:21.080> 1.97<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:22.380> pretty

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
that we do indeed have 40 1.97 so pretty

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.880 
that we do indeed have 40 1.97 so pretty
darn<00:03:22.920> close<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.400> 42
