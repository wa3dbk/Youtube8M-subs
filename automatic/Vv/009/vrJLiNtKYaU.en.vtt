is going to be a little more of a dipper
or<00:00:21.080> more<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.170> an<00:00:22.289> angled<00:00:22.769> passing<00:00:23.189> shot<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.670> can

or more of an angled passing shot I can

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.089 
or more of an angled passing shot I can
also<00:00:24.630> go<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> line<00:00:25.470> which<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
also go down the line which is going to

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.929 
also go down the line which is going to
be<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> little<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.910> flatter<00:00:28.670> faster<00:00:29.670> ball

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939

be a little bit of a flatter faster ball
okay<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:31.019> talk<00:00:31.230> first<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:32.040> that

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
okay so let's talk first about that

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
going to hit with a little more spin

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.139 
going to hit with a little more spin
than<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.500> down-the-line<00:00:38.010> attempt<00:00:38.700> which

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
than my down-the-line attempt which

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.970 
than my down-the-line attempt which
means<00:00:39.390> I've<00:00:39.570> got<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> get<00:00:40.320> my<00:00:40.469> racket

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
means I've got to start to get my racket

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
means I've got to start to get my racket
going<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.399> little<00:00:41.610> more<00:00:41.910> underneath<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> ball

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
going a little more underneath the ball

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.610 
going a little more underneath the ball
to<00:00:44.070> create<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.730> upward<00:00:45.300> path<00:00:45.660> which<00:00:46.260> gives

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to create that upward path which gives

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.830 
to create that upward path which gives
me<00:00:46.829> my<00:00:46.980> spin<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.760> helps<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> ball<00:00:48.930> drop<00:00:49.289> short

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840

speaking about target for that
cross-court<00:00:53.820> pass<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.420> always<00:00:54.809> trying<00:00:55.260> to

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
cross-court pass I'm always trying to

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.760 
cross-court pass I'm always trying to
keep<00:00:55.789> my<00:00:56.789> ball<00:00:57.090> from<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.750> past<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.350> service

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
keep my ball from going past the service

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.950

line when I hit a cross-court pass

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.750 
line when I hit a cross-court pass
because<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.710> worst<00:01:02.070> thing<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.430> could

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
because the worst thing that could

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.630 
because the worst thing that could
happen<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.260> opponent<00:01:04.860> gets<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.189> racket

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
happen is that my opponent gets a racket

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.850 
happen is that my opponent gets a racket
on<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> ball<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.930> they're<00:01:07.170> they're<00:01:07.530> stuck

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
on that ball but they're they're stuck

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
on that ball but they're they're stuck
with<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.070> really<00:01:08.280> low<00:01:08.640> volley<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.780> worst<00:01:10.110> case

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
with a really low volley so worst case

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.410 
with a really low volley so worst case
scenario<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> hit<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.520> well<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> might<00:01:12.240> have

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
scenario if I hit it well I might have

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
scenario if I hit it well I might have
one<00:01:12.750> extra<00:01:13.110> shot<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.040> usually<00:01:14.220> an<00:01:14.580> easy

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
one extra shot but it's usually an easy

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.359 
one extra shot but it's usually an easy
ball<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.140> opponent<00:01:16.619> had<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.799> pop<00:01:17.159> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
ball because my opponent had to pop the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.910 
ball because my opponent had to pop the
shot<00:01:17.580> up<00:01:17.820> but<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.780> working<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.290> nice<00:01:19.619> amount

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
shot up but I'm working on a nice amount

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
shot up but I'm working on a nice amount
of<00:01:20.070> racket<00:01:20.490> speed<00:01:20.759> coming<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.540> below<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
of racket speed coming from below the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
of racket speed coming from below the
ball<00:01:22.380> working<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.759> through<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> finish

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
ball working up through the finish

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.200 
ball working up through the finish
possibly<00:01:25.740> even<00:01:26.009> hitting<00:01:26.460> some<00:01:26.790> vertical

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
possibly even hitting some vertical

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.730 
possibly even hitting some vertical
follow<00:01:27.659> throughs<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.220> cross-court<00:01:29.909> pass

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
follow throughs on that cross-court pass

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.080 
follow throughs on that cross-court pass
okay<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.159> gets<00:01:32.340> me<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> down

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
okay and then that gets me to the down

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.749 
okay and then that gets me to the down
the<00:01:33.119> line<00:01:33.299> ball<00:01:33.780> I'm<00:01:34.009> usually<00:01:35.009> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> keep

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the line ball I'm usually going to keep

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.539 
the line ball I'm usually going to keep
my<00:01:35.939> racket<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.509> little<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:36.960> level<00:01:37.409> with<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
my racket a little more level with the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.760 
my racket a little more level with the
height<00:01:38.939> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.509> bounce<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.200> ball<00:01:40.290> which

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
height of the bounce of the ball which

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.789 
height of the bounce of the ball which
means<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.340> as<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.820> comes<00:01:42.150> in<00:01:42.509> whether<00:01:43.439> it's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
means that as it comes in whether it's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.370 
means that as it comes in whether it's
down<00:01:44.070> by<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.520> knees<00:01:44.579> sitting<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.630> by<00:01:45.840> my<00:01:46.049> waist

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
down by my knees sitting up by my waist

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
down by my knees sitting up by my waist
or<00:01:46.770> even<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.189> bit<00:01:47.430> higher<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:48.450> going<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
or even a little bit higher I'm going to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.920 
or even a little bit higher I'm going to
set<00:01:49.049> my<00:01:49.320> backswing<00:01:50.270> level<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> height

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
set my backswing level with the height

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
set my backswing level with the height
of<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.170> ball<00:01:52.350> because<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.280> gives<00:01:53.670> me<00:01:53.880> more

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
of the ball because that gives me more

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:54.530 
of the ball because that gives me more
of<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
of that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.980 
of that
flat<00:01:55.189> Drive<00:01:56.189> that's<00:01:56.640> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.149> down<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
flat Drive that's going to get down the

here<00:03:00.239> usually<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.410> higher<00:03:01.739> level<00:03:02.129> player<00:03:02.459> is

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
here usually a higher level player is

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.350 
here usually a higher level player is
going<00:03:02.910> to<00:03:03.150> follow<00:03:03.569> their<00:03:03.989> ball<00:03:04.760> take<00:03:05.760> away<00:03:06.090> my

down the line and my middle option and

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.119 
down the line and my middle option and
they'll<00:03:09.329> usually<00:03:09.900> leave<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.319> cross-court

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
they'll usually leave the cross-court

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.990 
they'll usually leave the cross-court
option<00:03:11.910> open<00:03:12.450> for<00:03:12.690> me<00:03:12.810> okay<00:03:13.709> at<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.400> point

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
option open for me okay at that point

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000 
option open for me okay at that point
I've<00:03:15.150> got<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.510> make<00:03:15.660> sure<00:03:15.870> I'm<00:03:16.019> in<00:03:16.049> open<00:03:16.620> stance

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
I've got to make sure I'm in open stance

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.340 
I've got to make sure I'm in open stance
because<00:03:17.549> my<00:03:17.700> opponent<00:03:18.299> is<00:03:18.420> going<00:03:18.690> to<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:19.049> a

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
because my opponent is going to have a

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.240 
because my opponent is going to have a
much<00:03:19.650> tougher<00:03:20.160> time<00:03:21.769> deciding<00:03:22.769> whether<00:03:23.010> I'm

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
much tougher time deciding whether I'm

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.240 
much tougher time deciding whether I'm
going<00:03:23.519> down<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:24.000> line<00:03:24.180> or<00:03:24.450> cross-court<00:03:25.260> if<00:03:25.590> my

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
going down the line or cross-court if my

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.729 
going down the line or cross-court if my
stance<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.790> open<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.329> lot<00:03:28.170> of<00:03:28.200> times<00:03:28.530> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
stance is open a lot of times that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.390 
stance is open a lot of times that
closed<00:03:29.310> stance<00:03:29.880> or<00:03:30.239> step<00:03:30.690> in<00:03:30.900> forehand<00:03:31.530> tips

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
closed stance or step in forehand tips

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.250 
closed stance or step in forehand tips
the<00:03:32.639> opponent<00:03:33.180> off<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.599> the<00:03:33.720> fact<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.109> I'm

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the opponent off to the fact that I'm

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.500 
the opponent off to the fact that I'm
probably<00:03:34.560> going<00:03:34.889> down<00:03:35.160> the<00:03:35.340> line<00:03:35.489> all<00:03:35.849> right

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
probably going down the line all right

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.150 
probably going down the line all right
so<00:03:36.720> let's<00:03:36.959> take<00:03:37.170> a<00:03:37.200> look<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.650> a<00:03:37.739> couple<00:03:37.950> of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
so let's take a look at a couple of

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.910 
so let's take a look at a couple of
these<00:03:38.250> cross<00:03:38.609> court<00:03:38.970> passes<00:03:39.239> first<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:40.739> can

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
these cross court passes first you can

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.420 
these cross court passes first you can
see<00:03:41.130> where<00:03:41.340> mark<00:03:41.639> is<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:43.470> gives<00:03:44.010> me<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.190> good

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
see where mark is it gives me a good

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.280 
see where mark is it gives me a good
chance<00:03:44.700> again<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.269> go<00:03:45.419> underneath<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.109> ball

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
chance again to go underneath the ball

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.370 
chance again to go underneath the ball
hit<00:03:46.980> more<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> dipper<00:03:48.000> angle<00:03:51.139> okay<00:03:52.139> and<00:03:52.290> you

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
hit more of a dipper angle okay and you

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.280 
hit more of a dipper angle okay and you
can<00:03:52.530> see<00:03:52.910> if<00:03:53.910> he<00:03:54.150> gets<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.599> that<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:55.079> ball

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
can see if he gets to that that ball

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.080 
can see if he gets to that that ball
probably<00:03:55.709> set<00:03:55.950> up<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.250> little<00:03:56.430> bit<00:03:56.639> too<00:03:56.849> high

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
probably set up a little bit too high

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.559 
probably set up a little bit too high
but<00:03:57.419> because<00:03:57.840> I<00:03:57.870> spun<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.940> it's<00:03:59.940> getting<00:04:00.419> away

more I'm going to land it a little bit

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.300 
more I'm going to land it a little bit
shorter<00:04:05.190> in<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.430> court<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.889> that<00:04:07.889> one<00:04:08.069> right

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
shorter in the court and that one right

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.479 
shorter in the court and that one right
there<00:04:08.609> pretty<00:04:09.450> darn<00:04:09.780> good<00:04:09.959> pass<00:04:10.290> I've<00:04:11.010> got<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
there pretty darn good pass I've got to

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.479 
there pretty darn good pass I've got to
make<00:04:11.609> sure<00:04:11.669> though<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.389> because<00:04:12.540> it's<00:04:13.109> it's

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
make sure though that because it's it's

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.250 
make sure though that because it's it's
cross-court<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:15.329> if<00:04:15.450> I<00:04:15.599> think<00:04:15.959> there's<00:04:16.200> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
cross-court that if I think there's a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.500 
cross-court that if I think there's a
chance<00:04:16.530> Mark's<00:04:16.979> going<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.220> get<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.729> I<00:04:17.940> got

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
chance Mark's going to get to it I got

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.930 
chance Mark's going to get to it I got
to<00:04:18.630> follow<00:04:18.870> my<00:04:19.049> ball<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.620> that<00:04:19.769> direction<00:04:19.979> okay

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
to follow my ball in that direction okay

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.969 
to follow my ball in that direction okay
now<00:04:21.479> I've<00:04:21.599> got<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.930> down-the-line<00:04:22.320> option

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
now I've got the down-the-line option

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.219 
now I've got the down-the-line option
I'm<00:04:23.310> treating<00:04:23.969> this<00:04:24.090> as<00:04:24.150> if<00:04:24.330> mark<00:04:24.750> did<00:04:24.990> not

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
I'm treating this as if mark did not

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.110 
I'm treating this as if mark did not
shade<00:04:25.710> over<00:04:26.000> okay

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
shade over okay

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.710 
shade over okay
so<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.330> see<00:04:27.660> a<00:04:27.690> nice<00:04:27.990> open<00:04:28.710> window<00:04:29.600> for<00:04:30.600> that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
so I see a nice open window for that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.510 
so I see a nice open window for that
down<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.139> line<00:04:31.169> pass<00:04:31.560> again<00:04:31.980> watch<00:04:32.250> my
