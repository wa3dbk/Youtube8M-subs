00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.770 

big<00:00:01.980> tank<00:00:02.190> on<00:00:02.460> top<00:00:02.490> because<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.360> need<00:00:03.510> to<00:00:03.600> take

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
big tank on top because you need to take

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.600 
big tank on top because you need to take
to<00:00:04.020> put<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.259> f<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.590> the<00:00:04.650> piston<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.070> but<00:00:05.520> we

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:05.610 
to put the f of the piston in but we

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.390 
to put the f of the piston in but we
change<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.240> went<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.720> two<00:00:06.960> tanks<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.620> we

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
change that went to two tanks and we

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.890 
change that went to two tanks and we
mounted<00:00:08.760> them<00:00:08.910> like<00:00:09.090> this<00:00:11.509> this<00:00:12.509> little

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
mounted them like this this little

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.289 
mounted them like this this little
there's<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.740> nub<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.070> each<00:00:14.249> end<00:00:14.490> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
there's a nub on each end we have a

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.839 
there's a nub on each end we have a
whole<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:16.379> bracket<00:00:16.830> fits<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.310> around<00:00:17.580> it

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:17.849 
whole the bracket fits right around it

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:21.830 
whole the bracket fits right around it
like<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.210> on<00:00:18.689> each<00:00:19.199> side<00:00:20.000> both<00:00:21.000> tanks<00:00:21.300> same

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
like that on each side both tanks same

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.509 
like that on each side both tanks same
thing<00:00:22.080> down<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.679> the<00:00:23.130> tanks<00:00:23.400> are

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
thing down here and the tanks are

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429 
thing down here and the tanks are
mounted<00:00:23.789> in<00:00:23.849> this<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.089> they<00:00:24.210> can<00:00:24.390> spin<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
mounted in this so they can spin but the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
mounted in this so they can spin but the
rules<00:00:25.890> say<00:00:26.039> they<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.429> to<00:00:26.550> be<00:00:26.699> structurally

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
rules say they have to be structurally

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.579 
rules say they have to be structurally
Martha<00:00:27.720> they<00:00:27.810> have<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.109> part<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
Martha they have to be part of the

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.820 
Martha they have to be part of the
structure<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> way<00:00:29.970> they<00:00:30.150> are

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
structure so that's the way they are

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.440 
structure so that's the way they are
then<00:00:31.830> next<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.369> needed<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.669> piston<00:00:33.060> so<00:00:33.240> this

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
then next we needed a piston so this

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.790 
then next we needed a piston so this
piston<00:00:34.370> has<00:00:35.510> 153<00:00:36.510> pounds<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.989> force<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.879> 65<00:00:38.879> psi

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
piston has 153 pounds of force at 65 psi

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.639 
piston has 153 pounds of force at 65 psi
it<00:00:40.800> only<00:00:41.070> has<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:42.360> point<00:00:42.719> 8<00:00:42.930> inch<00:00:43.199> stroke

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it only has an about point 8 inch stroke

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.860 
it only has an about point 8 inch stroke
so<00:00:44.190> we'll<00:00:44.399> call<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.820> inch<00:00:44.969> stroke<00:00:45.300> but

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
so we'll call it a one inch stroke but

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
so we'll call it a one inch stroke but
we're<00:00:46.050> using<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.590> letter<00:00:46.890> basically<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.879> make

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we're using a letter basically to make

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.610 
we're using a letter basically to make
it<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.359> our<00:00:48.660> flip<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.170> move<00:00:49.320> four

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
it so that our flip will move four

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.430 
it so that our flip will move four
inches<00:00:50.010> what's<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.670> stroke<00:00:51.030> stroke<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.109> how<00:00:52.230> far

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
inches what's a stroke stroke is how far

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.439 
inches what's a stroke stroke is how far
it<00:00:52.530> comes<00:00:52.680> out<00:00:52.829> ok<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> distance<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.300> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
it comes out ok the distance that it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.139 
it comes out ok the distance that it
comes<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.530> what<00:00:56.039> bit<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.430> then<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.969> need

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
comes out so what bit and then you need

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.880 
comes out so what bit and then you need
a<00:00:57.180> regulator<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> regulator<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
a regulator this is a regulator the

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.950 
a regulator this is a regulator the
tanks<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.820> pump<00:01:00.090> those<00:01:00.239> up<00:01:00.449> with<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.629> bicycle

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
tanks you pump those up with a bicycle

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.359 
tanks you pump those up with a bicycle
pump<00:01:01.079> up<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.649> 150<00:01:02.489> psi<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> these<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.980> pump<00:01:05.190> up

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
pump up to 150 psi so these you pump up

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.390 
pump up to 150 psi so these you pump up
then<00:01:05.960> these<00:01:06.960> tubes<00:01:07.350> there's<00:01:07.890> some<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.250> come

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
then these tubes there's some that come

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.039 
then these tubes there's some that come
out<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> tank<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.450> come<00:01:09.630> around<00:01:09.869> they

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
out of the tank they come around they

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.350 
out of the tank they come around they
come<00:01:10.229> through<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.770> they<00:01:11.759> come<00:01:12.000> these<00:01:12.240> are

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
come through here they come these are

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.460 
come through here they come these are
going<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.509> be<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.810> our<00:01:12.840> pressure<00:01:13.140> relief

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
going to be for our pressure relief

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.310 
going to be for our pressure relief
valve<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.430> tank<00:01:14.970> filler<00:01:15.210> valve<00:01:15.509> they<00:01:16.140> come

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
valve and a tank filler valve they come

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.359 
valve and a tank filler valve they come
around<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:16.799> they<00:01:16.979> go<00:01:17.100> into<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
around through here they go into the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.969 
around through here they go into the
regulator<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.390> regulator<00:01:18.900> takes<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> PSI

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
regulator the regulator takes the PSI

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.910 
regulator the regulator takes the PSI
that's<00:01:20.220> coming<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.640> 150<00:01:21.420> psi<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.049> puts<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.770> out

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
that's coming in 150 psi and puts it out

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.340 
that's coming in 150 psi and puts it out
the<00:01:23.130> other<00:01:23.159> side<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.820> 65<00:01:24.329> psi<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:24.990> whatever<00:01:25.200> we

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the other side at 65 psi or whatever we

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.410 
the other side at 65 psi or whatever we
set<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.799> using<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.520> knob<00:01:27.180> right

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
set it to using this little knob right

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.660 
set it to using this little knob right
here<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:28.799> come<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.220> 65<00:01:29.640> psi

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
here so that it will come out at 65 psi

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.300 
here so that it will come out at 65 psi
under<00:01:30.450> here<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.649> see<00:01:31.829> from<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
under here you can actually see from the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.270 
under here you can actually see from the
bottom<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.240> valve<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.710> way<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.979> works<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
bottom is a valve the way it works the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
bottom is a valve the way it works the
air<00:01:35.399> comes<00:01:35.640> into<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> valve<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
air comes into the valve and then the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.410 
air comes into the valve and then the
valve<00:01:37.200> fires<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.100> air<00:01:38.399> right<00:01:39.119> into<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
valve fires that air right into the

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
valve fires that air right into the
piston<00:01:40.310> very<00:01:41.310> very<00:01:41.579> quickly<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.210> that's

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
piston very very quickly because that's

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.120 
piston very very quickly because that's
the<00:01:42.630> whole<00:01:42.780> idea<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> quick<00:01:43.860> burst

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
the whole idea so you get a quick burst

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.670 
the whole idea so you get a quick burst
and<00:01:44.490> it<00:01:44.880> shoots<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.479> out<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.409> comes

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and it shoots this out and this comes

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.249 
and it shoots this out and this comes
out<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.979> 40<00:01:47.340> inches<00:01:47.700> per<00:01:47.909> second<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.990> means

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
out at 40 inches per second which means

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.310 
out at 40 inches per second which means
that<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> extends<00:01:50.219> in<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:51.090> we're<00:01:52.049> saying

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
that it extends in about we're saying

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.480 
that it extends in about we're saying
we're<00:01:52.469> going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> cut<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> in<00:01:53.009> half<00:01:53.040> because

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
we're going to cut that in half because

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.090 
we're going to cut that in half because
it's<00:01:54.060> 20<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.509> 40<00:01:54.780> inches<00:01:54.990> per<00:01:55.200> second<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
it's 20 to 40 inches per second so this

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.609 
it's 20 to 40 inches per second so this
will<00:01:56.280> extend<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.939> point<00:01:57.240> zero<00:01:57.600> five<00:01:57.899> seconds

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
will extend in point zero five seconds

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.429 
will extend in point zero five seconds
which<00:01:59.430> will<00:01:59.579> be<00:01:59.729> which<00:02:00.030> means<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:01.259> have<00:02:01.289> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
which will be which means that we have a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.580 
which will be which means that we have a
level<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:01.920> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.310> flip<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:03.380> it's<00:02:04.380> going

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
level that's going to flip up it's going

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
level that's going to flip up it's going
to<00:02:04.619> move<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.009> same<00:02:05.219> disk<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> move

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
to move the same disk it's going to move

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.899 
to move the same disk it's going to move
four<00:02:06.329> times<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.750> distance

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
four times the distance

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.790 
four times the distance
with<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.629> quarter<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.259> force<00:02:09.530> so

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
with a quarter of the force so

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.710 
with a quarter of the force so
technically<00:02:10.220> will<00:02:10.580> be<00:02:10.670> about<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:11.209> don't<00:02:11.540> know

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
technically will be about I don't know

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.910 
technically will be about I don't know
what<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> quarter<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.040> 150<00:02:13.819> so<00:02:14.030> say<00:02:14.239> about<00:02:14.470> 35<00:02:15.470> 40

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
what a quarter of 150 so say about 35 40

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.820 
what a quarter of 150 so say about 35 40
pounds<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.310> force<00:02:17.080> 40<00:02:18.080> pounds<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.410> force<00:02:18.590> but

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
pounds of force 40 pounds of force but

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.220 
pounds of force 40 pounds of force but
it's<00:02:18.980> going<00:02:19.099> to<00:02:19.160> move<00:02:19.370> four<00:02:20.299> inches<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.959> point

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
it's going to move four inches in point

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's going to move four inches in point
zero<00:02:21.500> five<00:02:21.709> seconds<00:02:22.250> now<00:02:22.790> flipper<00:02:23.269> what<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.629> did

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
zero five seconds now flipper what I did

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.020 
zero five seconds now flipper what I did
we<00:02:24.769> did<00:02:24.799> have<00:02:25.160> an<00:02:25.280> idea<00:02:25.519> it<00:02:25.640> was<00:02:25.730> going<00:02:25.849> to<00:02:25.940> be

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
we did have an idea it was going to be

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.030 
we did have an idea it was going to be
just<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.330> basic<00:02:26.510> spatula<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.650> scoop<00:02:28.010> like

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
just a basic spatula like a scoop like

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.100 
just a basic spatula like a scoop like
that<00:02:28.430> well<00:02:29.090> we<00:02:29.180> changed<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.629> around<00:02:29.750> and<00:02:30.049> we

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
that well we changed it around and we

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.050 
that well we changed it around and we
turn<00:02:30.290> it<00:02:30.410> into<00:02:30.560> two<00:02:30.799> forks<00:02:31.310> so<00:02:31.790> it'll<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:31.970> like

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
turn it into two forks so it'll be like

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
turn it into two forks so it'll be like
a<00:02:32.209> forklift<00:02:32.750> because<00:02:33.650> when<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> think<00:02:34.370> about

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
a forklift because when you think about

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.509 
a forklift because when you think about
it<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.150> way<00:02:35.299> a<00:02:36.140> scoop<00:02:36.799> works<00:02:37.010> as<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.370> gets

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
it the way a scoop works as it gets

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.610 
it the way a scoop works as it gets
under<00:02:37.760> something<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.390> if<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:39.110> is<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.319> body

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
under something and if this is the body

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.930 
under something and if this is the body
gets<00:02:39.920> under<00:02:40.099> it<00:02:40.160> like<00:02:40.250> that<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.579> you<00:02:40.640> flip<00:02:40.910> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
gets under it like that and you flip it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.550 
gets under it like that and you flip it
now<00:02:41.599> most<00:02:42.560> BOTS<00:02:42.920> aren't<00:02:43.840> thin<00:02:44.840> or<00:02:45.079> aren't<00:02:45.349> real

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
now most BOTS aren't thin or aren't real

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.610 
now most BOTS aren't thin or aren't real
narrow<00:02:46.250> so<00:02:46.819> if<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.720> have<00:02:47.900> two<00:02:48.110> things<00:02:48.410> like

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
narrow so if you have two things like

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.470 
narrow so if you have two things like
this<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.370> chances<00:02:49.790> that<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:49.970> broad<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.360> going

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
this the chances that a broad is going

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.020 
this the chances that a broad is going
to<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.989> between<00:02:51.170> are<00:02:51.680> very<00:02:52.400> very<00:02:52.610> slim<00:02:52.879> and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
to get in between are very very slim and

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.119 
to get in between are very very slim and
we<00:02:53.120> need<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.450> weight<00:02:53.629> so<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.470> forklift<00:02:54.950> that

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:55.129 
we need the weight so the forklift that

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:57.940 
we need the weight so the forklift that
is<00:02:55.250> simply<00:02:55.849> still<00:02:56.690> gives<00:02:56.930> us<00:02:57.079> essentially<00:02:57.799> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
is simply still gives us essentially the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.360 
is simply still gives us essentially the
same<00:02:59.290> usable<00:03:00.290> area<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.709> guess<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.069> could<00:03:01.220> call

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
same usable area I guess you could call

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.270 
same usable area I guess you could call
it<00:03:01.569> so<00:03:02.569> this<00:03:02.750> way<00:03:02.959> we'll<00:03:03.709> be<00:03:03.739> able<00:03:03.859> to<00:03:04.040> drive<00:03:04.190> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
it so this way we'll be able to drive a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.550 
it so this way we'll be able to drive a
little<00:03:04.459> faster<00:03:04.700> we'll<00:03:05.269> have<00:03:05.420> the<00:03:05.690> extra<00:03:06.170> well

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
little faster we'll have the extra well

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.619 
little faster we'll have the extra well
because<00:03:06.709> it's<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:07.040> 15<00:03:07.400> pound<00:03:07.640> class<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:08.510> your

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
because it's a 15 pound class so your

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.270 
because it's a 15 pound class so your
robot<00:03:08.930> can't<00:03:09.140> weigh<00:03:09.230> more<00:03:09.260> than<00:03:09.440> 15<00:03:09.890> pounds

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
robot can't weigh more than 15 pounds

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.650 
robot can't weigh more than 15 pounds
and<00:03:11.560> hopefully<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.680> plan<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:13.910> have<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.389> lot

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
and hopefully the plan is we have a lot

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.270 
and hopefully the plan is we have a lot
of<00:03:14.690> speed<00:03:15.019> with<00:03:15.230> these<00:03:15.380> motors<00:03:15.799> so<00:03:16.010> we'll<00:03:16.190> be

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
of speed with these motors so we'll be

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.970 
of speed with these motors so we'll be
able<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.549> maneuver<00:03:17.120> quick<00:03:17.680> get<00:03:18.680> underneath

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
able to maneuver quick get underneath

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.770 
able to maneuver quick get underneath
them<00:03:19.250> fire<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.940> piston<00:03:20.269> and<00:03:20.329> it<00:03:20.480> flips<00:03:20.660> them

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
them fire the piston and it flips them

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.750 
them fire the piston and it flips them
all<00:03:20.959> day<00:03:21.109> so<00:03:21.530> we<00:03:21.680> did<00:03:21.859> we<00:03:22.069> did<00:03:22.220> all<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.430> physics

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
all day so we did we did all the physics

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.159 
all day so we did we did all the physics
we<00:03:22.880> did<00:03:23.000> all<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.209> math<00:03:23.359> and<00:03:23.419> that<00:03:23.720> should<00:03:24.019> be

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.169 
we did all the math and that should be

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.489 
we did all the math and that should be
able<00:03:24.290> to<00:03:24.500> flip<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.799> robot<00:03:25.160> okay
