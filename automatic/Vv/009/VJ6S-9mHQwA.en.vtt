which allows of you and a friend to

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.590 
which allows of you and a friend to
listen<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.110> same

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
listen to the same

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.430 
listen to the same
on<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.350> ipod<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:16.540> doesn't<00:02:16.840> look<00:02:16.930> too<00:02:17.230> ugly

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
on the ipod and it doesn't look too ugly

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.680 
on the ipod and it doesn't look too ugly
but<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.160> really<00:02:19.030> cool<00:02:19.180> for<00:02:19.330> them<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.570> have

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
but it's really cool for them to have

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.620 
but it's really cool for them to have
that<00:02:19.870> feature<00:02:20.170> and<00:02:20.560> you<00:02:20.770> get<00:02:20.950> a<00:02:20.980> little

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
that feature and you get a little

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.210 
that feature and you get a little
knapsack<00:02:22.630> or<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.960> little<00:02:23.260> sack<00:02:23.800> whatever<00:02:24.130> you

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
knapsack or a little sack whatever you

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.560 
knapsack or a little sack whatever you
want<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.460> call<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.640> where<00:02:24.970> you<00:02:25.060> can<00:02:25.210> store<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
want to call it where you can store the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.380 
want to call it where you can store the
headphones<00:02:25.900> in<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.110> carry<00:02:26.500> them<00:02:26.650> around<00:02:26.800> and

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
headphones in and carry them around and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.270 
headphones in and carry them around and
which<00:02:28.390> is<00:02:28.600> kind<00:02:29.380> of<00:02:29.500> annoying<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.130> way

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
which is kind of annoying in a way

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.040 
which is kind of annoying in a way
because<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.730> really<00:02:30.970> offers<00:02:31.240> no<00:02:32.020> protection

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
because it really offers no protection

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.800 
because it really offers no protection
whatsoever<00:02:32.740> of<00:02:33.700> course<00:02:34.210> it's<00:02:34.360> going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.570> stop

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
whatsoever of course it's going to stop

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.570 
whatsoever of course it's going to stop
dust<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.440> scratches<00:02:35.740> from<00:02:35.980> getting<00:02:36.250> on<00:02:36.370> your

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
dust and scratches from getting on your

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.730 
dust and scratches from getting on your
headphones<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.450> would<00:02:37.960> really<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.500> loved

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
headphones but I would really have loved

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.100 
headphones but I would really have loved
to<00:02:38.890> see<00:02:38.920> maybe<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.460> hard<00:02:39.820> case<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.930> could

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
to see maybe a hard case that could

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.220 
to see maybe a hard case that could
protect<00:02:41.470> against<00:02:41.740> drops<00:02:42.450> bumps<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.660> all<00:02:43.960> that

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
protect against drops bumps and all that

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.610 
protect against drops bumps and all that
sort<00:02:44.440> of<00:02:44.560> thing<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:45.960> although<00:02:46.960> it's<00:02:47.140> soft<00:02:47.410> and
