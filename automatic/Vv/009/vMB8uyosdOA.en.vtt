in<00:05:34.530> Windows<00:05:34.830> however<00:05:35.790> this<00:05:36.419> will<00:05:36.750> require<00:05:37.200> all

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
in Windows however this will require all

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.710 
in Windows however this will require all

the partitions to be created which will

convert the partition table without
losing<00:05:48.930> data<00:05:49.139> however<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.460> should<00:05:50.669> always

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
losing data however you should always

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.330 
losing data however you should always
