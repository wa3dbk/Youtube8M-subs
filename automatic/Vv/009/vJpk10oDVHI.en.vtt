all of them at the same time but yeah we
didn't<00:06:16.229> go<00:06:16.319> there<00:06:16.619> to<00:06:17.039> PvP<00:06:18.029> so<00:06:19.849> anyway<00:06:20.849> I'll

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:21.300 
didn't go there to PvP so anyway I'll

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.589 
didn't go there to PvP so anyway I'll
just<00:06:21.329> I'll<00:06:21.809> just<00:06:21.839> leave<00:06:22.139> it<00:06:22.169> at<00:06:22.349> that<00:06:22.379> so<00:06:23.599> if

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:24.599 
just I'll just leave it at that so if

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:30.589 
just I'll just leave it at that so if
you<00:06:25.459> if<00:06:26.459> you<00:06:26.819> placed<00:06:28.339> the<00:06:29.339> eggs<00:06:29.729> inside<00:06:30.300> of<00:06:30.479> the

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
you if you placed the eggs inside of the

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:36.019 
you if you placed the eggs inside of the
keg<00:06:30.869> and<00:06:31.169> you<00:06:31.979> dropped<00:06:32.879> the<00:06:33.269> three<00:06:33.539> bombs<00:06:35.029> then

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
keg and you dropped the three bombs then

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:40.519 
keg and you dropped the three bombs then
you're<00:06:36.959> done<00:06:38.839> so<00:06:39.839> you<00:06:39.959> just<00:06:40.110> gotta<00:06:40.289> head<00:06:40.499> back

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:40.529 
you're done so you just gotta head back

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:44.629 
you're done so you just gotta head back
to<00:06:41.159> dark<00:06:41.879> hollow<00:06:42.089> Jenka<00:06:42.569> and<00:06:43.309> turn<00:06:44.309> in<00:06:44.610> your

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
to dark hollow Jenka and turn in your

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:49.040 
to dark hollow Jenka and turn in your
quests<00:06:45.409> and<00:06:46.849> you<00:06:47.849> got<00:06:48.119> rotten<00:06:48.389> hello

quests and you got rotten hello

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.909 
quests and you got rotten hello
so<00:06:49.889> hopefully<00:06:50.159> the<00:06:51.050> opposite<00:06:52.050> faction<00:06:52.409> didn't

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
so hopefully the opposite faction didn't

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:58.159 
so hopefully the opposite faction didn't
give<00:06:53.069> you<00:06:53.159> too<00:06:53.189> much<00:06:53.490> trouble<00:06:53.550> and<00:06:57.169> hopefully

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:58.169 
give you too much trouble and hopefully

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.079 
give you too much trouble and hopefully
you<00:06:58.469> got<00:06:59.189> in<00:06:59.399> and<00:06:59.550> out<00:06:59.639> of<00:06:59.759> there<00:06:59.849> without

you got in and out of there without

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:02.719 
you got in and out of there without
dying<00:07:00.419> too<00:07:00.719> many<00:07:00.899> times<00:07:01.169> it<00:07:01.800> helps<00:07:02.339> obviously

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
dying too many times it helps obviously

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.269
