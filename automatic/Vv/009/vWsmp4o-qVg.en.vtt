00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.330
The sun is often referred to in astronomical
texts as a garden-variety star, which is okay

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.950
because it is a fairly common type, although
I object to it sometimes because “garden”

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.290
sort of implies “uninteresting.”

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:52.160
We can have energy from the sun that affects our communication systems. It can also affect
satellites, space missions, and can cause

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:12.540
problems with power grids and things like
that.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.170
This is Kitt Peak National Observatory and
the National Solar Observatory. This is a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.010
pretty sunny site. We are in the Southwest,
in the middle of a desert at a fairly high

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.840
altitude—about seven thousand feet—so
we're above much of the atmospheric haze that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.840
lies down in the lower desert.
This is called the solar vacuum telescope.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.320
It’s a special telescope to observe only
the sun, making a special use of mirrors to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.350
produce a stationary image inside an observing
room. The actual observing apparatus then

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.060
consists of a spectromagnetograph, which is
a special instrument designed to look at the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.060
sun’s magnetic field. The magnetic field
is probably the fundamental physical mechanism

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.640
which controls the outer solar atmosphere.
It's because it varies and changes that particles

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.950
become accelerated and they're directed towards
the earth.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.950
The areas of strong field are probably here,
here, here. This region in particular is an

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:45.160
example of an active region. It's a region
that is likely to erupt, where large volumes

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.160
of the sun simply are ejected out into interplanetary
space and that is at the heart of space weather.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.950
Space weather starts at the sun and the sun’s
atmosphere explodes off of the sun and it

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.870
flows out into interplanetary space in all
directions at about a million miles per hour.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.269
And then, when that flowing solar wind impacts
the earth's magnetosphere, hits the earth's

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:18.269
magnetic field, some of the solar wind particles
and some of that flowing energy get trapped,

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.180
and when the energy is released, it causes
enormous acceleration of particles that give

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.739
us the radiation belts that impact astronauts
and impact satellites. It also generates the

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.260
aurora borealis that we see, and it drives
large electrical currents in the high latitude

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:43.250
ionosphere that can impact power transmission
on the ground, pipelines, communications,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.900
those sorts of things. And then on top of
that, the sun occasionally blasts off these

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.489
large coronal mass ejections, and when one
of those impacts the magnetosphere, it is

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.840
just like hitting an already stressed system
with a very large wallop and that causes some

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.909
of the largest space weather activity that
we see.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.709
Good morning, Space Weather Operations. This
is Ken.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:17.709
The largest flare was in M2. That’s an incredibly
impressive region. All solar activity does

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.770
not hit the earth--CMEs, solar flares. It
depends where they originated from on the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.870
sun and where we're located in space. Something
that's located in the middle of the sun, from

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.590
there heading straight toward the earth would
be the most likely direct hit.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.750
Right here, that's the one that has been giving
us most of the activity.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.900
The data that the Space Environment Center
uses is a collection of ground-based and space-based

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.760
instruments. So a forecast made moderate to
high M class flares are likely.  

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.300
Our forecasts, our information, our alerts and watches and
warnings go out to a variety of customers.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:02.980
Power companies receive our information. Operation
centers that are operating satellites. Airlines

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.500
use our information for radio blackouts. Geologists
use our information for checking their instruments

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.290
before they drill. Our forecasts on the short
term are not bad at all, they’re actually

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.730
pretty accurate. Long term, even with the
weather forecasts, it's difficult to say things

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.680
three to seven days out.
I think the day will come when space weather

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.680
reports become mainstream in our society,
in our news broadcasts and our newspapers,

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.620
because we're certainly using space more and
more and I think we will continue to, and

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:42.260
we're relying on it more and more for our
economy and for our standard of living. And

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.450
as we use space and rely on space, space weather
information is likely to become more prevalent 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:48.950

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.530
in our daily lives. 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.340
Space Weather Operations, this is Gail.
