sure they're in the mix so once the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.320 
sure they're in the mix so once the
groundbaits<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.850> will<00:00:30.060> draw

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
groundbaits got in that will draw

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.939 
groundbaits got in that will draw
everything<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> little<00:00:31.289> bit<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.650> stuff's

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
everything out a little bit this stuff's

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.069 
everything out a little bit this stuff's
been<00:00:32.039> made<00:00:32.340> probably<00:00:32.610> 15-20<00:00:33.450> minutes<00:00:33.720> now<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
been made probably 15-20 minutes now and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.200 
been made probably 15-20 minutes now and
if<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.440> pick<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.739> up<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.220> see<00:00:35.460> he's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
if I just pick that up you can see he's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.240 
if I just pick that up you can see he's
damp<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.899> it's<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.230> weighing<00:00:37.470> sort<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:37.950> holds

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
damp but it's not weighing sort of holds

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.060 
damp but it's not weighing sort of holds
together<00:00:38.430> but<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.390> will<00:00:39.480> break<00:00:39.690> up<00:00:40.070> quite

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
together but it will break up quite

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.900 
together but it will break up quite
easily<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.110> that's<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.290> mix<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:44.820> it

easily so that's your mix to put it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.119 
easily so that's your mix to put it
together<00:00:45.059> we're<00:00:45.660> gonna<00:00:45.780> use<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.860> fellow

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
together we're gonna use that fellow

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.209 
together we're gonna use that fellow
there<00:00:48.079> that's<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> long<00:00:49.410> chap<00:00:49.680> frontal<00:00:50.070> web

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
there that's the long chap frontal web

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.119 
there that's the long chap frontal web
the<00:00:50.399> smallest<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> three<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.950> you<00:00:52.950> see

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
the smallest of the three and you see

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.000 
the smallest of the three and you see
there<00:00:53.340> that's<00:00:53.660> identified<00:00:54.660> by<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> red<00:00:55.469> flash

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
there that's identified by the red flash

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.380 
there that's identified by the red flash

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
flash on it that's slightly larger one

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.420 
flash on it that's slightly larger one
needs<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.140> boilie<00:01:01.500> find<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.770> website<00:01:01.949> so

you're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.610> get<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.850> bigger<00:01:03.059> stick<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you're gonna get a bigger stick out of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.599 
you're gonna get a bigger stick out of
it<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.379> got<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> green<00:01:04.829> flash<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.459> and

it that's got a green flash on it and
the<00:01:05.670> biggest<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.509> the<00:01:06.810> original<00:01:07.049> funnel

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:07.709 
the biggest one is the original funnel

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:09.109 
the biggest one is the original funnel
web<00:01:07.799> which<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.009> yellow<00:01:08.459> which<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.789> be<00:01:08.880> honest

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
web which is yellow which to be honest

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
web which is yellow which to be honest
for<00:01:09.240> this<00:01:09.359> range<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.869> probably<00:01:10.350> too<00:01:10.560> big<00:01:10.859> but

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
for this range is probably too big but

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.969 
for this range is probably too big but
this<00:01:11.789> stuff<00:01:12.029> makes<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.840> tiny<00:01:13.170> tiny<00:01:13.619> little

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
this stuff makes a tiny tiny little

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.309 
this stuff makes a tiny tiny little
stick<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.969> can<00:01:15.209> get<00:01:15.359> that<00:01:15.450> PVA<00:01:15.899> onto<00:01:16.349> there

00:01:18.309 --> 00:01:18.319 
stick I can get that PVA onto there

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:19.879 
stick I can get that PVA onto there
there<00:01:19.319> we<00:01:19.439> go

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:19.889 
there we go

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.940 
there we go
and<00:01:20.609> the<00:01:21.599> mistake<00:01:21.959> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> people<00:01:22.289> make<00:01:22.709> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
and the mistake a lot of people make is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
and the mistake a lot of people make is
they<00:01:23.009> try<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.549> pick<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.789> groundbait<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
they try and pick the groundbait up and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.719 
they try and pick the groundbait up and
get<00:01:24.779> it<00:01:24.869> down<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.709> end<00:01:25.859> of<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.130> tube<00:01:26.399> there

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
what I'm going to do instead is just

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.699 
what I'm going to do instead is just
scoop<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:29.549> up<00:01:29.779> against<00:01:30.779> the<00:01:30.899> side<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.499> bait

00:01:31.699 --> 00:01:31.709 
scoop it up against the side of the bait

the<00:01:42.209> end<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.689> you've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.959> something<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.259> press

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the end so you've got something to press

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.129 
the end so you've got something to press
against<00:01:44.099> and<00:01:44.249> then<00:01:44.909> with<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.689> compressor

00:01:46.129 --> 00:01:46.139 
against and then with the compressor

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:48.019 
against and then with the compressor
that<00:01:46.259> comes<00:01:46.469> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.679> system<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.639> push<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:48.029 
that comes in the system just push it

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:49.729 
that comes in the system just push it
down<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.389> the<00:01:48.419> end<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.049> air<00:01:49.169> come<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.619> of

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
down to the end that the air come out of

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.309 
down to the end that the air come out of
it<00:01:49.889> and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:50.489> really<00:01:51.149> push<00:01:51.359> it<00:01:51.509> down<00:01:51.659> hard<00:01:51.989> so

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
it and then really push it down hard so

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.830 
it and then really push it down hard so
it's<00:01:52.469> all<00:01:52.560> compressed<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.880> then<00:01:54.119> holding<00:01:54.749> the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
it's all compressed and then holding the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.229 
it's all compressed and then holding the
payee<00:01:55.049> under<00:01:55.439> tension<00:01:55.679> just<00:01:55.889> push<00:01:56.279> it<00:01:56.459> at<00:01:56.999> the

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:57.239 
payee under tension just push it at the

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.510 
payee under tension just push it at the
end<00:01:57.389> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.569> tube<00:01:57.889> and<00:01:58.889> that's<00:01:59.099> the<00:01:59.249> stick

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
end of the tube and that's the stick

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.539 
end of the tube and that's the stick
formed<00:02:00.079> pump<00:02:01.079> plenty<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> PVA<00:02:01.799> off<00:02:02.099> and<00:02:02.399> then

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
formed pump plenty of PVA off and then

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.519 
formed pump plenty of PVA off and then
just<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.849> simple<00:02:03.389> overhand<00:02:03.779> knot<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.380> like

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:04.529 
just a simple overhand knot just like

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.159 
just a simple overhand knot just like
what<00:02:04.709> we<00:02:04.829> call<00:02:04.859> granny<00:02:05.309> knot<00:02:05.579> just<00:02:06.419> around<00:02:06.809> and

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:07.169 
what we call granny knot just around and

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.469 
what we call granny knot just around and
through<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:08.489> then<00:02:08.729> what<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:08.939> doing<00:02:08.969> is<00:02:09.299> I'm

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
through and then what I'm doing is I'm

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.610 
through and then what I'm doing is I'm
holding<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.200> PVA<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.099> top<00:02:11.370> of<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.670> stick

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
holding the PVA at the top of the stick

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.710 
holding the PVA at the top of the stick
holding<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.580> toy<00:02:13.849> and<00:02:14.060> then<00:02:14.120> I'm<00:02:14.269> pulling

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
holding that toy and then I'm pulling

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.530 
holding that toy and then I'm pulling
and<00:02:14.870> knock<00:02:15.019> down<00:02:15.260> onto<00:02:15.980> that<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.299> they're

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
and knock down onto that so that they're

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.600 
and knock down onto that so that they're
not<00:02:17.690> ends<00:02:17.900> up<00:02:18.140> right<00:02:18.830> on<00:02:18.950> top<00:02:19.159> of<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.340> stick

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
not ends up right on top of the stick

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.880 
not ends up right on top of the stick
and<00:02:19.909> then<00:02:20.030> they'll<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.239> a<00:02:20.269> second<00:02:20.780> knot<00:02:20.989> and<00:02:21.560> do

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
and then they'll do a second knot and do

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.320 
and then they'll do a second knot and do
the<00:02:22.040> same<00:02:22.190> thing<00:02:22.519> how<00:02:22.730> would<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.940> pain<00:02:23.120> be<00:02:23.299> a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
the same thing how would the pain be a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.270 
the same thing how would the pain be a
way<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.659> want<00:02:23.840> them<00:02:24.019> not<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.560> pull<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.040> down

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
way you want them not to be pull it down

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.729 
way you want them not to be pull it down
and<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.390> two<00:02:26.599> end<00:02:26.900> up<00:02:27.080> really<00:02:27.290> close<00:02:27.560> together

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
and the two end up really close together

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.729 
and the two end up really close together
so<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.159> don't<00:02:28.190> waste<00:02:28.489> any<00:02:28.700> PVI

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
so you don't waste any PVI

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.809 
so you don't waste any PVI
and<00:02:30.739> just<00:02:30.920> get<00:02:31.069> your<00:02:31.190> pair<00:02:31.340> of<00:02:31.400> scissors<00:02:31.730> cut

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
and just get your pair of scissors cut

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.509 
and just get your pair of scissors cut
between<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.390> two<00:02:32.650> and<00:02:33.650> if<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.860> pull<00:02:34.099> that<00:02:34.280> back

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
between the two and if I pull that back

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.880 
between the two and if I pull that back
there<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:35.750> system<00:02:36.170> is<00:02:36.290> ready<00:02:36.440> for<00:02:36.680> another

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
there the system is ready for another

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.559 
there the system is ready for another
guy<00:02:37.159> that<00:02:37.190> goes<00:02:37.519> back<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.060> tube<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.540> the

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
guy that goes back in the tube so the

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.670 
guy that goes back in the tube so the
PVA<00:02:38.989> mesh<00:02:39.349> doesn't<00:02:39.980> get<00:02:40.129> wet<00:02:41.319> and<00:02:42.319> mussed<00:02:42.440> it's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
PVA mesh doesn't get wet and mussed it's

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.640 
PVA mesh doesn't get wet and mussed it's
done<00:02:42.920> as<00:02:43.069> well<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:44.750> then<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.079> attach<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
done as well and then to attach the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.390 
done as well and then to attach the
stick<00:02:47.049> the<00:02:48.049> green<00:02:48.319> beta<00:02:48.680> need<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.220> heavy

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
stick the green beta need all the heavy

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.250 
stick the green beta need all the heavy
gate<00:02:49.670> latch<00:02:49.879> needle<00:02:50.390> just<00:02:50.840> gets<00:02:51.049> pushed

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
gate latch needle just gets pushed

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.539 
gate latch needle just gets pushed
through<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.620> stick<00:02:51.829> you'll<00:02:52.010> feel<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> pushing

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
through the stick you'll feel it pushing

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.250 
through the stick you'll feel it pushing
past<00:02:52.879> the<00:02:53.120> pellets<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.599> stuff<00:02:53.840> as<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.079> goes

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
past the pellets and stuff as it goes

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.960 
past the pellets and stuff as it goes
through<00:02:54.290> try<00:02:55.040> and<00:02:55.160> avoid<00:02:55.340> them<00:02:55.549> not<00:02:55.730> if<00:02:55.849> you

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
through try and avoid them not if you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.699 
through try and avoid them not if you
can<00:02:56.209> because<00:02:56.840> that's<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.079> last<00:02:57.260> part<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.590> the

can because that's the last part of the

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.059 
can because that's the last part of the
PVA<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.129> melt<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:58.909> then<00:02:59.590> with<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.890> loop

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
PVA to melt and then with the loop

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.349 
PVA to melt and then with the loop
you've<00:03:01.280> tied<00:03:01.459> in<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.730> end<00:03:01.849> of<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.030> hook<00:03:02.180> link

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:02.359 
you've tied in the end of the hook link

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.440 
you've tied in the end of the hook link
or<00:03:02.540> in<00:03:02.629> this<00:03:02.750> case<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.109> link<00:03:03.290> glue<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:04.790> put

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
or in this case the link glue just put

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.149 
or in this case the link glue just put
that<00:03:05.569> on<00:03:05.690> to<00:03:05.810> the<00:03:05.900> gate<00:03:06.079> latch<00:03:06.290> needle<00:03:06.799> and

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
that on to the gate latch needle and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:08.740 
that on to the gate latch needle and
then<00:03:07.340> pull<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.760> through<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.209> PVA<00:03:08.540> you'll

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
then pull it through the PVA you'll

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.479 
then pull it through the PVA you'll
break<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.019> couple<00:03:09.349> of<00:03:09.500> bits<00:03:09.590> of<00:03:09.709> PVA's<00:03:10.159> you<00:03:10.310> put

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
break a couple of bits of PVA's you put

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.339 
break a couple of bits of PVA's you put
it<00:03:10.579> through<00:03:10.730> that's<00:03:10.909> no<00:03:11.150> issue<00:03:11.359> at<00:03:11.599> all<00:03:11.780> and

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
it through that's no issue at all and

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.920 
it through that's no issue at all and
then<00:03:12.859> just<00:03:13.099> tease<00:03:13.609> that<00:03:13.640> sinker<00:03:14.450> through<00:03:14.720> the

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
then just tease that sinker through the

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.420 
then just tease that sinker through the
hole<00:03:15.140> you've<00:03:15.349> already<00:03:15.500> made<00:03:15.829> and<00:03:16.159> the<00:03:16.220> same

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
hole you've already made and the same

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.940 
hole you've already made and the same
thing<00:03:16.669> with<00:03:16.819> your<00:03:16.940> shrink<00:03:17.209> tube<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:21.049> then<00:03:21.919> the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
thing with your shrink tube and then the

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.099 
thing with your shrink tube and then the
point<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.459> the<00:03:22.549> hook<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:22.760> pulls<00:03:23.269> ever<00:03:23.840> so

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
point that the hook just pulls ever so

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:26.289 
point that the hook just pulls ever so
slightly<00:03:24.579> into<00:03:25.579> the<00:03:25.609> end<00:03:25.790> of<00:03:25.849> the<00:03:25.910> stick<00:03:26.150> so

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
slightly into the end of the stick so

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.940 
slightly into the end of the stick so
there's<00:03:26.419> no<00:03:26.630> way<00:03:26.870> the<00:03:27.019> hair<00:03:27.200> can<00:03:27.380> tangled

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
there's no way the hair can tangled

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.039 
there's no way the hair can tangled
you've<00:03:28.579> got<00:03:28.700> a<00:03:28.730> little<00:03:29.090> pile<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.480> really

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
you've got a little pile of really

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.229 
you've got a little pile of really
attractive<00:03:30.560> stuff<00:03:30.859> around<00:03:31.609> that<00:03:31.849> would<00:03:32.000> buy

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
attractive stuff around that would buy

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.300 
attractive stuff around that would buy
to<00:03:32.299> hopefully<00:03:32.810> draw<00:03:33.019> the<00:03:33.079> fish<00:03:33.379> in<00:03:33.590> even

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
to hopefully draw the fish in even

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.960 
to hopefully draw the fish in even
quicker<00:03:34.549> and<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.239> cover<00:03:35.629> up<00:03:36.129> the<00:03:37.129> join<00:03:37.669> between

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
quicker and to cover up the join between

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.490 
quicker and to cover up the join between
that<00:03:38.359> and<00:03:38.389> the<00:03:38.540> lead<00:03:38.720> system<00:03:39.169> I'm<00:03:39.290> just

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
that and the lead system I'm just

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.170 
that and the lead system I'm just
putting<00:03:39.769> a<00:03:39.799> bit<00:03:39.980> of<00:03:40.010> three<00:03:40.459> mil<00:03:40.669> silicon

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
putting a bit of three mil silicon

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.830 
putting a bit of three mil silicon
surely<00:03:41.900> being<00:03:42.049> on<00:03:42.199> and<00:03:43.060> then<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.269> quick<00:03:44.569> link

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
surely being on and then that quick link

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.819 
surely being on and then that quick link
is<00:03:45.739> attached<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:48.500> link<00:03:48.709> loop<00:03:48.919> like<00:03:49.819> so<00:03:49.849> and

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
is attached so the link loop like so and

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.199 
is attached so the link loop like so and
then<00:03:51.829> will<00:03:51.949> cover<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.310> hole<00:03:52.459> up<00:03:52.730> in<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.030> bit

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
then will cover the hole up in that bit

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.729 
then will cover the hole up in that bit
of<00:03:53.299> silicone<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.959> there's<00:03:54.109> no<00:03:54.319> way<00:03:54.530> you<00:03:54.590> can

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
of silicone so there's no way you can

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.619 
of silicone so there's no way you can
get<00:03:54.829> off<00:03:54.980> there<00:03:55.250> so<00:03:55.430> that's<00:03:55.819> my<00:03:55.940> favorite<00:03:56.299> PVA

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
get off there so that's my favorite PVA

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.720 
get off there so that's my favorite PVA
stick<00:03:56.989> mix<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.799> how<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.040> make<00:03:58.340> one<00:03:58.519> of<00:03:58.609> these

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
stick mix and how to make one of these

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.270 
stick mix and how to make one of these
tiny<00:03:59.060> long<00:03:59.419> chopsticks<00:03:59.989> and<00:04:00.530> whack<00:04:00.859> this<00:04:01.040> out

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
tiny long chopsticks and whack this out

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.199 
tiny long chopsticks and whack this out
there<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:01.730> show<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.389> all-important<00:04:02.989> three
