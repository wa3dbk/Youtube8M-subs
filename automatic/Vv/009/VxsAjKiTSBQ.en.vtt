think is the most important that is the

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.179 
think is the most important that is the
kill<00:02:04.329> streaks<00:02:04.600> okay<00:02:04.840> is<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.439> UAV<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.100> the

the majority of weapons used in advanced

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.250 
the majority of weapons used in advanced
warfare<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.549> not<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.359> KFI<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.840> know<00:03:21.989> people

warfare is not the KFI you know people

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.129 
warfare is not the KFI you know people
like<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.470> use<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.680> ASM<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.639> bell<00:03:23.930> 27<00:03:24.930> uh

like to use the ASM one the bell 27 uh

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.170 
like to use the ASM one the bell 27 uh
you<00:03:25.980> know<00:03:26.099> certain<00:03:26.430> guns<00:03:26.579> like<00:03:26.819> that<00:03:26.849> and<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
you know certain guns like that and the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.449 
you know certain guns like that and the
KFI<00:03:27.629> doesn't<00:03:28.139> really<00:03:28.349> see<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.590> lot<00:03:28.829> of<00:03:28.859> use<00:03:29.160> so

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
KFI doesn't really see a lot of use so

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.180 
KFI doesn't really see a lot of use so
what<00:03:30.180> tio<00:03:30.389> decided<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.959> was<00:03:31.079> slap<00:03:31.319> on<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:31.680> kf5

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
what tio decided it was slap on that kf5

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:33.470 
what tio decided it was slap on that kf5
since<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.549> didn't<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> challenges

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
since you didn't have all the challenges

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.270 
since you didn't have all the challenges
on<00:03:33.629> like<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.900> see<00:03:34.079> doesn't<00:03:34.349> even<00:03:34.500> have<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> camo

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
on like you see doesn't even have a camo

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.710 
on like you see doesn't even have a camo
unlike<00:03:35.970> forward<00:03:36.299> so<00:03:36.359> that<00:03:36.480> means<00:03:36.629> you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
unlike forward so that means you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.819 
unlike forward so that means you
probably<00:03:36.930> don't<00:03:37.079> have<00:03:37.139> any<00:03:37.199> of<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.409> cool<00:03:37.620> ones

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
probably don't have any of the cool ones

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.009 
probably don't have any of the cool ones
unlocked<00:03:38.190> or<00:03:38.879> diamond<00:03:39.389> or<00:03:39.510> gold<00:03:39.540> or<00:03:39.870> anything

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
and so just playing with the gun can

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.250 
and so just playing with the gun can
help<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.000> unlock<00:03:42.329> some<00:03:42.629> of<00:03:42.659> those<00:03:42.780> camels

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
help you unlock some of those camels

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.619 
help you unlock some of those camels
unlock<00:03:43.859> more<00:03:44.069> attachments<00:03:44.790> achieve<00:03:45.239> certain

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
unlock more attachments achieve certain

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.869 
unlock more attachments achieve certain
challenges<00:03:46.139> that<00:03:46.590> otherwise<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.639> wouldn't

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
challenges that otherwise you wouldn't

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:49.580 
challenges that otherwise you wouldn't
have<00:03:48.000> achieved<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.599> gotten<00:03:48.810> that<00:03:48.900> XP<00:03:49.379> and

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
have achieved and gotten that XP and

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.659 
have achieved and gotten that XP and
then<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.859> would<00:03:49.949> just<00:03:49.979> level<00:03:50.280> up<00:03:50.370> whole<00:03:50.519> lot

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
then you would just level up whole lot

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.099 
then you would just level up whole lot
slower<00:03:50.940> so<00:03:51.180> using<00:03:51.449> different<00:03:51.690> guns<00:03:51.810> like<00:03:51.959> that

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
slower so using different guns like that

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.589 
slower so using different guns like that
definitely<00:03:52.949> helped<00:03:53.099> out<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.250> shit-ton<00:03:53.519> it<00:03:54.449> just

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
definitely helped out a shit-ton it just

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.449 
definitely helped out a shit-ton it just

seems like the only guns I see people
using<00:04:13.229> is<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.440> ASM<00:04:13.799> one<00:04:13.949> in<00:04:14.099> about<00:04:14.280> 27<00:04:14.790> so

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
using is the ASM one in about 27 so

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.909 
using is the ASM one in about 27 so
that's<00:04:15.060> kind<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.389> set<00:04:15.629> now<00:04:16.049> also<00:04:16.530> another

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
that's kind of set now also another

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.110 
that's kind of set now also another
thing<00:04:17.280> this<00:04:17.729> dude<00:04:18.329> goes<00:04:19.019> absolutely

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
thing this dude goes absolutely

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.460 
thing this dude goes absolutely
ballistic<00:04:21.120> on<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.539> objective<00:04:22.019> this<00:04:22.139> dude

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
ballistic on the objective this dude

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.080 
ballistic on the objective this dude
there<00:04:22.830> is<00:04:22.949> almost<00:04:23.190> not<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.400> moment<00:04:23.880> in<00:04:23.940> this

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
there is almost not a moment in this

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.790 
there is almost not a moment in this
gameplay<00:04:24.300> where<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.720> man<00:04:24.960> isn't<00:04:25.169> capping<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
gameplay where this man isn't capping a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.620 
gameplay where this man isn't capping a
flag<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.340> there<00:04:26.669> are<00:04:26.789> so<00:04:27.029> many<00:04:27.180> different

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
flag and there are so many different

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.719 
flag and there are so many different
ways<00:04:27.779> to<00:04:27.840> cap<00:04:28.229> a<00:04:28.260> flag<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:29.159> isn't<00:04:29.550> just

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
ways to cap a flag and that isn't just

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:30.760 
ways to cap a flag and that isn't just
sitting<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.150> it

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
sitting on it

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.740 
sitting on it
capturing<00:04:31.310> it<00:04:31.430> because<00:04:31.699> if<00:04:31.910> you<00:04:32.030> play<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.330> flag

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
capturing it because if you play a flag

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.390 
capturing it because if you play a flag
right<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.289> you're<00:04:33.379> able<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.860> maneuver<00:04:34.190> your

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
right and you're able to maneuver your

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.309 
right and you're able to maneuver your
way<00:04:34.460> around<00:04:34.639> it<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.120> just<00:04:35.569> basically<00:04:35.990> leave<00:04:36.289> a

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:36.319 
way around it and just basically leave a

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.140 
way around it and just basically leave a
flag<00:04:36.740> neutral<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.460> don't<00:04:37.610> really<00:04:37.759> think<00:04:37.819> I<00:04:38.000> see

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
flag neutral I don't really think I see

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:39.309 
flag neutral I don't really think I see
him<00:04:38.270> doing<00:04:38.419> that<00:04:38.629> too<00:04:38.780> much<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.050> this<00:04:39.139> gameplay

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
him doing that too much in this gameplay

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.809 
him doing that too much in this gameplay
but<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.009> just<00:04:40.099> something<00:04:40.340> I<00:04:40.430> was<00:04:40.520> thinking

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
but it's just something I was thinking

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.309 
but it's just something I was thinking
about<00:04:40.879> if<00:04:41.060> there's<00:04:41.240> a<00:04:41.330> neutral<00:04:41.750> flag<00:04:42.020> every

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:42.319 
about if there's a neutral flag every

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.830 
about if there's a neutral flag every
kill<00:04:42.770> you<00:04:42.919> get<00:04:43.129> while<00:04:43.340> capping<00:04:43.729> a<00:04:43.759> flag<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:44.240> 200

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
kill you get while capping a flag is 200

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.779 
kill you get while capping a flag is 200
points<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.740> if<00:04:45.860> you're<00:04:46.009> able<00:04:46.190> to<00:04:46.370> just<00:04:46.460> kind<00:04:46.729> of

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
points so if you're able to just kind of

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.939 
points so if you're able to just kind of
hop<00:04:47.210> on<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.479> flag<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.020> few<00:04:48.229> seconds<00:04:48.710> and

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
hop on the flag for a few seconds and

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.010 
hop on the flag for a few seconds and
maybe<00:04:49.129> get<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.400> kill<00:04:49.699> and<00:04:49.909> then<00:04:50.180> hop<00:04:50.419> off<00:04:50.629> it<00:04:50.900> and

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
maybe get a kill and then hop off it and

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.420 
maybe get a kill and then hop off it and
then<00:04:51.139> hop<00:04:51.289> back<00:04:51.319> on<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:51.860> get<00:04:51.979> another<00:04:52.159> kill

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
then hop back on and get another kill

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.850 
then hop back on and get another kill
that<00:04:52.580> is<00:04:52.759> literally<00:04:53.479> double<00:04:53.870> xp<00:04:54.259> and<00:04:54.500> on

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
that is literally double xp and on

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.290 
that is literally double xp and on
double<00:04:55.099> xp<00:04:55.430> weekend<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:55.909> is<00:04:56.000> going<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.210> be

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
double xp weekend that is going to be

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.629 
double xp weekend that is going to be
quadruple<00:04:57.110> XP<00:04:57.830> so<00:04:57.949> that's<00:04:58.069> going<00:04:58.159> to<00:04:58.220> be<00:04:58.310> 400

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
quadruple XP so that's going to be 400

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.510 
quadruple XP so that's going to be 400
XP<00:04:59.300> a<00:04:59.330> kill<00:04:59.599> which<00:04:59.840> is<00:04:59.990> nearly<00:05:00.440> 1<00:05:00.919> kill<00:05:01.280> in
