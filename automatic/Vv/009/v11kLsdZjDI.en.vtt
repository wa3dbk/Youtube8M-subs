00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
take quite a few coats as well so this

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.650 
take quite a few coats as well so this
is<00:04:02.560> kind<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:02.860> a<00:04:02.950> better<00:04:03.360> formulation<00:04:04.360> of<00:04:04.450> that

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
is kind of a better formulation of that

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.780 
is kind of a better formulation of that
and<00:04:05.019> this<00:04:05.260> looks<00:04:05.530> like<00:04:05.769> that<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.430> now<00:04:06.550> it's

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
is worth it because the shade is just so

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.710
