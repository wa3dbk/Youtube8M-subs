00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.270 

I<00:00:00.030> think<00:00:00.390> he's<00:00:00.690> going<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.860> now<00:00:01.890> it's<00:00:02.100> not

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
I think he's going to right now it's not

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.470 
I think he's going to right now it's not
really<00:00:02.460> indicating<00:00:02.879> it<00:00:02.970> but<00:00:03.120> just<00:00:03.270> with<00:00:03.360> the

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
really indicating it but just with the

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.150 
really indicating it but just with the
troop<00:00:03.629> count<00:00:03.870> not<00:00:04.680> having<00:00:04.890> those<00:00:04.980> high

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
troop count not having those high

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.730 
troop count not having those high
templar<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> little<00:00:05.790> bit<00:00:05.910> sooner<00:00:06.240> i<00:00:06.620> think<00:00:07.620> then

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
templar a little bit sooner i think then

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.839 
templar a little bit sooner i think then
i<00:00:07.770> was<00:00:07.859> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> be<00:00:08.220> able<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.429> push<00:00:08.580> out<00:00:08.730> of

i was going to be able to push out of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.879 
i was going to be able to push out of
this<00:00:08.940> very<00:00:09.690> quickly<00:00:09.929> fairly<00:00:10.469> efficiently

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
this very quickly fairly efficiently

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.370 
this very quickly fairly efficiently
with<00:00:11.490> kind<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.940> zealot<00:00:12.240> press<00:00:12.480> combination

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
with kind of a zealot press combination

with kind of a zealot press combination

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
if he can he's going to have a hard time

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.890 
if he can he's going to have a hard time
moving<00:00:14.910> them<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.210> but<00:00:15.360> if<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.780> run

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
moving them out but if you can just run

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.390 
moving them out but if you can just run
though<00:00:15.990> zealots<00:00:16.320> up<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.039> reaver<00:00:17.310> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
follow being a good position but

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.300 
follow being a good position but
interestingly<00:00:19.289> enough<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.920> looks<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.189> that

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
interestingly enough it looks like that

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.200 
interestingly enough it looks like that
is<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:20.699> stopping<00:00:20.939> production

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210

production all together to get a cup of

production all together to get a cup of
those<00:00:26.130> gateways<00:00:26.369> up<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.789> just<00:00:26.880> relying<00:00:27.269> on

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
those gateways up and just relying on

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.300 
those gateways up and just relying on
the<00:00:27.510> natural<00:00:27.630> defense<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.439> those<00:00:28.859> Reavers<00:00:29.189> on

the natural defense of those Reavers on

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.250 
the natural defense of those Reavers on
those<00:00:29.429> students<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.210> front<00:00:30.420> door<00:00:30.660> but

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
those students on the front door but

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.990 
those students on the front door but
this<00:00:31.740> might<00:00:32.160> bite<00:00:32.369> him<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> butt<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.820> little

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this might bite him in the butt a little

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
this might bite him in the butt a little
bit<00:00:33.270> if<00:00:33.480> nuni<00:00:34.079> looks<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.469> he's<00:00:34.620> getting<00:00:34.739> some

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
bit if nuni looks like he's getting some

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.979 
bit if nuni looks like he's getting some
high<00:00:35.070> tempo<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.460> as<00:00:35.579> well<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:36.030> plopping<00:00:36.840> down

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
high tempo out as well and plopping down

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
high tempo out as well and plopping down
it<00:00:37.290> looks<00:00:37.500> like<00:00:37.739> additional<00:00:38.430> gateways<00:00:38.760> he's

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
it looks like additional gateways he's

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
it looks like additional gateways he's
going<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.329> seven<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.379> wow<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.610> he<00:00:41.670> can<00:00:41.910> get

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
going up to seven so wow if he can get

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
going up to seven so wow if he can get
some<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.329> size<00:00:42.600> storm<00:00:42.899> going<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.500> get

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
some of that size storm going and get

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.990 
some of that size storm going and get
position<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.399> front<00:00:44.489> door<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:44.850> might

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
position out in the front door he might

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.700 
position out in the front door he might
be<00:00:45.090> able<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.329> kind<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> counter<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:45.989> because

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
be able to kind of counter this because

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.200 
be able to kind of counter this because
dino<00:00:46.950> won't<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> position<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.940> kind<00:00:48.120> of

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
dino won't be in a position to kind of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.779 
dino won't be in a position to kind of
counter<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.840> basically<00:00:49.200> rollout<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> and

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
counter it's basically rollout and and

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.240 
counter it's basically rollout and and
reestablish<00:00:51.539> position<00:00:52.260> although<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.160> it

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
reestablish position although I think it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.380 
reestablish position although I think it
might<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.399> coming<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> little<00:00:53.969> bit<00:00:54.180> late

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
might be coming out a little bit late

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.939 
might be coming out a little bit late
even<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:54.960> seven<00:00:55.289> gateways<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.770> think

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
even with those seven gateways I think

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
even with those seven gateways I think
Dino<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.579> position<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> press

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
Dino is going to be in position to press

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.000 
Dino is going to be in position to press
out<00:00:57.570> take<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> three<00:00:58.440> o'clock<00:00:58.620> base<00:00:58.829> before

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
out take that three o'clock base before

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.830 
out take that three o'clock base before
then<00:00:59.309> but<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.640> really<00:00:59.879> going<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> be<00:01:00.359> the

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
then but that's really going to be the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.060 
then but that's really going to be the
difference<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.289> this<00:01:01.379> match<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
difference in this match here is

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.709 
difference in this match here is
essentially<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.969> nuni<00:01:03.270> get<00:01:03.420> those<00:01:03.570> high

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
essentially can nuni get those high

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
essentially can nuni get those high

templar on position to storm dino as

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
deuce oh man spear situation but it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.289 
deuce oh man spear situation but it
looks<00:01:22.950> like<00:01:23.070> he's<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.430> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> have<00:01:23.759> size

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
looks like he's not going to have size

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.730 
looks like he's not going to have size
from<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.689> quite<00:01:24.869> some<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.560> think

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
from for quite some time and I think

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.020 
from for quite some time and I think
that's<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.310> was<00:01:26.430> going<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.729> relying

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that's what he was going to be relying

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.179 
that's what he was going to be relying
on<00:01:27.240> his<00:01:27.780> size<00:01:28.049> storm<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.590> little<00:01:28.799> bit<00:01:28.920> sooner

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
on his size storm a little bit sooner

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
on his size storm a little bit sooner
and<00:01:29.310> psystorm<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.970> move<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.240> across<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and psystorm to move out across that

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.630 
and psystorm to move out across that
three<00:01:31.170> clock<00:01:31.350> base<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:31.860> nuni<00:01:32.250> even<00:01:32.549> though

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
three clock base so now nuni even though

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.770 
three clock base so now nuni even though
he<00:01:32.790> was<00:01:32.880> starting<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.240> an<00:01:33.360> economic

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
he was starting at an economic

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.030 
he was starting at an economic
disadvantage<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.470> think<00:01:34.650> he's<00:01:34.740> going<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.920> be

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
disadvantage I think he's going to be

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.770 
disadvantage I think he's going to be
able<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> turn<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> into<00:01:36.030> an<00:01:36.180> eight<00:01:36.299> advantage

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
able to turn it into an eight advantage

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.870 
able to turn it into an eight advantage
ultimately<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.950> Reavers<00:01:38.310> moving<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.820> think

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
ultimately to Reavers moving up I think

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
ultimately to Reavers moving up I think
we<00:01:39.210> actually<00:01:39.329> saw<00:01:39.630> speed<00:01:39.990> shuttles<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.530> might

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
we actually saw speed shuttles up might

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.230 
we actually saw speed shuttles up might
have<00:01:41.430> been<00:01:41.549> upgrade<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.909> we'll<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.119> once

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
have been upgrade and we'll see once

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.030 
have been upgrade and we'll see once
that<00:01:42.390> shuttle<00:01:42.659> gets<00:01:42.720> moving<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:43.680> Dino<00:01:43.920> is

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
that shuttle gets moving but now Dino is

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560 
that shuttle gets moving but now Dino is
going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.430> play<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.970> lot<00:01:45.420> more

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
going to have to play a lot more

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.749 
going to have to play a lot more

sighs storm so brilliant play from noon
each<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.150> stable<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.480> come<00:02:18.660> back<00:02:18.810> around<00:02:18.930> now

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
each is stable to come back around now

each is stable to come back around now
Dino<00:02:19.500> has<00:02:19.710> psystorm<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.880> just<00:02:21.060> see

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
Dino has psystorm but you can just see

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.550 
Dino has psystorm but you can just see
that<00:02:21.210> troop<00:02:21.570> positioning<00:02:22.020> difference<00:02:22.380> and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
that troop positioning difference and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
that troop positioning difference and
also<00:02:22.890> it<00:02:23.010> looks<00:02:23.100> like<00:02:23.220> nuni<00:02:23.910> just<00:02:24.090> had<00:02:24.210> more

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
also it looks like nuni just had more

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.480 
also it looks like nuni just had more
troops<00:02:24.720> out<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:25.020> begin<00:02:25.290> with<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.370> that

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
troops out to begin with that in that

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.010 
troops out to begin with that in that
River<00:02:26.820> difference<00:02:27.240> just<00:02:27.420> absolutely<00:02:27.780> huge

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
River difference just absolutely huge

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
River difference just absolutely huge
nuni<00:02:28.320> should<00:02:28.530> easily<00:02:28.770> be<00:02:28.920> able<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.220> take<00:02:29.400> out

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
nuni should easily be able to take out

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.120 
nuni should easily be able to take out
it<00:02:30.450> easily<00:02:30.959> able<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.230> take<00:02:31.380> another<00:02:31.590> base<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
it easily able to take another base and

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
it easily able to take another base and
basically<00:02:32.940> keep<00:02:33.240> Dino<00:02:33.480> from<00:02:33.630> taking<00:02:33.990> another

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
basically keep Dino from taking another

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.290 
basically keep Dino from taking another
base<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.680> I<00:02:35.040> think<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.850> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
base and I think that is going to be the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.050 
base and I think that is going to be the
story<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.660> this<00:02:36.959> match<00:02:37.260> I<00:02:38.130> think<00:02:38.250> what<00:02:38.850> Dino

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
story of this match I think what Dino

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.670 
story of this match I think what Dino
needs<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.450> do<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.810> another<00:02:40.080> shuttle<00:02:40.470> out
