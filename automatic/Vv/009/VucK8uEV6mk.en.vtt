00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.959
 Hello everyone today we are going to talk about 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.549
 different alternatives to remove 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.889
 the pips to the cherimoya for 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.420
 prepare it in order to use it in 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.449
 some recipes is one of the themes 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:23.539
 recurrent that always comes at the time 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.039
 to talk about why the custard apple does not 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.039
 often use a lot in the kitchen 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:34.079
 we have split a custard apple in half 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.079
 we proceed to peel it 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 what we do is 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.070
 remove the top layer we're going 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.070
 removing little by little 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.390
 and so we cut 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:09.320
 through the small pockets that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.490
 they contain the nuggets that then we 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.490
 will facilitate the extraction of the same 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.270
 if we want to preserve the texture of the 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.369
 Cherimoya in the recipes that we are 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.979
 preparing because we do not have many 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:36.300
 alternatives now what we do is 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.300
 catch one by one 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 they come out easily 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.210
 or 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.780
 we use this when we want 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.729
 keep what is the texture of the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.050
 cherimoya use it in pieces in 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.050
 different recipes 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.340
 or
