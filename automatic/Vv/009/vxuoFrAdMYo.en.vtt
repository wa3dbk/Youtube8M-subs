00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.820 
interactive mock-up for a point-of-sale
system<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.730> what<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:08.940> did<00:00:09.090> first<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:09.960> create

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
system so what I did first is to create

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.520 
system so what I did first is to create
the<00:00:11.010> designs<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.639> photoshop<00:00:12.019> then<00:00:13.019> export

them<00:00:13.679> as<00:00:13.830> pngs<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.759> then<00:00:15.210> import<00:00:15.570> them<00:00:15.599> in

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
them as pngs and then import them in

image<00:00:23.789> maps<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.390> top<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.560> images<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.250> here

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
image maps on top of the images so here

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
image maps on top of the images so here
I'm<00:00:27.359> going<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.720> draw<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.760> hot<00:00:29.760> spot<00:00:30.890> or<00:00:31.890> image

I'm going to draw a hot spot or image

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.139 
I'm going to draw a hot spot or image
map<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.880> top<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> browse<00:00:33.750> button<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:35.149> tell

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
map on top of the browse button and tell

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.889 
map on top of the browse button and tell
it<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.230> when<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.250> user<00:00:38.430> taps<00:00:38.899> that

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
it where to go when the user taps that

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.369 
it where to go when the user taps that
certain<00:00:40.290> area<00:00:41.780> it<00:00:42.780> should<00:00:43.379> go<00:00:43.559> there<00:00:44.000> so<00:00:45.000> once

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
certain area it should go there so once

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.819 
certain area it should go there so once
when<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> run<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.539> it<00:00:48.539> feels<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:48.989> it<00:00:49.350> really

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
when I run it it feels like it really

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.540 
when I run it it feels like it really
works<00:00:50.570> as<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.719> it<00:00:51.840> were<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.800> real<00:00:52.949> application

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
works as if it were the real application

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.600 
works as if it were the real application
so<00:00:54.329> when<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.660> dip<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> browse<00:00:55.320> button<00:00:55.610> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so when you dip the browse button it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.299 
so when you dip the browse button it
just<00:00:56.879> jumps<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.690> next<00:00:57.719> slide<00:00:58.100> where<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
just jumps to the next slide where the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740 
just jumps to the next slide where the
browse<00:00:59.520> button<00:00:59.760> where<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> image<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
browse button where the image is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
browse button where the image is
replaced<00:01:01.170> by<00:01:01.500> an<00:01:02.399> image<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.570> has<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
replaced by an image and it has to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.620 
replaced by an image and it has to
browse<00:01:04.049> button<00:01:04.489> selected<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.420> way<00:01:06.600> we

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
browse button selected so this way we

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.190 
browse button selected so this way we
can<00:01:06.780> build<00:01:07.490> full<00:01:08.490> scenarios<00:01:09.030> by<00:01:09.780> stringing

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
can build full scenarios by stringing

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.060 
can build full scenarios by stringing
together<00:01:10.409> slides<00:01:11.070> using<00:01:11.810> image<00:01:12.810> Maps<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.770> let

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
together slides using image Maps so let

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.760 
together slides using image Maps so let
me<00:01:14.159> continue<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> scenario<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
me continue this scenario so this is a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.820 
me continue this scenario so this is a
