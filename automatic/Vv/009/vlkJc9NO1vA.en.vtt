00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
slightly bigger than the piece of meat

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.889 
slightly bigger than the piece of meat
that<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:35.880> carving<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.600> makes<00:00:36.809> your

life easier
obviously<00:00:38.489> whatever<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:38.879> if<00:00:38.940> you're

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
obviously whatever now if you're

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.729 
obviously whatever now if you're
comfortable<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.660> makes<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> most<00:00:40.649> sense

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
comfortable with makes the most sense

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.440 
comfortable with makes the most sense
but<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> longer<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.820> better<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.390> case

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
but the longer is better in this case

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.959 
but the longer is better in this case
just<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.379> we're<00:00:43.530> making<00:00:43.620> nice<00:00:43.980> clean<00:00:44.340> cuts<00:00:44.670> all
