00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
with an idea yesterday of need a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830 
with an idea yesterday of need a
defendant<00:00:22.740> stop<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> run<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.580> well<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.390> some

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
outside is the beginning of the game and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.200 
outside is the beginning of the game and
I'm<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.369> shutting<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> down<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210

safety<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> top<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.320> I'm<00:01:07.530> basically

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
safety over the top so I'm basically

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
safety over the top so I'm basically
controlling<00:01:08.640> my<00:01:08.820> safety<00:01:09.240> again<00:01:09.990> especially

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
controlling my safety again especially

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.590 
controlling my safety again especially
it<00:01:11.250> works<00:01:11.520> better<00:01:11.880> if<00:01:12.390> they<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.810> no<00:01:13.619> huddle<00:01:13.860> and

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
it works better if they go no huddle and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.480 
it works better if they go no huddle and
if<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.810> go<00:01:15.930> no<00:01:16.110> huddle<00:01:16.320> right<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> they

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
if they go no huddle right here the they

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.190 
if they go no huddle right here the they
get<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.180> linebackers<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.930> higher

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
get it like the linebackers get a higher

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
get it like the linebackers get a higher
jump<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> ball<00:01:20.310> even<00:01:20.520> second<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> ball

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.149 
get a nice jump into the ball here for
even<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.200> they<00:01:28.320> were<00:01:28.380> trying<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.950> quick

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
even if they were trying to do a quick

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.399 
even if they were trying to do a quick
pass<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.790> quarterback<00:01:30.240> will<00:01:30.360> not<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.750> time

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
pass the quarterback will not have time

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.219 
pass the quarterback will not have time
