00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello friends with you denis semenihin in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.430
 this blog we discuss all the laws 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.350
 nutrition to achieve the perfect 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.460
 physical form this release caught me 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.349
 you can say in field conditions 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.360
 because I went for a few days 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.679
 snowboarding in the mountains and yesterday 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 faced a rather unpleasant 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 situations on grief because how are you 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.660
 understand this cafe and in all sorts 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 catering establishments 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.910
 what is offered is not like that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.430
 I would like to eat and I thought 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.320
 why don't we try together 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.760
 solve this problem with enough 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.929
 simple products that I managed 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.969
 buy in the supermarket 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.730
 I'll try to cook myself for today 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.829
 up the hill for a whole day skiing small 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.840
 food supply which is such a thermos 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.760
 let's see how much real there 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 calories and proteins fit for 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.210
 carbohydrates and then on the mountain 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.010
 reporting mode so say i to you 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.989
 report back to the place 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.640
 this food has come as far as it is convenient 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.829
 or uncomfortable but generally will share with you 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.750
 my feelings I suggest to start and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 cook and so on my doubt then 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.449
 up to 20 grams of pasta which 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.789
 contain aggregate I tell you 85 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.640
 grams of carbohydrates and 12 grams of protein 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.549
 150 grams of shrimp 150 grams 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.619
 shrimp contains about 25 grams 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.360
 protein but the amount of fat is insignificant 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.700
 we will then take it all together with you 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 further chicken breast weighing 200 grams 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 and the amount of protein in it is about 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.530
 thirty five grams small 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.780
 the amount of fat that we sweat too 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.150
 then we will consider a small amount further 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.610
 there are very few mushrooms for taste 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.040
 yudakov carbs so we won't even 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.020
 take this into account and 100 grams of corn in 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.090
 which contains 20 grams of carbohydrates 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.969
 and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.859
 3 grams Dulko further cream sought 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.259
 Fifteen percent cream did not find 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.609
 bought 20 percent cream here 100 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.159
 milliliters may even be a little less 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:45.710
 but suppose 110 is 20 grams of fat 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.920
 natural order there 3 grams 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.380
 protein and 4 grams of carbohydrates so here from 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.299
 this all together I will try 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 cook I don't know what to call it 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.520
 soup is eaten naturally to drink 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.829
 This thermos on the mountain I need to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.929
 it's a little poured or whatever 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.579
 the whole cavity but I will try it on the mountain 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.009
 have called for it to increase the fit 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.840
 or is it all here now all together we 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.060
 let's go this way with you from the beginning to 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.560
 the end will start cutting the board guys right away 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.349
 It was in this hotel room therefore 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:24.920
 will have to cut back on your plate Well 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:26.900
 can you do that but here's the chicken breast 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.060
 cut now i think you can cut 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.860
 shrimp i will explain again why i see 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.620
 the fact that the mountain I will not take the spoon 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.150
 I will try to drink all this on the mountain in 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.340
 pockets extra items such as 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.230
 a spoon or a protein that's even better protein 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.420
 fine i think for snowboarders 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.150
 squirrel in the pocket of this squirrel in baku and 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.739
 so i cut the chicken breasts cut 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.810
 shrimp about appliance for 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.609
 cooking I was not lazy and took 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.380
 from the unit itself but considering the amount 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.930
 luggage that i was including two 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.430
 snowboard and other 4 kilograms for me 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.840
 there was no problem besides i understood 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.090
 that I will need to record the issue 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.880
 this tank is poured around 350 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.410
 milliliters of water I'm not sure yet 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.060
 this amount of water is enough for that 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.280
 the amount of food that we have all 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.470
 harvested try 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.540
 chicken breast world i like hi here 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.640
 the internet will throw mushrooms here and such 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.580
 I got the feeling that I need water 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.760
 more floors mushrooms there will understand yes 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:26.220
 in general, these products will figure out how to live 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:31.700
 there but a little cream for the thickness well 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.700
 What is all- start cooking ? 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:41.209
 the dish is ready but without them looking ago 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.750
 but here's the guys for this all this and 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:56.569
 done that is to have on the mountain with you 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.310
 thermos with the soup that I 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.829
 cooked it is simply unrealistic 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.480
 try to ride the foundations of the furnace on 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:04.579
 downhill skiing for a couple of hours 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.650
 take this soup with you get it 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.359
 from a backpack and drink 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.340
 and then you will understand that such a particular 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.709
 if you were like this town too when 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.729
 did today I for rose once 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.489
 lift queue 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.590
 too i.e. it is 1:15 cardiac load 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.840
 will you guys train look for new 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.850
 new brands of loads diversify your 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:31.610
 training process and good luck for now 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:34.910
 let's open the burned snippet 5 4 hours 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.460
 did an invisible enemy and nougat best 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.900
 was it on the gorilla with at least 1 legs 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.240
 imported noise is not 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.070
 the enemy is not the enemy is burning 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:51.610
 face lit up angry at the enemy not 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:51.610
