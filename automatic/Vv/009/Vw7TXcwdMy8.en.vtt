00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.839
 beacon from solution 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.800
 did and from this side also did 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.670
 beacon while shopping these 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.980
 magical frozen if I brought you 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.670
 the solution in this bucket and threw such 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:27.320
 way we will now shoot this 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.320
 excess solution moving 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:37.090
 this rule beacons slightly fatima also 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.090
 drill and take off 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.100
 once again you need to remove that is, I do not press 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 strongly sat and quietly 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:05.760
 at 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.690
 so that this layer is not removed well, that one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 side rule is sharp if of course 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.290
 tape would have to take breakfast tape 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.570
 what else will I have next girl 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.570
 put and tape conveniently and quickly 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:45.490
 I go on like this 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.490
 again about toys 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.710
 slightly healers eat goes goes go 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.710
 between 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.360
 everything 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.960
 and 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.030
 bucket set 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.909
 on the stand then there is a bath mind not 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.670
 working now for work 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:24.829
 look all work went today 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.930
 thing turiyu this wall and this wall and 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.930
 going to the next wall and so on 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.750
 and that which is such a volume of this 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.420
 walls and now they plaster behind this 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:47.650
 coil but this pipe is not the most 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.350
 uncomfortable place I got here I 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.290
 these rules passed and show how it is 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.950
 I did it as it was made like 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.330
 one option to make this turned out 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.330
 the other he himself turned out 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.849
 Well, naturally moistened bricks 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.849
 be sure to wet these 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.150
 so that the water from this solution into these 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.150
 bricks 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.520
 did not eat very fast the network will 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.000
 soak it embroidery with god you 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.000
 wrong 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.830
 this is not the remainder of the solution remained but it is necessary 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.530
 show necessarily as between 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:55.130
 It turned out can options very many 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.130
 this is also an option 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.450
 thickness 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:17.579
 the mortar on this side of this wall is very 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:20.290
 little me in the thigh look bedrock 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.199
 the solution went to this all to this 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:26.470
 here it is generally gone and here is the kind of damage 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:29.680
 it took here and a bucket on these t-shirts here 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:33.610
 look now how i was taking it 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.520
 rule here so here I am well 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.280
 as usual, this bevel goes like this 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.940
 way and I in the opposite direction and 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.950
 it turned out very cool 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:50.530
 I will add to this mine and bend it like this 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:52.860
 and go through this pipe see how 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.860
 it turned out great 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.180
 plaster turned out 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:18.690
 and constantly constantly doing dir here 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:22.870
 in any case this beast 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.270
 screw I twisted here they are not needed and 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.780
 all this is necessary to unscrew this screw 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.780
 remove from 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:41.590
 so we continue on the plant 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:45.200
 and give me here and give me quietly once 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:48.220
 can remember pass ask how beautiful 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.220
 it turns out exactly 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.060
 let's go again 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.130
 Look here I did not spend smoothly 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:06.040
 so here so of course it will be smooth and 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.370
 if we do like this then 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.370
 strider 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.400
 plaster 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.150
 such a here already 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.719
 clean this solution 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.990
 entailed look milestones belly such 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.990
 turned out and need to disassemble 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.660
 only press on the center of such a case 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:45.640
 It turns out very to do the passage 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.640
 this difficult place 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.890
 I sort of showed how I did it 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.950
 what I wanted to plaster here and 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:57.780
 plaster from this side and then 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.610
 throw over and chopsticks to drive like that 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:02.220
 by drawing on this box and on 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.740
 I got this stucco today 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:08.870
 necessarily with whom the plasterer tomorrow 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.870
 another wall sbivku this board 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:11.870
 until
