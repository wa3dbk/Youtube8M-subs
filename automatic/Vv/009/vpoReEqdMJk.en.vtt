as far as eatin wise goes now try piece
of<00:02:18.680> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.080 

so<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:34.250> think<00:02:35.250> they<00:02:35.370> might<00:02:35.520> be<00:02:35.580> better<00:02:35.940> off

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
so so I think they might be better off

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.810 
so so I think they might be better off
if<00:02:36.570> I<00:02:37.170> pick<00:02:37.380> them<00:02:37.560> before<00:02:38.130> they<00:02:38.310> get<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.670> this

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
if I pick them before they get to this

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.770 
if I pick them before they get to this
point<00:02:39.090> right<00:02:39.210> here

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
point right here

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.690 
point right here
I<00:02:39.810> believe<00:02:40.350> that<00:02:40.980> would<00:02:41.160> help<00:02:43.430> okay<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.460> went

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
I believe that would help okay I went

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
I believe that would help okay I went
back<00:02:44.820> outside<00:02:45.410> got<00:02:46.410> another<00:02:46.680> one

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
back outside got another one

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.250 
back outside got another one
got<00:02:47.520> a<00:02:47.550> smaller<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.120> right<00:02:48.180> here<00:02:48.600> we're<00:02:49.140> going

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
got a smaller one right here we're going

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.570 
got a smaller one right here we're going
to<00:02:49.320> play<00:02:49.440> around<00:02:49.650> with<00:02:49.830> this<00:02:49.980> one<00:02:50.040> too

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
to play around with this one too

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.650 
to play around with this one too
I'll<00:02:51.030> cut<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.050> see<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.160> like

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
I'll cut this and see what it's like

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.260 
I'll cut this and see what it's like
then<00:02:54.660> really<00:02:54.990> crispy<00:02:55.970> nice<00:02:56.970> firm<00:02:57.570> cucumber

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
then really crispy nice firm cucumber

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.650 
then really crispy nice firm cucumber
still<00:03:00.270> got<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> fair<00:03:00.690> amount<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:01.020> seeds<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.560> it

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.750 

and<00:03:06.660> we'll<00:03:07.500> try<00:03:07.680> to<00:03:07.740> cut<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> skin<00:03:08.340> off<00:03:08.400> this

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
and we'll try to cut the skin off this

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.920 
and we'll try to cut the skin off this
time<00:03:09.030> see<00:03:09.270> if<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.510> was<00:03:09.660> where<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
time see if that was where the

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.310 
time see if that was where the
bitterness<00:03:10.260> came<00:03:10.470> from<00:03:14.900> that's<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.020> whole<00:03:16.170> lot

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
bitterness came from that's a whole lot

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.620 
bitterness came from that's a whole lot
better<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.710> time

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
better this time

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.030 
better this time
cut<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:18.810> skin<00:03:19.140> off<00:03:21.230> and<00:03:22.230> pick<00:03:22.590> them<00:03:22.770> a<00:03:22.830> little

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
cut that skin off and pick them a little

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.110 
cut that skin off and pick them a little
bit<00:03:23.160> smaller<00:03:25.190> once<00:03:26.190> they<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:26.520> to<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:26.880> this

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
bit smaller once they get to like this

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.510 
bit smaller once they get to like this
and<00:03:27.570> then<00:03:28.050> most<00:03:28.260> cucumbers<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.310> take<00:03:29.490> a

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
and then most cucumbers and take a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.220 
and then most cucumbers and take a
cucumber<00:03:29.820> like<00:03:30.210> this<00:03:30.390> it'll<00:03:30.660> get<00:03:30.810> real<00:03:31.020> big

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
cucumber like this it'll get real big

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.440 
cucumber like this it'll get real big
and<00:03:31.440> turn<00:03:31.650> yellow<00:03:31.920> a<00:03:32.220> lot<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.940> pictures<00:03:33.330> I

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
and turn yellow a lot of the pictures I

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.380 
and turn yellow a lot of the pictures I
saw<00:03:33.660> lemon<00:03:33.990> cucumbers<00:03:34.650> show<00:03:34.890> them<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:36.000> yellow

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
saw lemon cucumbers show them as yellow

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.150 
saw lemon cucumbers show them as yellow
like<00:03:36.660> this<00:03:36.870> so<00:03:37.050> I<00:03:37.080> was<00:03:37.350> assuming<00:03:37.770> that's<00:03:37.980> when

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
like this so I was assuming that's when

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.370 
like this so I was assuming that's when
you<00:03:38.250> need<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> pick<00:03:38.700> them<00:03:38.930> but<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.990> don't<00:03:40.170> think

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
you need to pick them but I don't think

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.830 
you need to pick them but I don't think
so<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.710> there<00:03:40.860> is<00:03:41.270> something<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.420> can<00:03:42.660> use

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
so but there is something you can use

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.090 
so but there is something you can use
these<00:03:43.080> for<00:03:43.880> what<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.180> do<00:03:45.500> I'm<00:03:46.500> sure<00:03:46.560> some

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
these for what you can do I'm sure some

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.790 
these for what you can do I'm sure some
of<00:03:47.250> you<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.580> heard<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:48.090> cinnamon<00:03:48.840> cinnamon

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
of you have heard of cinnamon cinnamon

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.200 
of you have heard of cinnamon cinnamon
pickles<00:03:50.370> that<00:03:50.970> kind<00:03:51.180> of<00:03:51.240> thing<00:03:51.480> basically

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
pickles that kind of thing basically

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.110 
pickles that kind of thing basically
where<00:03:54.210> you<00:03:54.480> take<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:55.070> oversize<00:03:56.070> of<00:03:56.550> cinnamon

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
where you take the oversize of cinnamon

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.730 
where you take the oversize of cinnamon
cucumbers<00:03:57.600> where<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:57.900> take<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.110> oversized

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
cucumbers where you take the oversized

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.330 
cucumbers where you take the oversized
cucumbers<00:03:59.490> and<00:04:00.360> slice<00:04:01.290> them<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.130> big

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
cucumbers and slice them up the big

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.700 
cucumbers and slice them up the big
yellow<00:04:02.550> ones<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.090> I<00:04:04.050> believe<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.470> they<00:04:04.560> do

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
yellow ones and I believe what they do

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.660 
yellow ones and I believe what they do
is<00:04:04.860> come<00:04:05.040> along<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.610> cut<00:04:06.860> cut<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.890> inside<00:04:08.430> out

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
is come along and cut cut the inside out

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.440 
is come along and cut cut the inside out
of<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:10.220> something<00:04:11.220> like<00:04:11.340> that<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.240> make<00:04:12.420> a

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
of it something like that and make a

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.110 
of it something like that and make a
ring<00:04:12.810> might<00:04:13.440> want<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.740> peel<00:04:13.920> it<00:04:14.100> too<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:15.060> you

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
ring might want to peel it too and you

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.729 
ring might want to peel it too and you
end<00:04:15.420> up<00:04:15.570> with<00:04:15.750> rings<00:04:16.020> and<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.410> could<00:04:16.590> probably

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
end up with rings and you could probably

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.940 
end up with rings and you could probably
these<00:04:17.460> would<00:04:17.640> probably<00:04:17.670> do<00:04:18.060> good<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:19.470> fact<00:04:19.830> I'm

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
these would probably do good in fact I'm

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.420 
these would probably do good in fact I'm
pretty<00:04:19.980> shorted<00:04:20.549> with<00:04:22.070> making<00:04:23.070> cinnamon

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
much look at that the seeds aren't very

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.820 
much look at that the seeds aren't very
big<00:04:43.890> in<00:04:44.100> there

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.230 

we<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:49.070> slice<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.580> piece<00:04:49.790> off<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.150> there
