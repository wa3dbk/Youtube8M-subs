at the end so she was saying that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.490 
at the end so she was saying that
basically<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.820> should<00:01:00.270> she<00:01:00.809> should<00:01:00.840> pick<00:01:01.350> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
basically I should she should pick and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.049 
basically I should she should pick and
choose<00:01:01.770> which<00:01:02.010> ones<00:01:02.039> she<00:01:02.640> went<00:01:02.850> it's<00:01:02.969> a

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
choose which ones she went it's a

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.590 
choose which ones she went it's a
highlight<00:01:03.619> that<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> story<00:01:05.250> however<00:01:05.700> I

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
highlight that was the story however I

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.630 
highlight that was the story however I
see<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.470> she's<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:08.840> colored<00:01:10.280> some<00:01:11.280> that

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
see that she's still colored some that

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.609 
see that she's still colored some that
don't<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.090> buzz<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.080> end<00:01:13.260> she<00:01:13.560> still

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
don't have buzz at the end she still

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.300 
don't have buzz at the end she still
colored<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.970> thought<00:01:18.270> process<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:19.310> if

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
colored it so my thought process is if

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.609 
colored it so my thought process is if
you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.210> still<00:01:21.390> color<00:01:21.600> all<00:01:21.869> over<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.439> eye

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you can still color all over one eye

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.330 
you can still color all over one eye
give<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.280> what<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.549> asked<00:01:23.970> word<00:01:24.150> anyway<00:01:25.200> um<00:01:25.830> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
give me what I asked word anyway um so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.640 
give me what I asked word anyway um so
she<00:01:26.400> did<00:01:26.909> she<00:01:27.240> did<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> highlight<00:01:27.960> colors<00:01:28.350> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
she did she did the highlight colors and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.890 
she did she did the highlight colors and
I<00:01:28.770> wanted<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.299> strawberry<00:01:30.299> blonde<00:01:31.070> I<00:01:32.900> don't

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
I wanted a strawberry blonde I don't

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.569 
I wanted a strawberry blonde I don't
think<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.439> strawberry<00:01:34.890> blonde<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.400> my

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
think the strawberry blonde is my

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.270 
think the strawberry blonde is my
according<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.890> pictures<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
according to like all the pictures and

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.749 
according to like all the pictures and
things<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.360> referenced<00:01:39.689> her<00:01:40.140> too<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.700> I

things that I referenced her too but I

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.850

think she just lifted my color she

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060 
think she just lifted my color she
didn't<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.780> diet<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.380> makes<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:47.040> don't
