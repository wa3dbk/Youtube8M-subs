00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.290 

hey<00:00:01.380> guys<00:00:01.589> how<00:00:01.890> you're<00:00:02.070> not<00:00:02.220> doing<00:00:02.520> now<00:00:02.970> as

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey guys how you're not doing now as

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey guys how you're not doing now as
I've<00:00:03.720> said<00:00:03.840> before<00:00:03.899> you<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.500> my<00:00:04.650> vibe<00:00:04.890> mana

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
I've said before you know my vibe mana

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.309 
I've said before you know my vibe mana
box<00:00:05.430> amplifier<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.120> stopped<00:00:06.359> working<00:00:06.450> I've

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
box amplifier that stopped working I've

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.080 
box amplifier that stopped working I've
checked<00:00:07.649> through<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:07.980> board<00:00:08.189> forelli<00:00:08.670> to

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
checked through the board forelli to

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.220 
checked through the board forelli to
make<00:00:09.240> sure<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.540> there<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.809> no<00:00:09.960> blown

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
make sure that there was no blown

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.220 
make sure that there was no blown
resistors<00:00:10.800> blown<00:00:11.099> caps<00:00:11.429> anything<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:11.969> that

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
resistors blown caps anything like that

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.930 
resistors blown caps anything like that
what<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> didn't<00:00:13.710> check<00:00:13.889> was<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> transistors

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
what I didn't check was the transistors

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.170 
what I didn't check was the transistors
properly<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.690> what<00:00:16.590> decided<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.220> do<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.910> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
properly so what decided to do is to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060 
properly so what decided to do is to
take<00:00:18.359> off<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.350> little<00:00:19.590> clips<00:00:19.920> holding

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
take off the the little clips holding

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.120 
take off the the little clips holding
the<00:00:20.250> transistors<00:00:20.730> against<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> heatsink<00:00:21.539> and

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
the transistors against the heatsink and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.259 
the transistors against the heatsink and
got<00:00:23.130> halfway<00:00:23.369> through<00:00:23.900> and<00:00:25.880> these<00:00:26.880> will<00:00:27.119> look

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
got halfway through and these will look

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.509 
got halfway through and these will look
good<00:00:27.529> you<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.680> there's<00:00:28.859> no<00:00:28.949> problems<00:00:29.310> here

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
good you know there's no problems here

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.800 
good you know there's no problems here
I'm<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.760> getting<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> light<00:00:30.210> bit<00:00:30.449> better<00:00:30.630> on

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
I'm just getting a light bit better on

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.680 
I'm just getting a light bit better on
there<00:00:31.430> yeah<00:00:32.430> no<00:00:32.669> problems<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.120> all<00:00:33.270> these<00:00:33.510> will

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
there yeah no problems at all these will

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.490 
there yeah no problems at all these will
look<00:00:33.809> fine

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
look fine

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
look fine
yet<00:00:34.800> one<00:00:35.070> two<00:00:35.660> three<00:00:36.680> four<00:00:37.710> ah<00:00:38.059> hang<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
yet one two three four ah hang on a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.950 
yet one two three four ah hang on a
minute<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:40.200> God<00:00:40.530> on<00:00:40.559> their<00:00:41.000> looks<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.300> me<00:00:42.600> as

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
minute was God on their looks to me as

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.799 
minute was God on their looks to me as
if<00:00:43.020> we've<00:00:43.920> got<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.579> flex<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.600> here

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
if we've got some flex going on here

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.440 
if we've got some flex going on here
causing<00:00:46.350> these<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> come<00:00:47.489> unsold<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
causing these to come unsold it from the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.610 
causing these to come unsold it from the
board<00:00:49.010> they<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.840> we're<00:00:51.840> hoping<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
board they are we're hoping that this is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.080 
board they are we're hoping that this is
what's<00:00:52.980> causing<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.550> problem<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:53.969> my

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
what's causing the problem on my

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
what's causing the problem on my
amplifier<00:00:54.570> because<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:55.289> that's<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> case<00:00:56.010> all

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
amplifier because if that's the case all

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.779 
amplifier because if that's the case all
it<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> quick<00:00:57.180> Reese<00:00:57.660> older<00:00:58.140> and

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
it will be is a quick Reese older and

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.040 
it will be is a quick Reese older and
this<00:00:59.789> amp<00:01:00.000> will<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.210> back<00:01:00.420> up<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.719> running<00:01:00.809> in

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this amp will be back up and running in

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.210 
this amp will be back up and running in
no<00:01:01.410> time<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.270> anyway<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.170> D<00:01:04.559> 32

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
no time now what is this anyway is D 32

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.149 
no time now what is this anyway is D 32
on<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.400> board<00:01:05.729> let's<00:01:06.420> get<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.080> macro<00:01:07.740> going

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
on the board let's get a macro going

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.240 
on the board let's get a macro going
here<00:01:08.400> let's<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> look

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
here let's have a look

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.679 
here let's have a look
you<00:01:11.250> 15<00:01:11.850> 20<00:01:12.420> Cory<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.260> took<00:01:13.470> one<00:01:14.420> five<00:01:15.420> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you 15 20 Cory that took one five to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
you 15 20 Cory that took one five to
seven<00:01:16.170> I'm<00:01:16.530> gonna<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> part<00:01:17.790> number

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
seven I'm gonna look up that part number

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.940 
seven I'm gonna look up that part number
obviously<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.810> internet<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> also

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
obviously on the internet and also

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
obviously on the internet and also
contact<00:01:20.280> vibe<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.180> ask<00:01:21.390> them<00:01:21.630> what

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
contact vibe and just ask them what

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
contact vibe and just ask them what
would<00:01:21.930> happen<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.040> came<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.280> soldered

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
would happen if this came on soldered

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.490 
would happen if this came on soldered
would<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> cause<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.509> amplifier<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> act<00:01:25.290> how

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
would it cause the amplifier to act how

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.100 
would it cause the amplifier to act how
it<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> moment<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.689> gonna<00:01:27.900> be

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
it is at the moment now this is gonna be

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.539 
it is at the moment now this is gonna be
tricky<00:01:28.400> what<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.490> gonna<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.270> here<00:01:30.299> is

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
tricky what I'm gonna have to do here is

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:37.819 
tricky what I'm gonna have to do here is
slot<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.790> back<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.329> perfectly<00:01:36.619> right<00:01:37.619> that's

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
slot that back in perfectly right that's

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.300 
slot that back in perfectly right that's
better<00:01:38.009> no<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.420> was<00:01:39.540> solder<00:01:39.869> nine<00:01:40.049> out<00:01:40.259> well<00:01:41.250> we

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
better no it was solder nine out well we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
better no it was solder nine out well we
have<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> isn't<00:01:42.240> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> place<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
have to isn't going to have to place a

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.840 
have to isn't going to have to place a
blob<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.439> solder<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> end<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.729> this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
blob of solder on the end of this

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.480 
blob of solder on the end of this
soldering<00:01:45.479> iron<00:01:45.750> I've<00:01:46.350> had<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> extend<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
soldering iron I've had to extend the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.389 
soldering iron I've had to extend the
earth<00:01:47.579> little<00:01:48.320> spiky<00:01:49.320> bit<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.159> I'll<00:01:50.220> take

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
earth little spiky bit so I'll take

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.179 
earth little spiky bit so I'll take
longer<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.909> heat<00:01:51.119> up<00:01:51.439> and<00:01:52.439> I'm<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.890> have<00:01:52.979> to

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
longer to heat up and I'm gonna have to

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.270 
longer to heat up and I'm gonna have to
really<00:01:53.759> really<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.960> careful<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.159> don't

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
really really be careful that I don't

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.810 
really really be careful that I don't
punch<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.270> doe<00:01:57.810> burn<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.380> hole<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.040> this<00:01:59.250> cap<00:01:59.549> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
punch a doe burn a hole in this cap I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.940 
punch a doe burn a hole in this cap I
don't<00:02:00.479> damage<00:02:00.719> these<00:02:01.079> other<00:02:01.290> transistors

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
don't damage these other transistors

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
don't damage these other transistors
with<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.219> heat<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.759> think<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.719> was<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> board

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
with the heat I think that was the board

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.859 
with the heat I think that was the board
it's<00:02:05.219> going<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> be<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.420> those<00:02:06.509> things

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
it's going to be one of those things

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.669 
it's going to be one of those things
where<00:02:07.409> I'm<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:09.619> trying<00:02:10.619> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
where I'm just like trying to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.320 
where I'm just like trying to
get<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.340> time

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
get it right first time

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.450 
get it right first time
let's<00:02:13.110> bring<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> camera<00:02:13.710> back<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.100> zoom<00:02:14.280> in

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
let's bring the camera back and zoom in

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.650 
let's bring the camera back and zoom in
because<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:14.670> can't<00:02:14.880> get<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> soul<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> run<00:02:15.510> in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
because I can't get the soul to run in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.910 
because I can't get the soul to run in
there<00:02:15.840> let's<00:02:16.320> gonna<00:02:16.440> see<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.770> could

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
there let's gonna see if I could

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.830 
there let's gonna see if I could
actually<00:02:16.950> touch<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.910> terminals<00:02:18.480> with<00:02:18.690> this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
actually touch the terminals with this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.910 
actually touch the terminals with this
so<00:02:19.740> let's<00:02:19.950> go<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.550> there<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:22.260> do

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
so let's go in there I can do

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.100 
so let's go in there I can do
I<00:02:23.450> could<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.570> could<00:02:24.600> place<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> blob<00:02:25.820> there<00:02:27.110> and

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
I could I could place a blob there and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.610 
I could I could place a blob there and
that<00:02:28.560> would<00:02:28.680> seep<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.310> form<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.850> before<00:02:30.150> my<00:02:30.270> um

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
that would seep and form it before my um

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.780 
that would seep and form it before my um
seal<00:02:32.150> this<00:02:33.150> other<00:02:33.480> side<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> think<00:02:33.990> I'm<00:02:34.170> coming

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
seal this other side I think I'm coming

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.910 
seal this other side I think I'm coming
from<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.000> side<00:02:36.240> where<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.600> light<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.410> can

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
from this side where the light is I can

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.560 
from this side where the light is I can
come<00:02:38.100> in<00:02:38.220> from<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.520> angle<00:02:38.670> place<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.270> blob

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
come in from that angle place a blob

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.840 
come in from that angle place a blob
right<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:39.960> corner<00:02:40.290> there<00:02:40.520> so<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.670> one's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
right in a corner there so that one's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.180 
right in a corner there so that one's
okay<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:42.300> could<00:02:42.570> do<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.780> one<00:02:42.930> no<00:02:43.080> problem<00:02:43.230> it's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
okay I could do that one no problem it's

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.950 
okay I could do that one no problem it's
just<00:02:44.370> this<00:02:44.550> side<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.750> guys<00:02:45.900> are

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
just this side here you guys are

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.420 
just this side here you guys are
probably<00:02:46.170> thinking<00:02:46.620> why<00:02:46.770> don't<00:02:46.830> I<00:02:47.100> just<00:02:47.250> take

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
probably thinking why don't I just take

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.190 
probably thinking why don't I just take
the<00:02:47.640> board<00:02:47.910> out<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.450> heat<00:02:48.690> sink

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the board out of the heat sink

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.530 
the board out of the heat sink
I'll<00:02:49.920> tell<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.280> why<00:02:50.460> the<00:02:51.180> thing<00:02:51.360> that's

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
I'll tell you why the thing that's

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.170 
I'll tell you why the thing that's
holding<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.080> are<00:02:52.830> these<00:02:53.010> nuts<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.670> one

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
holding it on are these nuts here one

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.690 
holding it on are these nuts here one
there<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:55.290> one<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:55.560> nervously<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.550> can

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
there and one there nervously I can

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.370 
there and one there nervously I can
unscrew<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> nut<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:58.080> once<00:02:58.230> you've

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
unscrew the nut but once you've

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.620 
unscrew the nut but once you've
unscrewed<00:02:58.770> them<00:02:58.920> up<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.340> a<00:02:59.370> certain<00:02:59.610> point<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
unscrewed them up to a certain point the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.320 
unscrewed them up to a certain point the
screw<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.200> spins<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.550> hold<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.000> screw

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
screw just spins and to hold the screw

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.610 
screw just spins and to hold the screw
in<00:03:03.450> place<00:03:04.310> it's<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:06.000> there<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.170> gap<00:03:07.440> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
in place it's in there in the gap and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.010 
in place it's in there in the gap and
it's<00:03:08.310> impossible<00:03:08.660> trust<00:03:09.660> me<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> tried

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
it's impossible trust me I tried

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140 
it's impossible trust me I tried
it<00:03:10.140> with<00:03:10.200> my<00:03:10.350> old<00:03:10.500> vibe<00:03:10.770> amp<00:03:11.040> that<00:03:11.250> blew<00:03:11.430> it's

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
it with my old vibe amp that blew it's

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.060 
it with my old vibe amp that blew it's
not<00:03:12.330> gonna<00:03:12.510> happen<00:03:12.720> so<00:03:13.050> I'm<00:03:13.470> gonna<00:03:13.710> leave<00:03:13.920> it

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
not gonna happen so I'm gonna leave it

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.620 
not gonna happen so I'm gonna leave it
in<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.250> heat<00:03:14.430> sink<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.880> much<00:03:15.090> easier<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
in the heat sink it's much easier that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.050 
in the heat sink it's much easier that
way<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.800> tempted<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.580> now<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.760> know<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
way in tempted to do it now you know a

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.240 
way in tempted to do it now you know a
little<00:03:18.209> bit<00:03:18.300> late<00:03:18.570> night<00:03:18.750> of<00:03:18.900> soldering<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.950> I

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
little bit late night of soldering but I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.830 
little bit late night of soldering but I
should<00:03:20.490> probably<00:03:20.610> be<00:03:20.910> wise<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.450> wait<00:03:21.600> for<00:03:21.780> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
should probably be wise and wait for the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.210 
should probably be wise and wait for the
daylight<00:03:22.230> work<00:03:22.470> and<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.830> what<00:03:22.950> I'm<00:03:23.010> doing

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
daylight work and see what I'm doing

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.000 
daylight work and see what I'm doing
properly<00:03:24.200> man<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> just<00:03:25.500> want<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> see<00:03:25.830> if<00:03:25.890> this

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
properly man I just want to see if this

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.990 
properly man I just want to see if this
works<00:03:26.810> anyway<00:03:27.810> peace<00:03:28.680> out<00:03:28.890> guys<00:03:29.070> stay<00:03:29.760> tuned

works anyway peace out guys stay tuned
to<00:03:30.300> see<00:03:30.450> how<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.720> goes<00:03:30.990> obviously<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.070> this

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
to see how this goes obviously if this

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.760 
to see how this goes obviously if this
works<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.790> I'll<00:03:33.000> be<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.420> treat

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
works and I'll be in for a treat

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.850 
works and I'll be in for a treat
I<00:03:34.800> might<00:03:35.550> even<00:03:35.730> sell<00:03:36.240> this<00:03:36.600> amplifier<00:03:37.140> because

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
I might even sell this amplifier because

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.060 
I might even sell this amplifier because
once<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.970> has<00:03:39.180> gone<00:03:39.510> you<00:03:39.930> know<00:03:40.080> it's<00:03:40.770> not

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
once it has gone you know it's not

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.040 
once it has gone you know it's not
stable<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.670> one<00:03:41.940> ohm<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.240> don't<00:03:42.420> believe<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:42.870> a

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
stable on one ohm I don't believe it's a

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.790 
stable on one ohm I don't believe it's a
little<00:03:43.320> bit<00:03:43.500> iffy<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.490> might<00:03:44.790> sell<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.030> of

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:45.800 
little bit iffy so I might sell it of
