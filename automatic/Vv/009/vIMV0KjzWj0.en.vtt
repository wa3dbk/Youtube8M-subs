00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.170
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.910
 what is it today I hope you have 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.680
 the holidays are over well and are 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.940
 Now fit for New Year's Eve for now 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.590
 the possibility of a few cool 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.420
 to make fireworks pictures and how that 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.599
 i'll show you this in this 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.599
 Video 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 Let's get to the equipment we did 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 for that do not need so much 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.099
 I have my chaos here the months and months 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.820
 Although with the kit lens the 18 to 55 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.740
 mm 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.269
 That has me last year quite good 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.719
 services and that will be 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.850
 run this year and a tripod 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.610
 in itself, it does not matter the main thing 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.559
 Somehow underground possibility where you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 may lie down the camera where they do not 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 also blurs over a period up to 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.100
 10 20 seconds depending on how long we are 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.640
 but more about that right now 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.469
 and so we do not with this camera 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.960
 when triggered already blurred during 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.090
 we press the button there are quite 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.460
 great remote control either with cable 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.120
 or with 5 that's absolutely yours 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.219
 leave 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 Just take what is left on the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.240
 quick mr bring if so what 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.890
 not yet have and good then we have 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.100
 the part already checked off 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.049
 let's go to the settings like that 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.869
 Settings all run in manual mode 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.390
 Mode from season we turn the wheel up 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.380
 at our came on the m 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 then we have in the screen the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.710
 possibility to adjust our values ​​so 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.540
 as we need them 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 should you have any idea what 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.460
 it dazzles what is iso worth what it is 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.290
 report the video description my 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.820
 basics video and take the 15 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 minutes time and then page 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.200
 you should actually be ready to go 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.299
 we have the possibility to give up 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.740
 light umstadt it will be 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.920
 likely to be relatively dark 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 Accordingly, I go to the coop 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.799
 mode 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.600
 that means we keep on spinning for so long 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.520
 in seconds until the bult mode 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.070
 that means okay we can 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.049
 connect our remote control resp 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.520
 The camera will turn off as long as we do 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.189
 We also say that we have the countries 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.150
 the ghosts are worth divorcing 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.850
 somehow 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.090
 some say yes, no idea take one 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 worth between 7 to 16 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.280
 I tell you honestly I have in 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.530
 my camera the last year the aperture 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.820
 Hergenommen 45 and I think the 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.330
 Results are not so 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.480
 wrong 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.040
 You have to try it yourself 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.050
 if the picture should be too dark for you 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.550
 makes the aperture a bit bigger that 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.110
 means the value a little smaller 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.490
 or the other way if you like the picture too 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.840
 should be bright closes the dazzle 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.950
 a bit like the little cost 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.990
 greater the iso value we leave on 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.490
 100 to 200 by lowest at the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.260
 long-term exposure the light comes from 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:45.600
 the new year rockets round with 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.010
 sufficient for the focus or 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.770
 for the first time in the bildaufbau 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.540
 I take a wide-angled area 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.760
 that means I go to the 18 mm around so 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 As much as possible about it 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.230
 on the tripod we go to our 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:03.600
 Image stabilizer on the need me 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.790
 not on the tripod and as soon as we arrive 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.150
 Focused on getting one of our points 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.010
 we also set autofocus off 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.440
 this has the advantage that the camera 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.070
 do not try again after that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.840
 to trigger or to 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.090
 focus when we say solve now 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.380
 once we have focused once 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.459
 we behave these attitudes 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:26.519
 This also with so much to the 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.590
 Settings with the focus it is on 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 bit difficult in the dark the whole 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.190
 to focus as you wish 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.170
 so far you try the possibility 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.030
 Dwindle objectively to infinity 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.420
 ask if you can not do that because 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.190
 here no open end 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.319
 the indication on an objective or 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.130
 Something else somehow tries for so long 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.720
 to find a point 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.040
 the camera focuses so far says with 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.140
 you can live with the point and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.700
 then change the autofocus on the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.790
 manual focus then the camera is not 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.800
 again newly produced press 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.600
 we have a very simple story i have 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.459
 in my tripod and twice in construction 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.800
 the whole thing done so I pulled 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.330
 with the remote control once the rocket 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.069
 started and as soon as this 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.140
 fireball was with potentially greatest 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.880
 I stopped recording the whole thing 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.470
 can then take between three seconds 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.209
 up to seven seconds after we 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.750
 today and there the picture too bright or too 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.069
 dark 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.400
 then you have to over the blind 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.200
 I think that's it again 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.700
 as far as I wish you much fun 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.430
 keep your fingers crossed and hope 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.690
 have a reasonable result about you 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.130
 a happy new year and a happy new year 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.130
 fish what we see each other again
