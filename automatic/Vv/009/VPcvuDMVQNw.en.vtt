00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:10.170
 Hello everyone on the channel you vileyka 

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:12.300
 Today, such a small video review of the case 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 ago got all the DVR 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.570
 prestige road run 315 in English not 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.329
 strong so sorry maybe the name 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.329
 wrongly considered shorter than it looks 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.340
 bullshit from big 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.340
 with a capital letter x approximately like this 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:47.789
 even seen me a little bit was on in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:57.890
 bundled with such a cord is enough 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:57.890
 long less everywhere well and sucker clip 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.400
 well what can i tell you on this positive 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.619
 moments end begin 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.720
 horseradish moment is what's on the site 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.670
 the manufacturer was declared the same 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.020
 picture quality on the level there 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.149
 blah blah blah poplars all good i took 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.890
 navigator just hopefully 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.409
 navigator registrar with the hope 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.869
 that at least he will read the numbers so 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:32.189
 is an infection in the state of 5 meters and a number 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.869
 can not recognize normally the picture 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.320
 constantly beach well actually now 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:44.539
 I'll run a picture that he takes 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:48.020
 stated that shooting with full hd resolution 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:52.159
 get this to the horns and hooves left 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 the grain is that mother dear 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:02:01.010
 color walks in different directions such 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.220
 This g-sensor does not plow at all 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.720
 hickey went to the manufacturer's website 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.190
 prestige point ru 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.510
 in the support section I chose this model 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.300
 looked lies 31 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.630
 firmware on it there on it immediately flooded 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.420
 30 but all as the instructions said flooded 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.010
 this flash card firmware has pressed the button 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.990
 Inclusion in the instructions says that 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.370
 the download will automatically end up 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.350
 bolt and so are you just so damn it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.690
 that is, there is no new 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:42.290
 Horseradish is not present on this spat again and again 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.330

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.710

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.610

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.180
