00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
to have to be more careful with a wooden

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.930 
to have to be more careful with a wooden
countertop<00:00:37.559> it's<00:00:38.070> not<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:38.789> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
countertop it's not going to take the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.729 
countertop it's not going to take the
abuse<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.899> some<00:00:40.379> countertops<00:00:41.010> will<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:42.210> the

abuse that some countertops will now the

abuse that some countertops will now the
problem<00:00:43.739> area<00:00:44.039> that<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:44.249> have<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.820> my<00:00:45.030> wooden

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
problem area that I have with my wooden

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.200 
problem area that I have with my wooden
countertop<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.429> we<00:00:47.429> chose<00:00:47.699> to<00:00:47.909> use<00:00:47.940> an

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
countertop is we chose to use an

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.619 
countertop is we chose to use an
undermount<00:00:48.659> sink<00:00:49.109> and<00:00:50.120> the<00:00:51.120> reason<00:00:51.390> why<00:00:51.480> we

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
undermount sink and the reason why we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.389 
undermount sink and the reason why we
did<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.839> is<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.319> like<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> idea<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.980> sweeping

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
did that is we like the idea of sweeping

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.829 
did that is we like the idea of sweeping
everything<00:00:53.640> off<00:00:53.909> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.089> countertops<00:00:54.569> and

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
everything off of the countertops and

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.959 
everything off of the countertops and
into<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.170> sink<00:00:55.409> without<00:00:56.129> having<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.699> over

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
into the sink without having to go over

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.270 
into the sink without having to go over
the<00:00:57.089> lip<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.539> sink<00:00:57.929> but<00:00:58.589> the<00:00:58.710> problem<00:00:59.129> with

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the lip of the sink but the problem with

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.969 
the lip of the sink but the problem with
that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.640> when<00:01:00.089> you're<00:01:00.269> washing<00:01:00.620> large<00:01:01.620> and

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
that is when you're washing large and

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.570 
that is when you're washing large and
heavy<00:01:02.129> pots<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.819> pans<00:01:03.830> we<00:01:04.830> try<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.280> but

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
heavy pots and pans we try not to but

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.480 
heavy pots and pans we try not to but
you<00:01:05.700> tend<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> ding<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.049> sides<00:01:07.649> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.219> wooden

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
you tend to ding the sides of the wooden

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.649 
you tend to ding the sides of the wooden
countertop<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:10.110> now<00:01:10.290> you've<00:01:10.530> cracked<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
countertop and so now you've cracked the

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
countertop and so now you've cracked the
the<00:01:12.659> finish<00:01:13.079> and<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> water<00:01:14.430> there

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
the finish and you have the water there

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.010 
the finish and you have the water there
so<00:01:14.939> water<00:01:15.180> can<00:01:15.329> get<00:01:15.479> into<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> wood<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
so water can get into the wood and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.889 
so water can get into the wood and
periodically<00:01:16.829> I<00:01:17.130> kind<00:01:17.969> of<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.329> around<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.869> a

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
periodically I kind of go around with a

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:20.959 
periodically I kind of go around with a
little<00:01:19.110> artist<00:01:19.619> brush<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.700> some

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
little artist brush with some

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.899 
little artist brush with some
polyurethane<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.840> it<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.229> just<00:01:23.159> dab<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.880> little

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
polyurethane on it and just dab a little

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.929 
polyurethane on it and just dab a little
polyurethane<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:24.960> there<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:26.039> still<00:01:26.670> looks

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
polyurethane in there and it still looks

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.740 
polyurethane in there and it still looks
good<00:01:27.149> and<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.509> guess<00:01:27.890> another<00:01:28.890> Pro<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:30.000> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
good and I guess another Pro is you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.270 
good and I guess another Pro is you
could<00:01:30.930> always<00:01:31.079> take<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> countertop

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
could always take the countertop

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.170 
could always take the countertop
and<00:01:32.759> refinish<00:01:33.719> it<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:34.380> far<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.829> woods<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.520> likes

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and refinish it as far as woods I likes

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
and refinish it as far as woods I likes
appealing<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> wooden<00:01:37.380> countertop<00:01:37.590> and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
appealing for a wooden countertop and

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
appealing for a wooden countertop and
the<00:01:38.640> reason<00:01:38.880> for<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.750> very

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
the reason for that is it's a very

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.889 
the reason for that is it's a very
stable<00:01:40.229> wood<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.890> dense<00:01:41.219> wood<00:01:41.579> it's<00:01:41.899> easy

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
stable wood it's a dense wood it's easy

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
stable wood it's a dense wood it's easy
to<00:01:43.170> work<00:01:43.350> with<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.340> beautiful<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to work with and it's beautiful now I

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.749 
to work with and it's beautiful now I
would<00:01:45.960> definitely<00:01:46.350> stay<00:01:46.560> away<00:01:46.590> from<00:01:46.859> a<00:01:47.250> softer

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
would definitely stay away from a softer

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.760 
would definitely stay away from a softer
wood<00:01:48.000> like<00:01:48.539> a<00:01:48.570> pine<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:50.719> Douglas<00:01:51.719> fir<00:01:51.869> some

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
wood like a pine or a Douglas fir some

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.099 
wood like a pine or a Douglas fir some
people<00:01:53.159> will<00:01:53.609> talk<00:01:53.789> about<00:01:53.850> using<00:01:54.299> oak<00:01:54.630> for

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
people will talk about using oak for

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.289 
people will talk about using oak for
countertops<00:01:55.679> I<00:01:55.950> tend<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.340> not<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.609> the<00:01:57.060> deep

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
countertops I tend to not like the deep

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.760 
countertops I tend to not like the deep
grain<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.159> oak<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.850> oak<00:02:00.749> has<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> tendency

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
grain in oak and also oak has a tendency

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.880 
grain in oak and also oak has a tendency
to<00:02:01.890> turn<00:02:02.100> black<00:02:02.429> when<00:02:02.729> water<00:02:03.420> when<00:02:04.049> water<00:02:04.799> hits

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
to turn black when water when water hits

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.940 
to turn black when water when water hits
in<00:02:05.249> is<00:02:05.429> left<00:02:05.670> there<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> while<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.829> me

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
in is left there for a while so for me

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.089 
in is left there for a while so for me
it<00:02:08.100> was<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.910> just<00:02:09.810> think<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.470> appeal<00:02:10.950> is

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
it was just I just think that appeal is

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.480 
it was just I just think that appeal is
just<00:02:11.280> very<00:02:11.400> user<00:02:11.819> friendly

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
just very user friendly

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.130 
just very user friendly
looks<00:02:12.700> beautiful<00:02:13.210> in<00:02:13.270> your<00:02:13.300> you're<00:02:13.930> less

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
looks beautiful in your you're less

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.160 
looks beautiful in your you're less
likely<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:15.310> any<00:02:15.670> problems<00:02:16.240> with<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.480> for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
likely to have any problems with it for

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.450 
likely to have any problems with it for
finishing<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.650> countertop

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
finishing a countertop

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.700 
finishing a countertop
I<00:02:18.490> like<00:02:19.210> polyurethane<00:02:20.050> oil-based

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
I like polyurethane oil-based

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.730 
I like polyurethane oil-based
polyurethane<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.990> reason<00:02:23.290> for<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.470> is

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
polyurethane and the reason for that is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.980 
polyurethane and the reason for that is
it's<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.160> very<00:02:24.550> easy<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:25.000> use<00:02:25.240> it's<00:02:25.540> easy<00:02:25.690> to

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
it's just very easy to use it's easy to

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.530 
it's just very easy to use it's easy to
apply<00:02:26.260> most<00:02:26.620> people<00:02:26.890> can<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.240> it's

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
apply most people can do that and it's

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.930 
apply most people can do that and it's
strong<00:02:28.900> my<00:02:29.290> my<00:02:29.800> feeling<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.370> if<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:30.760> good

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
strong my my feeling is if it's good

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.360 
strong my my feeling is if it's good
enough<00:02:30.970> for<00:02:31.210> floor<00:02:32.080> or<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:33.040> strong<00:02:33.340> enough

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
enough for floor or it's strong enough

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.370 
enough for floor or it's strong enough
for<00:02:33.610> floor<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.240> going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.750> strong<00:02:35.170> enough

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
for floor it's going to be strong enough

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.040 
for floor it's going to be strong enough
for<00:02:35.650> my<00:02:35.920> countertop<00:02:36.550> now<00:02:37.300> there<00:02:37.660> are<00:02:37.810> people

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
for my countertop now there are people

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.410 
for my countertop now there are people
who<00:02:38.350> use<00:02:38.590> epoxy<00:02:39.190> finishes<00:02:39.940> and<00:02:40.150> maybe<00:02:40.300> you

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
who use epoxy finishes and maybe you

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.170 
who use epoxy finishes and maybe you
could<00:02:40.540> use<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.720> an<00:02:41.080> epoxy<00:02:41.500> finish<00:02:41.950> on<00:02:42.160> a<00:02:42.220> softer

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
could use a an epoxy finish on a softer

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.660 
could use a an epoxy finish on a softer
wood<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> pine<00:02:43.900> or<00:02:44.200> Douglas<00:02:45.160> fir<00:02:45.400> maybe

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
wood like a pine or Douglas fir maybe

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.910 
wood like a pine or Douglas fir maybe
that<00:02:45.850> would<00:02:46.000> help<00:02:46.150> but<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.110> don't<00:02:47.290> know<00:02:47.680> that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
that would help but I don't know that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.780 
that would help but I don't know that
much<00:02:48.130> about<00:02:48.190> using<00:02:49.030> epoxy<00:02:49.750> finishes<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:50.830> so<00:02:51.730> I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
much about using epoxy finishes so so I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.640 
much about using epoxy finishes so so I
really<00:02:52.030> can't<00:02:52.210> talk<00:02:52.390> about<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:53.020> think<00:02:53.440> the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
really can't talk about it I think the

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.010 
really can't talk about it I think the
best<00:02:53.890> place<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.220> use<00:02:54.430> wooden<00:02:55.300> countertop<00:02:55.570> is

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
best place to use wooden countertop is

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.440 
best place to use wooden countertop is
when<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.440> galley<00:02:56.800> kitchen<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.520> an

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
when you have a galley kitchen or an

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.570 
when you have a galley kitchen or an
island<00:02:58.720> meaning<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.350> straight<00:02:59.620> run<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.160> that's

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
island meaning a straight run and that's

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.450 
island meaning a straight run and that's
because<00:03:00.970> I'm<00:03:01.210> a<00:03:01.270> little<00:03:01.780> concerned<00:03:01.960> about<00:03:02.530> the

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
because I'm a little concerned about the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.060 
because I'm a little concerned about the
inside<00:03:03.880> corners<00:03:04.480> whether<00:03:05.020> that's<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.590> butt

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
inside corners whether that's a butt

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.250 
inside corners whether that's a butt
joint<00:03:06.100> or<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.640> miter<00:03:07.180> joint<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.780> that's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
joint or a miter joint and that's

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
joint or a miter joint and that's
because<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:08.680> expansion<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.280> contraction<00:03:09.520> now

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
because of expansion and contraction now

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.840 
because of expansion and contraction now
that<00:03:10.720> being<00:03:10.930> said<00:03:11.200> my<00:03:11.410> brother<00:03:11.710> who<00:03:12.040> almost

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
that being said my brother who almost

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.240 
that being said my brother who almost
finished<00:03:13.150> buildings<00:03:13.540> modular<00:03:14.110> house<00:03:14.290> has<00:03:14.980> got

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
finished buildings modular house has got

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.590 
finished buildings modular house has got
wooden<00:03:15.610> countertops<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.270> they<00:03:16.330> were<00:03:16.420> just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
wooden countertops and they were just

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.330 
wooden countertops and they were just
installed<00:03:16.990> the<00:03:17.110> other<00:03:17.230> day<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:18.010> he's<00:03:18.160> got<00:03:18.310> a

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
installed the other day and he's got a

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.600 
installed the other day and he's got a
big<00:03:18.700> inside<00:03:19.300> miter<00:03:19.720> joint<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:21.220> we'll<00:03:21.400> see

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
big inside miter joint and so we'll see

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.570 
big inside miter joint and so we'll see
how<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.850> holds<00:03:22.240> up<00:03:22.690> now<00:03:22.960> I<00:03:23.170> was<00:03:24.160> wondering

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
how that holds up now I was wondering

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.130 
how that holds up now I was wondering
how<00:03:24.700> they<00:03:24.880> were<00:03:24.910> going<00:03:25.240> to<00:03:25.390> join<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:25.840> counter

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
how they were going to join the counter

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.780 
how they were going to join the counter
what<00:03:26.290> they<00:03:26.410> ended<00:03:26.590> up<00:03:26.710> using<00:03:26.770> were<00:03:27.340> pocket

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
what they ended up using were pocket

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.030 
what they ended up using were pocket
hole<00:03:27.940> screws<00:03:28.050> so<00:03:29.050> they've<00:03:29.470> got<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.710> lot<00:03:30.010> of

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
hole screws so they've got a lot of

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.440 
hole screws so they've got a lot of
screws<00:03:30.400> in<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.670> I'm<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:30.910> sure<00:03:31.030> what<00:03:31.180> kind<00:03:31.240> of

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
screws in that I'm not sure what kind of

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.990 
screws in that I'm not sure what kind of
glue<00:03:31.720> they<00:03:31.960> use<00:03:31.990> but<00:03:32.890> again<00:03:33.580> it's<00:03:33.820> one<00:03:33.880> of

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
glue they use but again it's one of

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400 
glue they use but again it's one of
those<00:03:34.150> things<00:03:34.360> were<00:03:34.480> Time<00:03:34.690> hotel<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.380> just

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
those things were Time hotel and just

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.440 
those things were Time hotel and just

looking through the comments maple would

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.940 
looking through the comments maple would
be<00:03:37.600> a<00:03:37.630> good<00:03:37.870> choice<00:03:38.080> for<00:03:38.140> a<00:03:38.470> wooden<00:03:38.770> countertop

professional painter and he suggested

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.860 
professional painter and he suggested
that<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.490> won't<00:04:00.820> be<00:04:00.970> able<00:04:01.060> to<00:04:01.150> get<00:04:01.300> the<00:04:01.420> build<00:04:01.690> up

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
that I won't be able to get the build up

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.930 
that I won't be able to get the build up
using<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.290> wipe-on<00:04:02.650> poly<00:04:02.710> and<00:04:03.520> after

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
using the wipe-on poly and after

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.550 
using the wipe-on poly and after
sleeping<00:04:04.360> on<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.510> thought<00:04:04.870> yeah<00:04:05.020> he's<00:04:05.320> probably

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
sleeping on I thought yeah he's probably

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.270 
sleeping on I thought yeah he's probably
right<00:04:06.100> so<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.420> ended<00:04:07.810> up<00:04:07.990> lightly<00:04:08.620> sanding<00:04:09.070> the

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
right so I ended up lightly sanding the

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.000 
right so I ended up lightly sanding the
first<00:04:09.640> coat<00:04:10.000> of<00:04:10.030> wipe-on<00:04:10.630> poly<00:04:10.690> I've<00:04:11.320> applied

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
first coat of wipe-on poly I've applied

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.920 
first coat of wipe-on poly I've applied
two<00:04:12.340> coats<00:04:12.370> of<00:04:12.820> regular<00:04:13.270> oil-based

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
two coats of regular oil-based

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.640 
two coats of regular oil-based
polyurethane<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:15.070> now<00:04:16.000> I'm<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.690> apply

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
polyurethane and now I'm going to apply

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.830

two<00:04:17.770> coats<00:04:18.070> of<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.760> wipe-on<00:04:19.150> poly<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.750> I

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
two coats of the wipe-on poly and I

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.680 
two coats of the wipe-on poly and I
think<00:04:20.080> that<00:04:20.170> that<00:04:20.350> should<00:04:20.620> work<00:04:21.630> hopefully<00:04:22.630> I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
think that that should work hopefully I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.470 
think that that should work hopefully I
won't<00:04:22.840> have<00:04:22.990> any

Hayes<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.640> he<00:04:35.060> had<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> question<00:04:35.420> about<00:04:35.720> a

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
Hayes and he had a question about a

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.910 
Hayes and he had a question about a
countertop<00:04:37.610> for<00:04:37.940> his<00:04:38.150> Island<00:04:38.570> and<00:04:38.990> basically

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
countertop for his Island and basically

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.420 
countertop for his Island and basically
the<00:04:40.450> problem<00:04:41.450> that<00:04:41.810> he's<00:04:41.930> having<00:04:42.140> is<00:04:42.530> he<00:04:43.130> wants

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
the problem that he's having is he wants

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.490 
the problem that he's having is he wants
to<00:04:43.520> use<00:04:43.670> wormy<00:04:44.240> chestnut<00:04:44.270> which<00:04:45.050> I<00:04:45.170> don't<00:04:45.380> know

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
to use wormy chestnut which I don't know

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.190 
to use wormy chestnut which I don't know
much<00:04:45.770> about<00:04:45.940> but<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.240> problem<00:04:47.900> is<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.110> the

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
much about but the problem is that the

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.810 
much about but the problem is that the
material<00:04:48.620> is<00:04:48.710> only<00:04:48.830> 3/4<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.430> an<00:04:49.580> inch<00:04:49.670> thick

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
material is only 3/4 of an inch thick

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.770 
material is only 3/4 of an inch thick
and<00:04:50.300> so<00:04:51.110> how<00:04:51.740> can<00:04:51.770> he<00:04:52.400> gain<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.180> little<00:04:53.420> height

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
and so how can he gain a little height

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.570 
and so how can he gain a little height
to<00:04:54.170> his<00:04:54.350> countertop<00:04:54.920> because<00:04:55.040> he<00:04:55.280> happens<00:04:55.550> to

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
to his countertop because he happens to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.080 
to his countertop because he happens to
be<00:04:55.730> very<00:04:55.850> tall<00:04:56.180> so<00:04:56.870> my<00:04:57.110> suggestion<00:04:57.560> is<00:04:58.090> first

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
be very tall so my suggestion is first

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.440 
be very tall so my suggestion is first
use<00:04:59.660> a<00:04:59.690> piece<00:05:00.140> of<00:05:00.260> 3/4<00:05:00.740> inch<00:05:00.770> plywood<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.670> band

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
use a piece of 3/4 inch plywood and band

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.540 
use a piece of 3/4 inch plywood and band
the<00:05:02.630> edge<00:05:02.810> with<00:05:03.350> you'll<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.340> make<00:05:04.490> some

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
the edge with you'll have to make some

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.160 
the edge with you'll have to make some
molding<00:05:05.120> with<00:05:05.330> your<00:05:05.450> table<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:05.870> I'd<00:05:05.960> have<00:05:06.080> to

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
molding with your table so I'd have to

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.620 
molding with your table so I'd have to
cut<00:05:06.410> some<00:05:06.560> strips<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.100> you<00:05:07.160> can<00:05:07.850> bend<00:05:08.120> the

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
cut some strips and you can bend the

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.180 
cut some strips and you can bend the
edge<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.050> finish<00:05:09.410> that<00:05:09.620> you<00:05:09.800> want<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:10.040> finish

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
edge and finish that you want to finish

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.640 
edge and finish that you want to finish
the<00:05:10.400> top<00:05:10.640> of<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:11.150> then<00:05:11.660> cut<00:05:11.990> some<00:05:12.020> slotted

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
the top of it and then cut some slotted

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.670 
the top of it and then cut some slotted
holes<00:05:12.890> so<00:05:13.610> you<00:05:13.730> can<00:05:14.090> attach<00:05:14.630> the<00:05:15.110> counter<00:05:15.470> top

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
holes so you can attach the counter top

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.220 
holes so you can attach the counter top
to<00:05:15.710> the<00:05:16.040> plywood<00:05:16.310> with<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.300> washer<00:05:17.900> that<00:05:18.050> way

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
to the plywood with a washer that way

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.720 
to the plywood with a washer that way
the<00:05:18.380> countertop<00:05:18.860> can<00:05:19.100> expand<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.670> contract

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
the countertop can expand and contract

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.440 
the countertop can expand and contract
and<00:05:20.390> then<00:05:21.140> you<00:05:21.530> can<00:05:21.830> attach<00:05:22.130> your<00:05:22.670> countertop

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
and then you can attach your countertop

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.640 
and then you can attach your countertop
on<00:05:23.720> top<00:05:24.440> of<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.680> plywood<00:05:24.950> with<00:05:25.910> maybe<00:05:26.590> 3/4<00:05:27.590> of
