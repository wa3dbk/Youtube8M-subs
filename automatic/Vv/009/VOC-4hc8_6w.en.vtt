00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.860
 in 1957 my parents went to this 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.810
 Eastern 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.460
 You could have gone then a suit 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.160
 company 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:27.180
 a new style was built at the time and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.650
 Now we are already well 31 years later 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.950
 and we have world new 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.800
 and we have new construction 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 at this location that is in 1991 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.940
 purchased and built a new style 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.020
 according to the most modern guidelines 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.790
 so we built according to that 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.000
 yardstick sustainable livestock farming 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:53.620
 and that means well the floor 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.990
 in our case, low-emission is applied 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.829
 we have chosen the key one 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.260
 on the floor and the stitches 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.519
 we have a field of animal feed there 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.100
 inlaid 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.720
 for a reason we don't have one 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.590
 raise we keep the floor there 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.470
 ground floor would hold the stables 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.220
 are equipped with bowl mattresses and 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.220
 knee boom tube 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.590
 the roof is insulated have the company 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.520
 is energy neutral 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.670
 so we have a lot of roof we have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.119
 87,000 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 lie and kilowatt than solar 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.549
 so we still have the pasture cake 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.039
 it is therefore a mixture of and everywhere 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:45.100
 60 solid percentages of prawns with cows 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:46.509
 20 30% is still spot fly and there is one 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.780
 another single black and white a montebi year 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.659
 so between those who could now go to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.640
 eight and a half thousand bitter and that will 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.490
 with this col 1 2 3 if not succeed 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.259
 so we will do that for the whole 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.209
 theme, but also the course 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.490
 alive breeding policy there will surely be 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:06.840
 more milk bulls albin over the drugs 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.840
 highest sector pets 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.070
 production was under the circumstances 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.260
 shall we farmers 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.130
 yes round 7 thousand and so it fluctuated 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.870
 sometimes back and forth 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.870
 because yes we do these whims happen 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.560
 yes the code mar dur we make that no 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.150
 problem of if those refrigerators are in it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.590
 remain roughly the same as we are 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.240
 that ten or fifteen good ones may or 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.070
 20 that was not such a problem but that 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.020
 the one to the hundreds of wells and then some 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:35.190
 a little more work now that the royal family is gone 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.590
 or anyway other than have to draw one 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.240
 steel standard relatively expensive 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.410
 we will tell you more every box that too 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.590
 in the chest mouth of nine thousand liters 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.690
 Well now we are 5 so we 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.290
 still have a way to go 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.820
 so yes we have been good at that in 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.630
 manager of other super and 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.670
 circumstances with a sober cookie and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.140
 now go that day of that sober course 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 judges all converted to a milk 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.790
 more productive cool is also a must 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.290
 different 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.660
 we are planning to act a number 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.820
 hiring knowledge to us in it 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.170
 a bit to guide because yes then 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.540
 also if someone is an us euro we are 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.280
 of this you are completely wrong and this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.610
 must be slightly different because otherwise it will be 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.610
 never what
