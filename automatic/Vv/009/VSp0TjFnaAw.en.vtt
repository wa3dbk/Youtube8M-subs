00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
in the right light you'll see that I

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.820 
in the right light you'll see that I
drill<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.180> hole<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.479> squared<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.560> there

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
too and then I cut along here so that I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
too and then I cut along here so that I
could<00:01:31.680> pull<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> battery<00:01:32.520> cover<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:33.350> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
could pull the battery cover off the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
could pull the battery cover off the
next<00:01:34.710> thing<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.040> did<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:36.710> pried<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.009> top<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
ring off and that was a pain in the butt

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.310 
ring off and that was a pain in the butt
to<00:01:42.930> do<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.890> fortunately<00:01:44.490> votes<00:01:45.329> X<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> O<00:01:45.899> 7

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.850 
it down so I mean then the slider is
permanently<00:02:09.479> glued<00:02:09.929> on<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.700

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
the pendant as you can see I glued the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.170 
the pendant as you can see I glued the
UV<00:02:25.520> nib<00:02:26.200> mainly<00:02:27.200> because<00:02:27.350> I<00:02:27.890> was<00:02:28.370> never<00:02:28.940> going

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
UV nib mainly because I was never going

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.760 
UV nib mainly because I was never going
to<00:02:29.240> use<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:29.630> plus<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.990> dried<00:02:30.260> out<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.590> me

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
to use it and plus it dried out on me

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.920 
to use it and plus it dried out on me
and<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.610> was<00:02:31.970> drying<00:02:32.240> out<00:02:32.360> when<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.570> got<00:02:32.900> it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
and when I was drying out when I got it

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.550
