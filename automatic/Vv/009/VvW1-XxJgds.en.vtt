00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
bring it a little bit lower I think you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.420 
bring it a little bit lower I think you
see<00:02:23.260> with<00:02:24.840> bring<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.960> into<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.320> match<00:02:26.530> gradual

Mike instead of just knocking it out in
there<00:02:30.209> that's<00:02:31.209> always<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> risk<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:32.050> take<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
there that's always the risk we take a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.500 
there that's always the risk we take a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
the side to side on it you're gonna

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000 
the side to side on it you're gonna
agree<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.690> hit<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> dead<00:02:44.080> in<00:02:44.230> line<00:02:44.440> but<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.800> want

agree to hit a dead in line but you want
to<00:02:45.100> but<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.820> elevation<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.450> always<00:02:46.690> always<00:02:47.140> a

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to but the elevation is always always a

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.860 
to but the elevation is always always a
mystery<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.770> a<00:02:47.860> slingshot<00:02:48.630> let's<00:02:49.630> see<00:02:49.750> if<00:02:49.810> we

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
mystery with a slingshot let's see if we

00:02:49.870 --> 00:03:14.410 
mystery with a slingshot let's see if we
can<00:02:49.959> get<00:02:50.080> that<00:02:50.230> get<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.680> down

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.350 

still<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> little<00:03:15.569> bit<00:03:15.719> too<00:03:15.749> much

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
still a little bit too much

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.770 
still a little bit too much
elevation<00:03:18.360> is<00:03:18.510> a<00:03:18.570> little<00:03:18.930> off<00:03:19.020> there<00:03:19.290> i<00:03:20.390> lo<00:03:21.390> I

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
elevation is a little off there i lo I

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.660 
elevation is a little off there i lo I
thought<00:03:22.410> I'd<00:03:22.530> magically<00:03:22.950> bring<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.310> into<00:03:23.460> it

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
thought I'd magically bring it into it

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:32.240 
thought I'd magically bring it into it
again<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.120> hit<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.780> again<00:03:27.980> need<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:31.040> just<00:03:32.040> name

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
again but hit it again need to just name

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.000 
again but hit it again need to just name
a<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.760> bit<00:03:36.440> see<00:03:37.440> if<00:03:37.470> we<00:03:37.590> can<00:03:37.770> make<00:03:37.890> this

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
a little bit see if we can make this

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:55.550 
a little bit see if we can make this
happen

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:03.650 

that's<00:03:56.310> not<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.760> right<00:03:56.910> elevation

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.360 

light
