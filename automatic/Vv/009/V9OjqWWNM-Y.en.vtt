00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.510
 I have missed it fields I am here in Hanover at the Walloon 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.840
 Irish church 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.680
 for his Calvinistic church which proclaimed a great deal of importance to that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.140
 However, the word in the sermon also lives on church music 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.370
 and therefore 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 Moritz 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.450
 But the situation was that here was an organ that was almost 50 years old 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.400
 was 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.810
 that's the style that had come and wont between the years 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.220
 had to repair an empty box was no longer properly illuminated 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.000
 and then thought of the Ruhr if we also wanted to expand the organ 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
 Wear 20 registers 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.960
 the for a today's service with different possibilities 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 I was so good 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.240
 our requests were that we have different services as well 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.390
 different sound can not complain that we are so with Dieter Thiel 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.820
 Have services and solemn services 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.610
 that we seemed with it but moods also make evening areas 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.880
 They can be made as they are 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 if the Anglican church 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.109
 and that we can offer an organ especially for a concert 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:12.739
 Dr the different there possibilities for the organists 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.319

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:16.779
 Dr the church 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:18.669
 that's how the old time became 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:19.859
 hold there 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.989
 in their process and condition but also to build new ones 

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:31.509
 the possibility of authenticity was still to play as it did 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:34.869
 originally was also hits by the new Fehmer new game table 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.649
 Of course, the possibility the 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:41.879
 m 9 digital times to combine with the old organ 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.799
 that's the exciting thing about it 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.799

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.430
