fast at the point at the information
that<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:22.580> are<00:01:22.610> looking<00:01:22.820> for<00:01:25.930> Tempe<00:01:26.930> is<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.770> very

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
that you are looking for Tempe is a very

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.390 
that you are looking for Tempe is a very
useful<00:01:28.600> temperature<00:01:29.600> sensor<00:01:30.080> because<00:01:30.950> can<00:01:31.250> be

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
useful temperature sensor because can be

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.560 
useful temperature sensor because can be
placed<00:01:32.200> externally<00:01:33.200> not<00:01:33.970> close<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.000> my<00:01:35.330> body

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
placed externally not close to my body

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.900 
placed externally not close to my body
like<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.050> was<00:01:36.230> previously<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:37.370> example<00:01:37.760> when

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
like it was previously for example when

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.060 
like it was previously for example when
I<00:01:37.940> am<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.480> to<00:01:38.720> ice<00:01:38.900> climb<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:39.590> is<00:01:39.740> very

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
I am going to ice climb that is very

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.950 
I am going to ice climb that is very
important<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.760> know<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.000> external

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
important to know the external

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.980 
important to know the external
temperature<00:01:42.140> in<00:01:42.830> relating<00:01:43.550> it<00:01:43.730> to<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
temperature in relating it to the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.100 
temperature in relating it to the
potential<00:01:45.770> quality<00:01:46.580> of<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.390> eyes<00:01:47.540> that<00:01:47.930> I'm

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
potential quality of the eyes that I'm

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.100 
potential quality of the eyes that I'm
climbing<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:49.460> when<00:01:49.730> I<00:01:49.760> watch<00:01:50.060> Tempe<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.750> know

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
climbing on so when I watch Tempe I know

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.230 
climbing on so when I watch Tempe I know
exactly<00:01:51.530> which<00:01:52.130> is<00:01:52.370> the<00:01:52.490> temperature<00:01:52.670> and

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
exactly which is the temperature and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.210 
exactly which is the temperature and
they<00:01:53.480> can<00:01:53.780> monitor<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.350> also<00:01:54.800> while<00:01:54.980> I'm

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
they can monitor it also while I'm

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.340 
they can monitor it also while I'm
climbing<00:01:55.520> because<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.330> fix<00:01:56.570> it<00:01:56.690> for<00:01:56.930> example<00:01:57.140> on

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
climbing because I fix it for example on

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.430 
climbing because I fix it for example on
the<00:01:57.530> shoulder<00:01:57.920> on<00:01:58.160> my<00:01:58.580> pecs<00:01:58.910> and<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.960> is<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
the shoulder on my pecs and this is the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.680 
the shoulder on my pecs and this is the

the mapping of all the waypoints of the
different<00:03:16.870> days<00:03:17.230> or<00:03:17.650> different<00:03:18.220> rescues<00:03:18.670> that

I'm performing and this is creating like

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.550 
I'm performing and this is creating like

a database that will be helpful for the
