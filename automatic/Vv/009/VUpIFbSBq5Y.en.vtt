00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.890
 the first service should first be 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.019
 executed 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.820
 on the right side of the court. 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.570
 punch 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.390
 has two chances of serve 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.740
 wrong the first can get the second 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.150
 the ball after the serve should only dribble 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.470
 once on the ground or none can beat 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.059
 At first what can not happen is 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:42.180
 give two drops as in this case in the serve 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:45.540
 the ball must pass over the net and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.100
 dribble in the serving area on the court 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.890
 always on the opposite side if you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 the right bag was dripping to the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.949
 left side if you analyze 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.730
 pinga left 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.730
 on the right side 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:09.439
 the game gets 15 to 0 for the player said 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.509
 that 15 to zero the site wants to be realized 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.689
 on the left side 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:18.350
 How the ball did not go the other way. 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:24.049
 30 0 for the player above the serve in 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.960
 30 0 should be performed on the right side 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.350
 on counting points during the game 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.770
 we must always tell the point first 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.240
 who is taking after who is 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.039
 receiving for example that 15 to zero are 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.929
 that was the year that made the point 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:46.149
 of 10 15 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:50.450
 if who is receiving that made the point 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.520
 on the ball exchange once again the player 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.799
 from below he could not pass the ball through 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.580
 on the other side of the court so play 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:01.610
 40 to 0 how to hit the ball as if 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.649
 position on the court with 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.680
 racket 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:10.399
 that's all we'll see more ahead 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:14.750
 of the most advanced classes finalized 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.209
 tennis is a complex sport both for 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.320
 count the points as much as for this 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.340
 game 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.709
 so if you have any questions 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.510
 who lived in the comments page 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.810
 of this channel I would make a video 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.079
 specifically to clarify its 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.079
 doubt 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.950
 For today, it's only next week. 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.750
 we will see an example of a game in which 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.750
 stay 40 the same
