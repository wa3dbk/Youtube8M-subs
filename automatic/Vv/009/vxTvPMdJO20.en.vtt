00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.500
 hello to all these waves and welcome to 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.430
 this top 10 tips for samsung 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.350
 galaxy is dry 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.570
 so the first of all if you come 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.470
 to acquire your galaxy 5 or that you 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.349
 bought it from someone else 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.990
 this can be helpful to check on the 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.130
 the sensor at the back that there is more 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.900
 while there is no longer here the screen of 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.390
 protection so the little plastic that 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.560
 you may see it there so in fact 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.570
 there is a small plastic that protects 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.050
 this window has it to take the 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.539
 best photos 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.339
 it must be removed this little plastic that 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:37.449
 See, this is the first of the tips 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.059
 so check this out anyway 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.550
 so on anything the second 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.829
 it's the quick connect that you have here 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.989
 it actually allows to search very 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.969
 quickly a nearby device and 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.769
 share his active bluetouff as 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:53.199
 you saw it just down and that allows 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.780
 directly to access phones at 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.760
 proximity so there is no phone 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.379
 bluetooth I believe nearby 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.319
 so otherwise it finds you directly 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.900
 this is when we go down this the 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:06.159
 disables the third it may be 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.740
 this little boat you saw on the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.880
 side is the double window that allows 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.680
 in fact that allows access to two 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.870
 windows at the same time for example if I 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.830
 want to send an email at the same time as 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.240
 I'm looking for something on the internet 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.340
 it's very useful 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.710
 this way if we can adjust 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.300
 the size of windows like these in 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.760
 long press on the back button 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.190
 it was made disappear or to appear 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.420
 So that's it 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 settings we go on a multi windows 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:42.430
 here and we can activate another trick 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.440
 it's the herviou you know 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.270
 maybe that's the way to access 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.010
 done on an application without touching 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.870
 the screen to be able to have 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.210
 additional information like that 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.090
 This so you can see that I 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.470
 do not touch the screen and yet we have 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.240
 additional information 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.500
 that too will be settled at the level of 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.810
 parameter settings and we have a small 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.950
 tab called herviou so if I 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.450
 loupais or not the herviou he is here and 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.920
 in the plane we will be able to activate it or 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.220
 no to have information like 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.090
 on videos 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.050
 auto also on keyboards etc on 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.690
 the agenda etc 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.630
 you also have the possibility maybe 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.620
 you know to access the parameters and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.240
 in the settings you also have 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.560
 access to the list 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.970
 to access this list more 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.350
 quickly a fiset of fingers and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.510
 go down to the step and you go 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.210
 directly to this list rather than 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.810
 to go like this so that's 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:41.060
 our little trick like that the trick 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.330
 next is that of the Danish of 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.740
 booster which is just the smart booster 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.690
 which actually allows to download more 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.910
 quickly large files in 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.550
 actually using the connection of the 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.740
 sim card and wifi so that's for 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.300
 download even faster you 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340
 can also save your day then 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
 for this your day you imagine yes 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.459
 the tasers you have in addition to 10% of 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.010
 battery you have to hold until evening 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.510
 you go in the settings is 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.770
 directly in the settings you 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.450
 find what's called savings 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.490
 of energy and you can activate the mode 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.380
 ultra energy savings that goes into 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.390
 does the phone in black and white and 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.130
 really reduces all your use 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.310
 it really seems to consume and 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.870
 consume very little battery 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.459
 another tip knows if in the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.380
 settings you do not like this intake 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.570
 in that know that in the menu you 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.940
 can access the settings but under 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.700
 different france way for example by 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.260
 list but also by tabs so like 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.090
 those ci etc 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.709
 you can also change from there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.920
 fast settings so I kept him 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.450
 original community in grid mode you 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.430
 should also know that the button you 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.620
 have here that for applications 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.900
 recent also allows you to access a 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.549
 menu button like this one you stay 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.890
 long pressed on this one and you 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.200
 go to the menu it works in full 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.090
 applications for example here we access 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.110
 also directly button menu is from 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.350
 even when we are going to be for example in 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.220
 the gallery we have the menu so that's it 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.630
 it's also something very 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.850
 fast and at the application level 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.590
 present to finish you know you 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.930
 can the is closed that way there 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.180
 you can also access all 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.250
 active applications in progress or any 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.320
 simply with this little button all 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.739
