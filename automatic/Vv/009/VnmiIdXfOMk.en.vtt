00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 not everyone as you see I have nothing 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.640
 I'm not going to cook it in a few 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.640
 cooked recipes 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.210
 great if you want to see this I think it has 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.730
 come the time I can or should 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.140
 open these white sections a 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.060
 section in which I will answer to 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.230
 all your questions because of the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.510
 social networks you make me a lot of 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.760
 questions installed by 6/2 by tweets 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.189
 how can I uefa nor am I a 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.710
 boy and at the end he threw me hours and now 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.600
 shut up and writing and when I get to 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.250
 everything therefore I think that the best is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.200
 that for a while you ask me what 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.430
 that you want to spanair here with leave 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.020
 using them until you're in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.539
 any society network and I have 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.730
 answered then every fifteen days or a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.399
 month to a video with all started 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.989
 your questions, memories, it seems that 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.280
 we go with the first action when to my 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.539
 child does not like fruit and truth 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 what can you do to like the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.539
 truth that is a question that I receive in 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 a lot of social networks daily 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.500
 or when I meet someone in some 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.239
 site or suddenly there is something that got me 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 an email is that I have this problem my 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.300
 son the truth that the fruit in a room 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.360
 very good and I try and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.070
 so I can do it there is not a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 magic response 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.390
 the main thing is those suits were houses and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.710
 if at home there is not a habit because 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.780
 there is a habit of eating fruit 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
 it's really hard to get that 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.000
 our son like that for love of art 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.190
 like the fruit or question it 2000 is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.020
 important that I think that no no 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.670
 they use the prefabricated flavors 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 how can it be a frozen vegetable 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 worried then without the cream already prepared 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.580
 of the supermarket last commercial balloons 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.380
 low since they are have an excess of salt 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.390
 or an excess of sugars or has 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.820
 some kind of other kind of flavorings 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.440
 or dyes that makes you have the 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.080
 color that is far from the flavor and at the end 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.910
 when you give him a real pumpkin or when 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.500
 make a beet cream because no 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.870
 has nothing to do with connections so much 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.340
 bigger and obviously to put everything 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.170
 above all patience not not everyone 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.880
 we like everyone all the beans 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.290
 It is going all the people in the vegetable or 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.100
 there are even some that were better 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.550
 those three things I think they are 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:14.020
 fundamental to understand 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:17.560
 because this is one of the fears and 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.960
 obsessions and follies that I see in a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.650
 lots of parents I will be giving all 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.210
 my things 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.860
 will be well nourished will have enough 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.790
 protein and enough sugar is pretty and 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.530
 the vitamins what is our mission is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.320
 the favor that crazy is if we worry 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.690
 say if it grows well if you eat well if you walk 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.610
 well if you breathe well if he sleeps well 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.450
 there giving him to the head neither this 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.780
 To come back crazy thought more than 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.980
 the variety of ingredients or more than the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.870
 know if we are giving all the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.690
 necessary nutrients for me is more 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.100
 important to worry about what is not 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.590
 have to give the week of everything create 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.750
 Broccoli Zucchini Cauliflower Beet 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.640
 but what is clear is that the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.819
 week you do not have to give my chocolate 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.099
 and sugar or product refineries or supplies 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.319
 industrial and things so they can 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.330
 really affect your health more than if 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.239
 a week eating single broccoli when 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.920
 just ends 501 video every science very 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.330
 agreement sunflower seeds without power 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.330
 and nuts and hazelnuts 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.930
 with nuts 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.160
 which my son my son does not eat anything two 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.549
 spoonfuls and already whether it is going to die 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.549
 of hunger 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.640
 starve 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:36.469
 that goes away whether or not it is going to grow or 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.969
 go to live a centimeter moment if 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:39.859
 so much worries about the first thing that the 

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:41.359
 pediatrician talk to him and who is more or 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:43.129
 less explain then look are you doing 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.659
 may well have some problem or a 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.730
 return an intolerance may have 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.620
 some elector an element that makes 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.389
 lose your appetite and 6 that fixed you not 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.730
 whatever it is that you do not eat because you know that 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:55.760
 you have won the battle in that and if not 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.989
 like this and he left it to me he will give me if not 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.670
 I eat the cream of vegetables I'm going to 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.530
 angry with my mother I start to cry or 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.760
 I start to protest but then my mom 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:09.540
 will give me a quantity of chocolate 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:13.590
 Complement the child is reduced that there 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:22.889
 some grandparents and grandmothers and grandparents and 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:24.449
 grandmothers children that really your son 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.220
 it takes us malnourished in mobility me 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.840
 for a warped fear because one morning 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.490
 in a coma but if you see that it is something 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.690
 obviously obviously the first of the 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.370
 what to do is go to the doctor because 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.220
 pediatrician here be a nutritionist 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.930
 someone you trust and who you value if 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.760
 it really is that they do not eat because they do not 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.310
 he's hungry because he does not like it because 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.260
 also in problems before is enough 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.110
 an activate in the morning is enough 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.150
 and if at school or at school with a 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.990
 activated only in the mornings man if 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.729
 if we see ads like I do not know how to 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.080
 activities and reinforces their defenses by 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.389
 the morning I do it has been with 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.720
 ads this is like this one day 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:02.520
 round or like cloth at breakfast 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.320
 the champions while we have breakfast 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.390
 story 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.270
 and having been clear that breakfast 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.100
 must be 20 25 and 30 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.990
 a hundred at most of the amount of 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.340
 calories that a child has per day that 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.540
 you have to have data that you have to 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.850
 have proteins that you have to have 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.210
 vitamins men then one active only 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.210
 in the morning 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.919
 what is the secret of your lentils 

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:39.269
 lentils very secret new secrets that 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.099
 really if at home we cook some 

00:05:39.269 --> 00:05:43.169
 lentils four input from the 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.399
 flavor that elevates that mind alcocer is not 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.589
 the same as if we make five kilos 

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:47.969
 newspapers as a single material always everything 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:50.189
 the only one next that they have different 

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:52.049
 hash I think it's really the whole 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:54.809
 of what happens children at that time 

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:57.029
 all of his colleagues are locked 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:59.039
 a time when you enjoy the 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.659
 food is given the importance that 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.610
 have to have we have come look at everything 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.559
 that makes me lentils though 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.479
 they gave time things that although another day 

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:08.009
 if it is true that an 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.249
 little bit with the salt look is this 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:15.509
 is given in general like I like 

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:19.099
 much to all the children of your school 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:19.099
 they only eat the cream at noon 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.250
 every day the salmorejo 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.460
 have lunch and snack at your school 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:45.980
 all the secrets that are similar more 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.980
 expensive 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.030
 well up here the questions today if 

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.650
 you have asked all the things that 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.760
 come to mind or is there any question is 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.400
 through social networks has not 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.430
 answered then leaving it with the hashtag 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.080
 ember niurka and go collecting the 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.699
 the best questions are the questions that 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.340
 I think they can really help us more 

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:08.020
 everyone and if I do not know them I'll look for them and 

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.389
 If I do not look for them and new encounters 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.100
 I'll ask a specialist about that and if 

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:13.510
 someone will not come to answer us because 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.160
 I will not know about the months asking 

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.260
 really anything you want 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.760
 have counted here and it gives me time because 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.830
