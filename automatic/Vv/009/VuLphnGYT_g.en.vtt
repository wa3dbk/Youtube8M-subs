00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.040
 quito is partying one of the sites 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 most visited is the monument in the middle 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 of the world very close to there is the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.280
 museum and dyed it reveals the advances 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.019
 scientists of the ancient settlers 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.820
 from that area 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.250
 the monument to the middle of the world 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.990
 located 13.5 kilometers from the capital 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.000
 is one of the favorite sites for 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.980
 tourists because it is where symbolically 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.650
 traced the equinoctial line that separates 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.360
 world in two in the 18th century a mission 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.279
 geodesic came to ecuador to perform 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.140
 studies that will determine the measurement of 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.700
 the earth and the location of its center 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.230
 now on the main avenue of the 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 city ​​half of the world the busts of 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.559
 who were part of that mission 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.120
 they are visited by hundreds of curious people 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.309
 tourists who do not miss the opportunity 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.260
 to take pictures on this site 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.440
 very nice symbolic ecuador very 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.540
 organized tourists fascinated 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.480
 so that I really love that yes 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.980
 to come back clear yes of course inside 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.320
 from the complex you can also observe 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.630
 an impressive replica of the center 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.850
 historical quito made with cardboard 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.250
 thanks to the lighting in this kit or 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.829
 in miniature the night falls and the city goes 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 being completely lit here is 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.070
 also locates the ethnographic museum that 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.110
 includes a sample of the cultures of 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.000
 our country and at the top of the monument is 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.189
 It has a panoramic view of the area 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.990
 this is one of the points by which 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.850
 passes the line that divides the planet in 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 two hemispheres and although the equator is 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.869
 known as the country of half 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.289
 the equatorial line also passes through 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.759
 other countries in america africa and asia and 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.649
 is that less than 5 minutes from the city 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.450
 half of the world is at least known 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.159
 intiman museum that does not stop surprising 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.049
 who visit it for the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.579
 experiences that they discover here as 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.560
 example that the location of the equator 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.569
 makes the existence of hurricanes impossible 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.929
 or typhoons these nation forces from the 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:46.390
 center of the planet towards the poles 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.490
 the poles collide and return to 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.409
 your starting point not put efforts 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.329
 already very weak that's why when 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.979
 collide are annulled and here the tier is 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.539
 perpendicular to it in the middle of the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.890
 world is easier than a raw egg is 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.750
 stay still in the head of a nail 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.099
 a similar explanation applies to 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.929
 the water that falls perpendicularly 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:03.640
 at this point but in the hemisphere 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.829
 North turns in the direction of the needles 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 of the clock we find here a clock 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.429
 solar used by our ancestors and 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.560
 that indicates the time with the reflection of the 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.030
 shadow thanks to the solar position the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.519
 tourists also perform other tests 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.890
 they close their eyes and try to walk in 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.090
 straight line mission almost impossible because 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 being in the middle of the world the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.360
 rotation of the earth makes the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.069
 attraction of the forces push them 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.840
 towards the poles, this is what his 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.160
 owner who also teaches us 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.050
 old photographs of the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
 the visitors of the monument of the half 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 of the world the first wedding that was celebrated 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.050
 in the place in the 60s the signatures of 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.770
 the illustrious visitors on the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.990
 concept of the kingdom of quito that existed 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.270
 kingdom of quito and of the quitus that 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.990
 they knew they were in the middle of the 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.390
 from there the idea of ​​maintaining 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.240
 this museum on site because here really 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.770
 the sneakers built their houses and it's 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.420
 that in these spaces it also rests 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 part of the historical memory of all 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.830
 the Ecuadorians of their origins there are 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.450
 to know in order to love in quito- 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.450
