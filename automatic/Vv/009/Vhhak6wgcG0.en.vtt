00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.150 

so<00:00:03.469> here's<00:00:03.679> a<00:00:03.739> real<00:00:03.980> old<00:00:04.569> guitar<00:00:05.569> luge<00:00:05.930> I<00:00:06.410> would

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
so here's a real old guitar luge I would

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.360 
so here's a real old guitar luge I would
call<00:00:07.370> it<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:07.580> guitar<00:00:07.879> lute<00:00:08.740> since<00:00:09.740> it<00:00:10.070> is<00:00:10.190> in

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
call it the guitar lute since it is in

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.480 
call it the guitar lute since it is in
between<00:00:10.490> many<00:00:11.299> different<00:00:11.360> instruments<00:00:12.309> it<00:00:13.309> is

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
between many different instruments it is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.240 
between many different instruments it is
not<00:00:13.669> a<00:00:13.700> theorem<00:00:14.389> because<00:00:15.349> if<00:00:15.500> durable<00:00:15.950> and

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
not a theorem because if durable and

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.870 
not a theorem because if durable and
original<00:00:16.850> TR<00:00:17.000> bow<00:00:17.300> has<00:00:18.189> those<00:00:19.189> strings<00:00:19.580> on<00:00:19.789> the

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
original TR bow has those strings on the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.790 
original TR bow has those strings on the
higher<00:00:20.060> ones<00:00:20.359> and<00:00:20.570> different<00:00:20.990> unit<00:00:21.320> even<00:00:21.529> more

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
higher ones and different unit even more

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.790 
higher ones and different unit even more
strings<00:00:22.189> on<00:00:22.609> the<00:00:23.390> ones<00:00:23.570> you<00:00:23.689> really<00:00:24.050> play<00:00:24.320> and

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
strings on the ones you really play and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.900 
strings on the ones you really play and
still<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:25.400> is<00:00:25.519> not<00:00:25.550> a<00:00:25.760> guitar<00:00:26.179> loot<00:00:26.420> because

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
still it is not a guitar loot because

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.630 
still it is not a guitar loot because
therefore<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.119> got<00:00:29.300> too<00:00:29.480> many<00:00:29.630> best<00:00:30.080> strings

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
therefore it's got too many best strings

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.049 
therefore it's got too many best strings
so<00:00:32.560> well<00:00:33.560> it's<00:00:33.710> something<00:00:34.250> beyond<00:00:34.700> the

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
so well it's something beyond the

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.930 
so well it's something beyond the
classifications<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.590> we<00:00:37.489> don't<00:00:37.670> even<00:00:37.790> know

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940 
classifications and we don't even know

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.569 
classifications and we don't even know
how<00:00:38.239> old<00:00:38.270> it<00:00:38.600> is<00:00:40.570> still<00:00:41.570> it<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.289> quite<00:00:42.950> a<00:00:43.340> nice

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
how old it is still it is quite a nice

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.400 
how old it is still it is quite a nice
sound<00:00:43.969> of<00:00:44.090> course<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.450> very<00:00:44.629> rich<00:00:44.899> and<00:00:45.230> low

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
sound of course a very rich and low

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.670 
sound of course a very rich and low
sound<00:00:45.800> -<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:47.660> one<00:00:47.809> who<00:00:47.930> made<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.170> his

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
sound - and the one who made it his

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.040 
sound - and the one who made it his
mates<00:00:50.110> some<00:00:51.110> good<00:00:51.320> ideas<00:00:51.980> or<00:00:52.600> some<00:00:53.600> very<00:00:53.899> good

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
mates some good ideas or some very good

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.010 
mates some good ideas or some very good
things<00:00:54.109> like<00:00:54.649> doing<00:00:55.489> this<00:00:55.699> brass<00:00:55.969> thing<00:00:56.870> up

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
things like doing this brass thing up

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.639 
things like doing this brass thing up
here<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:57.949> um<00:00:58.780> the<00:00:59.780> instrument<00:01:00.199> doesn't<00:01:00.469> doubt

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
here so um the instrument doesn't doubt

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.889 
here so um the instrument doesn't doubt
because<00:01:01.219> most<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.640> those<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.420> only<00:01:02.570> use

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
because most of those you can only use

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.470 
because most of those you can only use
for<00:01:03.170> decorating<00:01:03.530> your<00:01:03.710> walls<00:01:04.120> because<00:01:05.120> a

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:05.480 
for decorating your walls because a

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.140 
for decorating your walls because a
little<00:01:05.660> beautiful<00:01:06.080> but<00:01:06.440> then<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:07.550> like<00:01:07.730> that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
little beautiful but then just like that

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.260 
little beautiful but then just like that
and<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.890> with<00:01:10.040> this<00:01:10.130> one<00:01:10.370> it<00:01:10.850> still<00:01:11.120> is

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
and so with this one it still is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.380 
and so with this one it still is
playable<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:11.900> it's<00:01:12.680> probably<00:01:13.390> something

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
playable and it's probably something

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.480 
playable and it's probably something
between<00:01:15.110> in<00:01:15.410> the<00:01:15.500> 1940s<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.970> 1960s<00:01:18.280> might<00:01:19.280> be

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
between in the 1940s to 1960s might be

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.470 
between in the 1940s to 1960s might be
built<00:01:20.740> we<00:01:21.740> have<00:01:21.860> no<00:01:22.040> real<00:01:22.760> information<00:01:23.090> on

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
built we have no real information on

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.630 
built we have no real information on
that<00:01:23.600> but<00:01:23.660> I<00:01:24.200> talked<00:01:24.680> to<00:01:24.770> many<00:01:24.920> youth<00:01:25.190> makers

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
that but I talked to many youth makers

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.340 
that but I talked to many youth makers
and<00:01:25.970> we<00:01:26.350> analyzed<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:28.640> way<00:01:28.790> this<00:01:29.240> sound<00:01:30.170> hole

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
and we analyzed the way this sound hole

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.860 
and we analyzed the way this sound hole
decoration<00:01:30.920> was<00:01:31.040> made<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.450> way<00:01:32.600> the

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
decoration was made and the way the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.370 
decoration was made and the way the
machine<00:01:33.440> heads<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.370> kids<00:01:35.120> Unisphere<00:01:35.540> are

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
machine heads the kids Unisphere are

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.220 
machine heads the kids Unisphere are
then<00:01:36.680> and<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.010> on<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:37.400> on<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:38.270> usually

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
then and so on and so on and usually

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.930 
then and so on and so on and usually
these<00:01:39.620> instruments<00:01:39.980> have<00:01:40.250> a<00:01:40.310> lot<00:01:40.460> of<00:01:40.490> cracks

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
these instruments have a lot of cracks

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.640 
these instruments have a lot of cracks
in<00:01:41.180> the<00:01:41.270> top<00:01:42.850> this<00:01:43.850> one<00:01:44.090> has<00:01:44.330> not<00:01:44.510> it<00:01:45.290> is<00:01:45.470> only

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
in the top this one has not it is only

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.630 
in the top this one has not it is only
God<00:01:45.920> has<00:01:46.310> only<00:01:46.520> had<00:01:46.880> at<00:01:47.870> one<00:01:48.200> crack<00:01:48.650> which<00:01:49.370> went

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
God has only had at one crack which went

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.520 
God has only had at one crack which went
straight<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.540> fingerboard<00:01:50.870> but<00:01:51.260> we<00:01:51.410> own<00:01:51.500> a

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
straight to the fingerboard but we own a

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.500 
straight to the fingerboard but we own a
violin<00:01:51.950> maker<00:01:52.130> in<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.610> round<00:01:52.820> workshop<00:01:53.270> here

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
violin maker in the round workshop here

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.270 
violin maker in the round workshop here
and<00:01:53.840> he<00:01:54.560> fixed<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.040> professionally<00:01:55.880> and

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
and he fixed it professionally and

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.580 
and he fixed it professionally and
anyway<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.850> is<00:01:59.000> not<00:01:59.150> a<00:01:59.180> crack<00:01:59.480> which<00:01:59.720> would

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
anyway this is not a crack which would

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.140 
anyway this is not a crack which would
really<00:02:00.770> do<00:02:00.950> harm<00:02:01.160> to<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.460> instrument<00:02:01.880> because

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
really do harm to the instrument because

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.390 
really do harm to the instrument because
it<00:02:02.420> would<00:02:02.630> go<00:02:02.990> like<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.410> or<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:04.040> gone<00:02:04.250> like

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
it would go like this or have gone like

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.580 
it would go like this or have gone like
this<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.790> would<00:02:04.910> end<00:02:05.120> in<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.420> South<00:02:05.660> Pole<00:02:05.930> so

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
this and would end in the South Pole so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.550 
this and would end in the South Pole so
there's<00:02:06.800> no<00:02:06.980> further<00:02:07.580> danger<00:02:07.850> for<00:02:08.179> cracking

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
there's no further danger for cracking

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.710 
there's no further danger for cracking
down<00:02:09.560> here

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
down here

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.300 
down here
of<00:02:12.720> course<00:02:13.200> on<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.380> professional<00:02:13.980> playing

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
of course on a professional playing

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.040 
of course on a professional playing
these<00:02:14.490> instruments<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.540> would<00:02:15.750> probably

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
these instruments so it would probably

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.280 
these instruments so it would probably
sound<00:02:16.380> just<00:02:16.890> away<00:02:17.160> when<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:17.700> try<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.290> but

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
sound just away when you try it but

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.020 
sound just away when you try it but
anyway<00:02:19.740> I'm<00:02:19.890> trying<00:02:20.460> to<00:02:20.640> give<00:02:20.760> you<00:02:20.850> an<00:02:20.910> idea

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
anyway I'm trying to give you an idea
