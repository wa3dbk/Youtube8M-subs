little<00:04:20.040> bit<00:04:20.190> of<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.400> trick<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.910> them<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.810> wires

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
little bit of a trick to them the wires

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.420 
little bit of a trick to them the wires
have<00:04:23.280> little<00:04:23.699> release<00:04:24.120> tabs<00:04:24.570> on<00:04:25.500> the<00:04:25.830> backside

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
have little release tabs on the backside

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.590 
have little release tabs on the backside
of<00:04:26.669> them<00:04:26.810> so<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.290> have<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.680> reach<00:04:28.919> around<00:04:29.729> the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
of them so you have to reach around the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.629 
of them so you have to reach around the
how<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:30.840> wire<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.500> fill<00:04:31.949> that<00:04:32.130> little<00:04:32.400> tab

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
how the wire is fill that little tab

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.510 
how the wire is fill that little tab
squeeze<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.419> tab<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:34.080> that<00:04:34.949> will<00:04:35.130> release

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
squeeze that tab in that will release

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.520 
squeeze that tab in that will release
the<00:04:35.550> center<00:04:36.389> lock<00:04:36.630> on<00:04:36.900> them<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.260> allow<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the center lock on them and allow the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.159 
the center lock on them and allow the
speaker<00:04:40.530> to<00:04:40.800> be<00:04:40.830> unplug<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:42.449> if<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.720> look<00:04:42.930> real

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
speaker to be unplug so if you look real

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.490 
speaker to be unplug so if you look real
close<00:04:43.440> there<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:44.699> may<00:04:44.940> see<00:04:45.199> the<00:04:46.199> little

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
close there you may see the little

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.180 
close there you may see the little
release<00:04:46.830> tab<00:04:47.570> on<00:04:48.570> the<00:04:48.840> speaker<00:04:49.199> wider<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:50.100> you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
release tab on the speaker wider so you

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.610 
release tab on the speaker wider so you
have<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.430> push<00:04:50.669> that<00:04:50.850> little<00:04:51.030> tab<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.389> and<00:04:51.900> it

have to push that little tab in and it

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.189 
have to push that little tab in and it
releases<00:04:53.130> the<00:04:53.430> lock<00:04:53.669> I<00:04:53.940> then<00:04:54.449> you<00:04:54.570> can<00:04:54.720> unplug

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
releases the lock I then you can unplug

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.740 
releases the lock I then you can unplug
it<00:04:55.470> from<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.340> speaker<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:57.360> can<00:04:57.510> see<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
it from the speaker you can see the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.870 
it from the speaker you can see the
holes<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.380> the<00:04:58.620> middle<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.039> speaker<00:04:59.460> of

apart before you start ordering internal
parts<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.860> it<00:05:10.889> so<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:11.880> can<00:05:12.120> make<00:05:12.300> sure<00:05:12.330> that

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
parts for it so you can make sure that

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.390 
parts for it so you can make sure that
you<00:05:12.870> get<00:05:13.050> the<00:05:13.229> right<00:05:13.380> part<00:05:13.710> and<00:05:13.889> won't<00:05:14.220> get

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
you get the right part and won't get

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.129 
you get the right part and won't get
stuck<00:05:14.639> like<00:05:14.910> I<00:05:14.940> did

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
stuck like I did

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.490 
stuck like I did
I've<00:05:17.039> had<00:05:17.340> these<00:05:17.580> speakers<00:05:18.060> for<00:05:18.500> several

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
I've had these speakers for several

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.589 
I've had these speakers for several
months<00:05:19.680> probably<00:05:20.639> don't<00:05:21.180> know<00:05:21.389> where<00:05:21.570> I

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
months probably don't know where I

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.719 
months probably don't know where I
purchased<00:05:22.139> them<00:05:22.289> from<00:05:22.470> so<00:05:23.190> I'm<00:05:23.310> not<00:05:23.460> going<00:05:23.669> to

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
purchased them from so I'm not going to

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.650 
purchased them from so I'm not going to
be<00:05:23.820> able<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:24.030> return<00:05:24.449> them<00:05:24.690> but<00:05:26.150> make<00:05:27.150> sure<00:05:27.180> you

be able to return them but make sure you

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.430 
be able to return them but make sure you
crack<00:05:28.380> your<00:05:28.620> case<00:05:29.750> figure<00:05:30.750> out<00:05:30.870> what<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.229> need

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
order the proper parts and then replace

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.140 
order the proper parts and then replace
it<00:05:35.460> when<00:05:35.550> it<00:05:35.699> comes<00:05:35.910> in<00:05:36.150> only<00:05:36.750> took<00:05:37.139> about<00:05:38.150> 10

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
it when it comes in only took about 10

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:40.939 
it when it comes in only took about 10
minutes<00:05:39.180> to<00:05:39.720> get<00:05:39.870> to<00:05:40.020> back<00:05:40.229> at<00:05:40.440> his<00:05:40.590> computer

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:40.949 
minutes to get to back at his computer

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:44.120 
minutes to get to back at his computer
back<00:05:41.849> there's<00:05:42.090> TV<00:05:42.479> off<00:05:42.630> so<00:05:42.870> I<00:05:42.900> can<00:05:43.229> see<00:05:43.440> what

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
back there's TV off so I can see what

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.270 
back there's TV off so I can see what
part<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.490> need<00:05:44.669> not<00:05:45.630> be<00:05:45.810> a<00:05:45.840> real<00:05:46.110> good<00:05:46.410> idea<00:05:46.470> to

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
part I need not be a real good idea to

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.110 
part I need not be a real good idea to
figure<00:05:47.639> out<00:05:47.870> what<00:05:48.870> speaker<00:05:49.349> is<00:05:50.000> supposed<00:05:51.000> to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
figure out what speaker is supposed to

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.659 
figure out what speaker is supposed to
go<00:05:51.270> in<00:05:51.510> your<00:05:51.690> system<00:05:52.139> if<00:05:52.320> you<00:05:53.039> don't<00:05:53.070> order<00:05:53.460> one

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
go in your system if you don't order one

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.640 
go in your system if you don't order one
from<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:53.940> manufacturer<00:05:54.870> it<00:05:55.289> looks<00:05:55.440> like

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
from the manufacturer it looks like

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.080 
from the manufacturer it looks like
there's<00:05:55.860> some<00:05:56.010> kind<00:05:56.190> of<00:05:56.280> part<00:05:56.550> number<00:05:56.849> here

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
there's some kind of part number here

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.529 
there's some kind of part number here
but<00:05:57.720> the<00:05:57.870> important<00:05:58.380> thing<00:05:58.620> is<00:05:59.010> the<00:05:59.849> owns<00:06:00.180> in

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:00.539 
but the important thing is the owns in

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:02.659 
but the important thing is the owns in
the<00:06:00.870> Watts<00:06:01.110> as<00:06:01.470> you<00:06:01.889> can<00:06:02.039> see<00:06:02.220> us<00:06:02.310> an<00:06:02.460> 8<00:06:02.639> ohm

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:02.669 
the Watts as you can see us an 8 ohm

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.110 
the Watts as you can see us an 8 ohm
speaker<00:06:03.360> and<00:06:03.570> it's<00:06:04.199> a<00:06:04.289> 10<00:06:04.560> watt<00:06:04.770> speaker<00:06:05.310> so

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
speaker and it's a 10 watt speaker so

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.140 
speaker and it's a 10 watt speaker so
you<00:06:06.510> could<00:06:06.720> replace<00:06:07.260> them<00:06:07.560> by<00:06:08.010> pairs<00:06:08.430> that<00:06:08.970> way

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
you could replace them by pairs that way

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.450 
you could replace them by pairs that way
you<00:06:09.210> know<00:06:09.449> you<00:06:09.510> get<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.750> good<00:06:09.990> match<00:06:10.260> sound<00:06:10.650> or

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
you know you get a good match sound or

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.670 
you know you get a good match sound or
if<00:06:11.699> you<00:06:11.789> want<00:06:11.970> to<00:06:12.060> try<00:06:12.240> to<00:06:12.300> replace<00:06:12.750> one<00:06:13.080> you

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
if you want to try to replace one you

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.020 
if you want to try to replace one you
can<00:06:13.919> match<00:06:14.610> it<00:06:14.639> up<00:06:14.940> by<00:06:15.180> ohms<00:06:15.960> or<00:06:16.289> watts<00:06:16.560> and

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
can match it up by ohms or watts and

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.790 
can match it up by ohms or watts and
hopefully<00:06:18.030> you'll<00:06:18.270> get<00:06:18.479> a<00:06:18.659> sound<00:06:19.349> that<00:06:19.560> match

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
hopefully you'll get a sound that match

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.250 
hopefully you'll get a sound that match
but<00:06:20.070> I<00:06:20.130> really<00:06:20.550> recommend<00:06:20.900> replacing<00:06:21.900> them<00:06:22.139> in

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
but I really recommend replacing them in

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.459 
but I really recommend replacing them in
pairs<00:06:22.760> now<00:06:23.760> the<00:06:23.820> only<00:06:24.090> tool<00:06:24.419> I<00:06:24.450> needed<00:06:25.110> was<00:06:25.440> a

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:25.469 
pairs now the only tool I needed was a
