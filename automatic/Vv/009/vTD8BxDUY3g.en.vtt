I'm<00:00:08.340> gonna<00:00:08.490> Jason<00:00:08.940> I'm<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.210> registered

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:09.600 
I'm gonna Jason I'm a registered

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.299 
I'm gonna Jason I'm a registered
polysomnographic<00:00:09.750> technologist<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:11.250> I

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
polysomnographic technologist and I

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.080 
polysomnographic technologist and I
wanted<00:00:11.520> to<00:00:11.610> do<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:12.270> follow-up<00:00:12.930> to<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.090 
wanted to do a follow-up to the

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.350 
wanted to do a follow-up to the
respironics<00:00:15.090> Amara<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.099> was<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:18.210> old

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
respironics Amara so this was the old

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.810 
respironics Amara so this was the old
Amara<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.650> say<00:00:19.800> old<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.340> there's<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
Amara and I say old because there's a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.740 
Amara and I say old because there's a
newer<00:00:21.150> Amara<00:00:23.029> so<00:00:24.029> here's<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.390> newer<00:00:24.539> one

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
newer Amara so here's what the newer one

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.730 
newer Amara so here's what the newer one
looks<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:26.630> blue<00:00:27.630> gel<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.320> they<00:00:28.470> use

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
looks like it's a blue gel that they use

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.420 
looks like it's a blue gel that they use
and<00:00:29.600> so<00:00:30.600> when<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.560> Amara<00:00:31.800> first<00:00:32.070> came<00:00:32.279> out

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and so when the Amara first came out

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.720 
and so when the Amara first came out
they<00:00:32.879> were<00:00:32.930> trying<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:33.960> make<00:00:34.080> it<00:00:34.260> is<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.739> easy

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
they were trying to make it is as easy

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.060 
they were trying to make it is as easy
as<00:00:35.970> possible<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.750> few<00:00:36.960> parts<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:37.890> all

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
as possible with it's a few parts so all

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.009 
as possible with it's a few parts so all
they<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.519> a<00:00:38.550> head<00:00:38.790> gear<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.720> had<00:00:39.900> the

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
they have is a head gear they had the

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.380 
they have is a head gear they had the
frame<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.650> then<00:00:40.739> they<00:00:40.830> had<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.850> cushion<00:00:42.180> that

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
frame and then they had the cushion that

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
frame and then they had the cushion that
you<00:00:42.449> could<00:00:42.629> change<00:00:42.870> easily<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.500> pop<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
you could change easily and just pop in

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.500 
you could change easily and just pop in
and<00:00:43.979> out<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.339> you<00:00:44.460> wanted<00:00:46.820> all<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.089> was<00:00:48.239> great

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and out if you wanted all that was great

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.579 
and out if you wanted all that was great
so<00:00:49.199> what<00:00:49.650> happened<00:00:50.040> is<00:00:50.190> people<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:51.000> notice

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
so what happened is people would notice

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.630 
so what happened is people would notice
right<00:00:52.589> here<00:00:52.650> on<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.190> bridge<00:00:53.339> of<00:00:53.460> their<00:00:53.610> nose

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
right here on the bridge of their nose

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.340 
right here on the bridge of their nose
they<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.629> get<00:00:54.780> these<00:00:54.930> huge<00:00:57.110> marks<00:00:58.110> for<00:00:58.260> this

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
they would get these huge marks for this

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.960 
they would get these huge marks for this
it<00:00:58.589> was<00:00:58.710> too<00:00:58.860> much<00:00:58.979> pressure<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.549> nose<00:00:59.729> and

00:00:59.960 --> 00:00:59.970 
it was too much pressure in the nose and

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:01.549 
it was too much pressure in the nose and
so<00:01:00.059> you'd<00:01:00.239> get<00:01:00.390> skin<00:01:00.720> breakdown<00:01:01.170> right<00:01:01.350> here

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
so you'd get skin breakdown right here

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.939 
so you'd get skin breakdown right here
so<00:01:02.360> at<00:01:03.360> first<00:01:03.650> Respironics<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.830> know

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
so at first Respironics you know

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.340 
so at first Respironics you know
nothing's<00:01:05.580> wrong<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.790> our<00:01:05.909> master<00:01:06.360> fine<00:01:06.630> try

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
nothing's wrong with our master fine try

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.520 
nothing's wrong with our master fine try
this<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:07.950> what<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.250> did<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.940> they<00:01:09.540> show

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
this and so what they did is they show

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.620 
this and so what they did is they show
these<00:01:10.710> are<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> exact<00:01:11.250> same<00:01:11.340> size<00:01:11.909> mass<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
these are the exact same size mass and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.209 
these are the exact same size mass and
the<00:01:12.719> same<00:01:12.960> size<00:01:13.170> cushion<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.890> they're<00:01:14.039> good

00:01:14.209 --> 00:01:14.219 
the same size cushion so they're good

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.480 
the same size cushion so they're good
for<00:01:14.369> comparison<00:01:14.969> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.719> see<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:17.009> older<00:01:17.310> one

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
for comparison you can see the older one

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.910 
for comparison you can see the older one
the<00:01:17.759> frame<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.600> longer<00:01:19.289> so<00:01:19.829> what

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the frame is actually longer so what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
the frame is actually longer so what
they<00:01:20.039> did<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.490> moved<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.180> what<00:01:21.689> they

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
they did is it moved it to a what they

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.800 
they did is it moved it to a what they
call<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.990> reduced<00:01:22.409> size<00:01:22.649> frame<00:01:23.130> rs<00:01:23.729> frame<00:01:24.119> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
call a reduced size frame rs frame and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.919 
call a reduced size frame rs frame and
that's<00:01:24.960> all<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.350> get<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:25.679> is<00:01:25.829> ers<00:01:26.250> frame

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:26.929 
that's all you can get now is ers frame

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:30.260 
that's all you can get now is ers frame
what<00:01:27.929> they<00:01:28.020> also<00:01:28.170> did<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:29.179> decreasing<00:01:30.179> the

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
what they also did by decreasing the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.139 
what they also did by decreasing the
size<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.950> brought<00:01:32.369> it<00:01:32.490> instead<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.909> being

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
size that brought it instead of being

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:35.510 
size that brought it instead of being
back<00:01:33.359> here<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:34.560> up<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.039> at<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.219> front

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
back here it's up here at the front

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.849 
back here it's up here at the front
where<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:36.030> would<00:01:36.450> pull<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.929> out<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.499> they

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
where it would pull it out more and they

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.120 
where it would pull it out more and they
also<00:01:38.039> added<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.820> one<00:01:39.229> here<00:01:40.229> only<00:01:40.560> goes<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.009> 8

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
also added this one here only goes to 8

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.639 
also added this one here only goes to 8
centimeters<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:42.329> sorry<00:01:42.630> 8<00:01:42.840> millimeters<00:01:43.499> when

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
centimeters I'm sorry 8 millimeters when

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:44.330 
centimeters I'm sorry 8 millimeters when
you<00:01:43.710> pull<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> up

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you pull it up

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
you pull it up
this<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.820> goes<00:01:44.969> to<00:01:45.149> 10<00:01:45.359> so<00:01:45.689> what<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.960> does<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
this one goes to 10 so what that does is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
this one goes to 10 so what that does is
obviously<00:01:46.920> it's<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.219> take<00:01:47.429> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.700> more

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
obviously it's gonna take a lot more

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
obviously it's gonna take a lot more
pressure<00:01:48.149> off<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.719> well<00:01:49.499> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.920> pull<00:01:50.100> it

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
pressure off here well you can pull it

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.649 
pressure off here well you can pull it
away<00:01:50.249> as<00:01:50.399> far<00:01:50.609> as<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.819> want<00:01:50.850> you're<00:01:51.329> still

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
away as far as you want you're still

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
away as far as you want you're still
possibly<00:01:52.200> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.740> leakage<00:01:53.130> around

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
possibly going to get leakage around

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.539 
possibly going to get leakage around
your<00:01:53.939> cheeks<00:01:54.649> so<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.009> know<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.429> to

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
your cheeks so you know you just have to

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.169 
your cheeks so you know you just have to
toy<00:01:56.700> with<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.090> find<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> fit<00:01:58.999> find<00:01:59.999> that

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
toy with it to find that fit find that

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.090

lies<00:02:06.179> a<00:02:06.229> good<00:02:07.229> fit<00:02:07.499> if<00:02:07.679> you<00:02:07.799> can<00:02:07.950> find<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.960> so

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
lies a good fit if you can find it so

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.910 
lies a good fit if you can find it so
anyway<00:02:10.200> with<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.590> newer<00:02:10.770> version<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:12.000> have

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
anyway with the newer version you have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.039 
anyway with the newer version you have
this<00:02:13.920> forehead<00:02:14.340> spacer<00:02:14.760> which<00:02:15.090> extends<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.810> 10

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
this forehead spacer which extends to 10

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.080 
this forehead spacer which extends to 10
millimeters<00:02:16.560> instead<00:02:17.099> of<00:02:17.190> just<00:02:17.400> eight<00:02:17.610> it's

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
millimeters instead of just eight it's

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.390 
millimeters instead of just eight it's
also<00:02:18.299> on<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> reduced

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
also on the reduced

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.309 
also on the reduced
frame<00:02:19.760> which<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.090> a<00:02:20.209> little<00:02:20.450> lower<00:02:20.629> so<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.110> on

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
frame which is a little lower so it's on

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.800 
frame which is a little lower so it's on
more<00:02:21.739> of<00:02:21.890> your<00:02:22.069> your<00:02:22.939> eyebrows<00:02:23.299> where<00:02:23.689> it's

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
more of your your eyebrows where it's

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.860 
more of your your eyebrows where it's
harder<00:02:24.200> though<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:24.939> now<00:02:25.939> they<00:02:26.060> also<00:02:26.209> change

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
harder though here now they also change

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.229 
harder though here now they also change
the<00:02:27.170> cushion<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:28.129> with<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.430> older<00:02:28.730> version<00:02:29.150> of

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
the cushion so with the older version of

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.390 
the cushion so with the older version of
the<00:02:29.299> Amara<00:02:29.629> they<00:02:30.170> have<00:02:30.319> a<00:02:30.349> silicone<00:02:30.950> cushion

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
the Amara they have a silicone cushion

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.940 
the Amara they have a silicone cushion
and<00:02:31.579> you<00:02:32.420> can<00:02:32.569> see<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.140> shape<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.650> even

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
and you can see that the shape is even

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.949 
and you can see that the shape is even
different<00:02:34.540> there's<00:02:35.540> a<00:02:35.599> little<00:02:35.810> more

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
different there's a little more

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.110 
different there's a little more
reinforcement<00:02:36.709> here<00:02:36.829> here<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:37.459> dips<00:02:37.730> in<00:02:37.939> and

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
reinforcement here here it dips in and

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.170 
reinforcement here here it dips in and
comes<00:02:38.329> up<00:02:38.540> and<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.870> was<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:38.989> very<00:02:39.140> sharp<00:02:39.590> hard

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
comes up and it was a very sharp hard

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.979 
comes up and it was a very sharp hard
silicone<00:02:41.180> point<00:02:41.480> right<00:02:41.629> here<00:02:41.810> which<00:02:41.959> is

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
silicone point right here which is

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.899 
silicone point right here which is
probably<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.590> was<00:02:42.799> like<00:02:42.920> one<00:02:43.579> of<00:02:43.609> the<00:02:43.730> major

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
probably what was like one of the major

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.899 
probably what was like one of the major
offenders<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.750> the<00:02:45.189> unyielding<00:02:46.189> desire<00:02:46.730> to

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
offenders of the unyielding desire to

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.140 
offenders of the unyielding desire to
destroy<00:02:47.090> your<00:02:47.480> nose<00:02:48.640> this<00:02:49.640> one<00:02:49.819> is<00:02:49.939> definitely

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
destroy your nose this one is definitely

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.050 
destroy your nose this one is definitely
softer<00:02:51.049> but<00:02:51.440> if<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.799> push<00:02:52.430> in<00:02:52.639> far<00:02:52.970> enough

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
softer but if you push in far enough

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.970 
softer but if you push in far enough
there<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.569> it's<00:02:53.810> still<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.200> same<00:02:54.500> hard<00:02:55.720> point

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
there is it's still that same hard point

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.199 
there is it's still that same hard point
so<00:02:57.980> if<00:02:58.099> you<00:02:58.190> over<00:02:58.280> tighten<00:02:58.519> this<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.090> then

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
so if you over tighten this and then

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.920 
so if you over tighten this and then
you're<00:02:59.420> doing<00:03:00.159> killing<00:03:01.159> your<00:03:01.280> nose<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:02.900> you

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
you're doing killing your nose if you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.869 
you're doing killing your nose if you
squeeze<00:03:03.319> in<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.920> this<00:03:04.250> is<00:03:04.430> definitely<00:03:04.730> a

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
squeeze in here this is definitely a

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.089 
squeeze in here this is definitely a
thicker<00:03:05.120> gel<00:03:05.540> material<00:03:06.109> so<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.650> mask<00:03:06.829> gets

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
thicker gel material so the mask gets

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.069 
thicker gel material so the mask gets
soft<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.549> heavier<00:03:07.879> this<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.659> definitely

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
soft is heavier this is definitely

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.009 
soft is heavier this is definitely
lighter<00:03:09.349> this<00:03:10.069> has<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.280> heaviness<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:11.030> it<00:03:11.060> and

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
lighter this has a heaviness to it and

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.629 
lighter this has a heaviness to it and
also<00:03:12.260> when<00:03:12.379> you<00:03:12.439> have<00:03:12.470> it<00:03:12.769> on<00:03:12.859> it's<00:03:13.129> not<00:03:13.340> quite

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
also when you have it on it's not quite

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.720 
also when you have it on it's not quite
as<00:03:14.139> it<00:03:15.139> feels<00:03:15.379> less<00:03:15.769> breathable<00:03:16.340> although<00:03:16.700> I

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
as it feels less breathable although I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.099 
as it feels less breathable although I
think<00:03:16.970> that's<00:03:17.120> probably<00:03:17.299> more<00:03:17.629> in<00:03:17.750> my<00:03:17.900> head

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
think that's probably more in my head

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.080 
think that's probably more in my head
than<00:03:18.349> anything<00:03:18.530> else<00:03:18.859> other<00:03:19.670> than<00:03:19.819> that

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
than anything else other than that

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.189 
than anything else other than that
essentially<00:03:20.900> it's<00:03:21.049> the<00:03:21.170> same<00:03:21.230> mask<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:23.199> as

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
essentially it's the same mask and as

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:25.689 
essentially it's the same mask and as
far<00:03:24.410> as<00:03:24.470> trying<00:03:24.859> it<00:03:24.980> on<00:03:25.040> people<00:03:25.400> in<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:25.549> lab

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
far as trying it on people in the lab

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:28.059 
far as trying it on people in the lab
and<00:03:25.940> trying<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.299> myself<00:03:26.329> I<00:03:26.870> still<00:03:27.139> notice<00:03:27.500> it

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
and trying it myself I still notice it

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.289 
and trying it myself I still notice it
puts<00:03:28.250> a<00:03:28.340> lot<00:03:28.459> of<00:03:28.489> pressure<00:03:28.669> on<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.030> bridge<00:03:29.180> of

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
puts a lot of pressure on the bridge of

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.180 
puts a lot of pressure on the bridge of
my<00:03:29.359> nose<00:03:29.389> although<00:03:30.199> I<00:03:30.230> will<00:03:30.530> admit<00:03:30.919> that<00:03:30.949> it's

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
my nose although I will admit that it's

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.580 
my nose although I will admit that it's
less<00:03:31.400> so<00:03:31.669> than<00:03:31.879> it<00:03:31.970> was<00:03:32.180> with<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.900> older<00:03:33.169> Amara

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
less so than it was with the older Amara

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.009 
less so than it was with the older Amara
and<00:03:34.239> people<00:03:35.239> have<00:03:35.329> reported<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.870> newer

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
and people have reported that the newer

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.199 
and people have reported that the newer
Amara<00:03:36.459> some<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.639> said<00:03:37.790> that<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:38.060> actually

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
Amara some have said that it actually

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.970 
Amara some have said that it actually
works<00:03:38.510> for<00:03:38.720> him<00:03:38.810> now<00:03:38.930> or<00:03:39.290> as<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.560> did<00:03:39.709> in<00:03:39.829> the

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
works for him now or as it did in the

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.659 
works for him now or as it did in the
past<00:03:40.159> when<00:03:40.430> they<00:03:40.519> first<00:03:40.760> tried<00:03:41.000> it<00:03:41.030> I<00:03:42.669> think

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
past when they first tried it I think

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.879 
past when they first tried it I think
it's<00:03:43.790> 50/50<00:03:44.510> most<00:03:45.199> of<00:03:45.290> the<00:03:45.349> people<00:03:45.530> that<00:03:45.829> I

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
it's 50/50 most of the people that I

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.770 
it's 50/50 most of the people that I
personally<00:03:46.549> had<00:03:46.730> try<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.090> they<00:03:47.359> still<00:03:47.569> got

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
personally had try it they still got

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.360 
personally had try it they still got
breakdown<00:03:48.169> on<00:03:48.440> their<00:03:48.590> nose<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.040> they<00:03:49.099> didn't

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
breakdown on their nose and they didn't
