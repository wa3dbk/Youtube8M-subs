00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.480
 I 'm just like a girl 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.819
 forced what they make 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.030
 want to know the blood on the photo 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.709
 crystals really super fun 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.449
 of course very nice they give to the photo 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.400
 and then I will check which one 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:34.590
 fine i have to go out 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.199
 it 's half past two or so I'm pretty tired 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.400
 and back home and I have the leftovers 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.290
 removed from my makeup because I 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.729
 just had a make-up from yesterday 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.689
 I am now going to walk downwards in comparison 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.829
 because I really need chips so much 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.870
 yes it's because of me 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.680
 I drank something last night 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.689
 not all of them stayed inside 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.060
 and I don't know then I just feel like it 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:58.470
 tasty resistance food and salt and stuff 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.299
 incapable wool coats 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.889
 but again many musical things 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.870
 of course in the early at the beginning 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.549
 I just looked up my bed today 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.859
 and I'm watching a video 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.689
 second part of the great also video from 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.150
 eric where i made it a few vlogs ago 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.459
 also had a look here is that and the title 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.979
 is fine longest well for who would 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.269
 cock anxious be okay the link is in 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.949
 the description of this video and about 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.139
 looking at it completely 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:24.659
 nice and we'll just talk to you again 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.159
 about the gate things and the we 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:27.960
 answer the questions and so on 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:29.969
 not much filmed anymore so me 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.199
 at home it is now almost half past nine and 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:32.610
 I want to go right away 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.229
 sleep because of course I did last night 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.300
 slept badly or not badly 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.190
 just very short and I am now 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.620
 briefly an elevator pitch for tomorrow 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.030
 preparing and pitch say 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.280
 a kind of sales pitch the shorter 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.930
 rear and elevator pitch yes it goes 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.420
 actually you just have to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.070
 sell yourself to a company so me 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.910
 it must have some characteristics 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.650
 call things from me 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.940
 so I'll just lay it out or not 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.410
 read what I have now I will try 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.580
 out of my head saying that I should 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.960
 tomorrow also in class from me 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.640
 head saying my name is back to the 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.760
 wall i'm 19 years old and i'm studying 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.890
 tourism to inholland in haarlem 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.170
 I could describe it as a free 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.910
 extrovert person i am very open 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.130
 energy I actually always have it 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.930
 glass half full or really just 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.270
 completely full I am also very honest 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.820
 I am stronger in my shoes though I have 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.870
 of course also moments of 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.250
 uncertainty and the trying of it too 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.280
 learning naturally likes my opinion 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.570
 and I also think it should be possible 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.790
 therefore I can really express myself 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.450
 social media I like to 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.070
 to share things 

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.600
 to give my opinion on that and then 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.430
 it is actually a hobby of mine 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.690
 but i would like it went addiction 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.670
 because that sounds like that again 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.660
 negative bulk very motivated I want 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.190
 like to learn 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.230
 and I am very aware of my 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.060
 or I think strengths and weaknesses 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.710
 actually that between strong and weak 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.800
 can be a very thin line 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.980
 for example my self-assurance or 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.240
 My ego as the diet can be very strong 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.490
 be something of mine although I don't want that 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.350
 people get confused with arrogance 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.450
 but it can of course also be a weak one 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.050
 point because pride comes before the 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.550
 fall 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.080
 and i can talk it very easily 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.270
 can also be very useful as a strong point 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.620
 but sometimes i also need to know when you 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.110
 must shut up so those are again 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.880
 weak point, that is why the line so 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.680
 very very thin my plans should 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.300
 describe that for a year from now 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.950
 very difficult I always have something like that 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.810
 we will see how it goes and it is still possible 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.220
 anything happens although I know that I do 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.860
 quite a half year in itself 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.990
 would like to sit abroad for to 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.630
 prefer to study or for an internship 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.520
 I would also go to Australia but yes 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.350
 I say that I am very curious if I 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.920
 that can deliver and I am not doing anything 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.420
 on fixed 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.060
 that's about what I'm going to tell you 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.200
 the elevator pitch yes why number 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.210
 worth points but I had to keep 

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.010
 runaway arm oh shit, so I'm going 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.390
 I hope it's a bit sleepy 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.830
 yes i have all keywords here 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.750
 so I am guilty 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:47.730
 looking down would you like your case 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:52.170
 sleep until tomorrow tomorrow guilty longer 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.170
 and I don't feel like messing around
