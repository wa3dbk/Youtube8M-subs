00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
it really is waste of time doing that

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.889 
it really is waste of time doing that
because<00:00:32.070> rendering<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.669> 1080p<00:00:33.120> video<00:00:33.570> that's

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
because rendering a 1080p video that's

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.319 
because rendering a 1080p video that's
30<00:00:34.230> minutes<00:00:34.649> long<00:00:34.890> takes<00:00:35.730> me<00:00:35.940> about<00:00:36.030> five

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
30 minutes long takes me about five

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.990 
30 minutes long takes me about five
hours<00:00:36.390> I've<00:00:37.079> got<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> overclocked<00:00:38.250> size<00:00:38.430> 7<00:00:38.850> and

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
hours I've got a overclocked size 7 and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
hours I've got a overclocked size 7 and
it<00:00:39.210> even<00:00:39.360> takes<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.809> long<00:00:39.870> with<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> sort

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it even takes that long with that sort

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.470 
it even takes that long with that sort
of<00:00:40.590> rig<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.910> upload<00:00:42.180> again

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
