00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
that will add both of them together so i

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.389 
that will add both of them together so i

think<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.549> what<00:01:20.850> i<00:01:21.090> know<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
think of what i know you can make it to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
think of what i know you can make it to
where<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.950> spawn<00:01:23.369> egg<00:01:23.520> will<00:01:23.729> summon<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.450> custom

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
where a spawn egg will summon a custom

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.749 
where a spawn egg will summon a custom
mob<00:01:25.140> um<00:01:26.150> but<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.810> doesn't<00:01:28.170> matter<00:01:28.759> but

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
mob um but it that doesn't matter but

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.300 
mob um but it that doesn't matter but
here's<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.450> actually<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.009> first

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
here's how you actually do it so first

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
here's how you actually do it so first
you<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:34.070> test<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.630> snowball<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
you want to test for the snowball so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.440 
you want to test for the snowball so
when<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> throw<00:01:38.040> your<00:01:38.159> snowball<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:39.000> will

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
when you throw your snowball it will

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.999 
when you throw your snowball it will
execute<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.560> you'll<00:01:40.710> find<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
execute it to where you'll find the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.639 
execute it to where you'll find the
snowball<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> your<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.990> used<00:01:43.170> relative

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
snowball and your you used relative

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.740 
snowball and your you used relative
coordinates<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.210> test<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
coordinates and then it will test for a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.440 
coordinates and then it will test for a
sheet<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.530> radius<00:01:47.189> of<00:01:47.310> nine<00:01:47.850> blocks

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
sheet that is a radius of nine blocks

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
sheet that is a radius of nine blocks
from<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> snowball<00:01:49.860> then<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.610> give

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
from that snowball then it will give

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.539 
from that snowball then it will give
that<00:01:51.450> player<00:01:51.840> closest<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> command<00:01:53.399> block

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
that player closest to the command block

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.560 
that player closest to the command block
the<00:01:54.180> spawning<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.530> minecraft<00:01:56.369> Cohen<00:01:57.180> spawn

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the spawning and minecraft Cohen spawn

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.359 
the spawning and minecraft Cohen spawn
underscore<00:01:58.170> egg<00:01:58.380> 191<00:01:59.280> is<00:01:59.460> the<00:02:00.439> data<00:02:01.439> tag<00:02:01.860> for

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
underscore egg 191 is the data tag for

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.730 
underscore egg 191 is the data tag for
sheep<00:02:02.759> now<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.270> can<00:02:03.479> change<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.960> 91<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
sheep now you can change this 91 to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.290 
sheep now you can change this 91 to
whatever<00:02:05.130> number<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:07.110> mob<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.429> then

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
whatever number that mob is and then

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.930 
whatever number that mob is and then
here<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.410> make<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.619> seem<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.550> caught

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.460 
this will just kill the sheep so it's
test<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.980> sheet<00:02:17.490> days<00:02:17.730> in<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.420> radius<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.990> 15

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
test for a sheet days in a radius of 15

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.400 
test for a sheet days in a radius of 15
from<00:02:19.710> that<00:02:19.920> snowball<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:21.810> will<00:02:21.930> just<00:02:22.170> kill

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
from that snowball and it will just kill

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.230 
from that snowball and it will just kill
it<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.920> reason<00:02:23.190> why<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.370> have<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.700> at<00:02:23.790> 15<00:02:24.210> and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
it the reason why I have it at 15 and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.380 
it the reason why I have it at 15 and
not<00:02:24.570> nine<00:02:24.840> because<00:02:25.140> before<00:02:25.800> I<00:02:26.160> had<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.000> at<00:02:27.150> nine

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
not nine because before I had it at nine

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.150 
not nine because before I had it at nine
and<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.840> wouldn't<00:02:28.140> always<00:02:28.290> kill<00:02:28.740> his<00:02:28.920> sheep

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
and it wouldn't always kill his sheep

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.840 
and it wouldn't always kill his sheep
and<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:29.760> was<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:31.650> would<00:02:32.340> not<00:02:32.580> always

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and that was because it would not always

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.790 
and that was because it would not always
register<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.600> those<00:02:34.080> command<00:02:34.410> blocks<00:02:34.620> over

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
register and those command blocks over

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.590 
register and those command blocks over
there<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.700> make<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:35.940> to<00:02:36.180> where<00:02:36.330> when<00:02:36.570> I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
there and just make it to where when I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.830 
there and just make it to where when I
kill<00:02:36.930> this<00:02:36.960> sheep<00:02:37.380> another<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.130> spawns<00:02:38.840> so
