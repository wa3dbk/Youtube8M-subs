 if you think multiplying is something 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.410
 impossible to achieve if it is the same 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:17.590
 for you add subtract and divide if you 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.260
 like the hidden more than tell of 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:27.710

 safely secrecy secrets 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.980
 mathematicians entering aris island 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.590
 you will discover with simple with safety 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.010
 quickly the mathematical secrets of 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.010
 our island 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.510
 hello friends I'm finally I'm here in the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.280

 learn what is very easy always 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.850
 many say that mathematics is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 difficult but let's come beta that 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 things you have always think very

 with you with things that are of the 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.709
 nature you believe 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.530
 have then we go to the park of the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.470
 kill milestones and then I can explain everything 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.470
 very good good ok I hope nothing much 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.650
 well we are already here in the park 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.050
 the mates milestones as you can see in the 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.930
 island we have a park like 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.090
 we have an island of the mate cited the one 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.760
 it is always everything is the unit 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:02.780
 the one is always everything is like a 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:05.599
 apple is a bit and if it's all I 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.989
 I am one this is a good example no 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.690
 for example then the number one will 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:17.290
 write as you see it in my hand 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:19.239
 as it is an invention that I am 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.489
 working is an invisible glove that 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.230
 makes things project always 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:27.290
 you are with things like mola 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.349
 well let's move forward that if not then 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.599
 we say that the 1 is everything for example in 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.610
 the apple tree we can take an apple and 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:37.730
 If I give you half of each one, we have 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.200
 two pieces of the beige apple of the 1 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:44.090
 we can get more numbers 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.090
 how good that hunger was 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.020
 with art 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.620
 this attention in eating 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:53.780
 beta mother you 're always just as good 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.100
 guys do not discuss come on let's go to 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.940
 continue 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:01.660
 then the number 2 is represented as well 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.710
 let's continue to see the number 3 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.210
 let's do one thing we will 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:07.580
 show all our friends 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.940
 all the park of the milestones and 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.190
 we see what thing we have 3 we have 3 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.320
 Look, we are going to count them and you 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.450
 I am going to emphasize with a new invention that 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.810
 I did the other day that projects an image 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:23.750
 where I want then we have a two 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.800
 and three clouds 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.800
 and we also have 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.980
 to tell you he has 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:38.999
 but 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:41.909
 As a fashion, I've been amazed 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.149
 then the number 3 is represented as well 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.680
 beta 

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:50.199
 this is more fun than your pictures of 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:52.259
 the little houses we discussed guys man that 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.309
 we are having fun you want to continue 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:56.009
 well you can also see in the

 little garden we have three little dots 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:02.069
 beige 1 2 and 3 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:05.849
 now let's see what we have 4 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:05.849
 look, you see something 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.250
 and so 4 daisies
