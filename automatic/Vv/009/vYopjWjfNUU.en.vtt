00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
in his head and then one of it was a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.340

viewfinder<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.899> know<00:00:37.079> there<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
viewfinder now you know there are

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.700 
viewfinder now you know there are
different<00:00:37.469> cameras<00:00:38.129> such<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.670> 5d<00:00:39.239> 60d<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
different cameras such as a 5d 60d and a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.819 
different cameras such as a 5d 60d and a
5d<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.219> 7d<00:00:41.460> shared<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.600> same<00:00:42.809> LCD<00:00:43.320> 3-inch

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
5d and 7d shared the same LCD 3-inch

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.180 
5d and 7d shared the same LCD 3-inch
screen<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:45.059> me<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.899> 60d<00:00:46.590> due<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
screen and for me I like 60d due to the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.430 
screen and for me I like 60d due to the
articulating<00:00:47.910> screen<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.510> I'm<00:00:48.840> select<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
articulating screen and I'm select the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.170 
articulating screen and I'm select the
fact<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.950> wanted<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> viewfinder

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
fact that I wanted to use a viewfinder

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
fact that I wanted to use a viewfinder
under<00:00:51.360> 16<00:00:51.719> D<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.079> there<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.320> no<00:00:52.530> option<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.070> do

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
under 16 D but there was no option to do

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.860 
under 16 D but there was no option to do
that<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.850> can't<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.360> mount<00:00:54.690> a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that because you can't just mount a

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.990 
that because you can't just mount a
sticky<00:00:55.230> frame<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.680> your<00:00:55.710> 60d<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.579> else<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
sticky frame on your 60d or else you can

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
sticky frame on your 60d or else you can
close<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.300> back<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.320> know<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> lots<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
close it back so you know the lots of

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.590 
close it back so you know the lots of
solution<00:00:59.250> I've<00:00:59.370> done<00:00:59.699> previously<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
solution I've done previously and I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.639 
solution I've done previously and I
think<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.870> might<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.079> made<00:01:01.199> around<00:01:01.440> like

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
think it might have made around like

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.160 
think it might have made around like
three<00:01:01.920> videos<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.629> finally

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
three videos to it and now I finally

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.250 
three videos to it and now I finally
have<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.129> viewfinder<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:06.299> works<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.990> all

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
have a viewfinder that works for all

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910 
have a viewfinder that works for all
cameras<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.189> DSLRs<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.650> carry

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
cameras all DSLRs now this is the carry

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
cameras all DSLRs now this is the carry
speed<00:01:11.159> viewfinder<00:01:12.229> yes<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> sides

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
speed viewfinder yes from the sides

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
speed viewfinder yes from the sides
itself<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:14.640> pretty<00:01:15.060> huge

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
itself it is pretty huge

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
itself it is pretty huge
I<00:01:15.840> haven't<00:01:16.470> measured<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.950> yet<00:01:17.159> but<00:01:17.729> what

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I haven't measured it yet but what

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.870 
I haven't measured it yet but what
really<00:01:18.240> excites<00:01:18.630> me<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> most<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.009> um

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
really excites me the most is that um

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.899 
really excites me the most is that um
this<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.540> not<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> sticky<00:01:22.200> frame<00:01:22.439> all<00:01:23.159> right<00:01:23.369> now

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
this is not a sticky frame all right now

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.940 
this is not a sticky frame all right now
sticky<00:01:24.299> frame<00:01:24.509> has<00:01:24.750> been<00:01:24.780> gone<00:01:25.259> around<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
like that and this how does it work

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
like that and this how does it work
