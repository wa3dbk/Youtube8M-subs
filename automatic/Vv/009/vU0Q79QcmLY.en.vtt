different weather symbols and then I

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.190 
different weather symbols and then I
just<00:03:43.920> sort<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.310> cut<00:03:44.610> just<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.540> cross<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.049> of

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
envelope to seal the envelope and let's

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.800 
envelope to seal the envelope and let's
see<00:05:13.590> what<00:05:13.770> else<00:05:13.800> we<00:05:14.130> got<00:05:14.310> just<00:05:15.180> again<00:05:15.480> some<00:05:15.780> a

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
see what else we got just again some a

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.130 
see what else we got just again some a
dark<00:05:18.860> so<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.010> dark<00:05:20.250> is<00:05:20.490> she<00:05:20.730> brown<00:05:21.120> with<00:05:21.600> text

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
dark so the dark is she brown with text

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.390 
dark so the dark is she brown with text
on<00:05:22.290> it<00:05:22.410> again<00:05:22.850> and<00:05:23.900> some<00:05:24.900> more<00:05:25.080> text<00:05:25.380> I<00:05:25.860> have<00:05:26.370> a

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
on it again and some more text I have a

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.090 
on it again and some more text I have a
tendency<00:05:26.670> to<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.180> text<00:05:27.720> and<00:05:28.470> of<00:05:28.680> course<00:05:28.920> i<00:05:29.040> do

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
tendency to like text and of course i do

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.150 
tendency to like text and of course i do
have<00:05:29.400> thinner<00:05:29.940> washi<00:05:30.390> tape<00:05:30.780> as<00:05:30.990> well<00:05:31.230> which<00:05:31.980> I

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
have thinner washi tape as well which I

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.340 
have thinner washi tape as well which I
I've<00:05:32.490> tried<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.150> used<00:05:33.330> on<00:05:33.540> these<00:05:34.020> ones<00:05:34.230> are

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
I've tried and used on these ones are

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.770 
I've tried and used on these ones are
really<00:05:34.620> difficult<00:05:34.830> to<00:05:35.250> use<00:05:35.520> so<00:05:36.300> I

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
really difficult to use so I

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.500 
really difficult to use so I
occasionally<00:05:37.530> use<00:05:38.010> them<00:05:38.250> but<00:05:38.460> i<00:05:38.490> tend<00:05:39.000> to<00:05:39.120> cut

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
occasionally use them but i tend to cut

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.280 
occasionally use them but i tend to cut
in<00:05:40.140> half<00:05:40.530> using<00:05:40.830> a<00:05:41.070> paper<00:05:41.280> cutter<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.990> thicker

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
in half using a paper cutter the thicker

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.350 
in half using a paper cutter the thicker
tape<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.920> that<00:05:44.130> works<00:05:44.430> pretty<00:05:44.790> well<00:05:44.910> for<00:05:45.060> me

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
tape and that works pretty well for me

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.040 
tape and that works pretty well for me
and<00:05:46.010> there's<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.070> utensil<00:05:47.880> one<00:05:48.480> looks<00:05:48.840> like<00:05:48.930> a

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
and there's a utensil one looks like a

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.670 
and there's a utensil one looks like a
Victoriana<00:05:49.770> one<00:05:50.760> again<00:05:51.120> so<00:05:51.750> really<00:05:52.140> the<00:05:52.410> theme

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
Victoriana one again so really the theme

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.590 
Victoriana one again so really the theme
is<00:05:52.920> black<00:05:53.190> and<00:05:53.460> white<00:05:53.700> text<00:05:55.010> victoriana

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:56.600
