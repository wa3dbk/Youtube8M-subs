00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.890
 go with six points of light on a 1 PSV 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.299
 champion race 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.460
 as last Saturday in the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.309
 home duel with mock a real atmosphere promotion 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.900
 for one of the players after one 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.910
 that the box on north man here it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.990
 the ball extended 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.990
 muzaqi on reggy 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 april muzaqi to switching burdles 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.830
 leemans with the overview 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.019
 sanam type had the bruijn back and all 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 after two minutes it is a how many psv 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.929
 because albian muzaqi that ball easy 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.929
 could tap inside 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.469
 quick goal so salon-keeper de bruijn 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.329
 back and this is a breeze especially 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:48.360
 beyond you, we switch PSV so soon to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.210
 pink start is therefore very promising 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.680
 little happened in the 1st half 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.960
 this is after more than half an hour of playing 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.489
 front of van de kreeke kardash below 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.719
 the ball through and el allouchi 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.890
 who could therefore head in freely and after 33 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.430
 both teams get up again in minutes 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.430
 equal height 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.320
 dash you miss them they bertrams could not 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.320
 otherwise do little about it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.720
 and so psv can start again 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.920
 meijers put under pressure by archie and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.830
 that is why that playback ball might be 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.020
 what brief how matter here the between the goal 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.869
 know how to bag with the overview 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.960
 then that paul is sharp on rakuten via the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:36.460
 klut arno and then know how to save brown 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.530
 great opportunity for psv 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.420
 so it remains one way 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.110
 earlier this season in November around PSV 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.850
 in breda with 5 2 now is at rest one 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.610
 a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:56.210
 cavani and by here with the duel disorder 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:59.480
 winner is i good body and gets 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.490
 then the space for a cross but that 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.470
 is taken out by el allouchi 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
 and therefore the corner for psv and so jorrit 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.270
 hendrix forward 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.399
 leemans takes decoder and there is the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.700
 header from albian muzaqi and psv state 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.170
 here a2 for beautiful albian header 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.600
 so muzaqi who is a second of the 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.600
 competition makes good carnival leemans 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.750
 and there albian muzaqi 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.380
 hendriks with the pressure and therefore the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.660
 ball win for psv 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.620
 sano because goals go under the ball 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.620
 the chance for sando 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.270
 but eye to eye with keeper de bruijn 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.270
 falls sano 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.720
 so leave a very good chance here 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720
 lie 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.290
 leemans 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.360
 with room for the cross at the second 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.350
 pole would be then 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.350
 and that doesn't go in either 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.740
 huge opportunity but we had to Asolo 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 so two remain 1 and therefore always one 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.510
 match the space again 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.670
 left hand side 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.990
 this time for heatsackers 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.240
 heersakkers him at the first post here 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.000
 all gone the wall polio 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.010
 but that ball landed on the second paul like that 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.840
 psv is much better but forget that 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.140
 to complete the competition 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.600
 antonio to preference on one 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.510
 the cross and then three solo and this one too 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.090
 didn't want to go in but it did have five one 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.380
 can be for psv a1 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.790
 because phillip cocu's plow 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.709
 so finally win with two one 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.510
 but they have two goals from this albian man 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.850
 muzaqi 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.610
 and therefore psv a1 remains the leader in the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:55.709
 national premier league where we are juniors 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.930
 stronger on the 3 points out on feyenoord 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:00.420
 that the confrontation in Arnhem from 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.010
 vitesse loses an FC with two 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.510
 groningen passes through 4th comfort 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.680
 gentlemen's hair 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.680
 utrecht and ajax
