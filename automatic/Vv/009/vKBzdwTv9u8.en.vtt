00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
these two computers there will be only a

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.199 
these two computers there will be only a
small<00:03:59.109> difference<00:03:59.410> between<00:04:00.010> them<00:04:00.459> and<00:04:00.730> the

small difference between them and the

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.789 
small difference between them and the
difference<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.959> speed<00:04:02.260> in<00:04:02.470> which<00:04:02.500> they

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
difference is the speed in which they

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.879

operate and this difference is not so

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:10.590 
operate and this difference is not so
big<00:04:06.190> so<00:04:07.090> if<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.900> are<00:04:08.400> going<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.489> a<00:04:10.120> low<00:04:10.359> budget

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600
