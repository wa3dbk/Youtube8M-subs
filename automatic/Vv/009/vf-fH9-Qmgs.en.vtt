00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.620 
I'm just thinking if I was using a
shadow<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.010> was<00:03:14.100> more<00:03:14.400> intense<00:03:14.819> harder<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
shadow that was more intense harder to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.140 
shadow that was more intense harder to
work<00:03:15.780> with<00:03:16.080> something<00:03:16.500> where<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.800> placement

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
work with something where the placement

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.699 
work with something where the placement
exactly<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.420> eye<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.900> really<00:03:19.200> important

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
exactly on the eye was really important

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.370 
exactly on the eye was really important
I<00:03:19.920> would<00:03:20.340> want<00:03:20.549> something<00:03:20.880> flat<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.780> here<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.350> I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
I would want something flat in here so I

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.039 
I would want something flat in here so I
guess<00:03:22.799> that's<00:03:23.579> what<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.090> can<00:03:24.329> use<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.989> little

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
guess that's what I can use this little

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.770 
guess that's what I can use this little
extra<00:03:25.769> part<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> pouch<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.329> know<00:03:27.480> pop

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
extra part of the pouch for you know pop

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.449 
extra part of the pouch for you know pop
a<00:03:27.810> different<00:03:28.350> brush<00:03:28.560> in<00:03:28.860> there<00:03:29.100> if<00:03:29.220> there's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
a different brush in there if there's

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.620 
a different brush in there if there's
one<00:03:29.670> that<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.880> feel<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.239> missing

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
one that you feel is missing

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.330 
one that you feel is missing
Hallet<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.230> kind<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.650> testing<00:03:32.190> out

Hallet that I'm kind of testing out

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.370 
Hallet that I'm kind of testing out
along<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.880> way<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.209> well<00:03:33.239> is<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.110> new<00:03:34.230> one

along the way as well is the new one

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.110 
along the way as well is the new one

spellbinding<00:03:37.110> for<00:03:37.290> starters<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.739> just<00:03:37.920> primed

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.160 
spellbinding for starters I just primed
my<00:03:38.310> lids<00:03:38.579> and<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.940> went<00:03:39.120> straight<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.600> a

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
my lids and then I went straight to a

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.460 
my lids and then I went straight to a
matte<00:03:40.590> mid-tone<00:03:41.400> brown<00:03:42.120> crease<00:03:42.630> color<00:03:42.989> with

matte mid-tone brown crease color with

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.940 
matte mid-tone brown crease color with
the<00:03:43.680> crease<00:03:43.950> brush<00:03:44.480> just<00:03:45.480> got<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> soft<00:03:46.290> wash<00:03:46.709> of

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
the crease brush just got a soft wash of

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.130 
the crease brush just got a soft wash of
that<00:03:47.190> color<00:03:47.519> there<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.120> the<00:03:48.269> crease<00:03:48.540> next<00:03:49.049> I

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
that color there in the crease next I

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.410 
that color there in the crease next I
did<00:03:49.350> use<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.590> all-over<00:03:50.400> shadow<00:03:50.730> brush<00:03:51.180> I

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
did use that all-over shadow brush I

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.569 
did use that all-over shadow brush I
used<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.989> light<00:03:52.380> kind<00:03:52.799> of<00:03:52.859> shimmery<00:03:53.250> pink

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
used the light kind of shimmery pink

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.180 
used the light kind of shimmery pink
shade<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.239> did<00:03:54.810> Pat<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.320> all<00:03:55.560> over<00:03:55.829> the<00:03:56.010> lid

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
shade and did Pat that all over the lid

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.430 
shade and did Pat that all over the lid
and<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.640> also<00:03:56.880> just<00:03:57.269> use<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.660> brush<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.320> apply

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
and I also just use that brush to apply

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.380 
and I also just use that brush to apply
the<00:03:58.650> pink<00:03:58.980> as<00:03:59.160> my<00:03:59.340> highlight<00:03:59.609> up<00:04:00.000> under<00:04:00.269> my

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
the pink as my highlight up under my

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.759 
the pink as my highlight up under my
brows<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.750> thought<00:04:00.930> it<00:04:01.019> might<00:04:01.170> be<00:04:01.290> fun<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.620> work

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
brows I thought it might be fun to work

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.949 
brows I thought it might be fun to work
in<00:04:02.010> just<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.370> slight<00:04:02.730> bit<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.480> bright<00:04:03.720> pink

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
in just a slight bit of the bright pink

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.780 
in just a slight bit of the bright pink
shade<00:04:04.320> that's<00:04:04.560> in<00:04:04.709> here<00:04:04.950> so<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.190> used<00:04:05.579> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
shade that's in here so I used the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.300 
shade that's in here so I used the
crease<00:04:06.060> brush<00:04:06.359> just<00:04:07.079> to<00:04:07.230> apply<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.620> little<00:04:08.130> bit

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
crease brush just to apply a little bit

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.009 
crease brush just to apply a little bit
of<00:04:08.549> that<00:04:08.730> right<00:04:09.030> between<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.540> crease<00:04:09.750> and<00:04:09.959> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
of that right between the crease and the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.930 
of that right between the crease and the
brow<00:04:10.260> using<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.859> smudger<00:04:11.160> brush<00:04:11.280> I<00:04:11.670> went<00:04:11.850> to

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
brow using the smudger brush I went to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.759 
brow using the smudger brush I went to
this<00:04:12.030> really<00:04:12.209> pretty<00:04:12.600> dark<00:04:13.140> like<00:04:13.530> kind<00:04:13.739> of

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
this really pretty dark like kind of

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.279 
this really pretty dark like kind of
burgundy<00:04:14.250> Brown<00:04:14.519> and<00:04:14.970> I<00:04:15.600> started<00:04:16.019> blending

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
burgundy Brown and I started blending

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.500 
burgundy Brown and I started blending
that<00:04:16.799> a<00:04:16.829> bit<00:04:17.160> in<00:04:17.190> the<00:04:17.519> outer<00:04:17.729> corner<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.329> also

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
that a bit in the outer corner I also

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.020 
that a bit in the outer corner I also
took<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:19.019> just<00:04:19.049> under<00:04:19.680> my<00:04:19.859> eye<00:04:19.890> really<00:04:20.370> softly

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
took it just under my eye really softly

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.570 
took it just under my eye really softly
and<00:04:21.419> then<00:04:21.989> to<00:04:22.169> get<00:04:22.380> even<00:04:22.800> more<00:04:23.070> in

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
and then to get even more in

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.059 
and then to get even more in
intensity<00:04:23.939> more<00:04:24.389> concentrated<00:04:25.259> color<00:04:25.439> I<00:04:25.740> use

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
intensity more concentrated color I use

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:27.800 
intensity more concentrated color I use
the<00:04:26.340> liner<00:04:26.639> side<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.210> the<00:04:27.330> brush<00:04:27.539> with<00:04:27.780> that

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
the liner side of the brush with that

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.350 
the liner side of the brush with that
same<00:04:28.259> shape<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.889> many<00:04:29.099> brush<00:04:29.610> kits<00:04:29.849> that<00:04:29.939> I<00:04:30.030> try

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
same shape so many brush kits that I try

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.029 
same shape so many brush kits that I try
were<00:04:30.599> I<00:04:30.810> feel<00:04:31.020> like<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.379> know<00:04:31.500> something's

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
were I feel like you know something's

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.249 
were I feel like you know something's
missing<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.969> I<00:04:33.120> don't<00:04:33.330> necessarily<00:04:33.599> feel

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
missing and I don't necessarily feel

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.409 
missing and I don't necessarily feel
that<00:04:34.710> way<00:04:34.860> about<00:04:35.069> this<00:04:35.520> kit<00:04:35.819> because<00:04:35.969> like<00:04:36.300> I

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
that way about this kit because like I

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.929 
that way about this kit because like I
said<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.719> can<00:04:37.020> get<00:04:37.259> these<00:04:37.830> really<00:04:38.219> soft<00:04:38.520> nice

00:04:38.929 --> 00:04:38.939 
said I can get these really soft nice

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:41.149 
said I can get these really soft nice
blended<00:04:39.569> looks<00:04:39.780> very<00:04:40.259> happy<00:04:40.800> with<00:04:41.009> the

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:41.159 
blended looks very happy with the

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.950 
blended looks very happy with the
finished<00:04:41.490> effect<00:04:41.699> leaned<00:04:42.180> up<00:04:42.330> easily<00:04:42.930> I

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
finished effect leaned up easily I

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.779 
finished effect leaned up easily I
haven't<00:04:43.620> had<00:04:43.770> any<00:04:44.009> shedding<00:04:44.460> with<00:04:44.610> it's

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
haven't had any shedding with it's

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.550 
haven't had any shedding with it's
almost<00:04:45.060> got<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> little<00:04:45.870> bit<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.110> a<00:04:46.199> slightly

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
almost got a little bit of a slightly

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.529 
almost got a little bit of a slightly
rubbery<00:04:47.129> texture<00:04:47.610> to<00:04:47.909> it<00:04:47.939> and<00:04:48.090> I<00:04:48.180> think<00:04:48.240> that's

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
rubbery texture to it and I think that's

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.510
