00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
one different very retro safety is

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.780 
one different very retro safety is
important<00:02:40.060> and<00:02:40.180> be<00:02:40.900> great<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.500> just<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.730> a

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
important and be great to just be in a

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.520 
important and be great to just be in a
city<00:02:42.970> driving<00:02:43.330> but<00:02:43.720> once<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.260> get<00:02:44.410> on<00:02:44.500> the

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
city driving but once you get on the

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.430 
city driving but once you get on the
freeways<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.310> think<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.760> will<00:02:46.630> be<00:02:47.140> a<00:02:47.170> lot

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
freeways I think it will be a lot

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.979 
freeways I think it will be a lot
intimidating<00:02:48.280> by<00:02:48.430> truck<00:02:48.760> drivers<00:02:49.239> now<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:49.870> was

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
intimidating by truck drivers now it was

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.360 
intimidating by truck drivers now it was
definitely<00:02:50.320> well<00:02:50.500> worth<00:02:50.530> it<00:02:50.920> we<00:02:51.130> were<00:02:51.220> just

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
definitely well worth it we were just

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.150 
definitely well worth it we were just
talking<00:02:51.700> about<00:02:51.760> going<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.010> with<00:02:54.010> him

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
talking about going to the with him

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.979 
talking about going to the with him
doing<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.520> advanced<00:02:54.850> forces<00:02:55.570> well<00:02:55.780> now

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
doing the advanced forces well now

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.229 
doing the advanced forces well now
because<00:02:56.410> there's<00:02:56.739> obviously<00:02:56.860> only<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.150> many

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
because there's obviously only so many

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.350 
because there's obviously only so many
things<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.630> parent<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.080> teach<00:02:59.350> their<00:03:00.360> children

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
things a parent can teach their children

learnt<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.989> safety<00:03:23.709> is<00:03:23.769> more<00:03:23.890> important<00:03:24.370> so

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
learnt the safety is more important so

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.539 
learnt the safety is more important so
do<00:03:25.030> you<00:03:25.150> look<00:03:25.239> at<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:25.390> touchscreen<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.799> good

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.910 

ABS<00:03:30.549> traction<00:03:31.180> control<00:03:31.840> yeah<00:03:32.019> yeah<00:03:32.320> good

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
ABS traction control yeah yeah good

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.710 
ABS traction control yeah yeah good
that's<00:03:33.190> good

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
that's good

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.000 
that's good
what<00:03:34.720> are<00:03:34.810> your<00:03:34.900> priorities<00:03:35.049> like<00:03:35.620> it<00:03:35.860> it's

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
what are your priorities like it it's

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.330 
what are your priorities like it it's
space<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:37.000> tack<00:03:37.420> or<00:03:37.690> um<00:03:38.200> probably<00:03:38.620> as<00:03:38.860> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
space and and tack or um probably as a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.310 
space and and tack or um probably as a
first<00:03:39.790> car<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> think<00:03:40.239> safety<00:03:40.750> would<00:03:40.989> probably

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
first car I think safety would probably

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.620 
first car I think safety would probably
be<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.470> best<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:42.370> look<00:03:42.519> at<00:03:42.700> saying<00:03:43.209> that<00:03:43.510> it

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
be the best to look at saying that it

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.530 
be the best to look at saying that it
has<00:03:43.810> ABS<00:03:44.620> brakes<00:03:44.950> that's<00:03:45.310> a<00:03:45.489> big<00:03:46.000> thing<00:03:46.330> and

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
has ABS brakes that's a big thing and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.960 
has ABS brakes that's a big thing and
then<00:03:47.110> things<00:03:47.530> that<00:03:47.739> limit<00:03:48.160> my<00:03:48.370> distractions

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
then things that limit my distractions

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.910 
then things that limit my distractions
now<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.540> a<00:03:49.570> good<00:03:49.780> sized<00:03:49.959> car<00:03:50.230> it's<00:03:50.590> on

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
now this is a good sized car it's on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.090 
now this is a good sized car it's on
large<00:03:51.549> windows<00:03:52.000> great<00:03:52.420> like<00:03:52.930> safety<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:54.040> you

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
large windows great like safety and you

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.440 
large windows great like safety and you
can<00:03:54.250> see<00:03:54.400> outside<00:03:54.549> you're<00:03:55.000> not<00:03:55.120> blocked<00:03:55.360> by

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
can see outside you're not blocked by

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.630 
can see outside you're not blocked by
anything<00:03:55.930> can<00:03:56.680> check<00:03:56.860> your<00:03:57.010> blind<00:03:57.250> spots

what are the non-negotiables air bags

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.210 
what are the non-negotiables air bags
it's<00:04:21.479> one<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.780> biggest<00:04:22.079> one<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.770> fact<00:04:23.040> is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
it's one of the biggest one the fact is

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.460 
it's one of the biggest one the fact is
that<00:04:23.250> t<00:04:23.669> players<00:04:23.940> have<00:04:24.180> 14%<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.930> licenses<00:04:25.440> and

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
that t players have 14% of licenses and

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.500 
that t players have 14% of licenses and
yet<00:04:25.800> they<00:04:25.949> still<00:04:26.010> account<00:04:26.490> for<00:04:26.550> 28%<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.389> all

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
yet they still account for 28% of all

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.570 
yet they still account for 28% of all
fatalities<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.620> buy<00:04:28.770> a<00:04:28.800> car<00:04:29.070> as<00:04:29.190> well<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.520> you

fatalities so buy a car as well that you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.070 
fatalities so buy a car as well that you
have<00:04:29.699> really<00:04:29.970> good<00:04:30.060> visibility<00:04:30.360> a<00:04:30.750> car<00:04:30.960> that

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080

steering wall goes up and down but also

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.320 
steering wall goes up and down but also
goes<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:34.919> out<00:04:35.010> because<00:04:35.729> of<00:04:35.910> particularly

airbags you've got the crumple zones
you've<00:04:48.300> got<00:04:48.479> the<00:04:48.600> best<00:04:48.720> chance<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.169> them

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
you've got the best chance of them

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:50.960 
you've got the best chance of them
getting<00:04:49.440> out<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.860> it<00:04:49.949> at<00:04:50.039> the<00:04:50.340> same<00:04:50.520> time<00:04:50.580> my

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
getting out of it at the same time my

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.610 
getting out of it at the same time my
suggestion<00:04:51.479> is<00:04:51.570> if<00:04:51.600> you<00:04:52.139> bought<00:04:52.320> a<00:04:52.380> new<00:04:52.590> car

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
suggestion is if you bought a new car

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.990 
suggestion is if you bought a new car
and<00:04:53.039> you've<00:04:53.220> thought<00:04:53.250> about<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.699> from<00:04:53.880> a

safety point of view nobody's actually
showing<00:04:56.520> you<00:04:56.639> how<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:56.789> drive<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.240> all<00:04:57.360> but<00:04:57.600> the

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
showing you how to drive it all but the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
safety features feel like when they're

safety features feel like when they're
activating<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.150> main<00:05:00.330> thing<00:05:00.479> we're

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
activating and the main thing we're

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.840 
activating and the main thing we're
trying<00:05:00.780> to<00:05:00.960> achieve<00:05:01.380> is<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:01.860> see<00:05:02.370> if<00:05:02.520> we<00:05:02.669> can

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
trying to achieve is that see if we can

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.070 
trying to achieve is that see if we can
show<00:05:03.060> you<00:05:03.120> that<00:05:03.270> when<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.449> all<00:05:03.630> goes<00:05:03.780> wrong

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
show you that when it all goes wrong

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.390 
show you that when it all goes wrong
we're<00:05:04.650> probably<00:05:04.860> going<00:05:05.099> to<00:05:05.190> make<00:05:05.340> some
