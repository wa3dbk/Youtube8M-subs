guys an update to my laval deck profile
this<00:00:07.950> deck<00:00:08.189> will<00:00:08.429> be<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.849> September<00:00:10.040> 2013

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
this deck will be for the September 2013

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.970 
this deck will be for the September 2013
bandulus<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.940> I've<00:00:12.450> modified<00:00:12.840> it<00:00:13.170> for<00:00:13.530> that

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
bandulus so I've modified it for that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.890 
bandulus so I've modified it for that
list<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.549> had<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> lot<00:00:14.940> of<00:00:14.969> changes<00:00:15.509> on<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.719> list

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
list we had a lot of changes on the list

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.930 
list we had a lot of changes on the list
so<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.830> return<00:00:17.160> I<00:00:17.220> had<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> make<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.699> lot<00:00:17.880> of

so in return I had to make a lot of
changes<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.660> laval<00:00:19.020> deck<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.529> thought

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
changes to my laval deck so I thought

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.230 
changes to my laval deck so I thought
I'd<00:00:19.830> give<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.279> guys<00:00:20.460> it's<00:00:21.000> still<00:00:21.210> a

pretty fun deck not too much was hit
that<00:00:23.760> really<00:00:24.060> affected<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.630> deck<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.439> we'll

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that really affected the deck so we'll

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.900 
that really affected the deck so we'll
go<00:00:25.680> ahead<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.890> get<00:00:26.039> started<00:00:26.130> go<00:00:26.580> through<00:00:26.789> the

which<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:45.030> rekindling<00:00:45.300> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
which is what you use the rekindling and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.900 
which is what you use the rekindling and
the<00:00:46.379> molten<00:00:46.620> conduction<00:00:47.070> field<00:00:47.309> helps<00:00:47.820> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
the molten conduction field helps you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.350 
the molten conduction field helps you
send<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> graves<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.200> run<00:00:49.320> 3

send it to the graves you got to run 3

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.150 
send it to the graves you got to run 3
but<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> most<00:00:51.600> important<00:00:51.989> monster<00:00:52.410> is<00:00:52.590> Laval

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
but the most important monster is Laval

but the most important monster is Laval
volcano<00:00:53.969> handmaiden<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:55.230> have<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.530> run<00:00:55.649> three

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
volcano handmaiden you have to run three

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.040 
volcano handmaiden you have to run three
of<00:00:56.039> her<00:00:56.190> because<00:00:57.059> pretty<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.329> when<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.780> use

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
of her because pretty much when you use

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.500 
of her because pretty much when you use
Mullen<00:00:58.620> conduction<00:00:59.100> field<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.879> send<00:01:00.210> one

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
Mullen conduction field you send one

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.009 
Mullen conduction field you send one
lava<00:01:01.109> magma<00:01:01.590> cannoneer<00:01:02.690> handmaiden<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.870> then

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
lava magma cannoneer handmaiden and then

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
lava magma cannoneer handmaiden and then
with<00:01:04.140> her<00:01:04.290> effect<00:01:04.619> she<00:01:04.799> sends<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.309> more

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
with her effect she sends one more

with her effect she sends one more
handmaiden<00:01:06.180> another<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.229> then<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.619> final

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
handmaiden another and then the final

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.780 
handmaiden another and then the final
cannoneer<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.600> sets<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.790> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
cannoneer so that sets you up for the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
cannoneer so that sets you up for the
rekindling<00:01:12.450> which<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.080> help<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.350> get

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
rekindling which will help you get

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
quasar out on the field and I'm also

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.190 
quasar out on the field and I'm also
running<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.770> lavale<00:01:17.340> lakeside<00:01:17.850> lady<00:01:18.200> mostly

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
running to lavale lakeside lady mostly

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
running to lavale lakeside lady mostly
run<00:01:19.380> her<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:20.159> pop<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.520> opponents<00:01:21.000> back<00:01:21.180> row<00:01:21.420> it
