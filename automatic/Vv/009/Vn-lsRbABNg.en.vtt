quiver<00:03:15.620> which<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.690> could<00:03:17.959> take<00:03:18.230> off<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:19.190> could

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
quiver which you could take off it could

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.090 
quiver which you could take off it could
come<00:03:19.880> off<00:03:20.060> kadeshi<00:03:20.420> super<00:03:20.690> piece<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.799> it's

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
come off kadeshi super piece I just it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.120 
come off kadeshi super piece I just it's
like<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.220> just<00:03:22.430> five<00:03:22.609> soft<00:03:23.030> plastics<00:03:23.930> crab<00:03:24.140> but

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
like a just five soft plastics crab but

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.530 
like a just five soft plastics crab but
no<00:03:25.430> need<00:03:25.609> no<00:03:25.940> need<00:03:25.970> to<00:03:27.459> UM<00:03:28.459> it<00:03:29.060> also<00:03:29.209> comes<00:03:29.420> with

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
no need no need to UM it also comes with

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.610 
no need no need to UM it also comes with
just<00:03:30.350> arrow<00:03:30.980> which<00:03:31.579> is<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:32.200> nice<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:33.470> we're

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
just arrow which is a nice so we're

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.750 
just arrow which is a nice so we're
paint<00:03:33.859> on<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.040> tip<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:34.609> at<00:03:35.150> purple<00:03:35.780> Quivers

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
paint on the tip there at purple Quivers

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.170 
paint on the tip there at purple Quivers
here<00:03:37.870> also<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.079> other<00:03:39.230> arrow<00:03:39.799> which<00:03:40.280> will<00:03:41.060> be

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
here also the other arrow which will be

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.460 
here also the other arrow which will be
coming<00:03:41.329> on<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.570> the<00:03:41.600> explosive<00:03:41.900> rounds<00:03:42.320> and

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
coming on to the explosive rounds and

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.330 
coming on to the explosive rounds and
it's<00:03:42.980> got<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:44.109> little<00:03:45.109> wasp<00:03:45.470> figure<00:03:45.950> just

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
it's got a little wasp figure just

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.810 
it's got a little wasp figure just
sitting<00:03:46.579> on<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:46.790> on<00:03:47.660> the<00:03:48.049> end<00:03:48.200> there<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:49.070> the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
sitting on it on the end there and the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.430 
sitting on it on the end there and the
reason<00:03:49.970> you<00:03:50.269> could<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.540> they<00:03:51.140> give<00:03:51.320> you<00:03:51.380> a

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
reason you could have they give you a

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.990 
reason you could have they give you a
little<00:03:51.590> plastic<00:03:52.569> what<00:03:53.569> kind<00:03:53.780> of<00:03:54.819> there's<00:03:55.819> no

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
little plastic what kind of there's no

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.479 
little plastic what kind of there's no
clear<00:03:56.269> rubber<00:03:56.480> band<00:03:56.780> things<00:03:57.079> go<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.859> little<00:03:58.340> bit

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
clear rubber band things go a little bit

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.380 
clear rubber band things go a little bit
thus<00:03:58.609> not<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.049> actually<00:04:00.140> use<00:04:00.560> that

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
thus not but you can actually use that

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.539 
thus not but you can actually use that
help<00:04:02.390> hold<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.690> in<00:04:02.780> his<00:04:02.870> hand<00:04:03.170> so<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.190> can<00:04:04.400> do

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:04.549 
help hold it in his hand so you can do

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:06.159 
help hold it in his hand so you can do
action<00:04:04.880> poses<00:04:05.060> which<00:04:05.449> you<00:04:05.630> know<00:04:05.720> kind<00:04:05.989> of<00:04:06.019> like
