00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
about debris or shrapnel going out that

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.320 
about debris or shrapnel going out that
way<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.220> pushes<00:02:26.760> out<00:02:26.910> this<00:02:27.120> way<00:02:27.269> so

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
way it just pushes out this way so

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.260 
way it just pushes out this way so
that's<00:02:27.900> really
