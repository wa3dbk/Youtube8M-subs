to<00:01:22.979> steal<00:01:23.189> as<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.430> talked<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> beginning

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
to steal as we talked to the beginning

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.929 
to steal as we talked to the beginning
into<00:01:24.450> that's<00:01:25.189> totally<00:01:26.189> tinker's<00:01:26.549> favorite

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
into that's totally tinker's favorite

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.929 
into that's totally tinker's favorite
college<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.369> had<00:01:29.460> known<00:01:29.610> how<00:01:29.790> many

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
college so if they had known how many

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.890 
college so if they had known how many
people<00:01:30.119> were<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.299> there<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.840> they

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
people were actually there I think they

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.999 
people were actually there I think they
would<00:01:31.020> have<00:01:31.049> committed<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.590> honest<00:01:31.829> but

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
would have committed to be honest but

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.289 
would have committed to be honest but
obviously<00:01:32.729> they<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> vision

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
obviously they don't have the vision

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.319 
obviously they don't have the vision
that<00:01:33.450> we<00:01:33.630> do<00:01:33.780> uh<00:01:34.430> well<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> think<00:01:35.670> Nabi<00:01:35.939> has<00:01:36.150> way
