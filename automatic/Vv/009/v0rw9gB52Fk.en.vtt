putting the archers and barbs in looks

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
putting the archers and barbs in looks
like<00:02:50.250> he's<00:02:50.370> very<00:02:50.430> hesitant<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.180> drop<00:02:51.450> all<00:02:51.690> this

troops<00:02:52.140> because<00:02:52.320> again<00:02:52.770> he<00:02:52.950> thinks<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.459> a

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
troops because again he thinks it's a

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.920 
troops because again he thinks it's a
trap<00:02:53.850> he's<00:02:54.060> not<00:02:54.209> sure<00:02:54.450> what's<00:02:54.690> going<00:02:54.840> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
trap he's not sure what's going to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.750 
trap he's not sure what's going to
happen<00:02:55.260> he<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:56.100> to<00:02:56.220> get<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.490> loot

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
happen he is going to get this loot

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
happen he is going to get this loot
though<00:02:56.970> because<00:02:57.360> there's<00:02:57.660> nothing<00:02:58.110> really

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
though because there's nothing really

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.110 
though because there's nothing really
stopping<00:02:58.709> him<00:02:58.950> once<00:02:59.340> he<00:02:59.430> gets<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.760> back

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
stopping him once he gets to the back

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.640 
stopping him once he gets to the back
layer<00:03:00.420> those<00:03:00.720> mortars<00:03:01.170> are<00:03:01.290> gonna<00:03:01.380> start

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
layer those mortars are gonna start

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.590 
layer those mortars are gonna start
firing<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.160> him<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.730> clan<00:03:02.970> castle<00:03:03.000> might

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
firing on him and the clan castle might

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.510 
firing on him and the clan castle might
come<00:03:03.870> out<00:03:03.990> but<00:03:04.590> I'm<00:03:04.709> thinking<00:03:04.980> at<00:03:05.070> that<00:03:05.190> point

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
come out but I'm thinking at that point

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.730 
come out but I'm thinking at that point
he'll<00:03:05.790> probably<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.150> do<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> final<00:03:07.110> rush<00:03:07.470> with

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
he'll probably just do a final rush with

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.620 
he'll probably just do a final rush with
his<00:03:07.860> barbarians<00:03:08.490> looks<00:03:08.940> like<00:03:09.090> right<00:03:09.270> now<00:03:09.420> he's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
his barbarians looks like right now he's

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.120 
his barbarians looks like right now he's
just<00:03:09.930> dropping<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.350> archers<00:03:10.740> which<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.100> a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
just dropping the archers which is a

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.370 
just dropping the archers which is a
great<00:03:11.520> idea<00:03:11.730> now<00:03:12.600> look<00:03:12.840> at<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.020> loot<00:03:13.170> he's

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
great idea now look at the loot he's

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.410 
great idea now look at the loot he's
already<00:03:13.770> at<00:03:14.040> half<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.580> million<00:03:14.940> roughly<00:03:15.150> of

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
already at half a million roughly of

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.229 
already at half a million roughly of
each<00:03:15.630> resource<00:03:16.050> and<00:03:16.380> he's<00:03:17.010> got<00:03:17.280> most<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.120> the

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
each resource and he's got most of the

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.660 
each resource and he's got most of the
dark<00:03:18.450> elixir<00:03:18.660> he's<00:03:19.200> got<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.410> storage<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.280> two

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
dark elixir he's got the storage and two

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.120 
dark elixir he's got the storage and two
dark<00:03:20.910> elixir<00:03:21.120> drills<00:03:21.660> which<00:03:22.110> holds<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.800> much

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
dark elixir drills which holds so much

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.509 
dark elixir drills which holds so much
so<00:03:23.970> he's<00:03:24.690> made<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.500> well<00:03:25.769> over<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.130> million

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
so he's made it well over a million

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.850 
so he's made it well over a million
total<00:03:26.910> but<00:03:27.360> he's<00:03:27.510> only<00:03:27.630> halfway<00:03:28.080> through<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
total but he's only halfway through the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.070 
total but he's only halfway through the
golden<00:03:29.250> elixir<00:03:29.519> he's<00:03:30.420> only<00:03:30.630> halfway<00:03:30.959> through

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
golden elixir he's only halfway through

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.990 
golden elixir he's only halfway through
it<00:03:31.290> he's<00:03:31.410> still<00:03:31.620> got<00:03:31.769> another<00:03:32.190> million

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
it he's still got another million

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.330 
it he's still got another million
combined<00:03:33.420> resources<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:34.170> go<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:35.160> he's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
combined resources to go now he's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.820 
combined resources to go now he's
running<00:03:35.610> low<00:03:35.910> on<00:03:35.940> troops<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.019> think

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
running low on troops but I do think

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.770 
running low on troops but I do think
he's<00:03:38.100> saving<00:03:38.519> them<00:03:38.610> for<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.850> final<00:03:39.180> push<00:03:39.480> let's

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
he's saving them for a final push let's

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.920 
he's saving them for a final push let's
see<00:03:40.110> what<00:03:40.410> happens<00:03:40.830> here<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:42.150> looks<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
see what happens here now looks like

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.300 
see what happens here now looks like
he's<00:03:43.019> starting<00:03:43.290> to<00:03:43.320> drop<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.709> barbarians

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
he's starting to drop the barbarians

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.979 
he's starting to drop the barbarians
that's<00:03:44.549> good<00:03:44.790> because<00:03:44.970> he<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.299> on<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> final

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
that's good because he is on the final

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.630 
that's good because he is on the final
layer<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.350> mortars<00:03:46.709> are<00:03:46.860> starting<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.340> come

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
layer the mortars are starting to come

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.300 
layer the mortars are starting to come
into<00:03:47.790> play<00:03:47.880> and<00:03:48.390> soon<00:03:48.959> the<00:03:49.500> clan<00:03:49.950> castle<00:03:49.980> will

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
into play and soon the clan castle will

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.100 
into play and soon the clan castle will
come<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.580> as<00:03:50.700> well<00:03:50.880> I<00:03:51.120> have<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.450> lot<00:03:51.660> of<00:03:51.690> pesky

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
come out as well I have a lot of pesky

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.930 
come out as well I have a lot of pesky
troops<00:03:52.380> in<00:03:52.530> there<00:03:52.680> looks<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.070> archers<00:03:53.730> and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
troops in there looks like archers and

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.180 
troops in there looks like archers and
minions<00:03:54.780> those<00:03:55.140> are<00:03:55.290> pretty<00:03:55.410> hard<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.950> take

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
minions those are pretty hard to take

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.250 
minions those are pretty hard to take
out<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.610> he's<00:03:57.000> just<00:03:57.030> gonna<00:03:57.299> spam<00:03:57.660> them<00:03:57.840> let's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.770 
out so he's just gonna spam them let's
go<00:03:58.640> hopefully<00:03:59.640> he<00:03:59.760> drops<00:04:00.000> his<00:04:00.120> clan<00:04:00.360> castle<00:04:00.540> as

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780

go hopefully he drops his clan castle as
well<00:04:00.989> I<00:04:01.019> don't<00:04:01.200> know<00:04:01.380> what's<00:04:01.590> in<00:04:01.739> there<00:04:01.950> but

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
well I don't know what's in there but

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.979 
well I don't know what's in there but
looks<00:04:02.370> like<00:04:02.459> he<00:04:02.700> got<00:04:02.880> almost<00:04:03.269> all<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.750> loot

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
looks like he got almost all the loot

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.289 
looks like he got almost all the loot
yet<00:04:04.620> what<00:04:05.010> there's<00:04:05.459> still<00:04:05.700> two<00:04:05.940> hundred

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
yet what there's still two hundred

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.390 
yet what there's still two hundred
thousand<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.870> each<00:04:07.110> I<00:04:07.410> guess<00:04:07.830> it's<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.160> just

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
thousand of each I guess it's in just

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.850 
thousand of each I guess it's in just
these<00:04:08.549> few<00:04:09.000> mines<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.900> pumps<00:04:10.200> here<00:04:10.410> my

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
these few mines and pumps here my

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.130 
these few mines and pumps here my
minions<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.580> archers<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.180> such<00:04:12.750> are<00:04:12.989> gonna

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
minions and archers and such are gonna

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.750 
minions and archers and such are gonna
take<00:04:13.410> out<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> rest<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.920> his<00:04:13.980> troops<00:04:14.220> he's<00:04:14.580> not

take out the rest of his troops he's not

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.520 
take out the rest of his troops he's not
gonna<00:04:14.910> make<00:04:15.120> it<00:04:15.180> much<00:04:15.420> farther<00:04:15.660> thirty-eight

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
gonna make it much farther thirty-eight

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.960 
gonna make it much farther thirty-eight
percent<00:04:16.709> he<00:04:17.430> got<00:04:17.640> almost<00:04:18.359> 1<00:04:18.750> million<00:04:19.260> gold

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
percent he got almost 1 million gold

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.180 
percent he got almost 1 million gold
just<00:04:20.970> shy<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.239> 1<00:04:21.570> million<00:04:21.750> elixir<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.950> dark

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
just shy of 1 million elixir the dark

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.740 
just shy of 1 million elixir the dark
elixir<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.610> wish<00:04:23.880> he<00:04:24.030> had<00:04:24.120> gotten<00:04:24.270> more<00:04:24.570> of

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
elixir I wish he had gotten more of

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.840 
elixir I wish he had gotten more of
because<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.229> don't<00:04:25.500> need

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
because I don't need

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.940 
because I don't need
he<00:04:26.090> probably<00:04:26.330> does<00:04:26.600> need<00:04:26.780> it<00:04:26.930> but<00:04:27.080> still<00:04:27.470> this

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
he probably does need it but still this

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.460 
he probably does need it but still this
was<00:04:28.190> probably<00:04:28.520> enough<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.270> make<00:04:29.450> his<00:04:29.660> day<00:04:29.960> his

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
was probably enough to make his day his

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.680 
was probably enough to make his day his
year<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.250> mean<00:04:31.640> he's<00:04:31.850> not<00:04:32.090> going<00:04:32.330> to<00:04:32.390> forget

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690
