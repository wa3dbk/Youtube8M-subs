00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 and I want to play here and committed 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.710
 This is the first child in my series. 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.130
 talking about my impressions of the 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.980
 game fifa 16 for those who do not know the beta 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.619
 of the game happened until the 23rd 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.289
 and I had the opportunity to play for 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.689
 About three days I did more than 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 30 matches in this short serious I'll talk 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.769
 about some elements of the game that I 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 I think it's worth it 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.219
 You guys know about fifa 16 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.620
 mainly online was a 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.630
 so I played an online kit my 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.329
 first subject the first thing I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.020
 I want to talk about fifa 16 then 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.860
 played 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 these 30 matches or more is about the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.230
 speed because before I played the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.809
 game when you had a video of someone 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.239
 speaking that he had played the game at 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.680
 first thing we wanted to know was about 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.489
 speed what happened to 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.070
 velocity 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.039
 if they fixed the speed cia has 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.960
 those damn corridors I wanted 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.299
 know about this many of the people who 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 they played the game always roll and do not talk 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.549
 on this subject I talk about the 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.250
 speed on the run ended or 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.380
 It's not as personal as I said it. 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.530
 played for over 30 matches in the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 ultimate team online for fifa 16 in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.840
 none of these matches had a rush 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 they modified someone play and stayed 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.740
 much fairer is obvious even though you 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 can run in fast players 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.280
 Can you use speed but not speed? 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.119
 the way it was in fifa and is 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.200
 much like fifa 14 you have 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.470
 fast players 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.220
 yes you can use speed yes but 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.590
 you can not appeal the way you 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.939
 You appealed to ipca 15 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.360
 you can not mount the midfield 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.759
 rush in with a shot count 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.909
 mistake of all that crap 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.149
 happening fifa 15 this does not happen in 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.940
 River 16 I tried several times I 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.450
 I tried the fast players to see if 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.950
 it worked to hold it 's out with 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.910
 stir for one lot of things nothing 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 folks 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.000
 nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing happened, and I 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.130
 I was very much happier than this. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.590
 change has happened because for me in 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.920
 my opinion the biggest problem of fifa 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.069
 15 was the rush is the rush is 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.520
 complicated because the match 90% fifa 15 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.950
 online would only help fast players 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:42.150
 You play Ultimate Team against the same 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.180
 teams all the time and this ended up in fifa 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.180
 16 at least in personal beta open 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.040
 of the game is neither the demo or the game 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.459
 it's not ready yet they can 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.950
 well change everything 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.850
 game to get faster in beta 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:02.280
 No, I'm not going to run. 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.440
 I tried to do no rush I played 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.390
 against players who used the players 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.920
 fast but no problem happened 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.810
 those moves runnin 'nuts do not 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.150
 Happened then stays here for everyone. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.930
 who are in doubt if there will be 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.410
 I would run in fifa 16 the answer is not so 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.500
 less in beta nothing to run anything 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 fast crap player taking advantage 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.110
 All the time in the beta nothing personal I 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.570
 I'm almost positive that I'm going. 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.660
 keep this gameplay pro game final 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.720
 so I can say with my mouth full it's over 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.700
 just to run if you played fifa 15 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.090
 and set up a team with an embargo of 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.320
 harvey wine and unb at the attack and your 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.820
 game was only that in fifa 16 and will have 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.190
 to learn to do something different 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.299
 Why can not you appeal more? 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.459
 this folks this is the first video 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.760
 talking about their impressions of 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.350
 ultimate team pro fifa 16 beta 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.780
 Be very clear, the beta is not mine. 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.500
 We have too many things to change. 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.650
 Teak talking about talking speed 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.900
 about speed abuse did not 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.970
 As I said, it's over then this is the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.299
