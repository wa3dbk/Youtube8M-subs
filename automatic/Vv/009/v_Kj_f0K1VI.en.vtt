ten<00:02:26.730> fifteen<00:02:27.150> dollars<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.890> invest<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.459> about

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
ten fifteen dollars you invest in about

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.040 
ten fifteen dollars you invest in about
twenty<00:02:30.239> dollars<00:02:30.600> into<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.989> microphone<00:02:31.380> and

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
twenty dollars into a microphone and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.360 
twenty dollars into a microphone and
honestly<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.290> lot<00:02:34.440> better<00:02:34.620> than<00:02:34.950> any<00:02:35.280> kind

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
honestly it's a lot better than any kind

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.960 
honestly it's a lot better than any kind
of<00:02:35.670> stand<00:02:35.940> alone<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.269> get<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.900> lot<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.290> um

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
of stand alone you get and a lot of um

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.420 
of stand alone you get and a lot of um
us<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.269> lot<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> headset<00:02:40.560> microphones<00:02:41.130> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
us a lot of the headset microphones it

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.059 
us a lot of the headset microphones it
is<00:02:41.610> better<00:02:41.910> than<00:02:42.209> them<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.950> hopefully<00:02:43.950> you

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
is better than them and hopefully you

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.800 
is better than them and hopefully you
can<00:02:44.250> hear<00:02:44.670> it<00:02:44.819> I'm<00:02:45.230> not<00:02:46.230> sure<00:02:46.290> if<00:02:46.980> you<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.400> and

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
can hear it I'm not sure if you can and

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.180 
can hear it I'm not sure if you can and
well<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.519> tried<00:02:50.519> my<00:02:50.700> best<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.030> show<00:02:51.299> it<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:55.190> this

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
well I tried my best to show it now this

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.410 
well I tried my best to show it now this
is<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> reason<00:02:56.790> that<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:56.970> don't<00:02:57.090> use<00:02:57.390> a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
is the reason that you don't use a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.050 
is the reason that you don't use a
handheld<00:02:57.870> every<00:02:58.739> single<00:02:59.250> movement<00:02:59.519> you<00:02:59.819> make

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
handheld every single movement you make

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.050 
handheld every single movement you make
on<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> microphone<00:03:00.739> even<00:03:01.739> if<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.489> hear

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
on a microphone even if you don't hear

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.240 
on a microphone even if you don't hear
it<00:03:03.150> even<00:03:03.630> if<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.080> seems<00:03:04.410> like<00:03:04.650> it's<00:03:04.980> an

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
it even if it just seems like it's an

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.220 
it even if it just seems like it's an
innocent<00:03:05.790> thing<00:03:06.060> like<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.019> probably

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
innocent thing like you can probably

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.500 
innocent thing like you can probably
hear<00:03:10.560> that<00:03:10.769> perfectly<00:03:11.700> in<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:11.940> microphone

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
hear that perfectly in this microphone

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.660 
hear that perfectly in this microphone
no<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:14.549> isn't<00:03:14.730> -<00:03:15.390> ah<00:03:15.780> damn<00:03:16.650> it<00:03:16.799> it's<00:03:17.340> hard<00:03:17.579> to

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
no that isn't - ah damn it it's hard to

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.490 
no that isn't - ah damn it it's hard to
say<00:03:17.850> this<00:03:18.180> microphone<00:03:18.690> maybe<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:21.350> don't<00:03:22.350> know

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
say this microphone maybe I don't know

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.289 
say this microphone maybe I don't know
how<00:03:22.680> much<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:23.130> weighs<00:03:23.310> maybe<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.700> pound<00:03:24.060> or

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
how much this weighs maybe a pound or

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.870 
how much this weighs maybe a pound or
something<00:03:24.780> it<00:03:25.109> feels<00:03:25.920> great<00:03:26.370> in<00:03:26.579> your<00:03:26.609> hand

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
something it feels great in your hand

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.430 
something it feels great in your hand
plastic<00:03:27.750> on<00:03:27.930> this<00:03:28.200> feels<00:03:28.829> like<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.870> has<00:03:31.170> weight

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
plastic on this feels like it has weight

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.940 
plastic on this feels like it has weight
to<00:03:31.709> it<00:03:31.829> and<00:03:32.100> this<00:03:32.640> mesh<00:03:33.030> here<00:03:33.660> I'm<00:03:34.320> not<00:03:34.620> exactly

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
to it and this mesh here I'm not exactly

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.050 
to it and this mesh here I'm not exactly
sure<00:03:35.310> what<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.640> is<00:03:36.500> it<00:03:37.500> might<00:03:37.769> be<00:03:38.130> plastic<00:03:38.820> it

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
sure what it is it might be plastic it

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.130 
sure what it is it might be plastic it
might<00:03:39.450> be<00:03:39.750> metal<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:41.120> can't<00:03:42.120> be<00:03:42.299> sure<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.780> just

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
might be metal I can't be sure and just

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.020 
might be metal I can't be sure and just
like<00:03:43.290> I<00:03:43.440> can't<00:03:43.799> be<00:03:43.950> sure<00:03:43.980> what<00:03:44.160> this<00:03:44.579> one<00:03:44.760> here

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
like I can't be sure what this one here

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.780 
like I can't be sure what this one here
is<00:03:45.150> I<00:03:45.420> think<00:03:45.450> it's<00:03:46.140> metal<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:47.579> whole

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
is I think it's metal the whole

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.569 
is I think it's metal the whole
microphone<00:03:48.359> is<00:03:48.600> metal<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:50.250> have<00:03:50.430> no

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
microphone is metal but I have no

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.569 
microphone is metal but I have no
fucking<00:03:51.000> clue<00:03:51.030> with<00:03:51.359> that<00:03:51.540> um<00:03:51.900> meshes<00:03:52.859> same

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
fucking clue with that um meshes same

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.539 
fucking clue with that um meshes same
thing<00:03:53.819> goes<00:03:54.000> here<00:03:54.109> it's<00:03:55.109> probably<00:03:55.829> plastic

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
thing goes here it's probably plastic

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.900 
thing goes here it's probably plastic
but<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:57.030> really<00:03:57.569> don't<00:03:57.810> know<00:03:58.069> now<00:03:59.069> I<00:03:59.519> probably

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
but I really don't know now I probably

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.789 
but I really don't know now I probably
gave<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.390> enough<00:04:00.630> tests<00:04:00.989> with<00:04:01.350> me<00:04:01.560> just

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
gave you enough tests with me just

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.759 
gave you enough tests with me just
holding<00:04:02.190> it<00:04:02.840> there's<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.900> reason<00:04:04.290> that<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:04.440> use<00:04:04.739> a

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
holding it there's a reason that I use a

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.650 
holding it there's a reason that I use a
path<00:04:05.100> guard<00:04:05.430> whenever<00:04:05.609> I<00:04:05.850> make<00:04:06.030> videos<00:04:06.450> and

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
path guard whenever I make videos and

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.809 
path guard whenever I make videos and
that's<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.200> these<00:04:07.950> microphones<00:04:08.519> will

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
that's because these microphones will

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.319 
that's because these microphones will
pick<00:04:09.180> up<00:04:09.359> whatever<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:10.019> fuck<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.530> um<00:04:10.829> any

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
pick up whatever the fuck you um any

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:14.390 
pick up whatever the fuck you um any
kind<00:04:12.329> of<00:04:12.420> wind<00:04:12.630> that<00:04:12.840> comes<00:04:13.079> out<00:04:13.319> your<00:04:14.130> voice

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
kind of wind that comes out your voice

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.770 
kind of wind that comes out your voice
any<00:04:14.909> breath<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.140> make<00:04:16.380> it'll<00:04:17.220> pick<00:04:17.549> it<00:04:17.700> up<00:04:17.820> and

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
any breath you make it'll pick it up and

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.080 
any breath you make it'll pick it up and
sensitive<00:04:20.780> is<00:04:21.199> an<00:04:22.099> understatement<00:04:22.699> with

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
sensitive is an understatement with

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.990 
sensitive is an understatement with
these<00:04:23.349> the<00:04:24.349> audio<00:04:24.979> coming<00:04:25.400> from<00:04:25.430> these<00:04:25.759> is

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
these the audio coming from these is

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.689 
these the audio coming from these is
almost<00:04:26.300> unusable<00:04:26.860> if<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:27.949> don't<00:04:28.159> have<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> pop

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
almost unusable if you don't have a pop

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.029 
almost unusable if you don't have a pop
guard<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.300> used<00:04:30.050> to<00:04:30.169> not<00:04:30.289> give<00:04:30.650> a<00:04:30.680> shit<00:04:31.009> about

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
guard I used to not give a shit about

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.689 
guard I used to not give a shit about
that<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.409> well<00:04:33.409> thankfully<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.009> changed

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
that and well thankfully I changed

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.179 
that and well thankfully I changed
because<00:04:35.569> this<00:04:36.080> microphone<00:04:36.590> wasn't<00:04:36.979> cutting

00:04:37.179 --> 00:04:37.189 
because this microphone wasn't cutting

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.800 
because this microphone wasn't cutting
it<00:04:37.400> for<00:04:37.639> my<00:04:37.909> normal<00:04:37.969> use<00:04:38.569> is<00:04:38.840> why<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.620> got<00:04:39.949> this

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
it for my normal use is why I got this
