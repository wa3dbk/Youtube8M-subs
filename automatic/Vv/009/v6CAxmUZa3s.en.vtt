 we will have zero 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.310

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.360
 knowledge routine fasting and currency 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.150
 euro 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.610
 let's local income 0 and for 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.800
 start we have to fight to fight 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.570
 we go here to battle another thing to say 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.500
 is that to pass it to Spanish we're going 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.580
 by clicking here 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.580
 and spanish 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.040
 and we are going to battle 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.070
 and here is the page of battles and today 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:03.790
 He has fought 5 times so I still have left 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.880
 five and well we can fight ten times 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.090
 per day because he has fought we are going to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:14.070
 remove 10% 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 of energy energy and if we win a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.359
 battle a fight the loser is going to be 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.280
 our referral for a day and if 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:24.200
 we lose we are going to be referred 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.770
 of him or the enemy for a day 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.259
 to attack we must attack here 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:33.890
 and here is what is the information 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.159

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.170
 what we do and what the enemy 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.240

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.850
 participated in sand and claimed to be with 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.900
 a little further beyond that 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.890
 It takes a lot of gold and good 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.410
 here is what is the total defenses 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.030

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.909
 people who have to have a minor 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.479
 defense or attack that we 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.930

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 It takes 10 minutes between 8 minutes and 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.190

00:02:52.880 --> 00:03:01.310
 work and well we can work once 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.720
 every 24 hours here we can also see 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.030
 what is the formula to get the 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.550
 productivity that is energy more 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.220
 experience more knowledge 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.870
 dividing it by dividing it by 3 pull out 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.210
 our productivity that if not that 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.330
 can be here because here is if not 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.340
 they want to take it out 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.100
 and here we can work for the person 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.970
 who is giving more salary in your company 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.450
 we can see how much we are going to receive 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:32.060
 taking this is the salary shown by 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.060
 productivity and divide it by 1000 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.030
 to work is to work if here 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:43.470
 leaves work 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.330
 I do not plan here and it's ready to say that 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.440
 every three days of consecutive work 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.300
 or followed 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:54.040
 come on now we will receive a bonus 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.040
 when we work we also win 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.159
 we gained experience points 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:05.870
 If we do not have referrals, we will receive 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.980
 0.7 points 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.500

 yes yes we have an active reference 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.909
 we will gain a point if we have a 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.370
 reference two active references we're going 

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:21.370

 We will receive 2.5 if we have more than 5 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.530
