going<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.160> look<00:00:17.400> at<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> transition<00:00:18.869> that

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
going to look at is a transition that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.710 
going to look at is a transition that
moves<00:00:19.289> us<00:00:19.529> from<00:00:19.859> part<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.400> into<00:00:21.029> part<00:00:21.269> two<00:00:21.449> and

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
moves us from part one into part two and

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.749 
moves us from part one into part two and
it<00:00:21.839> starts<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.259> the<00:00:22.289> B<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.859> above<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> and

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
it starts on the B just above that a and

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.849 
it starts on the B just above that a and
goes<00:00:23.999> up<00:00:24.179> to<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.419> e<00:00:24.449> above<00:00:25.169> that<00:00:25.349> and<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.650> start

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
goes up to the e above that and we start

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.560 
goes up to the e above that and we start
with<00:00:25.949> our<00:00:26.009> thumb<00:00:26.339> on<00:00:26.369> B<00:00:26.669> and<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.150> go<00:00:27.269> up<00:00:27.390> one

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
with our thumb on B and just go up one

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.620 
with our thumb on B and just go up one
finger<00:00:27.900> at<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> time<00:00:28.140> b<00:00:28.769> c<00:00:29.279> d<00:00:29.519> e<00:00:29.669> ending<00:00:30.329> on<00:00:30.480> our

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
finger at a time b c d e ending on our

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.800 
finger at a time b c d e ending on our
fourth<00:00:30.869> finger<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.529> sounds<00:00:31.800> like<00:00:31.919> this

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
fourth finger and it sounds like this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.260 
fourth finger and it sounds like this
and<00:00:33.810> from<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> transition<00:00:35.220> we<00:00:35.670> move<00:00:35.879> into<00:00:36.090> a

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and from that transition we move into a

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.090 
and from that transition we move into a
pattern<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.840> looks<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.469> notice<00:00:37.800> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
pattern that looks like this notice the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
pattern that looks like this notice the
low<00:00:38.309> G<00:00:38.340> below<00:00:38.910> and<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.359> the<00:00:39.480> three<00:00:39.719> notes

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
low G below and then the three notes

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.810 
low G below and then the three notes
above<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.379> D<00:00:40.649> E<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.100> F<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.609> going<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
above it D E and F and you're going to

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
above it D E and F and you're going to
see<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.059> this<00:00:42.269> structure<00:00:42.600> actually<00:00:42.960> repeats

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
see that this structure actually repeats

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.740 
see that this structure actually repeats
itself<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.489> next<00:00:44.699> few<00:00:44.940> sections<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
itself over the next few sections and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.029 
itself over the next few sections and
how<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.140> play<00:00:46.320> through<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.739> is

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
starting with our thumb on the G going

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.020 
starting with our thumb on the G going
up<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.679> F<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.039> our<00:00:50.190> pinky<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.699> working

into<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.140> first<00:01:28.350> part<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.770> learned<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
into the first part we learned in the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
into the first part we learned in the
last<00:01:29.490> video<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.240> transition<00:01:30.780> involves

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
last video and this transition involves

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.690 
last video and this transition involves
playing<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.439> simple<00:01:31.649> pattern<00:01:32.159> over<00:01:32.490> each

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
playing a simple pattern over each

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
playing a simple pattern over each
octaves<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.200> thumb<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.950> with<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
octaves to with the thumb one with the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.920 
octaves to with the thumb one with the
pinky<00:01:35.610> then<00:01:35.880> jumping<00:01:36.180> up<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> next<00:01:36.780> octave

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
pinky then jumping up to the next octave

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.630 
pinky then jumping up to the next octave
two<00:01:37.350> with<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.590> thumb<00:01:37.770> one<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> pinky

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
two with the thumb one with the pinky

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.810 
two with the thumb one with the pinky
like<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
like this

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.060 
like this
you'll<00:01:41.720> notice<00:01:41.930> that<00:01:42.050> our<00:01:42.320> piano<00:01:42.620> doesn't

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
you'll notice that our piano doesn't

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.830 
you'll notice that our piano doesn't
have<00:01:43.220> that<00:01:43.460> top<00:01:43.729> e<00:01:43.970> but<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:44.390> simply<00:01:44.630> the<00:01:44.810> e

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
have that top e but it's simply the e

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.480 
have that top e but it's simply the e
the<00:01:45.170> next<00:01:45.409> octave<00:01:45.740> up<00:01:45.890> remember<00:01:46.280> that's<00:01:46.430> the

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
the next octave up remember that's the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.280 
the next octave up remember that's the
two<00:01:46.700> E's<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.150> repeat<00:01:47.479> are<00:01:47.690> always<00:01:47.990> done<00:01:48.110> with

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
two E's that repeat are always done with

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.660 
two E's that repeat are always done with
your<00:01:48.409> thumb<00:01:48.650> the<00:01:48.830> whole<00:01:48.979> right<00:01:49.220> hand<00:01:49.460> part

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
your thumb the whole right hand part

00:01:49.670 --> 00:02:00.820 
your thumb the whole right hand part
together<00:01:49.850> sounds<00:01:50.540> like<00:01:50.690> this

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.710 

now<00:02:01.400> let's<00:02:01.640> take<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:01.850> look<00:02:02.060> at<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> left<00:02:02.480> hand

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
now let's take a look at the left hand

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.450 
now let's take a look at the left hand
the<00:02:02.930> left<00:02:03.140> hand<00:02:03.380> in<00:02:03.500> this<00:02:03.620> second<00:02:04.010> part<00:02:04.190> is

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
the left hand in this second part is

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.280 
the left hand in this second part is
very<00:02:04.700> similar<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.450> left<00:02:05.660> hand<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:06.110> the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
very similar to the left hand in the

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.510 
very similar to the left hand in the
first<00:02:06.500> part<00:02:06.710> we<00:02:06.770> learn<00:02:07.010> we're<00:02:07.250> going<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.430> be

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
first part we learn we're going to be

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
first part we learn we're going to be
playing<00:02:07.760> CGC<00:02:08.720> like<00:02:09.020> this<00:02:09.260> and<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.770> in<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
playing CGC like this and like in the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.380 
playing CGC like this and like in the
last<00:02:10.190> video<00:02:10.400> we're<00:02:10.790> going<00:02:10.880> to<00:02:10.940> go<00:02:11.090> bottom

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
last video we're going to go bottom

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.450 
last video we're going to go bottom
Middle<00:02:11.900> top<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.440> we're<00:02:12.560> going<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.710> play<00:02:12.950> pinky

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
Middle top and we're going to play pinky

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.240 
Middle top and we're going to play pinky
index<00:02:13.730> finger<00:02:14.420> thumb<00:02:14.690> or<00:02:14.900> 521<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.160> going

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
index finger thumb or 521 and it's going

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.990 
index finger thumb or 521 and it's going
to<00:02:16.340> sound<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:18.490> then<00:02:19.490> all<00:02:19.790> we're<00:02:19.910> going

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
to sound like this then all we're going

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000 
to sound like this then all we're going
to<00:02:20.120> do<00:02:20.270> is<00:02:20.420> move<00:02:20.600> the<00:02:20.780> C's<00:02:21.020> down<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.470> B's<00:02:21.710> I'm

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
to do is move the C's down to B's I'm

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.410 
to do is move the C's down to B's I'm
going<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.220> keep<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> G<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.850> middle<00:02:22.970> and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
going to keep the G in the middle and

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.270 
going to keep the G in the middle and
play<00:02:23.660> through<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:23.990> in<00:02:24.080> the<00:02:24.200> same<00:02:24.470> way<00:02:24.500> pinky

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
play through it in the same way pinky

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.760 
play through it in the same way pinky
index<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.240> bottom<00:02:26.720> Middle<00:02:27.020> top<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.500> it'll

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
index the bottom Middle top and it'll

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.300 
index the bottom Middle top and it'll
sound<00:02:27.950> like<00:02:28.070> this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
sound like this

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.949 
sound like this

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
then we're going to play a part that's

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.839 
then we're going to play a part that's
exactly<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.739> same<00:02:32.950> as<00:02:33.010> what<00:02:33.400> we<00:02:33.489> learned<00:02:33.730> in

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
exactly the same as what we learned in

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.570 
exactly the same as what we learned in
the<00:02:33.940> last<00:02:33.970> video<00:02:34.300> and<00:02:34.720> that's<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.050> e<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.770> again

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
the last video and that's a e a again

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.000 
the last video and that's a e a again
bottom<00:02:37.000> Middle<00:02:37.300> top<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.900> this

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
bottom Middle top like this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.710 
bottom Middle top like this
and<00:02:40.489> here's<00:02:40.700> where<00:02:40.849> we<00:02:41.000> begin<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:41.450> transition

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
and here's where we begin the transition

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.350 
and here's where we begin the transition
back<00:02:42.319> into<00:02:42.349> the<00:02:42.680> first<00:02:42.980> part<00:02:43.310> by<00:02:43.819> playing<00:02:44.060> E

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
back into the first part by playing E

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.899 
back into the first part by playing E
octaves<00:02:45.019> bottom<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.220> middle<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.819> then

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:46.909 
octaves bottom the middle and then

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.880 
octaves bottom the middle and then
coming<00:02:47.239> in<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.510> borrowing<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.200> same<00:02:48.440> ethat

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
coming in and borrowing the same ethat

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.530 
coming in and borrowing the same ethat
our<00:02:49.010> right<00:02:49.220> hand<00:02:49.430> was<00:02:49.580> playing<00:02:49.849> earlier<00:02:50.180> like

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
our right hand was playing earlier like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.190 
our right hand was playing earlier like
this<00:02:52.330> now<00:02:53.330> we're<00:02:53.480> going<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.629> put<00:02:53.810> both<00:02:54.019> those

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
this now we're going to put both those

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.990 
this now we're going to put both those
parts<00:02:54.560> together<00:02:54.739> and<00:02:55.159> then<00:02:55.430> we're<00:02:55.549> also<00:02:55.700> going

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
parts together and then we're also going

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.809 
parts together and then we're also going
to<00:02:56.209> take<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.569> transition<00:02:57.170> back<00:02:57.620> into<00:02:57.819> the

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
to take the transition back into the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.610 
to take the transition back into the
section<00:02:59.209> we<00:02:59.299> learned<00:02:59.330> in<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.810> last<00:02:59.840> video<00:03:00.230> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
section we learned in the last video and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.720 
section we learned in the last video and
you'll<00:03:00.739> see<00:03:00.890> how<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.069> bring<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.459> all<00:03:01.580> together

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
you'll see how we bring it all together

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:26.860 
you'll see how we bring it all together
to<00:03:02.030> end<00:03:02.330> it'll<00:03:02.690> sound<00:03:02.930> like<00:03:03.110> this
