00:00:04.367 --> 00:00:05.300
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.833
 We continue to learn from team operations 

00:00:07.933 --> 00:00:11.967
 Today we will discuss how to refresh the point battle at the bottom of the map Mines. 

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.600
 As usual, the Slide of the Na'Vi team made this suggestion to me. 

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:30.100
 Fast chariots, good chariots on the elevations, and tanks with hard turrets will take the lead on the map of Mines. 

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:34.167
 In this lineup, the two statistics behind us are relatively low. 

00:00:34.267 --> 00:00:39.433
 Because many teams often choose five heavy tanks, our flexibility is usually better. 

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.200
 Let's start with this example. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.867
 For example, the enemy has two 1st-order chariots and five heavy-duty chariots. 

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:54.533
 In this case, we sent 90 to the hill and sent IS-3 to cover it, and to cover it, IS had to go to the F4 position immediately and aim at the E5 position. 

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:57.733
 AMX 50 100 remains concealed but cannot leave too far 

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.267
 We sent T1 to the islands in the H1 area and the houses in the F8 area. 

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.533
 Then wait for the message of the scout car 

00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.800
 90 found several chariots in the center of the map 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 In this case, there will be three options for the next step. 

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:11.300
 The first 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.600
 The opponent has occupied the position in the D5 area 

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.300
 Suddenly, one of our heavy-duty tanks was shot, and the shells were shot from the island. 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.267
 This means that there is at least one enemy 8th-order chariot on the water's edge. 

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:24.867
 We immediately rushed to the map center because we have a quantitative advantage 

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.900
 5 to 4, attack... Hey! 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.967
 Then killing the last 8th-order chariot is not a problem. 

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:37.433
 It is very important to remember where the chariot will shoot from the island, avoid these places and maintain a 5 to 4 situation. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.067
 Second choice 

00:01:39.167 --> 00:01:41.233
 The enemy rushes to the center of the map 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.833
 In this case, we hide the 90 in a safe place, but still in the mountains 

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.767
 In this case, the scout car can survive and distract the enemy’s attention. 

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:56.000
 If the enemy goes to the mountains, then we send heavy tanks to shoot their sides and fight back. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.167
 IS-3 absorbs shells, AMX 50 100 deals damage, 90 shoots from the other side to lure enemies 

00:02:03.267 --> 00:02:05.533
 Try to let the enemy point the turret to himself 

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:08.300
 Focusing on firepower, victory belongs to us. 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.767
 If the enemy rushes to the center and bottom of the map without going up the mountain, then our 90 should quickly attack them from the flanks. 

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:17.633
 Do your best to inflict damage on enemies 

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:24.000
 We aim at the fuel tank and ignite it! 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.833
 It's important to keep 50-100 behind IS-3 so they won't be killed when the enemy starts attacking. 

00:02:29.933 --> 00:02:34.800
 Remember that each autoloader must fire at least one shell of the magazine at the enemy. 

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:40.367
 If all the players do what they need to do, then the enemy has no chance. 

00:02:40.967 --> 00:02:41.967
 Third choice 

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:44.600
 Enemies occupy positions near their base 

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:47.033
 In this case, we have to sweat very much. 

00:02:47.133 --> 00:02:49.567
 At this point we need to rely on 13 90 

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:53.600
 His mission is to scrutinize and shoot at the time of shooting. 

00:02:54.267 --> 00:03:02.567
 Pay attention to the correct approach - the path we drive 90 should ensure that there are constant rocks between him and the enemies that may appear in the A4 area. 

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.267
 From here he can shoot in parts of the C4 and D5 areas. 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:13.900
 By the way, even if you don’t find a chariot in the bushes of the C4 area, you should blindly shoot here. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.433
 When you leave here, return as you like. 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.633
 When the 90s perform their missions on the mountain, IS-3 will play their role as a solid turret in the center of the map. 

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:28.967
 At this stage, our team's mission is to act as carefully as possible and strive to gain a blood volume advantage. 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.633
 Don't forget to play the role of T1 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.133
 If you find that the enemy is securely protected - propel to the side 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.467
 We carefully sent the scout to the island and sent a 50-100 to cover it from the map center. 

00:03:40.633 --> 00:03:44.367
 The second T1 enters the village under the cover of 90 

00:03:44.567 --> 00:03:51.900
 The goal of T1 is to approach the enemy and actively investigate, but you must first remove the enemy's T1. 

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:59.600
 Because of this, we can move freely and contain the enemy, because the enemy’s flanks will have no obstacles. 

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:05.033
 90 Enemies near the hill, 100 bypasses through the village 

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:08.533
 We are close to the right side and are not found by the enemy for as long as possible. 

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.233
 Waiting for the right time to shoot 

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:16.300
 Once the enemy turns their attention to 100, the IS-3 can start to advance toward them. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.267
 The main thing to remember is to hide the 100 until the right time comes and concentrate the firepower. 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.033
 However, it is very risky to send a chariot through the village. 

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:29.700
 Send all heavy tanks to attack from the central area more reliably 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.467
 However, this is subject to availability. 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.667
 E.g 

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:39.300
 There are 4 enemy heavy tanks in the D5 area and 1 in the bushes of the C4 area. 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.767
 Our 90 fired at it 

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.233
 At the same time, IS-3 used their turrets to absorb shells. 

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:50.667
 We already have an advantage, so we can take a simple plan - rush to the map center! 

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:53.233
 IS first, 100 followed 

00:04:54.167 --> 00:04:57.200
 90 Continue to control the heavy-duty chariot in the C4 area 

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.100
 Active attack, you can win the battle 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:06.267
 If the enemy has a squad chariot, then you should fight in a similar style, but you need to be more careful. 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.733
 A shot of the chariot will probably mess everything up. 

00:05:10.167 --> 00:05:14.067
 We use 90 to detect, use IS-3 to lure the enemy to shoot, and also ensure 100 security. 

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:16.900
 From time to time, fire at the bushes in the A4 area. 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.400
 Because the chariot is likely to be behind this rock. 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.767
 So shoot from both sides 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.867
 No need to worry 

00:05:23.967 --> 00:05:26.467
 It is important to gain a blood volume advantage 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.433
 If not, it is very difficult to successfully attack the enemy. 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.400
 As for other aspects - action is similar to other situations 

00:05:33.767 --> 00:05:39.733
 Relax defense, use T1 to approach the flanks, wait for the right time... launch an attack 

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.567
 What if the enemy lineup is as fast as ours? 

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.667
 This problem is a bit difficult 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:54.567
 If the enemy has a fast chariot, then we can challenge the mountain, but in most cases, the enemy's light chariot will rush there before us. 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.600
 Because the road conditions there are better than the departure from the northern base. 

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:01.267
 IS-3 shoots from the F4 area to support 90 

00:06:01.567 --> 00:06:03.833
 Then we fight from the central rock 

00:06:03.933 --> 00:06:06.000
 100 cover IS as usual 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.167
 In this case, rely more on the personal skills of the chariot driver. 

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:13.633
 There is no way to guarantee winning 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.600
 Another way is to play defense 

00:06:16.767 --> 00:06:21.333
 This method is especially useful if the enemy has more than one fast chariot. 

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:24.167
 We arranged the T1 in the bushes of the F8 area. 

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:27.333
 Another trip to the foot of the G6 area 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.233
 90 Go to the island of the H1 area, one of which goes to the K4 area 

00:06:32.333 --> 00:06:37.767
 The other stayed near the base with one of the IS-3s and the other IS-3 went to the F5 area. 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.300
 T1 investigates the road from the village to the mountain 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.533
 One of the IS-3 Reconnaissance Map Centers 

00:06:44.633 --> 00:06:48.700
 90 Control the island and, if necessary, shoot in the E5 area 

00:06:50.267 --> 00:06:52.400
 One of the 100 is also aiming here 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.367
 The other one is aiming at the mountain 

00:06:54.467 --> 00:06:58.167
 The IS-3 in the J7 area is ready to fire at the village. 

00:06:58.567 --> 00:07:03.967
 At this time, the most important thing is to stay alert, do not turn the turret, always aim at the place that needs to be aimed, wait for the opportunity. 

00:07:04.067 --> 00:07:09.200
 We have given the hills to faster enemies, but we have completely controlled the way to our base. 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.367
 Our goal is to catch the enemy's mistakes. 

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.500
 An accidental voyeur of the enemy chariot, we can have an 8th-order artillery advantage 

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:21.000
 Everyone knows that it is not difficult to win such a battle. 

00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:25.533
 We continue to use the extra gun that dominates to capture the hills. 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.467
 Sometimes in order to win, you have to let the enemy feel that everything is in control. 

00:07:30.567 --> 00:07:34.633
 Not everyone has the patience to do this, but you need to do this. 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.733
 So much today 

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:38.667
 In the next episode we will discuss how to fight from the birth point in the north. 

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:42.267
 Remember to share it with your guild companion and subscribe to keep up to date with the program information. 

00:07:42.367 --> 00:07:43.767
 Goodbye!
