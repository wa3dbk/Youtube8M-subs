from from the outset and very balanced
he<00:00:34.500> deserves<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> title<00:00:35.219> ii<00:00:35.520> made<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> pest<00:00:36.120> job

but i guess it always helps if you have
a<00:00:43.950> bit<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> good<00:00:44.670> luck<00:00:44.730> which<00:00:45.180> he<00:00:45.390> obviously
