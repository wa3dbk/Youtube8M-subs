think that we would have different

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.630 
think that we would have different
people<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.320> different<00:04:30.410> lives<00:04:30.830> get<00:04:31.430> involved

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
with this probably didn't envision a

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.430

seven<00:04:33.920> year<00:04:34.070> old<00:04:34.360> but<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:35.930> just<00:04:36.200> can't

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
seven year old but it's you just can't

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.920 
seven year old but it's you just can't
