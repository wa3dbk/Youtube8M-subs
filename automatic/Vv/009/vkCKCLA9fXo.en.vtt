00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.980
 Total city gather you have and we 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.320
 Get ever weapons we give afterwards 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.670
 continue to walk or triple and walk 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.530
 continue on foot or not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:58.320

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:03.890
 offered as it seemed lost everything 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:07.320

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.030
 go back immediately , although yes I have 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 I have a look for a long enough zombie 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:25.549
 why does not he still go I have to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.170
 first it probably was that 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.850
 that's not there that there is no weapon 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:37.140

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140

 compact competent but fathers come that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:18.400
 Despite that, we have to go back so great 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:22.480
 no gentleman attacked guys of all 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.989

 Now I'm tucked away 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.730
 I 'm pretty busy gamescom 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.280
 comcom assassin and him as fast as 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.100
 all possible in the bus 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.040
 yet he unfortunately does not run, I wanted 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.450
 I'll get jagger the oldtimer all the way 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.140
 fast really fast i can feel it 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.209
 do not afford 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.430
 I can still get something with it 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.430
 Shit I'm on top of the bus 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.450
 walter late this is bad 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:17.500
 look at me 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:24.730
 damn shit economical 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:28.000
 two strokes of age can now 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:31.030
 Build the ship and there where the crate 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.520
 was the view but is experienced as 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.080
 radish or say left but the 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.370
 he closes doors faster 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.669
 and what do you have for that until then 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.669
 go through 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.630
 yes, if you leave the doors for example 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.580
 which now in the ratio from behind me 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.770
 need ammo at first 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:54.370
 to buy 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:56.380
 I am glad I want to show you 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.210
 'm that because I'm the whole round only 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.000
 survived with boxes that was not 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.729
 bad that must be recognized if 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.120
 I would have thought of what she would have done 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.340
 focus on more 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:11.560
 if I would see that except green and 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.000
 transparent and fun way but also who 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.960
 that's exactly what I'm looking at 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.830
 behind exactly 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.169
 Really what can I get if it really is 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.539
 he is not as he describes it 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.539
 there will be no beating behind da costa 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.930
 comes from which people the game 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.780
 not resolved on the track so 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:43.270
 those who just blindly spd 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 displace do now not easy 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.450
 the door of a rising and then again 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.010
 is he actually going to drive faster? 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.650
 He makes you come to one 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.220
 ethics commission paintings 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.220
 made 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.110
 that people are always at a door 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.110
 close 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.650
 in there 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.800
 behind you 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.970
 he drives faster 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.410
 This time the devise can not be quiet 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.120
 8th 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:46.610
 then let's get ahead now we have to 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:47.930
 ok with new convertible even it says 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.610
 then we have a problem 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.310
 not have signs I looked then 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:58.360
 in the meantime just on the piste 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:07:02.500
 go because I really have it then 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.500
 public and not on the wall 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:08.180
 We will be there when you have had it 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.710
 Are you what you could theoretically 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:13.190
 if we come here again 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.360
 theoretically, you could just go out there 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.160
 dwindle because the bus driver 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.210
 you could be slow at times 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.080
 the purchase is back to the bus 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.080
 jumps then I think 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:29.360
 if you can not do it yet 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:32.990
 packaged with my when he needs the 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.180
 am i wrong there when in that 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:39.320
 made wait wait read there immediately 

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:43.880
 I out of there me out out out out all 

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:50.910
 I'm out there as possible, selling three 

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:55.980
 Small finished , take it back 

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:59.720
 the hans is the nuke but it is coming 

00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.720
 right back which deductions
