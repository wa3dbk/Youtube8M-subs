00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
and we have this little bit smaller with

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:49.539 
and we have this little bit smaller with
it<00:02:48.799> like<00:02:48.950> this

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
it like this

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.250 
it like this
I<00:02:49.580> found<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.650> glass<00:02:51.650> piece<00:02:52.400> of<00:02:52.549> glass<00:02:53.049> put<00:02:54.049> that

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
I found a glass piece of glass put that

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.190 
I found a glass piece of glass put that
on<00:02:54.410> top<00:02:54.650> won't<00:02:55.579> slide<00:02:55.970> much

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
on top won't slide much

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.869 
on top won't slide much
I'm<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.260> little<00:02:58.500> afraid<00:02:58.739> that<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.220> glass<00:02:59.550> may

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
I'm a little afraid that the glass may

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:17.140 
I'm a little afraid that the glass may
break<00:03:00.709> but<00:03:01.709> I'm<00:03:02.190> just<00:03:02.370> using<00:03:02.640> it<00:03:02.970> yesterday

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.460 

branding<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.900> bit<00:03:20.690> sharp<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.379> edges

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
branding it's a bit sharp on the edges

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.119 
branding it's a bit sharp on the edges
but<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:24.599> might<00:03:25.140> be<00:03:25.650> able<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:26.040> send<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.579> down<00:03:26.900> and

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:28.129 
but I might be able to send it down and

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.599 
but I might be able to send it down and
I<00:03:29.129> don't<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:29.610> make<00:03:30.000> anymore
