00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:09.570
 today we will review the onboard 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:12.599
 computer multitronics in 10-30 one gpl 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.269
 here which is installed in the car 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.590
 chevrolet aveo 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.050
 installation site can be selected by 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.010
 your taste but in particular, I chose 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.210
 above rearview mirror 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 that's why you can place it on 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.390
 the front panel place the watch with any 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 convenient side where you like for 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 in order to understand why 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.940
 on-board computer 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:49.829
 we will start the car now and see what 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 how we have what functions are present but 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.949
 a pleasant female voice is certainly pleasant 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.170
 hello to you means on display 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.960
 I'm on now 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:07.290
 multifunction display 4 on it 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.560
 12 different parameters can be displayed 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.900
 do depending on the settings and 3 and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.140
 6 and 8 parameters how convenient it means here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 here we are on top 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:27.900
 this is instant consumption total consumption 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:30.869
 fuel mileage rpm further goes total 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.540
 travel time their battery readings 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.100
 power network voltage 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.049
 outboard air fishing rods now 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 fenders next to the engine 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.490
 engine temperature where 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:51.500
 more informative than the sensor that 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:55.250
 we are staffed here is the tank capacity in the tank 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.460
 speed and remaining kilometers 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:02.399
 mean besides 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.950
 optimal data that provides 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.710
 you onboard computer 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:11.090
 here it has useful features like 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.280
 maintenance reminder 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.520
 extension of insurance and accordingly 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.200
 all other parameters 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.200
 also reading errors and accordingly 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.180
 a means to erase them 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.180
 Specifically, we consider this menu 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:41.939
 replacing the air filter 9000 and 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:46.790
 Required parameters I pronounce with 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:46.790
 in a pleasant female voice that is nice 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:03:04.829
 belt change engine oil change 8000 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:07.370
 replacing spark 17000 time this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.370
 enough 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:20.280
 parameter contains information 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.620
 demonstration this theme mode show and 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.599
 mode and mode stand and when display 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.870
 stop buttons are muted and blocked 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.109
 did not accidentally hit someone system error 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.409
 Here in particular with regards to errors errors and 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.690
 q is currently 0 demand system errors 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:42.019
 here they are in this menu, you can 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.019
 reset 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:52.209
 medium voltage regulator 4 means 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.769
 As for the displays, this one is convenient for me 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.370
 multifunction display 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.090
 here which contains you necessary and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.709
 optimal parameters 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.329
 besides this you can choose 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.689
 user display 3 take others 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:12.730
 display field display 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:18.100
 User 2 display display 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:21.760
 user one display display 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.760
 user 4 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:30.000
 that's about its economic 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.419
 values ​​judge for yourself means reading 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.730
 Scanner errors are on the order of 600 to 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.970
 800 rubles for one mistake, that is 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.220
 arrived thought a mistake 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.600
 dropped 800 rubles gave at the best 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.380
 case up there 600 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.300
 that's all there is no guarantee that we will allow 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.360
 no error will have to go again 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:55.080
 on new again paying money means in 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.940
 this plan that all errors are convenient we 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.250
 get the information directly already 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.290
 immediately to the onboard computer when 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:05.910
 occurrence they pronounce a code 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:10.260
 errors and also this on-board computer 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.590
 they can be reset that is, if we allow 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:16.350
 I particularly concerning my 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:21.479
 the operation of the machine was about such 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:23.280
 cases 10 10 multiply even by 6 600 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.020
 Minimum count at 600 then this 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.030
 it turns out about 6000 investigator to 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.970
 the cost itself 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:36.090
 onboard computer is no longer new 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:39.630
 model but at that time it became 3 900 then 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:41.850
 have it already paid off this is a quick overview i 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.320
 I will not climb all at the construction site now 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.950
 the rest is done to 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.370
 you understand you need this thing or not in 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.830
 principle, in principle, for the sake of say so 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.990
 what are some engine parameters 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.139
 revealed more complete it is 1 + 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.449
 and reading errors and 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.870
 and reset is the second plus it is two palpable 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.629
 which is in the pros 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:12.439
 dictate let's say the need for 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:17.860
 such a device in your car that 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:25.249
 regards connection connection 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:28.719
 implemented by the standard connector but here 

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:32.029
 hard to see of course here is the experience of this and 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:35.029
 I put the sensor in the front locker for me 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:41.210
 temperature sensor that's basically 

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:44.090
 probably and everything but beyond that in new 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:49.840
 multitronics ah built in light control 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:52.659
 that is, separately we get in a block and 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:55.250
 plug in dazzle and 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:58.129
 accordingly the on-board computer will be 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.249
 report low beam on 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:02.749
 or not at the beginning of the movement or rather 

00:07:01.249 --> 00:07:04.300
 when the speed reaches twenty 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:07.930
 kilometers per hour 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.930
 thank you for your attention
