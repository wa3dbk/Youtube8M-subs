glenmorangie<00:01:47.650> probably<00:01:48.650> is<00:01:48.920> more<00:01:49.729> particular

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
glenmorangie probably is more particular

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.039 
glenmorangie probably is more particular
about<00:01:50.390> their<00:01:50.900> o<00:01:51.200> cast<00:01:51.920> than<00:01:52.369> anybody<00:01:52.729> else

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
about their o cast than anybody else

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.500 
about their o cast than anybody else
they're<00:01:54.049> all<00:01:54.200> cast<00:01:54.500> all<00:01:54.860> come<00:01:55.070> from<00:01:55.220> America

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
they're all cast all come from America

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.330 
they're all cast all come from America
the<00:01:56.510> trees<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.170> they<00:01:57.290> use<00:01:57.530> are<00:01:57.830> all<00:01:57.950> hand

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
the trees that they use are all hand

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.510 
the trees that they use are all hand
selected<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.090> believe<00:01:59.960> they<00:02:00.200> only<00:02:00.979> grow<00:02:01.280> on

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
selected I believe they only grow on

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.210 
selected I believe they only grow on
North<00:02:01.909> facing<00:02:02.420> equal<00:02:02.720> sides<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.409> the<00:02:03.979> reason

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
North facing equal sides and the reason

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.880 
North facing equal sides and the reason
I<00:02:04.280> do<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:04.700> because<00:02:05.299> they<00:02:05.570> want<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:06.020> very

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
I do that is because they want a very

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.639 
I do that is because they want a very
specific<00:02:07.450> consistent<00:02:08.450> density<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.379> oak

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
specific consistent density to the oak

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.920 
specific consistent density to the oak
so<00:02:10.340> that<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.580> will<00:02:10.640> impart<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.150> very<00:02:11.360> consistent

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
so that it will impart a very consistent

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.679 
so that it will impart a very consistent
flavor<00:02:12.290> to<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.709> whiskey

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:13.689 
flavor to the whiskey

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:15.580 
flavor to the whiskey
firstly<00:02:14.689> I'd<00:02:14.780> say<00:02:14.959> they<00:02:15.140> have<00:02:15.230> been<00:02:15.349> pretty

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
firstly I'd say they have been pretty
