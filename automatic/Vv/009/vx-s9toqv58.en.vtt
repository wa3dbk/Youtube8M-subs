your iPods booting up I don't need to
custom<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.430> I'll<00:01:38.579> just<00:01:38.610> go<00:01:38.939> ahead<00:01:39.000> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
custom one so I'll just go ahead and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.749 
custom one so I'll just go ahead and
stick<00:01:39.360> with<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> regular<00:01:39.990> one<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.290> then<00:01:41.220> go

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
stick with the regular one and then go

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.910 
stick with the regular one and then go
ahead<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.939> click<00:01:42.119> build<00:01:42.390> ipsw<00:01:42.770> this<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
ahead and click build ipsw this is

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.770 
ahead and click build ipsw this is
probably<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.280> take<00:01:44.460> close<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.970> five<00:01:45.240> minutes

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
probably to take close to five minutes

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.270 
probably to take close to five minutes
something<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.470> that<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.890> if<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> want<00:01:47.220> to

walk away from your computer and do

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.109 
walk away from your computer and do
something<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.799> ahead<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.700> then

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
something go ahead and do that and then

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.550 
something go ahead and do that and then
once<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.509> done<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:52.020> going<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> ask<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> if

seven seconds because it's kind of

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.860 
seven seconds because it's kind of
confusing<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.910> instructions<00:02:27.420> you're

ahead and hold up for a couple of
seconds<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.220> then<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.240> you<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.420> do<00:02:33.540> is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630

keep holding the home button and then
it's<00:02:38.400> going<00:02:38.490> to<00:02:38.580> take<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.790> few<00:02:38.880> seconds<00:02:39.420> don't

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
it's going to take a few seconds don't

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
have to open for full 30 seconds then

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.670 
have to open for full 30 seconds then
it's<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.300> go<00:02:42.450> into<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.780> dfu<00:02:43.320> mode<00:02:43.380> you

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
it's going to go into a dfu mode you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.900 
it's going to go into a dfu mode you
should<00:02:43.860> get<00:02:43.950> something<00:02:44.190> from<00:02:44.340> your<00:02:44.460> computer

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
should get something from your computer

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.450 
should get something from your computer
like<00:02:45.390> three<00:02:45.750> dings<00:02:45.990> then<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.650> revs<00:02:47.190> going<00:02:47.400> to

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
like three dings then I revs going to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.250 
like three dings then I revs going to
run<00:02:47.640> and<00:02:47.670> you're<00:02:48.000> going<00:02:48.120> to<00:02:48.210> get<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.480> logo<00:02:49.020> on

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
run and you're going to get this logo on

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.300 
run and you're going to get this logo on
your<00:02:49.700> iPod<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:51.300> that<00:02:51.960> means<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.530> if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
your iPod that's that means that if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370 
your iPod that's that means that if
everything<00:02:54.030> went<00:02:54.210> okay<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:54.690> then<00:02:55.230> we're

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
everything went okay and then we're

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.870 
everything went okay and then we're
going<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.530> go<00:02:55.590> ahead<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.800> open<00:02:55.920> up<00:02:56.130> iTunes<00:02:56.610> so

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
going to go ahead and open up iTunes so

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.340 
going to go ahead and open up iTunes so
we<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.180> add<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.540> so<00:02:57.960> we<00:02:58.050> can<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.320> our

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
we can add the so we can put our

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.590 
we can add the so we can put our
custom-built<00:02:59.250> firmware<00:02:59.850> that<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.210> just<00:03:00.360> made

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
custom-built firmware that we just made

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.200 
custom-built firmware that we just made
on<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.990> our<00:03:01.110> device<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.880> we're<00:03:03.030> going<00:03:03.120> to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
on to our device so what we're going to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.170 
on to our device so what we're going to
do<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.740> go<00:03:04.740> ahead<00:03:04.770> and<00:03:04.980> go<00:03:05.340> on<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.790> wrist

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
do is go ahead and go on to the wrist
