I'm<00:00:01.319> going<00:00:01.500> to<00:00:01.560> change<00:00:01.770> this<00:00:01.920> window<00:00:02.280> back<00:00:02.520> to

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
I'm going to change this window back to

I'm going to change this window back to
a<00:00:02.700> properties<00:00:03.120> window<00:00:03.570> with<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.529> armature

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
a properties window with the armature

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.740 
a properties window with the armature
selected<00:00:05.670> I'm<00:00:05.970> going<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.359> go<00:00:06.420> into<00:00:06.690> the

selected I'm going to go into the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.610 
selected I'm going to go into the
armature<00:00:07.140> properties<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.919> turn<00:00:08.160> x-ray<00:00:08.910> on

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
armature properties and turn x-ray on

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.990 
armature properties and turn x-ray on
now<00:00:10.620> we<00:00:10.679> can<00:00:10.800> see<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> armature<00:00:11.610> through<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
now we can see the armature through the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.259 
now we can see the armature through the
skin<00:00:12.590> we<00:00:13.590> have<00:00:13.710> a<00:00:13.740> problem<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.700> skin<00:00:15.089> is

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
skin we have a problem that the skin is

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.240 
skin we have a problem that the skin is
the<00:00:15.389> same<00:00:15.630> colors<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> armature<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:17.100> I'm

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
the same colors the armature so I'm

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.880 
the same colors the armature so I'm
going<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.520> go<00:00:17.760> into<00:00:18.119> object<00:00:18.630> mode<00:00:18.710> select<00:00:19.710> the
