00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.040
 These tanks are intended to cover fire protection 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.289
 ccoo housing areas in a particular environment 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.900
 the interest of the flexible tank does not have to connect to a pipeline 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.010
 of drinking water is filled a first time from a small pipeline 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.009
 which is in the proximity 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.480
 you as I two saints was but until the second in the present case we chose the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.829
 installation of a suction post to make it more practical for 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.699
 units of aid since the suction valve is connected directly to the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.160
 cistern by means of a pipeline buried under this allows to install the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.040
 system off the ice and use the reserve in any condition 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.950
 climatic 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 we rely on the circular of December 10, 1951, we privileged the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.760
 installation of cost and fire hydrants in urban area since 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.090
 we have a dimensioning of the potable water pipes 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.580
 enough wolf 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.500
 this allows having a regulatory flow of 60 square meters per 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 hour for two hours little what is not forced in the case of a rural environment 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 where channels are more restricted in particular for reasons 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
 sanitary 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.600
 to officially certify this determining criterion under the control of 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.480
 a bailiff this flexible cistern emptied completely of his 120 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.310
 cubic meters of water 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.130
 firefighters connected the tanker pump to their truck with a medium flow rate 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.130
 measured 60 cubic meters per hour 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.970
 precisely two hours of pumping were necessary for the flexible cistern 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.870
 in the speed it was totally empty offering the 120 thousand liters of water and 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.670
 the two hours of autonomy expected by the security teams against 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.720
 fires
