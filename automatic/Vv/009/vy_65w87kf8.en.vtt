another<00:00:50.250> trick<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.760> have<00:00:50.879> big<00:00:51.059> dogs<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
another trick if you have big dogs is to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.549 
another trick if you have big dogs is to
only<00:00:52.739> stain<00:00:53.430> your<00:00:53.640> floor's<00:00:54.140> really<00:00:55.140> really

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
only stain your floor's really really

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
only stain your floor's really really
lightly<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> keep<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.550> pretty<00:00:56.820> close<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
lightly and keep it pretty close to the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
lightly and keep it pretty close to the
interior<00:00:58.079> color<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> wood<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.699> way<00:00:59.940> if

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
interior color of the wood that way if

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.849 
interior color of the wood that way if
your<00:01:00.359> dogs<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.320> scratched<00:01:01.649> into

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
your dogs get going and scratched into

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.410 
your dogs get going and scratched into
the<00:01:02.010> finish<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.789> don't<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> huge

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the finish you don't see a huge

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
the finish you don't see a huge
difference<00:01:03.539> like<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.260> would<00:01:04.619> if<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.010> was<00:01:05.100> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
difference like you would if it was a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
difference like you would if it was a
really<00:01:05.430> dark<00:01:05.820> stain<00:01:06.330> with<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.020> really<00:01:07.320> light

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
really dark stain with a really light

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.340 
really dark stain with a really light
interior<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.720> but<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.840> hit<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.080> another

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
interior right but you hit on another

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
interior right but you hit on another
interesting<00:01:10.890> solution<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:12.060> your

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
interesting solution and that is your

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440 
interesting solution and that is your
tile<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.350> looks<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.799> wood<00:01:14.119> now<00:01:15.119> this<00:01:15.330> has

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
tile that looks like wood now this has

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.789 
tile that looks like wood now this has
really<00:01:15.720> been<00:01:15.960> an<00:01:16.110> interesting<00:01:16.470> development

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
really been an interesting development

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.980 
really been an interesting development
recently<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.880> they've<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.540> out<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.720> all

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
recently and they've come out with all

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.990 
recently and they've come out with all
kinds<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.530> advances<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.369> design<00:01:20.820> that

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
kinds of advances in this design that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
kinds of advances in this design that
make<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.299> look<00:01:21.479> more<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.080> more<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:23.070> real

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
make it look more and more like a real

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
make it look more and more like a real
wood<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.390> obviously<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.439> have<00:01:25.590> your

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
wood now obviously if you have your

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.530 
wood now obviously if you have your
shoes<00:01:26.040> off<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> tell<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.119> it's<00:01:27.299> not

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
shoes off you can tell that it's not

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.890 
shoes off you can tell that it's not
really<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> wood<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.369> they<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.150> new<00:01:30.479> designs

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
really a wood but they have new designs

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.620 
really a wood but they have new designs
where<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.829> planks<00:01:32.250> are<00:01:32.369> varying<00:01:32.850> sizes<00:01:33.180> and

print<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> tile<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.250> end

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
print of the tile so that you don't end

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
print of the tile so that you don't end
up<00:01:38.549> with<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.759> same<00:01:39.150> repeating<00:01:39.659> pattern<00:01:40.049> as

often all of these are elements that are

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
often all of these are elements that are
