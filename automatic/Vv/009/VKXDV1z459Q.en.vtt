 But the summer lasts longer newspaper 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.460

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.040
 I chose six books

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.220
 people are looking at them strangely 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.590
 As you see your deceased cousin for 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.550
 looks alike and looks natural 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.479
 jazzy want to search or to the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.760
 is looking for 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 information what this is all about 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.270
 and what happened to her cousin 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.030
 and at the same time she comes across pretty 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770
 dangerous secrets I think so 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.479
 I am very exciting recently 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.030
 now really curious about it and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.229
 so this book is called as soon as I read 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 I'll do that, of course 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.590
 to review for you 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.229
 the next book I want to read 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.070
 is the craziest night of my life 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.740
 von lauren bahn picks up from the cbt verlag 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.310
 that costs 97 99 this is about one 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.500
 young girl whose diary of hers 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 Ex-boyfriend was stolen and he tries 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.970
 you all the time I believe all fear 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.979
 close 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.390
 exactly and then she has one night 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.430
 full of speculations exist around that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.080
 diary ever recover so 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.030
 bites his teeth together and tries 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.090
 to torment yourself through these speculations 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.530
 but cmx gets closer again 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.970
 happened here and how that will be 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.709
 I will probably know then if I 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.450
 I read that they prefer agathe 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.549
 it is praised and it is awesome 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.540
 I am glad he was happy 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:19.819
 me all the more on the story 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.680
 then I would like to read as well 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.590
 tyler wilkie my life on the head 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.700
 and what I will do about it 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.680
 charlie summers 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.810
 I think so the last name of the authors 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.400
 fits in well with the summer here 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.200
 is there somehow a young one I know 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.000
 It's not that accurate 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.840
 someone writes the soundtrack of yours 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.810
 Live someone who loves you, it's about 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.220
 grayson divider 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.959
 even if grace desperately tries it 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.849
 Do not let part of your story 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.170
 should somehow so should 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.639
 In any case insanely great to 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.689
 and I also like the presentation super 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.409
 I like the right way 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.870
 beautiful 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:57.669
 and yes i want this book on everyone 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.959
 read now in the next few weeks 

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.939
 then a book which I on the 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.939
 Book Fair got extra for this 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.439
 season so now stood here 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:08.090
 felt a felt nine months 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.379
 and waited for his assignment and 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.319
 now it must necessarily be something to it 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:15.530
 namely songs of a summer here goes 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.569
 it's kind of charlie at her 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.250
 Grandfather is in the country and she 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:25.970
 tries each time in vain with 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:29.150
 roses and dave but befriend 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.620
 instead, she practices songs on the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.590
 The two guys are really hard nuts 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.919
 and then somehow I happen something 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.250
 he does not even know exactly then he wants it on 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.629
 but charlie girlfriend be but once 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.060
 somehow it does not quite fit 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.290
 and yes there is something behind and 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.970
 I'm crazy in any case 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.440
 I love the cover it has 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.849
 to do something with music that suits 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.680
 In any case, it's amazingly good to me 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:53.560
 it suits the season and I leave 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.810
 Just surprise me 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.790
 Two books we have the penultimate 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.290
 is big and in love with soap bubbles 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.329
 series i just find this 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.519
 Quirky cover fits in very well 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.540
 and the story is right 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.920
 Well, this is about a young one 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.040
 girl what part of one 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.170
 soap opera becomes and in love with her 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.180
 i believe and that is chaos 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.340
 just preprogrammed I think so 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:19.010
 witty sparkling charming and super good 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.460
 and can be the ideal reading for the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.740
 be hot, summer days 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:27.520
 and last but not least by Patricia Spitals 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.620
 the tv say this is the first part 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.669
 this story is there 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.380
 every case a second if I 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.970
 serves me correctly, I do not even remember 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.240
 what this is about is just looking 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.550
 times with colleagues over or 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.260
 look at it yourself where you like 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.300
 I would like to do that in any case 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.680
 read because the bagage of it very much 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.630
 learned German and I think so too 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.790
 This book is amazingly good in the summer 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.760
 fit and hopefully me well 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.760
 entertained and yes they were pure 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.590

 something scattered today with these videos 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:09.530
 I hope that does not bother you too much 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.479
 that's what the six books are 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.770

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.050
