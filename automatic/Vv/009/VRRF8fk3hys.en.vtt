00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.360
Hello, Polynesians!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.180
Well today we are going to make a challenge with sweets.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.580
These delicious sweet acids.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.660
They are very acid sweet, they are the most acidic sweets that we find in the super market

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.300
- I'm going to open these called Warheads. - These are called...

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:27.760
- They are super extreme, bitter. - I'm going to use these that are suor patch of water melon, of watermelon.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.020
I the sour patch kids.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780
- Let's see. - Oh the watermelon is small!

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.020
Here come the warheads.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.660
These are, according to some dolls, but without form.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.420
Stop little children of those who come in the thread.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.220
Are fruits. They are colored fruits.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.840
Let's start from the least acid, to the most acidic.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.400
- Exactly. - This is the least acidic, we believe, we do not know, we have never tried them.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.540
But they put us in our vlog comment that these were the least acidic.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.260
And these were the most acidic, so let's try first, these, then...

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.320
These, then these.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.280
And in the end these, 1, 2, 3!

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.380
It is not so acid.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.740
I'm going to cry!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.820
I think I'm going to lose, I'm sticking everything in the brackets.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.360
Ready! I go with the children.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.260
Do not overdo it, it's super strong.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.880
Oh no, it's worse than lemon!

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.200
Oh, my skin was already bristling!

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.640
And that they have not reached children.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.700
Is not it? I'm going to cry!

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.160
- I'm crying. - Are the children acidic?

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.400
Yes, they are super acidic. - My head is aching.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.200
Me too! here it hurts.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.480
I'm already Polynesian, slowly but surely, I go with the children.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.420
I go with the balls.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.600
I also. No, my little ball!

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.640
Oh no!

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.220
Oh, they're horrible, they are horrible.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.700
they're horrible. - This is horrible. - I swear to you, Karen, I swear it's super ugly.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.780
They are horrible.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.240
- He's going to give me something, he's going to give me something! - I need water.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.420
We do not have water Nooo!

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.440
Already!

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.700
And I won.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.640
Oh, your candy ball there! says "and I won".

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.440
Lesslie and I draw now.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.240
Because acidity is getting quicker.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.940
But they have not finished.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.980
Let's see, I'm crying, I'm crying, I do not

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.200
know if he sees in the camera but I'm crying. - I have bristling skin.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.340
I'm crying and I have a cold, I just had a cold.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.420
Is that you havent's taste it Karen, they are  horrible. You have to taste it, you can not leave the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.860
challenge without trying it, this challenge will not end until you finish.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.120
My plan did not work! My plan did not work!

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.980
- He scared my tongue, this is horrible. - I think the one who lost goes for water.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.720
- That's you. - You?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.240
- Yes. - But after you eat your candy.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.520
Go, Karen is going to eat her 5 sweets, we teach the camera.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.240
- Are here! Ready?

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.420

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.540
Not even...

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.960
Give her another, you have not even tried them, do not spit them out.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.340
Give her another one.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.900
How does it taste? Really, horrible.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.980
Oh, most holy God!

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.720
Wait, wait.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.640
Is not it true that tears come to you?

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.600
- I want to cry. - The tears come out I swear that the tears come out with this candy.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.780

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.200
And that he ate 4 because 1 dropped it.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.780
Do not pass, this, that is, it will give me stomach pain.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.700
Does not matter.

- Yes, I also have a tongue like ... scalded. - They are very extreme, these candies are very extreme.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.220
These. If they are sold by their country or if they can obtain them, they are the most extreme.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.020
They are really, they cry, they cry with...

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.710
And well Polynesians that was the challenge of today, I really have my tongue ...

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.240
- I already washed my tongue as much as I could and ... - Mine is blue.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.920
- What is mine? - One half pink and one half orange.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:18.080
Oh yeah! You do not get to see I think but yes, and Rafa is not...

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.320
And well Polynesians last week you voted because this week there would be a double challenge,

we will do our best so that the challenge comes out the following week.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:41.560
And if they want us to do another challenge with only one bag, a bag of these each,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.380
