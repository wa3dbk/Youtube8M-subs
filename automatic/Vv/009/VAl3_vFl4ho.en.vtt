actually done quite simply but there's a
couple<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.940> general<00:00:15.299> rules<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.690> really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
to cut your cuttings okay I have a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.389 
to cut your cuttings okay I have a
blueberry<00:00:48.899> cutting<00:00:49.500> here's<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> bottom

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
blueberry cutting here's the bottom

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.220 
blueberry cutting here's the bottom
here's<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> top<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> remove<00:00:51.780> all<00:00:52.020> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
here's the top and I remove all the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
here's the top and I remove all the
leaves<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.370> doesn't<00:00:53.699> lose<00:00:53.850> water<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
leaves so that it doesn't lose water and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360 
leaves so that it doesn't lose water and
I<00:00:54.809> take<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> scissors<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:55.770> need<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.039> cut<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
I take the scissors and I need to cut it

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.049 
I take the scissors and I need to cut it
at<00:00:56.520> an<00:00:56.640> angle<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.780> large<00:00:58.140> surface<00:00:58.949> area<00:00:59.340> so

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
at an angle very large surface area so

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360 
at an angle very large surface area so
you<00:01:00.149> get<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> nice<00:01:00.480> clean<00:01:00.930> cut<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.890> sterilized

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
you get a nice clean cut with sterilized

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.460 
you get a nice clean cut with sterilized
scissors<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.449> next<00:01:03.719> step<00:01:03.899> really<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.320> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
scissors the next step really is to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
scissors the next step really is to
start<00:01:04.860> putting<00:01:04.920> rooting<00:01:05.339> hormone<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.090> do

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
start putting rooting hormone you can do

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.490 
start putting rooting hormone you can do
one<00:01:06.360> with<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> powder<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.290> with

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
one with a powder or you can do it with

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.440 
one with a powder or you can do it with
a<00:01:07.530> gel<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.340> case<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.880> doing<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.299> with<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
a gel this case I'm doing it with a

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
a gel this case I'm doing it with a
powder<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.110> then<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> next<00:01:11.070> step<00:01:11.250> after<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
powder and then the next step after that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.890 
powder and then the next step after that
is<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.689> into<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.170> clay<00:01:13.500> pot<00:01:14.869> you're<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
is to put it into your clay pot you're a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.749 
is to put it into your clay pot you're a
rooting<00:01:16.259> pot<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.740> hold<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.430> your<00:01:17.580> bio

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
rooting pot and hold it with your bio

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
rooting pot and hold it with your bio
balls<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.810> thing<00:01:18.990> will<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.409> hang

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
balls so this thing will actually hang

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.399 
balls so this thing will actually hang
out<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> water<00:01:21.180> will<00:01:21.479> spray<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.930> all<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.200> time

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
out and water will spray on all the time

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
out and water will spray on all the time
roughly<00:01:22.979> about<00:01:23.220> two<00:01:23.549> weeks<00:01:23.790> you'll<00:01:23.970> start

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
roughly about two weeks you'll start

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.210 
roughly about two weeks you'll start
seeing<00:01:24.390> roots<00:01:24.659> at<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> end<00:01:25.259> here<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
seeing roots at the end here and the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
seeing roots at the end here and the
next<00:01:26.490> step<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.210> put<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> down<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:28.110> your

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
next step is to put it down into your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.590 
next step is to put it down into your
aeroponic<00:01:28.979> system<00:01:29.369> where<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> water

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
aeroponic system where then the water

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.300 
aeroponic system where then the water
will<00:01:30.810> then<00:01:30.840> flush<00:01:31.229> up<00:01:31.439> against<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.130> then

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
will then flush up against it and then

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.890 
will then flush up against it and then
you'll<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.759> roots<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.119> roughly<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.570> two

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you'll have roots in roughly about two

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.539 
you'll have roots in roughly about two
weeks

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
weeks

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
weeks
my<00:01:35.549> suggestion<00:01:35.909> also<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.780> cover<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.320> so

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
my suggestion also is to cover it so

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.560 
my suggestion also is to cover it so
that<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> lose<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> evaporation<00:01:39.150> here<00:01:39.479> you

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
that the lose the evaporation here you

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.179 
that the lose the evaporation here you
can<00:01:39.689> put<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> glass<00:01:40.079> over<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.470> or<00:01:40.829> some<00:01:40.950> sort

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
can put a glass over here or some sort

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.170 
can put a glass over here or some sort
of<00:01:41.220> plastic<00:01:41.430> cup

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of plastic cup

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.179 
of plastic cup
so<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.810> roughly<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.350> two<00:01:43.740> weeks<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
so in roughly about two weeks you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.800 
so in roughly about two weeks you
actually<00:01:44.520> start<00:01:44.700> seeing<00:01:44.939> some<00:01:45.270> roots<00:01:45.509> coming

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually start seeing some roots coming

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.690 
actually start seeing some roots coming
out<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> bottom<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.799> cutting<00:01:47.159> if

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
out the bottom of your cutting if

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
out the bottom of your cutting if
there's<00:01:48.000> no<00:01:48.149> sterilization<00:01:49.020> problem<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
there's no sterilization problem one of

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.550 
there's no sterilization problem one of
the<00:01:50.310> tricks<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.079> make<00:01:52.079> sure<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.320> your

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the tricks is to make sure that your

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
the tricks is to make sure that your
water<00:01:52.799> stays<00:01:53.220> totally<00:01:53.909> sterilized<00:01:54.450> no<00:01:54.659> do<00:01:54.960> not

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
water stays totally sterilized no do not

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.959 
water stays totally sterilized no do not

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
put nutrients in there at this time it

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.940 
put nutrients in there at this time it
will<00:01:57.030> actually<00:01:57.299> burn<00:01:57.540> your<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:58.290> cuttings

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
will actually burn your your cuttings

what you want to do is you only just put
straight-out<00:02:00.960> water<00:02:01.380> run<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.159> roughly

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
straight-out water run it for roughly

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.940 
straight-out water run it for roughly
about<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.659> aeroponic<00:02:04.649> system

to use one that's actually in the
hydroponic<00:02:33.420> store<00:02:33.629> then<00:02:34.049> it<00:02:34.140> comes<00:02:34.319> in

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
hydroponic store then it comes in

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.809 
hydroponic store then it comes in
bottles<00:02:34.620> like<00:02:34.980> this<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.489> little<00:02:35.640> bit

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
bottles like this or a little bit

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.240 
bottles like this or a little bit
smaller<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.390> keep<00:02:37.319> your<00:02:37.440> system<00:02:37.799> clean<00:02:38.040> and

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
smaller so keep your system clean and

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.420 
smaller so keep your system clean and
you're<00:02:38.760> off<00:02:38.879> to<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.060> races
