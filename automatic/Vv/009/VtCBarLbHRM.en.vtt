00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.390 

we're<00:00:16.990> going<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.200> synthesize<00:00:17.380> nylon<00:00:18.130> a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
we're going to synthesize nylon a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:26.040 
we're going to synthesize nylon a
different<00:00:18.970> way<00:00:23.700> so<00:00:24.700> the<00:00:24.820> synthesis<00:00:25.300> of<00:00:25.330> nylon

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
different way so the synthesis of nylon

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.410 
different way so the synthesis of nylon
there<00:00:26.170> are<00:00:26.260> many<00:00:26.410> types<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.770> nylon<00:00:27.160> but<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
there are many types of nylon but this

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.210 
there are many types of nylon but this
type<00:00:28.599> in<00:00:28.720> Milan<00:00:28.930> you<00:00:29.050> simply<00:00:29.349> need<00:00:29.500> some<00:00:29.830> add

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
type in Milan you simply need some add

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:39.360 
type in Milan you simply need some add
zero<00:00:30.610> fluoride<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.420> seven<00:00:37.170> one<00:00:38.170> six<00:00:38.440> xane

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
zero fluoride and seven one six xane

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.049 
zero fluoride and seven one six xane
diamine<00:00:40.769> whenever<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.949> two<00:00:42.160> layers<00:00:42.460> meet

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
diamine whenever the two layers meet

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.360 
diamine whenever the two layers meet
this<00:00:44.019> is<00:00:44.199> where<00:00:44.410> you<00:00:44.590> will<00:00:44.769> have<00:00:45.129> the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
this is where you will have the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:54.869 
this is where you will have the
synthesis<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.059> nylon<00:00:51.870> as<00:00:52.870> you<00:00:53.110> can<00:00:53.290> see<00:00:53.879> there

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
synthesis of nylon as you can see there

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:56.789 
synthesis of nylon as you can see there
are<00:00:54.940> two<00:00:55.089> layers<00:00:55.269> being<00:00:55.600> formed<00:00:56.019> at<00:00:56.769> the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
are two layers being formed at the

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.829 
are two layers being formed at the
junction<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.460> the<00:00:57.519> layers<00:00:57.790> this<00:00:58.390> is<00:00:58.449> where<00:00:58.720> the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
junction of the layers this is where the

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.170 
junction of the layers this is where the
Milon<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.350> forming<00:00:59.769> I'm<00:01:00.670> using<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:01.000> fishhook

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
Milon is forming I'm using a fishhook

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.080 
Milon is forming I'm using a fishhook
here<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.750> go<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.049> grab<00:01:02.890> that<00:01:03.100> nylon<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.880> every

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
here to go and grab that nylon so every

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.390 
here to go and grab that nylon so every
time<00:01:07.240> I'm<00:01:07.420> pulling<00:01:07.720> I'm<00:01:08.110> removing<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.190> some

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
time I'm pulling I'm removing in some

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.320 
time I'm pulling I'm removing in some
nylon<00:01:09.850> so<00:01:10.090> another<00:01:10.510> layer<00:01:10.780> creates<00:01:13.049> another

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
nylon so another layer creates another

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.820 
nylon so another layer creates another
polymer<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.510> nylon<00:01:16.840> is<00:01:16.990> forming<00:01:17.380> between<00:01:17.560> the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
polymer of nylon is forming between the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.230 
polymer of nylon is forming between the
two<00:01:17.950> layers<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.130> every<00:01:21.340> time<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.549> remove<00:01:21.969> some

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
two layers so every time I remove some

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.709 
two layers so every time I remove some
nylon<00:01:22.600> so<00:01:23.049> more<00:01:23.289> nylon<00:01:23.680> creates<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:25.299> between

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
nylon so more nylon creates in between

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.319 
nylon so more nylon creates in between
two<00:01:25.960> layers<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.350> liquid<00:01:26.619> I'm<00:01:27.460> creating<00:01:27.820> solid

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
two layers of liquid I'm creating solid

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.380 
two layers of liquid I'm creating solid
nylon<00:01:29.259> in<00:01:29.439> between<00:01:29.740> two<00:01:29.950> layers<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.250> liquid<00:01:30.640> as

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
nylon in between two layers of liquid as

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.429 
nylon in between two layers of liquid as
long<00:01:31.719> as<00:01:31.869> you<00:01:31.990> have<00:01:32.759> both<00:01:33.759> solutions<00:01:34.439> you'll

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
long as you have both solutions you'll

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.189 
long as you have both solutions you'll
be<00:01:35.649> able<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.979> synthesize
