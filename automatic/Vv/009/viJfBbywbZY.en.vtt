00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.900 

I<00:00:12.800> think<00:00:13.800> when<00:00:13.920> we<00:00:14.010> talk<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.250> theater<00:00:14.760> of<00:00:14.850> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I think when we talk about theater of a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.250 
I think when we talk about theater of a
concert<00:00:15.270> it<00:00:15.360> can<00:00:15.480> mean<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> great<00:00:16.020> many

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
concert it can mean a great many

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.260 
concert it can mean a great many
different<00:00:16.350> things<00:00:17.010> because<00:00:17.610> essentially

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
different things because essentially

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.940 
different things because essentially
what<00:00:18.450> we're<00:00:18.660> looking<00:00:19.080> at<00:00:19.230> when<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.590> engage

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
what we're looking at when we engage

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.150 
what we're looking at when we engage
that<00:00:20.220> idea<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:21.200> what<00:00:22.200> are<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.500> theatrical

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
that idea is what are the theatrical

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.630 
that idea is what are the theatrical
elements<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.849> any<00:00:24.240> concert<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.279> how<00:00:26.279> can<00:00:26.489> we

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
elements of any concert and how can we

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609 
elements of any concert and how can we
enhance<00:00:26.790> them<00:00:27.270> or<00:00:27.419> change<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.779> or<00:00:28.140> utilize

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
enhance them or change them or utilize

00:00:28.619 --> 00:01:24.790 
enhance them or change them or utilize
them<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.869> to<00:00:30.869> good<00:00:31.079> effect

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.610 

inherently<00:01:25.800> concerts<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.790> theatrical

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
inherently concerts are theatrical

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.680 
inherently concerts are theatrical
because<00:01:28.620> of<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.400> fact<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.910> stage<00:01:30.150> because

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
because of the fact of the stage because

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.420 
because of the fact of the stage because
of<00:01:30.840> being<00:01:31.020> able<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.740> musicians<00:01:32.190> do

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
of being able to see the musicians do

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:44.950 
of being able to see the musicians do
what<00:01:32.640> they<00:01:32.790> do

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.279 

and<00:01:46.250> then<00:01:47.250> there<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:47.670> pieces<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.600> music<00:01:48.929> and

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
and then there are pieces of music and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.649 
and then there are pieces of music and
certain<00:01:52.549> repertoire<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.579> invite<00:01:54.090> even

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
certain repertoire that invite even

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:13.510 
certain repertoire that invite even
further<00:01:54.960> theatrical<00:01:55.590> treatment

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.040 

opera's<00:02:14.520> a<00:02:14.550> marvelous<00:02:15.120> experience<00:02:15.300> when<00:02:15.900> it's

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
opera's a marvelous experience when it's

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.850 
opera's a marvelous experience when it's
the<00:02:16.200> whole<00:02:16.410> theatrical<00:02:16.920> package<00:02:17.610> but<00:02:18.330> we<00:02:19.230> tend

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
the whole theatrical package but we tend

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.590 
the whole theatrical package but we tend
to<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.160> a<00:02:20.220> different<00:02:20.610> focus<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.240> music

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
to have a different focus on the music

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.180 
to have a different focus on the music
when<00:02:21.780> we<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:22.230> operas<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.830> concert<00:02:23.160> hall

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
when we do operas in the concert hall

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.900 
when we do operas in the concert hall
however<00:02:24.170> we<00:02:25.170> still<00:02:25.470> want<00:02:25.710> to<00:02:25.740> preserve<00:02:26.190> the

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
however we still want to preserve the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.940 
however we still want to preserve the
sense<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.750> drama<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.320> that<00:02:28.350> work<00:02:28.740> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
sense of the drama of that work and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.050 
sense of the drama of that work and
there<00:02:29.040> are<00:02:29.070> many<00:02:29.340> things<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.790> do

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there are many things we can do

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.200 
there are many things we can do
theatrically<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:31.280> our<00:02:32.280> setting<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.970> in<00:02:33.150> a

theatrically in our setting and in a
concert<00:02:33.600> setting<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:34.050> enhanced<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
concert setting that enhanced the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:57.570 
concert setting that enhanced the
experience<00:02:35.220> of<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.460> world
