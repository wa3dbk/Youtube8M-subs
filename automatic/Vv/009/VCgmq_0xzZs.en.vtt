00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.660
 Muslim parents in their roermond window 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.170

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.860
 somewhere that and that now there is Muslim 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.220
 kind of made clear of 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.900
 well we are muslims and we live in one 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.049
 in one in a western country 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.079
 where multiple parties are held 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.970
 who do not belong in our faith and carnival 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.590
 is one of those parties 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.150
 the clearer the variety to your time fun 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.209
 just hear a household name third son 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.269
 with youth problem shofukan shoes 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.840
 gray oligarch oil prevent yes now you can 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.329
 avatar 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.799
 color very many muslim parents in roermond 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.109
 have chosen not to have their child 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.780
 send to school during carnival 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.220
 he was given as a murderer 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.170
 of course i brought it you got i 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.040
 follow the news especially if it's mine 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 enters town 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.090
 let me first of course state that 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.549
 Islam therefore has two religious festivals 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.389
 that means that it is also out of the question 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.379
 as a Muslim for other religious festivals 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.870
 to participate in it 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.379
 so that is not possible that she can anderson 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.909
 Besides 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.489
 that also does not happen between those 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.139
 just to respect but I think so 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.900
 that a child just has to go to school and 

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:24.879
 I find that in a child's parent or so 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.989
 the community must contribute to 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.849
 alternative 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.129
 so the child does not stay at home but 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.169
 going to school we know what such 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.660
 party content and it respects for that 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:35.859
 does my religion actually do our religion 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.079
 So we lay you think it 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.250
 carnival party in principle for the 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.329
 Catholics can go ahead and without 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.409
 too many problems with the Muslim children 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.659
 absolutely 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.190
 this can go on and the children up 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.870
 Muslim children must know what it is 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.209
 means where it comes from and I think 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.709
 even that many are not Muslims so she is 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.940
 those who celebrate it themselves don't even agree 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.190
 know it is a man and religious 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.479
 I think faces would also have a 40 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.620
 days of stuck behind 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.049
 trail to be making them fox 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.310
 way but you will be little agitator 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.099
 find it there 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.729
 and know what charcoal barbecue is 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.280
 yes that is a very good one I ask 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:12.340
 think i did you there 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.889
 no well yes the brand out of coziness and 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.470
 also drink a bit that the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.130
 data is depend on where you are 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.989
 are 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.090
 the belief in this party 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.819
 do not think that does not play a role 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.710
 say this is not scary catholic celebration 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:30.770
 carnival does not find 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:35.419

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.250

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.419
 understand that the Netherlands turned itself from years 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.639

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:47.750
 warm weather sligro integration with but 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:50.930

 the past in education 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.449
 seated but I see I see no 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.620
 difference i see i say again and 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.810
 I always kept saying it's always 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.720
 the parents drive around you responsibly 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.360
 to give children Islam at home 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.860
 arab roermond li ybele who want 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.469
 not that their children celebrate carnival 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.340
 what do you think of it as an arab of mine yes 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:35.870
 yes man cultures amenity absolutely 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.699
 you bring the Arabs to us anyway 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.949
 you have to understand 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.500
 I will integrate for free 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:46.599
 the netherlands because they can call that me 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.599
 wanted replication and location 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.020
 I only think they are very clear 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.919
 and us must be look at month like 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.580
 they say of 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.009
 day is religious freedom yes but then 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.839
 they must also put in parentheses from 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.569
 god love nice freedom but Islam 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.490
 with the exception of Islam because Islam 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.259
 do you not see religion but we see 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.819
 as a danger to a society 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:12.559
 as we clearly indicate from hey 

00:06:10.819 --> 00:06:14.029
 listen if you need to be here 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.469
 you can participate in carnival then you can 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:17.210
 you will make that choice 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.210
 I think so because one because then it is like that 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.070
 from well i as a muslim i can live in 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:25.170
 a country where Islam is not 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.550
 admissible is a few could the suitcase 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.550
 another small and I am gone
