00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 so welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.140
 video is about how today 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.030
 we put the mainboard in the housing 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 but we have to install it first 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.230
 wrap up the backplate here because we 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.049
 then hardly possible to 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.949
 to have 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:24.480
 just go for it and listen 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:26.210
 pressed the backplate here in the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.220
 opening 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.369
 a little bit of pressure that should 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.809
 they grab one 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:39.870
 always watch out for the tips 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 because the zeltiq pointed and then should 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 directly was already in it to be so 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.300
 It looks and now we come to it 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.670
 how to install the mainboard 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 so now the mainboard can do what you want 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.480
 but you have to do this before 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 Motherboard often hit here 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 there we have the same case 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 are adapter included 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.250
 the whole time a screwdriver this 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.969
 so it can be done in a more relative way 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.329
 simple 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.670
 then you take your mainboards nicely 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.250
 take care and carefully put in here 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.369
 like that and we pack that there a bit 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.630
 it is a pity that it is the connections 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.470
 match the backplate behind 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.330
 there you have to always a bit 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.820
 Help and look like it's best 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.080
 but does not fit below the pcb 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.430
 hurt the best 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 they are very bad when that happens 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 here little fold on the way 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 plate now we go again here 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:47.000
 and see if it almost seems like that now 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.000
 as if the connections are all inside 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.229
 you should watch it 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:59.579
 yes yes good times from here look with 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.680
 the cables that fits exactly and tells 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:05.730
 you probably call not you see 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.100
 but now here are each 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.940
 to see golden parts 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.950
 there just looks like the first 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:21.150
 few screws rad best so 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:23.730
 diagonal little 1 was on the mainboard 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.630
 also volunteers are there but 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.510
 on the housing inside was also which 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.220
 because that we use and at which 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.490
 point in each case be stopped purely 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.490
 have to 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:42.150
 it is then the next flabby then 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:03:05.580
 we still have up here I'm 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:03:07.230
 the corners first so that's the best way 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.170
 a screwdriver where your hate the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.700
 you just have to be able to turn yourself 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.209
 always be a bit careful 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.860
 is the next because you are allowed 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.730
 do not screw on too tight otherwise 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.450
 going 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.450
 broken your mainboard 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:47.090
 that's you can enter here below 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.990
 Tighten bit every now and then recasts 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:53.840
 in the middle with backplate watch it all 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.110
 Everything is right here fits fits 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.900
 wobbles and has air and that's it 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.260
 from the mainboard installation as 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.600
 next i will show you the we 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.810
 yes you like the individual drives 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.390
 can install and the video card 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.980
 the mainboard and that was already great 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.390
 I would be happy about the thumbs up 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.880
 but sometimes about an abo when in the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.160
 comment the last and have a look 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.370
 on my facebook page after mine 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.380
 own facebook page and on the 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.669
 website you will find everything in the left 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.650
 video description and how you like that 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.910
 buys components and where you can find them 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.650
 is synonymous in the video description 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.610
 really on my amazon shop 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 everything in her a little something 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.820
 We could see each other in the shop 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:36.820
 next video has pure and service
