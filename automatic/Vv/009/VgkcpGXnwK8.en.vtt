I thought the fans will like him
obviously<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.970> know<00:03:20.090> it's<00:03:20.359> the<00:03:20.480> first<00:03:20.720> game

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
obviously you know it's the first game

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.620 
obviously you know it's the first game
today<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.410> it<00:03:22.099> took<00:03:22.340> him<00:03:22.370> sort<00:03:22.970> of<00:03:23.030> 15<00:03:23.419> minutes

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
today and it took him sort of 15 minutes

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.849 
today and it took him sort of 15 minutes
to<00:03:23.690> get<00:03:23.750> into<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.109> game<00:03:24.260> once<00:03:24.560> he'd<00:03:24.739> ever

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
to get into the game once he'd ever

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.740 
to get into the game once he'd ever
thought<00:03:25.130> I<00:03:25.190> thought<00:03:25.430> he<00:03:25.700> contributed<00:03:26.299> a<00:03:26.569> lot

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
thought I thought he contributed a lot

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.539 
thought I thought he contributed a lot
to<00:03:26.930> the<00:03:27.079> team<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.680> striker<00:03:27.950> with<00:03:28.160> two<00:03:28.340> goals

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
to the team and a striker with two goals

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.280 
to the team and a striker with two goals
today<00:03:28.849> that<00:03:29.180> second<00:03:29.599> goal<00:03:29.720> was<00:03:29.750> crucial<00:03:30.260> for

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
today that second goal was crucial for

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.960 
today that second goal was crucial for
Robbie<00:03:30.500> Simpson<00:03:30.799> he's<00:03:31.160> come<00:03:31.400> on<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.669> last<00:03:31.819> two

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
Robbie Simpson he's come on the last two

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.229 
Robbie Simpson he's come on the last two
games<00:03:32.000> and<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.900> left<00:03:33.380> them<00:03:33.560> out<00:03:33.709> because<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.880> you

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
games and I left them out because it you

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.580 
games and I left them out because it you
know<00:03:35.329> I<00:03:35.359> know<00:03:35.480> is<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.750> straight<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.410> know<00:03:36.440> if

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
know I know is a straight you know if

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.199 
know I know is a straight you know if
you<00:03:36.680> go<00:03:36.829> six<00:03:37.160> or<00:03:37.250> seven<00:03:37.519> games<00:03:37.639> without<00:03:37.910> school

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
you go six or seven games without school

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.059 
you go six or seven games without school
and<00:03:38.329> it<00:03:38.720> does<00:03:38.900> affect<00:03:39.230> it<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.560> sometimes<00:03:39.739> you

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
and it does affect it and sometimes you

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.710 
and it does affect it and sometimes you
need<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.280> be<00:03:40.489> left<00:03:40.669> out<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.419> get<00:03:41.569> that

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
need to be left out to get that

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.750 
need to be left out to get that
freshness<00:03:42.019> about<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:42.590> and<00:03:43.370> the<00:03:43.459> last<00:03:43.609> two

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
freshness about you and the last two

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.190 
freshness about you and the last two
games<00:03:44.000> which<00:03:44.150> come<00:03:44.359> always<00:03:44.540> look<00:03:44.690> very<00:03:44.900> short

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
games which come always look very short

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.629 
games which come always look very short
so<00:03:45.410> before<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.769> game<00:03:45.919> it's<00:03:46.340> only<00:03:46.489> a<00:03:46.549> matter

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
so before the game it's only a matter

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.550 
so before the game it's only a matter
for<00:03:47.090> your<00:03:47.209> school<00:03:47.269> mate<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:47.810> you're
