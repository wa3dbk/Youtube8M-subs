00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
light came up just right fun I believe

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.710 
light came up just right fun I believe
it<00:02:12.630> was<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> second<00:02:13.200> song<00:02:13.320> that<00:02:13.590> he<00:02:13.680> was<00:02:13.799> gone

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it was the second song that he was gone

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.300 
it was the second song that he was gone
then<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.840> times<00:02:16.079> at<00:02:16.290> film<00:02:16.530> world<00:02:16.799> sure<00:02:17.100> there

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
then the times at film world sure there

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.600 
then the times at film world sure there
was<00:02:17.400> more<00:02:17.610> action<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.120> those<00:02:18.269> photos<00:02:19.519> again<00:02:20.519> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
was more action to those photos again it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.890 
was more action to those photos again it
was<00:02:20.700> very<00:02:20.880> hard<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.150> capture<00:02:21.540> because<00:02:21.630> he

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
was very hard to capture because he

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
was very hard to capture because he
moved<00:02:22.049> around<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.500> stage<00:02:22.799> of<00:02:23.040> life<00:02:23.329> so<00:02:24.329> you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
moved around the stage of life so you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.789 
moved around the stage of life so you
really<00:02:24.720> had<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.900> keep<00:02:25.110> your<00:02:25.260> eyes<00:02:25.380> open

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
really had to keep your eyes open
