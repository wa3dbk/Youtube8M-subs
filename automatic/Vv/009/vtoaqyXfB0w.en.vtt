00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
it's about action and I think that's the

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.649 
it's about action and I think that's the
biggest<00:00:02.490> thing<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.820> keep<00:00:02.970> stressed<00:00:03.270> or<00:00:03.419> guys

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
biggest thing we keep stressed or guys

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.019 
biggest thing we keep stressed or guys
you<00:00:03.990> know<00:00:04.110> not<00:00:04.319> that<00:00:04.549> you<00:00:05.549> know<00:00:05.640> not<00:00:05.850> that<00:00:05.879> we

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
you know not that you know not that we

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.450 
you know not that you know not that we
don't<00:00:06.120> want<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.359> give<00:00:07.020> guys<00:00:07.230> media<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.220> talk<00:00:08.429> a

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
don't want to give guys media and talk a

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.100 
don't want to give guys media and talk a
lot<00:00:08.760> but<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.300> know<00:00:09.389> we've<00:00:09.540> had<00:00:09.570> enough<00:00:09.900> talk

open and we don't need a whole lot talk
about<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> think<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> think<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
about it I think that I think the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.479 
about it I think that I think the
attitudes<00:00:40.140> right<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.590> think<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> tempo

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
attitudes right I think the tempo

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.100 
attitudes right I think the tempo
obviously<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.719> better<00:00:42.809> each<00:00:43.020> and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
obviously we can get better each and

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.660 
obviously we can get better each and
every<00:00:43.320> day<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> attitudes<00:00:44.550> are

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
every day but i think the attitudes are

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
every day but i think the attitudes are
right<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.940> guys<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.270> working<00:00:45.629> together<00:00:45.870> as<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
right the guys are working together as a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.170
