00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
of it the cross-section is a lot

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190 
of it the cross-section is a lot
different<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.940> a<00:00:36.090> little<00:00:36.300> bit<00:00:36.420> wider<00:00:36.660> back

it's<00:00:39.780> narrower<00:00:40.370> across<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.640> top<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> much

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
it's narrower across the top and much

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.930 
it's narrower across the top and much
sharper<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.920> leading<00:00:44.129> edge<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> blade

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
sharper on the leading edge of the blade

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.400 
sharper on the leading edge of the blade
which<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:45.840> good<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
which is going to be really good for a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.819 
which is going to be really good for a
water<00:00:47.010> extraction<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.600> handle<00:00:49.110> if<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.620> can

tell has some finger indentations and

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760 
tell has some finger indentations and
it's<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.399> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.140> textured<00:00:55.140> finish<00:00:55.170> which

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it's got kind of a textured finish which

it's got kind of a textured finish which
give<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.190> gives<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> really<00:00:57.300> good<00:00:57.510> feel<00:00:57.750> in

the<00:01:28.590> blade<00:01:28.799> pops<00:01:29.130> out<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.820> can

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
