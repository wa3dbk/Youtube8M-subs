00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
best on the other side she's a champ and

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
best on the other side she's a champ and
she<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:01.370> chant<00:01:02.370> lady<00:01:02.579> before<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> was<00:01:03.270> a

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.710 
she was a chant lady before I was a
champ<00:01:03.660> so<00:01:04.970> anything<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.030> look<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.570> her

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
champ so anything I look up to her

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.410 
champ so anything I look up to her
family<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.500> first<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.070> nothing<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:09.000> come

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
family is first and nothing can come

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
family is first and nothing can come
between<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.900> because<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.650> basic<00:01:10.950> unit<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
between that because the basic unit of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.980 
between that because the basic unit of
society<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.119> means<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> us

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
society and it means so much to us

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.160 
society and it means so much to us
because<00:01:13.430> sports<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.729> only<00:01:14.850> last<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.750> know<00:01:15.869> at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
because sports can only last you know at

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.890 
because sports can only last you know at
the<00:01:16.320> maximum<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:17.369> tennis<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.880> 10<00:01:18.450> 15
