00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.340
 well it's hard to find the words but hey 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.429
 laval which simply that it was necessary to put this match as well be 

00:00:11.069 --> 00:00:13.709
 and then if it's just that, not to repeat the same nonsense 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.709
 because it's true that i livity tonight we go we cracked 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.419
 the nerves have let go of the leader in some 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:21.359
 in the Breton club 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.300

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 of auteuil 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.720
 you have to remember 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.220
 not responded to provocations 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.710
 even if the win was one way tonight but hey 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.920
 it's not serious Eurobarometer in travel time and 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.220
 the work of his father 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.730
 while our place 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.750
 attention we felt a little bit before 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 during the match itself did not take place 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.220
 these clashes 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.940
 he thought we were little more on the fire 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
 brabant 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.710
 a little light was aimed in retracing that I go to the cause I insisted his 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 host on the fact that we with whom I like to provoke so I had asked 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.500
 to everyone to do a job for four years and I want it to be even 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.400
 bravo to pay the conditions and the facts of match with the arbitration which 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.440
 will make it hard to control yourself 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.490
 but beautiful but that's fine it will serve me for rock for the future husband 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.790
 and you do not know it's sorry it ends like that because kombouarÃ© has 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.010
 favorite witch 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.380
 in an other way 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.020
 couturier the world cup 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 and also the match for third place you gave up the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.180
 rebel commanders responsible tonight is to bounce back very quickly at this 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.070
 who will arrive quickly 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.670
 you have to recover 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.280
 because the viscount of hindsight must appear to know what we found 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.180
 some answers 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.800
 for all Nigerians it will not be the same atmosphere that you tried to 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.750
 have to concentrate on board and how 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.760
 guarbecque jean-robert oppose so we try to focus 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 praia - tanseau because we know what is an egypt and algeria 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.180
 male consumers he adds 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.720
 3 24 th place in h-cup 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.960
 less pressure maybe some arrive not yet completed 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.130
 rest pressure 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.080
 we are happy and proud of my career 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.000
 to talk about a heat do you know sql 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.820
 as are more physical button pressed to play on our qualities 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.390
 or so down it's a very physical team 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.320
 we know we sometimes know his prisons 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 it's okay, it's going really fast 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.100
 on the other hand messier farce so his back was not happening by chance so 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.110
 we will have found his way 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.939
 they are ubs customers 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.799
 we are more nuanced but hey it's mostly his son 113 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.149
 as I take ruckus deposits and to properly recover and empty 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.600

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.610
 today from canadian to brushard we will try to finish in beauty because 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.340
 the program at the end of a college 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.040
 a little difficult but we will try to get back to really stand 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.819
 at this rate of fire
