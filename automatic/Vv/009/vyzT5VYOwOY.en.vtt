00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.420 
because it's got a lot of like alcohol
in<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.840> definitely<00:01:22.740> something<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
in it it's definitely something that

in it it's definitely something that
works<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.880> me<00:01:24.119> because<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.570> really

works for me because I have a really

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
works for me because I have a really
really<00:01:25.110> sensitive<00:01:25.290> skin<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.759> is

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
really sensitive skin so this is

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600
