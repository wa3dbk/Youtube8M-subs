this unit there's just one wire in plug

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.970 
this unit there's just one wire in plug
so<00:01:01.750> you<00:01:01.780> don't<00:01:01.990> need<00:01:02.080> to<00:01:02.170> make<00:01:02.290> any<00:01:02.350> specialist

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
so you don't need to make any specialist

switches once the clips have been
unhooked<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.830> could<00:01:35.070> find<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.460> easier<00:01:35.820> to

unhooked you could find it easier to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
unhooked you could find it easier to
disconnect<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.540> switch<00:01:36.840> or<00:01:37.140> switches<00:01:37.530> from

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
disconnect the switch or switches from

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.160 
disconnect the switch or switches from
the<00:01:37.830> PCB<00:01:38.220> before<00:01:38.760> removing<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.330> they<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the PCB before removing it they just

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.690 
the PCB before removing it they just
clip<00:01:40.350> onto<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> board<00:01:40.980> with<00:01:41.250> these<00:01:41.370> little

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
clip onto the board with these little

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.180 
clip onto the board with these little
takes

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.240 

I<00:01:46.900> wonder<00:01:47.900> what<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:48.080> switch<00:01:48.350> from<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.560> PCB

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
I wonder what the switch from the PCB

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.070 
I wonder what the switch from the PCB
and<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.820> was<00:01:49.910> there<00:01:50.120> attached<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.690> control

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
and it was there attached to the control

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.590 
and it was there attached to the control
knob<00:01:51.320> until<00:01:51.620> I<00:01:51.680> remove<00:01:51.980> it<00:01:55.270> as<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.510> see

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
knob until I remove it as you can see

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.240 
knob until I remove it as you can see
the<00:01:57.020> switch<00:01:57.230> is<00:01:57.410> very<00:01:57.620> simple<00:01:58.040> in<00:01:58.100> its

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
the switch is very simple in its

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.680 
the switch is very simple in its
construction<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:59.060> only<00:01:59.270> has<00:01:59.420> one<00:01:59.450> moving

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
construction and only has one moving

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:39.850 

make<00:02:38.659> sure<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:38.900> replace<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.439> switch<00:02:39.680> in<00:02:39.830> the

make sure you replace the switch in the
