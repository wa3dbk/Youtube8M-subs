00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
in has a pattern maker there too I've

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
in has a pattern maker there too I've
used<00:00:44.579> both<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.360> I've<00:00:45.600> gone<00:00:46.110> both<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
used both and I've gone both back and

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.340 
used both and I've gone both back and
forth<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.120> know<00:00:48.149> either<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:49.079> is

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
forth on this you know either way is

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.369 
forth on this you know either way is
fine<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.420> also<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.870> kind<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.140> depends

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fine but it also really kind of depends

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.540 
fine but it also really kind of depends
on<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> quantities<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.250> you're<00:00:53.340> planning

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
on the quantities that you're planning

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.670 
on the quantities that you're planning
to<00:00:53.760> produce<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.379> probably

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
to produce as well but I would probably

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.369 
to produce as well but I would probably
say<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.480> get<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> best<00:00:57.899> people<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.320> can

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
say that get the best people you can

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
say that get the best people you can
find<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.309> they're<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.760> same<00:00:59.940> place

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
find and if they're in the same place

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.060 
find and if they're in the same place
so<00:01:00.660> be<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> don't<00:01:01.680> think<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
so be it but I don't think it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
so be it but I don't think it's
important<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.430> they<00:01:02.609> need<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:04.170> kind<00:01:04.769> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
important that they need to be I kind of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
important that they need to be I kind of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.910

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
between the two of them and if they're

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.190 
between the two of them and if they're
in<00:01:20.790> two<00:01:20.939> different<00:01:20.970> companies<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> sort

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
in two different companies it can sort

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.100 
in two different companies it can sort
of<00:01:22.290> diffuse<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.640> tension<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.780> know

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
of diffuse some of the tension you know

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.990 
of diffuse some of the tension you know
there's<00:01:25.290> no<00:01:25.409> hard<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.799> fast<00:01:25.890> rule<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:26.670> that's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
there's no hard and fast rule but that's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.210 
there's no hard and fast rule but that's
my<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:27.509> traces<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.380> separate<00:01:28.850> and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
my first traces have to be separate and

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.440 
my first traces have to be separate and
the<00:01:32.220> most<00:01:32.909> important<00:01:33.270> thing<00:01:33.329> though

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the most important thing though

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.820 
the most important thing though
truthfully<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
truthfully is that the

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.130 
truthfully is that the
maker<00:01:36.040> is<00:01:36.340> really<00:01:36.700> really<00:01:36.880> good<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:38.080> that

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
maker is really really good and that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.860 
maker is really really good and that
there's<00:01:38.890> a<00:01:39.010> level<00:01:39.400> of<00:01:39.610> trust<00:01:39.670> between<00:01:40.270> them

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
there's a level of trust between them

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.080 
there's a level of trust between them
because<00:01:41.680> I<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:42.010> definitely<00:01:42.340> had<00:01:42.640> situations

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
because I have definitely had situations

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.510 
because I have definitely had situations
where<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:44.230> sewers<00:01:44.680> would<00:01:44.830> always<00:01:45.040> say<00:01:45.370> well

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
where the sewers would always say well

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.100 
where the sewers would always say well
this<00:01:45.640> pattern<00:01:46.030> drives<00:01:46.240> Patra<00:01:46.690> they<00:01:46.840> didn't

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
this pattern drives Patra they didn't

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.240 
this pattern drives Patra they didn't
seem<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.290> have<00:01:47.410> a<00:01:47.470> lot<00:01:47.590> of<00:01:47.620> respect<00:01:48.040> for<00:01:48.160> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
seem to have a lot of respect for the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.730 
seem to have a lot of respect for the
pattern<00:01:48.580> maker<00:01:48.790> so<00:01:49.420> I<00:01:49.450> try<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.050> find<00:01:50.350> if<00:01:50.620> I'm

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
pattern maker so I try to find if I'm

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.290 
pattern maker so I try to find if I'm
gonna<00:01:50.950> if<00:01:51.100> I'm<00:01:51.220> working<00:01:51.430> with<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:51.730> contractor<00:01:51.880> I
