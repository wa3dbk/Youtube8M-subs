00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
fast and I think if you stick with a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.290 
fast and I think if you stick with a
consistent<00:00:39.680> bach<00:00:40.680> Titian<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.820> faster

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
consistent bach Titian the faster

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.430 
consistent bach Titian the faster

they're more familiar with it and you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.069 
they're more familiar with it and you
know<00:00:45.899> just<00:00:46.020> more<00:00:46.440> practice<00:00:47.539> will<00:00:48.539> give<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
know just more practice will give them a

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.709 
know just more practice will give them a
better<00:00:49.469> chance<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.300> get<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.390> hair<00:00:51.570> done

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.650 
I actually found out what slippage was
and<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.130> have<00:02:21.340> been<00:02:21.520> experiencing<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.510> lot

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
and that I have been experiencing a lot

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.820 
and that I have been experiencing a lot
of<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.370> apparently<00:02:24.370> since<00:02:25.830> having

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
of it apparently since having

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.570 
of it apparently since having
sisterlocks<00:02:27.990> basically<00:02:28.990> what<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.530> thought<00:02:30.220> or

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
sisterlocks basically what I thought or

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.440 
sisterlocks basically what I thought or
soon<00:02:30.940> ship<00:02:31.270> which<00:02:31.390> was<00:02:31.420> was<00:02:32.460> from<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.730> from

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
soon ship which was was from the from

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.980 
soon ship which was was from the from
the<00:02:34.950> ends<00:02:35.950> your<00:02:36.130> hair<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:37.090> hair<00:02:37.270> unraveling

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
the ends your hair the hair unraveling

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.460 
the ends your hair the hair unraveling
but<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:40.060> law<00:02:40.270> Titian<00:02:40.720> has<00:02:40.960> informed<00:02:41.380> me<00:02:41.440> that

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
but my law Titian has informed me that

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.380 
but my law Titian has informed me that
that's<00:02:41.920> actually<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.490> caught<00:02:42.730> unraveling

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
that's actually just caught unraveling

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.460 
that's actually just caught unraveling
when<00:02:43.630> um<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:46.000> hairs<00:02:46.240> actually<00:02:46.900> come<00:02:47.140> come

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
when um the hairs actually come come

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.960 
when um the hairs actually come come
aloose<00:02:47.710> but<00:02:48.070> they<00:02:48.160> will<00:02:48.340> eventually<00:02:48.430> lock

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
aloose but they will eventually lock

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.310 
aloose but they will eventually lock
back<00:02:49.180> up<00:02:49.710> slippage<00:02:50.710> is<00:02:51.100> when<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.690> can't<00:02:53.170> we

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
back up slippage is when you can't we

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.660 
back up slippage is when you can't we
see<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:53.770> my<00:02:54.190> hair<00:02:54.400> because<00:02:54.640> we<00:02:55.360> tighten

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
see it now my hair because we tighten

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.160 
see it now my hair because we tighten
what<00:02:57.670> exactly<00:02:58.060> time<00:02:58.300> for<00:02:58.780> me<00:02:58.960> to<00:02:58.990> your

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
what exactly time for me to your

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.390 
what exactly time for me to your
tightening<00:02:59.860> i'll<00:03:00.010> probably<00:03:00.190> do<00:03:00.370> another

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
tightening i'll probably do another

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.480 
tightening i'll probably do another
video<00:03:00.730> about<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.270> but<00:03:01.930> what<00:03:02.770> slippage<00:03:03.070> is<00:03:03.280> is

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
video about it but what slippage is is

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.270 
video about it but what slippage is is
when<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.960> hair<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:06.460> root<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:08.280> become

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
when the hair at the root is become

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.030 
when the hair at the root is become
smoother<00:03:10.000> than<00:03:10.300> normal<00:03:10.810> from<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> scalp<00:03:11.739> and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
smoother than normal from the scalp and

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.910 
smoother than normal from the scalp and
this<00:03:12.730> causes<00:03:13.090> the<00:03:13.420> hair<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.930> slip<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.590> become

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
this causes the hair to slip and become

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
this causes the hair to slip and become
loose<00:03:15.100> which<00:03:15.700> can<00:03:15.910> happen<00:03:16.090> from<00:03:16.440> working<00:03:17.440> out

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
loose which can happen from working out

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.150 
loose which can happen from working out
sweating<00:03:18.940> in<00:03:19.060> your<00:03:19.209> hair<00:03:19.570> I'm<00:03:20.290> styling<00:03:20.920> your

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
sweating in your hair I'm styling your

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.890 
sweating in your hair I'm styling your
hair<00:03:21.220> too<00:03:21.580> much<00:03:21.790> pulling<00:03:22.330> your<00:03:22.420> hair<00:03:22.600> into

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
hair too much pulling your hair into

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900 
hair too much pulling your hair into
like<00:03:23.230> ponytail<00:03:23.830> because<00:03:24.340> you're<00:03:24.730> going<00:03:24.850> to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
like ponytail because you're going to

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.330 
like ponytail because you're going to
actually<00:03:25.270> pull<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:26.140> Lister<00:03:26.620> swaps<00:03:26.950> from<00:03:27.160> the

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
actually pull that Lister swaps from the

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.570 
actually pull that Lister swaps from the
root<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.090> how<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.270> happens<00:03:28.989> actually

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
root you see how that happens actually

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.400 
root you see how that happens actually
causing<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.670> slip<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:32.050> the<00:03:32.230> page

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
causing the slip so that is the page

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.229 
causing the slip so that is the page
I'll<00:03:32.680> do<00:03:32.920> another<00:03:33.010> video<00:03:33.340> update<00:03:33.790> about<00:03:33.880> that

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
I'll do another video update about that

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.180 
I'll do another video update about that
and<00:03:34.510> about<00:03:34.570> four<00:03:35.230> or<00:03:35.260> five<00:03:35.350> weeks<00:03:35.500> when<00:03:36.040> it's

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
and about four or five weeks when it's

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.090 
and about four or five weeks when it's
time<00:03:36.370> are<00:03:36.760> tightening<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.360> show<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:38.100> what

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
time are tightening to show you what

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.800 
time are tightening to show you what
it's<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> only<00:03:39.700> like<00:03:39.910> at<00:03:40.180> five<00:03:40.360> weeks<00:03:40.660> and

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
it's the only like at five weeks and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.570 
it's the only like at five weeks and
what<00:03:41.019> slippage<00:03:41.410> looks<00:03:41.620> like<00:03:41.830> it's<00:03:42.010> isaac<00:03:42.370> so

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
what slippage looks like it's isaac so

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.470 
what slippage looks like it's isaac so
if<00:03:42.640> i'm<00:03:42.730> probably<00:03:43.209> gonna<00:03:43.630> have<00:03:43.870> some<00:03:44.080> more<00:03:44.310> um
