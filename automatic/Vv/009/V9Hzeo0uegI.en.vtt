let's compare the vibrant with the

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.679 
let's compare the vibrant with the
Google<00:01:15.210> Nexus<00:01:15.479> One<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.580> Nexus<00:01:17.970> One<00:01:18.000> also<00:01:18.450> has

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Google Nexus One the Nexus One also has

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.710 
Google Nexus One the Nexus One also has
a<00:01:18.720> OLED<00:01:19.439> display<00:01:20.009> but<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.369> vibrance<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.450> a

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
a OLED display but the vibrance is a

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170 
a OLED display but the vibrance is a
Super<00:01:22.320> AMOLED<00:01:22.619> display<00:01:23.520> it's<00:01:23.700> basically<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
newer version of it so the vibrant

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.030 
newer version of it so the vibrant

hump at the back now I don't have an
iPhone<00:02:52.870> 4<00:02:53.470> so<00:02:53.829> we'll<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.159> compare<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.579> with

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609

the<00:02:54.790> 3GS<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.599> 3GS<00:02:56.019> is<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> little<00:02:56.620> bit<00:02:56.769> thicker

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the 3GS the 3GS is a little bit thicker

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.550 
the 3GS the 3GS is a little bit thicker
although<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.299> iPhone<00:02:58.659> 4<00:02:58.900> should<00:02:59.139> be<00:02:59.200> thinner

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
although the iPhone 4 should be thinner

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.819
