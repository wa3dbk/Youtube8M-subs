00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
control sensitivity all the way guess

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.180 
control sensitivity all the way guess
there's<00:00:38.340> like<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:39.000> new<00:00:39.590> meter<00:00:40.590> thing<00:00:41.550> glow<00:00:43.190> too

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sensitive all right we've gotta get

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.420 
sensitive all right we've gotta get
eight<00:00:49.020> pages<00:00:50.690> set<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.809> books<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.379> keys<00:00:52.800> why<00:00:53.250> me

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.029 
but I guess it's just the window this
sensitivity<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.870> way<00:01:01.020> too<00:01:01.079> high<00:01:01.440> hold<00:01:01.710> on<00:01:01.859> one
