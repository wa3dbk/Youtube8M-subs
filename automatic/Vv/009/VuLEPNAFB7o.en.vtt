00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.130
In the DIY world, There are dozens of kinds
of drawbot.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.480
This one is a SCARA robot, it could draw the
pixel on a surface.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.749
This one could make an Easter egg.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:16.570
This one is like a car.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.349
Oh, This one could draw a picture on the wall.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.660
What we do here, is to put them together,
like a transformer.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.320
This is mDrawBot, a 4-in-1 drawbot.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.620
In 2012, we brought you the Makeblock, the
next generation of construction platform,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.390
it helps you build your own robot quickly.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.589
Now, our team has grown from 5 to 50.

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.289
We're ready to take on something bigger.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:45.359
mDrawbot is based on Makeblock.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.219
It contains structures, motors, pen lift mechanism
and electronics.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920
Form one is mSpider.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.950
It's a high-precision robot on a vertical
surface.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.280
And typically it's painting range is huge.The
2 step motors are used to control the position

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.960
of spider.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.710
Form two is mScara.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.220
Oh, you have seen that before.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.390
mScara could draw wonderful painting on the
paper.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.020
And if you put a laser diode instead of a
pen, it could even become a laser engraver!

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.810
The third one is mEggbot,which could help
you make your own Easter eggs.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.289
Pretty, uh-huh?

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:28.229
And the last one is mCar, the infinite drawbot,
on the ground.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.680
However, when we talk about the DIY robot,we
always think about the mass of cable, and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.079
the complicated code.

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.030
With the mDrawbot, you don't need them any
more.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.770
You could use Rj25 cable instead of Dupont,
that would save a lot of time for you.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280
As for the software, the operation is simple.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.090
All you need to do is three step, pick the
form you want.Connect the serial port.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:58.549
And upload the firmware.Then open a svg file,
make some adjustment.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.909
At last, click the "start" button.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.090
This is mDrawBot, a wonderful DIY robot.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.710
It's a drawbot, and more than a drawbot.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.670
You could use it to do anything you imagine.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.390
Now, we bring it to you.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.019
Here is the question, what are you going to
draw.
