your<00:01:14.729> storm<00:01:14.909> itself<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.810> very

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
your storm itself it's a very

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.770 
your storm itself it's a very
comfortable<00:01:16.619> Buster<00:01:17.189> it's<00:01:17.430> big<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
comfortable Buster it's big here and a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.649 
comfortable Buster it's big here and a
small<00:01:19.080> handle<00:01:19.759> put<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> batteries<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.270> here

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
small handle put the batteries in here

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.600 
small handle put the batteries in here
and<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.740> down<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.950> trigger<00:01:23.009> fire<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and you hold down the trigger fire I

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:44.390 
and you hold down the trigger fire I
will<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.360> batteries

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.950 

so<00:01:45.400> this<00:01:45.580> is<00:01:45.700> what<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:45.940> bus<00:01:46.120> sounds<00:01:46.600> like<00:01:46.750> with

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
so this is what the bus sounds like with

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.360 
so this is what the bus sounds like with
the<00:01:47.170> batches<00:01:47.590> in<00:01:47.710> but<00:01:47.860> no<00:01:47.950> water

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.280 

sounds<00:01:51.370> pretty<00:01:51.580> powerful<00:01:52.120> and<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.050> color

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
sounds pretty powerful and the color

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.000 
sounds pretty powerful and the color
scheme<00:01:53.470> is<00:01:54.060> orange<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.390> blue<00:01:55.740> where<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> walks

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
scheme is orange a blue where the walks

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.370 
scheme is orange a blue where the walks
toward<00:01:57.310> white<00:01:57.820> says<00:01:58.570> super<00:01:58.840> soak<00:01:59.020> here<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
toward white says super soak here and

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.320 
toward white says super soak here and
hide<00:01:59.530> result<00:01:59.800> I<00:01:59.950> am<00:02:00.010> hydro<00:02:00.580> stone<00:02:00.850> there<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
hide result I am hydro stone there and

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.230 
hide result I am hydro stone there and
then<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.140> has<00:02:02.350> these<00:02:02.590> blue<00:02:02.979> bubble<00:02:03.640> dot<00:02:03.970> fangs

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
it's the same on the other side but

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.200 
it's the same on the other side but
anyway<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.370> will<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.670> filling<00:02:07.000> up<00:02:07.090> the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
anyway it will go to filling up the

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
Buster so how you feel of the blaster is

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.900 
Buster so how you feel of the blaster is
you<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.520> screw<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.920> cap<00:02:11.950> until<00:02:12.370> comes<00:02:12.730> off

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
and then you turn on the top and then

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.410 
and then you turn on the top and then
this<00:02:19.030> takes<00:02:19.270> quite<00:02:19.540> wild<00:02:19.840> fill<00:02:20.110> up<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:21.420> it's

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this takes quite wild fill up and it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.360 
this takes quite wild fill up and it's
getting<00:02:22.750> great<00:02:23.200> range<00:02:23.530> better<00:02:24.070> than<00:02:24.250> your

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
getting great range better than your

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670 
getting great range better than your
lecture<00:02:24.730> storm<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.560> thunderstorm<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
lecture storm and the thunderstorm the

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.050 
lecture storm and the thunderstorm the
lightning<00:02:26.980> storm<00:02:27.340> let's<00:02:27.910> filled<00:02:28.180> up<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:30.060> but

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
lightning storm let's filled up and but

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.010 
lightning storm let's filled up and but
this<00:02:31.209> fight<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.480> different<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.050> them<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:34.020> so

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
this fight is different to them and so
