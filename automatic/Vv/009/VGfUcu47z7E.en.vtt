anything like you can try and update

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.869 
anything like you can try and update
your<00:00:56.190> mod<00:00:56.370> early<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:58.440> I<00:00:58.680> would<00:00:59.039> keep<00:00:59.460> checking

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
your mod early but I would keep checking

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.520 
your mod early but I would keep checking
it<00:01:00.000> because<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> did<00:01:00.539> say<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.320> things

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it because they did say that if things

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.380 
it because they did say that if things
aren't<00:01:01.829> working<00:01:02.039> as<00:01:02.579> intended<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:03.270> they

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
aren't working as intended then they

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
aren't working as intended then they
will<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.600> changing<00:01:04.170> things<00:01:04.379> which<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
will be changing things which is

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.359 
will be changing things which is
obviously<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:07.140> however<00:01:07.860> one<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.189> have

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
noticed hopefully they'll put it back on

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
out what the seed is then that's not

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.700 
out what the seed is then that's not
really<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.900> be<00:01:24.990> possible<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> do

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710

is<00:01:43.229> literally<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.829> drag<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.280> place<00:01:44.460> with

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
is literally just drag on a place with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.370 
is literally just drag on a place with
your<00:01:44.790> normal<00:01:45.119> minecraft<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.600> jar<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.320> if

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
your normal minecraft that jar but if

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
you've never done it before then I guess

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.740
