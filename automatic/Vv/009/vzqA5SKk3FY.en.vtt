place<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.699> play<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.270> this<00:00:18.420> case<00:00:18.630> five<00:00:18.960> times

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
place to play it in this case five times

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.670 
place to play it in this case five times
one<00:00:19.470> equals<00:00:19.500> 5<00:00:20.630> 7<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.840> not<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> play<00:00:22.470> for<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
one equals 5 7 I do not see a play for a

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.980 
one equals 5 7 I do not see a play for a
seven<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.100> I'm<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.430> another<00:00:23.609> card<00:00:23.990> 08

seven so I'm going to do another card 08

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.800 
seven so I'm going to do another card 08
minus<00:00:25.380> 8<00:00:25.590> equals<00:00:25.800> 0<00:00:26.279> so<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.119> can<00:00:27.420> move<00:00:27.570> along

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
minus 8 equals 0 so I can move along

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
minus 8 equals 0 so I can move along

very rapidly through the game 2 plus one

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.910 
very rapidly through the game 2 plus one
