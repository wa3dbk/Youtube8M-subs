just going to skip ahead to UM all the

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.780 
just going to skip ahead to UM all the
live<00:02:42.700> wallpapers<00:02:43.269> I<00:02:43.359> have<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.569> my<00:02:43.689> device<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.479 
live wallpapers I have in my device the
one<00:02:49.090> our<00:02:49.239> head<00:02:49.510> on<00:02:49.629> screen<00:02:49.959> is<00:02:50.200> called<00:02:50.500> bubbles

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.800 

there's<00:02:54.489> no<00:02:55.180> options<00:02:55.569> but<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:57.659> think<00:02:58.659> maybe

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
there's no options but I think maybe

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.390 
there's no options but I think maybe
change<00:02:59.109> the<00:02:59.200> color<00:02:59.440> could<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.040> pretty<00:03:00.220> cool

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
change the color could be pretty cool

it's I guess it like going through your
blood<00:03:53.349> cells<00:03:53.620> or<00:03:54.129> an<00:03:54.819> artery<00:03:55.739> showing<00:03:57.150> blue

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150

blood cells or an artery showing blue
blood<00:03:58.510> cells<00:03:58.750> instead<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.459> red<00:04:03.269> now<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.780> could

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
blood cells instead of red now you could

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.300 
blood cells instead of red now you could
change<00:04:05.260> these<00:04:05.470> colors<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.849> that<00:04:07.319> but<00:04:08.319> blue<00:04:09.040> is

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
change these colors so that but blue is

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:19.259

my<00:04:09.729> color<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:14.409> can<00:04:14.560> also<00:04:14.739> speed<00:04:15.669> up<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.880> rate

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
my color you can also speed up the rate

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.980 
my color you can also speed up the rate
in<00:04:19.570> which<00:04:20.459> you<00:04:21.459> go<00:04:21.760> through<00:04:22.180> the<00:04:22.840> artery

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
in which you go through the artery

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
bit too much to see your apps in the

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.969 
bit too much to see your apps in the
background<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:38.099> your<00:04:38.129> widgets<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.819> so<00:04:39.979> slow
