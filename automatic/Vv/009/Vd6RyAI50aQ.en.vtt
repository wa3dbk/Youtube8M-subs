back to something that I said in a
previous<00:01:18.120> show<00:01:18.480> I<00:01:18.840> think<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.740> regardless<00:01:19.980> of

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
what your body type is you can probably

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.440 
what your body type is you can probably
pull<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> crop<00:01:23.190> top<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.610> long<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.330> you

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
pull off a crop top as long as you

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.600 
pull off a crop top as long as you
figure<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.750> where<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.350> waist<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.220> wear

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
a skirt or a pair of pants should

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.740 
a skirt or a pair of pants should
basically<00:01:28.890> rest<00:01:29.400> on<00:01:29.580> your<00:01:29.700> body<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.300> in<00:01:30.570> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
basically rest on your body so in this

it's a wife beater underneath but it's

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.580 
it's a wife beater underneath but it's
the<00:04:00.549> idea<00:04:00.909> that<00:04:00.970> she<00:04:01.299> has<00:04:01.510> this<00:04:01.810> shawl<00:04:02.199> this

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
the idea that she has this shawl this

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.319 
the idea that she has this shawl this
scarf<00:04:02.949> over<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.579> that<00:04:03.729> she<00:04:03.879> can<00:04:04.030> wrap<00:04:04.299> around

scarf over it that she can wrap around

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:07.349 
scarf over it that she can wrap around
and<00:04:05.019> it<00:04:05.470> immediately<00:04:05.769> gives<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.669> pop<00:04:07.000> of

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
and it immediately gives that pop of

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.360 
and it immediately gives that pop of
style<00:04:07.989> whether<00:04:08.349> it's<00:04:08.530> leopard<00:04:08.919> print<00:04:09.190> or

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
style whether it's leopard print or

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.680 
style whether it's leopard print or
whether<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.699> would<00:04:09.790> be<00:04:09.819> houndstooth<00:04:10.389> it

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
whether it would be houndstooth it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.360 
whether it would be houndstooth it
doesn't<00:04:10.989> matter<00:04:11.169> because<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.979> definitely

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
doesn't matter because it definitely

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.110 
doesn't matter because it definitely
just<00:04:12.819> gives<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.150> easy<00:04:13.599> polished<00:04:14.500> edge<00:04:15.120> that
