a very tricky team to play against the
blade<00:01:49.230> am<00:01:49.380> also<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.800> preseason<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.280> and

blade am also in a preseason game and
was<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> very<00:01:51.690> difficult<00:01:51.930> game<00:01:52.580> they<00:01:53.580> created<00:01:53.760> a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
was a very difficult game they created a

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.560 
was a very difficult game they created a
lot<00:01:54.150> of<00:01:54.300> chances<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.810> did<00:01:55.020> also<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:56.610> one

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
lot of chances we did also but it's one

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.150 
lot of chances we did also but it's one
of<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.780> team<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.500> play<00:01:58.710> against<00:01:58.980> them

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
of the team that you play against them

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.590 
of the team that you play against them
and<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.470> of<00:02:01.530> weird<00:02:01.770> because<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.600> they

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and it's kind of weird because they they

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200 
and it's kind of weird because they they
stare<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.320> strikers<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.860> stay<00:02:05.550> up<00:02:05.700> front<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
stare the strikers to stay up front and

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.480 
stare the strikers to stay up front and
the<00:02:06.720> AG<00:02:06.870> on<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.140> break<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.650> you<00:02:08.250> feel<00:02:08.460> like

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
the AG on the break and you feel like

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.070 
the AG on the break and you feel like
you're<00:02:08.670> in<00:02:08.760> control<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.240> game<00:02:09.390> but<00:02:09.630> it

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you're in control of the game but it

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.870 
you're in control of the game but it
seems<00:02:10.320> like<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:10.649> was<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.400> opportunity

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
seems like there was some opportunity

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.970 
seems like there was some opportunity
school<00:02:12.120> usually<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:12.750> are<00:02:12.900> pretty<00:02:13.170> confident

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
school usually we are pretty confident

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.890 
school usually we are pretty confident
in<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> back<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.730> two<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.240> come<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.600> with<00:02:15.810> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
in the back for two to come out with the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.810 
in the back for two to come out with the
ball<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.380> they<00:02:16.920> will<00:02:17.070> definitely<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.700> know

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
ball so they will definitely you know

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.060 
ball so they will definitely you know
try<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.720> think<00:02:19.170> they<00:02:19.230> will<00:02:19.380> try<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> stay<00:02:19.800> low

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
try to I think they will try to stay low

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.430 
try to I think they will try to stay low
and<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.580> make<00:02:21.210> sure<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.630> try<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.930> close<00:02:22.230> us

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
and and make sure to try to close us

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.560 
and and make sure to try to close us
down<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.190> defend<00:02:23.850> wealth<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
down and and defend wealth to get the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.090 
down and and defend wealth to get the
point<00:02:24.810> so<00:02:25.110> that's<00:02:25.860> then<00:02:26.790> we<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.150> have<00:02:27.240> to<00:02:27.480> be

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
point so that's then we just have to be

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.230 
point so that's then we just have to be
continue<00:02:29.100> pressing<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.730> get<00:02:29.910> stressed

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
continue pressing and not get stressed

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.870 
continue pressing and not get stressed
out<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.990> keep<00:02:31.890> having<00:02:32.160> our<00:02:32.280> session

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
out about it and keep having our session

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.330 
out about it and keep having our session
game<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.300> just<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.750> think<00:02:34.560> we<00:02:34.800> should<00:02:34.830> continue

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
game and just I think we should continue

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.610 
game and just I think we should continue
to<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.700> directing<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.420> way<00:02:36.540> we<00:02:36.720> play<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.200> have

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
to be directing the way we play I have

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.740 
to be directing the way we play I have
to<00:02:37.770> expect<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.160> ND<00:02:38.790> unexpected<00:02:39.570> because

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
to expect the ND unexpected because

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.270 
to expect the ND unexpected because
