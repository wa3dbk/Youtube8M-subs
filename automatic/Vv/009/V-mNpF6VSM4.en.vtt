00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
built a base by making five simple

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
built a base by making five simple
frames<00:01:02.370> using<00:01:02.670> two<00:01:02.969> by<00:01:03.149> threes<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> had

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
frames using two by threes that I had

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
frames using two by threes that I had

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
drill pilot holes and put in the screws
and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.320> used<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.650> speed<00:01:10.920> square<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.220> get<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.490> 90

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and I used a speed square to get a 90

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.060 
and I used a speed square to get a 90
degree<00:01:12.090> angle<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.750> middle<00:01:13.020> board<00:01:13.290> to

degree angle for the middle board to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.410 
degree angle for the middle board to
make<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.369> base<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.729> joined<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> frames

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420

enough<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.450> avoid<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.750> existing<00:01:25.350> screws<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
enough to avoid the existing screws I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.830 
enough to avoid the existing screws I
painted<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> base<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.210> solid<00:01:27.659> white

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
weatherproofing stain and I added some

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.700 
weatherproofing stain and I added some
feet<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> bottom<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> base<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.560> keep

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
feet at the bottom of the base to keep

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.170 
feet at the bottom of the base to keep
it<00:01:31.860> off<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> ground<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.610> help<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:32.970> water

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
it off the ground to help with water

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
it off the ground to help with water
drainage<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.900> used<00:01:34.320> 1<00:01:34.500> by<00:01:34.619> 6<00:01:34.920> boards<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> cover

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

drainage I used 1 by 6 boards to cover
the<00:01:35.790> base<00:01:36.000> leaving<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.720> back<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> one<00:01:37.350> side

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the base leaving the back and one side

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020 
the base leaving the back and one side
uncovered<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> save<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> little<00:01:38.670> bit<00:01:38.790> on

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
sure to place them inside enough so that

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.690 
sure to place them inside enough so that
they<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.469> hit<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.829> base<00:02:08.009> when<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.280> panel

acetone<00:03:06.920> works<00:03:07.190> great<00:03:07.489> for<00:03:07.519> that<00:03:07.760> this<00:03:08.569> table

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
acetone works great for that this table

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.449 
acetone works great for that this table
was<00:03:09.079> a<00:03:09.110> little<00:03:09.530> bit<00:03:09.680> smaller<00:03:10.040> than<00:03:10.160> what<00:03:10.430> I

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
was a little bit smaller than what I

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.850 
was a little bit smaller than what I
wanted<00:03:10.910> so<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.269> ended<00:03:11.720> up<00:03:11.810> making<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.319> top<00:03:12.590> that

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
wanted so I ended up making a top that

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.009 
wanted so I ended up making a top that
just<00:03:13.069> slips<00:03:13.370> over<00:03:13.579> the<00:03:13.730> existing<00:03:14.090> table<00:03:14.690> to

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
just slips over the existing table to

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.930 
just slips over the existing table to
make<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.319> larger<00:03:15.680> to<00:03:15.890> make<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.609> I<00:03:16.730> added

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
make it larger to make it I added

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.090 
make it larger to make it I added
iron-on<00:03:17.600> edging<00:03:18.109> to<00:03:18.290> a<00:03:18.319> piece<00:03:18.590> of<00:03:18.739> half-inch

store<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.319> then<00:03:21.889> I<00:03:21.980> trimmed<00:03:22.280> off<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.459> excess

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:22.639

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
to keep the top in place I added furring

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.039 
to keep the top in place I added furring
strips<00:03:34.670> underneath<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.299> top<00:03:35.510> to<00:03:35.720> fit<00:03:35.930> the

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
to the underside of the table so that

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.629 
to the underside of the table so that
the<00:03:50.870> new<00:03:51.019> top<00:03:51.260> would<00:03:51.500> stay<00:03:51.709> in<00:03:51.829> place<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.489> last
