00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
an inch with 19 millimeters so it's I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.980

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
and then um 10 millimeter bolt that's

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.760 
and then um 10 millimeter bolt that's
1.5<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.590> thread<00:01:40.860> pattern<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.430> then<00:01:42.240> it's

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
1.5 is the thread pattern and then it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.230

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
again a millimeter 1.5 you need a
locking<00:01:53.430> call<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> locking<00:01:54.329> washer<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.770> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
locking call a locking washer and a this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
locking call a locking washer and a this
is<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.979> 3/8<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.670> inch<00:01:59.759> washer<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.719> just

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
is a 3/8 of an inch washer just I just

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.969 
is a 3/8 of an inch washer just I just
got<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> really<00:02:01.259> long<00:02:01.439> one<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:01.829> why

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
got a really long one that's why

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.910 
got a really long one that's why
subspace<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.790> an<00:02:03.060> inch<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.829> it's<00:02:04.829> about<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
subspace of an inch and it's about it

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.210 
subspace of an inch and it's about it
and<00:02:06.760> it's<00:02:07.570> like<00:02:07.690> 1.5<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.229> think<00:02:08.560> about<00:02:08.770> inches

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
and it's like 1.5 I think about inches

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
and it's like 1.5 I think about inches
wide<00:02:09.429> or<00:02:09.460> something<00:02:09.940> happening<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.330> Rana<00:02:10.780> well

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
wide or something happening to Rana well

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.050 
wide or something happening to Rana well
