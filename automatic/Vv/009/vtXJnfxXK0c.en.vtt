absolutely<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.370> close<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> three<00:00:44.820> lanes

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
absolutely this is close to three lanes

absolutely this is close to three lanes
one<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.300> guess<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.719> top<00:00:45.870> 0<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.289> smoke

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
one I guess the top 0 for the smoke

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
one I guess the top 0 for the smoke
ganks<00:00:46.890> maybe<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.489> us<00:00:47.610> support<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.120> late<00:00:48.270> top

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
ganks maybe give us support the late top

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.209 
ganks maybe give us support the late top
but<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.079> tough<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> when<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.100> see

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
but it's tough to do that when you see

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
but it's tough to do that when you see
the<00:00:50.309> constant<00:00:50.730> pressure<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> rtz<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.050> found
