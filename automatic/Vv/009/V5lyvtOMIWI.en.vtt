each pick X will only last you for one
bit<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> cobblestone<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.000> you'll<00:01:06.150> need<00:01:06.450> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
bit of cobblestone so you'll need to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
bit of cobblestone so you'll need to
craft<00:01:06.750> three<00:01:06.990> pickaxes<00:01:07.439> not<00:01:07.650> even<00:01:07.950> get<00:01:08.070> your

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
craft three pickaxes not even get your

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.060 
craft three pickaxes not even get your
first<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.670> pigs<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.380> even<00:01:10.380> then<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.890> stone

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
first some pigs and even then the stone

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:20.410 
first some pigs and even then the stone
pickaxe<00:01:11.340> itself<00:01:11.790> will<00:01:12.750> only<00:01:13.560> last<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.180> 12<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.429 

that's<00:01:21.420> free<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.200> about

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that's free you can see it's about

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.550 
that's free you can see it's about
halfway<00:01:22.650> done<00:01:22.890> now<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.540> six<00:01:24.540> blocks<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.080> total

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
halfway done now so six blocks in total

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.160 
halfway done now so six blocks in total
is<00:01:25.710> how<00:01:26.400> long<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.850> trusty<00:01:27.570> stone<00:01:27.720> pickaxe<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
is how long your trusty stone pickaxe is

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.609 
is how long your trusty stone pickaxe is
worth<00:01:28.590> now<00:01:29.299> basically<00:01:30.299> it<00:01:30.479> makes<00:01:30.780> branch

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
worth now basically it makes branch

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.830 
worth now basically it makes branch
mining<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> other<00:01:32.460> game<00:01:32.689> more<00:01:33.689> less

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
mining in the other game more less

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.630 
mining in the other game more less
impossible<00:01:34.110> because<00:01:34.650> you'll<00:01:34.950> barely<00:01:35.310> break

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
even on the under stone itself you will

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.390 
even on the under stone itself you will
break<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.500> you'll<00:01:40.799> even<00:01:40.950> come<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
break even you'll even come out with

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
couple more recipe changes has to do

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.010 
couple more recipe changes has to do
with<00:05:04.680> first<00:05:05.130> of<00:05:05.250> all<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.670> steel<00:05:06.060> instead<00:05:06.900> of

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
with first of all in steel instead of

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.170 
with first of all in steel instead of
using<00:05:07.170> an<00:05:07.350> iron<00:05:07.440> ingot<00:05:07.740> it<00:05:07.860> now<00:05:07.950> uses<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.400> rocket

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
using an iron ingot it now uses a rocket

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.210 
using an iron ingot it now uses a rocket
and<00:05:09.390> the<00:05:09.690> recipes<00:05:10.320> completely<00:05:10.740> shapeless<00:05:11.040> now

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and the recipes completely shapeless now

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.240 
and the recipes completely shapeless now
so<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:11.940> can<00:05:12.120> craft<00:05:12.360> this<00:05:12.600> very<00:05:13.380> simple<00:05:13.770> to

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
so you can craft this very simple to

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.550 
so you can craft this very simple to
experimental<00:05:15.150> find<00:05:15.300> what<00:05:15.900> shape<00:05:16.110> is<00:05:16.230> it<00:05:16.320> again

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
experimental find what shape is it again

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.850 
experimental find what shape is it again
something<00:05:17.430> that's<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.880> bet<00:05:18.870> most<00:05:19.230> people<00:05:19.350> hate
