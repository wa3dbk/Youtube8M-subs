00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.259 
look at the difference you can clearly
see<00:02:59.930> this<00:03:00.080> one's<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.350> lot<00:03:00.500> darker<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:02.120> was

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
see this one's a lot darker and it was

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.449 
see this one's a lot darker and it was
also<00:03:02.480> softer<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.530> easier<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:04.070> swatch<00:03:06.010> so<00:03:07.010> i

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
also softer and easier to swatch so i

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.060 
also softer and easier to swatch so i
think<00:03:07.700> they<00:03:08.060> improve<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.510> formula<00:03:09.110> but<00:03:09.800> since

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
think they improve the formula but since

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.620 
think they improve the formula but since
it's<00:03:10.220> limited<00:03:10.580> edition<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.120> kind<00:03:11.269> of<00:03:11.330> stinks

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
it's limited edition it kind of stinks

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.420 
it's limited edition it kind of stinks
because<00:03:11.840> not<00:03:12.140> everyone<00:03:12.470> was<00:03:12.560> able<00:03:12.709> to<00:03:13.010> get<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
because not everyone was able to get it

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.979 
because not everyone was able to get it
all<00:03:14.420> right<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.590> i<00:03:15.860> think<00:03:15.920> these<00:03:16.989> brightening

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
all right so i think these brightening

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.490 
all right so i think these brightening
eye<00:03:18.110> color<00:03:18.440> quads<00:03:18.799> are<00:03:19.540> kind<00:03:20.540> of<00:03:20.660> not<00:03:20.959> worth<00:03:21.260> it

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
eye color quads are kind of not worth it

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.620 
eye color quads are kind of not worth it
they<00:03:21.739> are<00:03:21.860> dollar<00:03:22.130> each<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.299> is<00:03:23.450> what<00:03:23.600> i

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
they are dollar each and this is what i

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.220 
they are dollar each and this is what i
was<00:03:23.810> saying<00:03:24.079> about<00:03:24.260> elf<00:03:24.709> where<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.840> kind<00:03:27.079> of

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
was saying about elf where it kind of

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.370

some great things you get some lousy

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.259 
some great things you get some lousy
things<00:03:33.070> because<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.220> price<00:03:34.489> is<00:03:34.760> kind<00:03:35.180> of

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
things because the price is kind of

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.560 
things because the price is kind of
skeptical<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:36.320> know<00:03:37.000> why<00:03:38.000> am<00:03:38.180> i<00:03:38.269> going<00:03:38.420> to<00:03:38.480> get

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
day so it's kind of not worth it I would

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.500 
day so it's kind of not worth it I would
just<00:04:30.560> look<00:04:30.830> for<00:04:31.070> dupes<00:04:31.310> for<00:04:31.490> these<00:04:31.790> colors<00:04:32.240> and
