okay<00:00:01.530> I'd<00:00:01.740> make<00:00:02.010> a<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.220> showing<00:00:02.730> how<00:00:02.820> I<00:00:02.909> did

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
okay I'd make a video showing how I did

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.369 
okay I'd make a video showing how I did

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
not have power windows but since I don't

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.580 
not have power windows but since I don't
like<00:00:14.330> turning<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.450> key<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:16.020> has<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> push<00:00:16.560> button

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
like turning a key it has a push button

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.490 
like turning a key it has a push button
starter<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.970> difference<00:00:18.779> from<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.230> one

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
starter the difference from this one

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.090 
starter the difference from this one
from<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.070> Firebird<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.060> its<00:00:21.539> USB<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.350> there's

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
from my Firebird is its USB and there's

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.330 
from my Firebird is its USB and there's
no<00:00:23.539> toggle<00:00:24.539> switches<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.199> any<00:00:25.529> kind<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.130> mean<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
no toggle switches of any kind I mean I

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.759 
no toggle switches of any kind I mean I
do<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.789> toggle<00:00:27.029> switch<00:00:27.180> right<00:00:27.539> here<00:00:27.930> but

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
do have a toggle switch right here but

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.000 
do have a toggle switch right here but
that<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.099> for<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.550> nitrous-oxide<00:00:31.009> on<00:00:32.009> switch

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
that is for the nitrous-oxide on switch

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.889 
that is for the nitrous-oxide on switch
anyways<00:00:35.010> I've<00:00:35.430> got<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.780> steering<00:00:36.780> column

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
anyways I've got the steering column

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.280 
anyways I've got the steering column
turn<00:00:37.260> turn<00:00:37.800> apart<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.030> I'm<00:00:39.780> going<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.140> show<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
turn turn apart so I'm going to show you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
turn turn apart so I'm going to show you
this<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.680> went<00:00:40.829> ahead<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.070> cut<00:00:41.219> that<00:00:41.250> off<00:00:41.629> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
this I went ahead and cut that off just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.389 
this I went ahead and cut that off just
so<00:00:44.270> it<00:00:45.270> doesn't<00:00:45.329> even<00:00:46.050> take<00:00:46.500> heat<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> all<00:00:47.129> it

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so it doesn't even take heat at all it

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.110 
so it doesn't even take heat at all it
we<00:00:47.520> can't<00:00:47.820> take<00:00:48.090> key<00:00:48.420> anymore<00:00:48.809> I've<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:50.120> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
we can't take key anymore I've got the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.729 
we can't take key anymore I've got the
that<00:00:51.270> sensor<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.079> here

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
that sensor right here

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.779 
that sensor right here
now<00:00:53.219> this<00:00:53.430> senses<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.180> RFID<00:00:54.780> chip<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:56.129> comes

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
now this senses the RFID chip that comes

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.630 
now this senses the RFID chip that comes
inside<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> GM<00:00:58.109> key<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.039> I've<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.309> glued

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
inside of a GM key and I've just glued

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.569 
inside of a GM key and I've just glued
that<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> side<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> also<00:01:01.649> needs<00:01:02.100> a

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that to the side of it it also needs a

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.369 
that to the side of it it also needs a
couple<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.120> resistors<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:03.780> are<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
couple of resistors that are in the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.700 
couple of resistors that are in the
original<00:01:05.510> ignition<00:01:06.510> switch<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> back

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
original ignition switch on the back

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
original ignition switch on the back
here<00:01:08.130> cf<00:01:09.000> pull<00:01:09.210> data<00:01:09.390> close<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.840> switch<00:01:10.020> off

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
here cf pull data close and switch off

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.719 
here cf pull data close and switch off
and<00:01:10.530> there's<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.830> couple<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> resistors<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
and there's a couple of resistors that

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.440 
and there's a couple of resistors that
go<00:01:11.850> inside<00:01:12.000> there<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.590> got<00:01:14.450> hard

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
go inside there that I've got hard

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
go inside there that I've got hard
soldered<00:01:15.930> inside<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.590> USB<00:01:16.950> dongle<00:01:17.310> I'm

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
soldered inside that USB dongle I'm

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
soldered inside that USB dongle I'm
using<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:19.049> takes<00:01:19.259> standard<00:01:21.680> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
using and then it takes standard just

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.630 
using and then it takes standard just
standard<00:01:23.130> pins<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.659> 0.1<00:01:25.470> inch<00:01:25.680> pins

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
standard pins they're the 0.1 inch pins

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.289 
standard pins they're the 0.1 inch pins
and<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> can<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.130> don't<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> if<00:01:29.850> my<00:01:29.970> camera

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
and you can I don't know if my camera

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.990 
and you can I don't know if my camera
can<00:01:30.420> focus<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.350> close<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.670> kind<00:01:32.939> of

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
can focus that close but you can kind of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.880 
can focus that close but you can kind of
see<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.299> spacing<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.900> I've<00:01:34.079> used<00:01:36.710> one<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
see the spacing that I've used one is

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.440 
see the spacing that I've used one is
just<00:01:38.130> hardwired<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:38.970> has<00:01:39.210> the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
just hardwired the other has the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.450 
just hardwired the other has the
resistor<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.680> mean<00:01:41.689> hard<00:01:42.689> wired<00:01:42.899> short

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460

shorted<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.610> each<00:01:44.700> other<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> other

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
shorted to each other and then the other

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.399 
shorted to each other and then the other
one<00:01:46.350> has<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> resistor<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:48.170> now<00:01:49.170> I've<00:01:49.259> got

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
one has the resistor in it now I've got
