to give my thoughts on what I saw the
first<00:00:09.150> thing<00:00:09.420> that<00:00:09.630> concerns<00:00:10.110> me<00:00:10.410> is<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.980> max

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
first thing that concerns me is the max

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.350 
first thing that concerns me is the max
they<00:00:12.809> look<00:00:13.170> ugly<00:00:13.400> they<00:00:14.400> really<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> colors

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
they look ugly they really do the colors

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.960 
they look ugly they really do the colors
are<00:00:15.540> terrible<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.289> even<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.279> matte<00:00:17.520> design

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
are terrible and even the matte design

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.019 
are terrible and even the matte design
doesn't<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.449> look<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.810> interesting<00:00:20.029> so

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
doesn't really look that interesting so

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.670 
doesn't really look that interesting so
a<00:00:21.060> lot<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.510> clips<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.080> saw<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.500> didn't

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
a lot of the clips that we saw we didn't

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.380 
a lot of the clips that we saw we didn't
get<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> entire<00:00:23.609> map<00:00:23.640> but<00:00:24.180> then<00:00:24.300> we

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
get to see the entire map but then we

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
get to see the entire map but then we
did<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.840> watch<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.289> one<00:00:25.590> game<00:00:26.060> where<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
did get to watch that one game where the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.089 
did get to watch that one game where the
pros<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.900> guys<00:00:28.080> from<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.410> Marines<00:00:28.859> were

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
pros and the guys from the Marines were

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.189 
pros and the guys from the Marines were
going<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.210> was<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> full<00:00:30.660> game<00:00:30.900> so

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
going at it and that was a full game so

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.799 
going at it and that was a full game so
we<00:00:31.320> got<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.590> see<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.040> map<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.610> guess<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.690> was

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
we got to see that map I guess it was

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.360 
we got to see that map I guess it was
okay<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.590> didn't<00:00:34.829> look<00:00:34.890> like<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.160> was

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
okay but it just didn't look like it was

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.510 
okay but it just didn't look like it was
anything<00:00:35.579> special<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:37.230> dynamic<00:00:37.980> maps<00:00:38.250> are

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
anything special the dynamic maps are

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.940 
anything special the dynamic maps are
pretty<00:00:38.730> interesting<00:00:39.270> though<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> looks<00:00:39.750> like

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
pretty interesting though it looks like

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.560 
pretty interesting though it looks like
they<00:00:40.950> didn't<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> battlefield<00:00:42.270> route

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
they didn't go the battlefield route

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.209 
they didn't go the battlefield route
where<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.809> can<00:00:43.079> destroy<00:00:43.469> anything<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
where you can destroy anything on the

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
where you can destroy anything on the
environment<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:44.820> there<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.270> maybe<00:00:45.719> like

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
environment but there will be maybe like

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.010 
environment but there will be maybe like
one<00:00:46.289> or<00:00:46.320> two<00:00:46.469> spots<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.309> each<00:00:47.489> map<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.780> you

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
one or two spots on each map that you

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.080 
one or two spots on each map that you
can<00:00:49.050> blow<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.739> destroy<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.489> should

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
can blow up and destroy so that should

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.090 
can blow up and destroy so that should
make<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.390> interesting<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.199> should<00:00:52.440> spice<00:00:52.829> up

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
make it interesting that should spice up

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
make it interesting that should spice up
some<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> maps<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.910> little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.710> we<00:00:55.710> haven't

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
some of the maps a little bit we haven't

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
some of the maps a little bit we haven't
had<00:00:56.219> anything<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.820> that<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> Call<00:00:57.510> of

don't<00:01:41.460> know<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.600> last<00:01:42.869> stand<00:01:43.170> isn't<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
don't know so if last stand isn't in the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
don't know so if last stand isn't in the
game<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.430> maybe<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.820> was<00:01:44.970> seeing<00:01:45.119> things<00:01:45.299> just

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
game and maybe I was seeing things just

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.460 
game and maybe I was seeing things just
say<00:01:45.750> give<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.710> guy<00:01:47.040> some<00:01:47.070> glasses

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
say give that guy some glasses

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.410 
say give that guy some glasses
hopefully<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.680> sequence<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> saw<00:01:50.880> maybe

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
hopefully that sequence that I saw maybe

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.090 
hopefully that sequence that I saw maybe
that<00:01:51.659> was<00:01:51.780> one<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:51.960> those<00:01:52.110> new<00:01:52.439> moves<00:01:52.710> where

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that was one of those new moves where

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.219 
that was one of those new moves where
you<00:01:53.250> slide<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:53.970> your<00:01:54.420> knees<00:01:54.659> maybe<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.140> was

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
you slide with your knees maybe it was

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.679 
you slide with your knees maybe it was
one<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.560> new<00:01:55.799> maneuvers<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.700> maybe<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.360> just

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
one of the new maneuvers or maybe I just

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.600 
one of the new maneuvers or maybe I just
blinked<00:01:57.990> maybe<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.560> had<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> nightmare<00:01:59.189> or

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
blinked maybe I had a nightmare or

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
blinked maybe I had a nightmare or
something<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.450> awfully<00:02:00.930> last

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
something I don't know awfully last

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
something I don't know awfully last
stand<00:02:02.009> is<00:02:02.130> nowhere<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.850> found<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.420> this

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
stand is nowhere to be found in this

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.560 
stand is nowhere to be found in this
game<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.829> next<00:02:05.159> thing<00:02:05.310> I<00:02:05.430> noticed<00:02:05.969> is<00:02:06.210> that

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
game the next thing I noticed is that

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.290 
game the next thing I noticed is that
the<00:02:06.960> hit<00:02:07.170> detection<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.270> in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the hit detection is not like it was in

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660 
the hit detection is not like it was in
modern<00:02:09.720> warfare<00:02:09.869> 2<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.890> seems<00:02:11.280> like<00:02:11.520> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
modern warfare 2 it seems like it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.860 
modern warfare 2 it seems like it's
similar<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> black

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
similar to black

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.580 
similar to black
to<00:02:13.200> modern<00:02:13.830> warfare<00:02:14.040> 3<00:02:14.310> and<00:02:15.080> one<00:02:16.080> thing<00:02:16.379> that

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
to modern warfare 3 and one thing that

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.850 
to modern warfare 3 and one thing that
concerns<00:02:17.190> me<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.840> that<00:02:18.840> every<00:02:19.140> time<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.409> guy

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
concerns me is that every time that guy

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.089 
concerns me is that every time that guy
jumped<00:02:20.400> over<00:02:20.670> something<00:02:21.409> he<00:02:22.409> never<00:02:22.650> got<00:02:22.890> hit

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
jumped over something he never got hit

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.979 
jumped over something he never got hit
with<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.280> bullet<00:02:23.700> he<00:02:23.849> was<00:02:23.970> always<00:02:24.330> able<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.750> kill

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
with a bullet he was always able to kill

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.509 
with a bullet he was always able to kill
whoever<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.500> on<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> screen<00:02:25.890> did<00:02:26.129> you<00:02:26.250> notice

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
whoever was on the screen did you notice

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.130 
whoever was on the screen did you notice
that<00:02:26.640> when<00:02:26.819> they<00:02:26.909> were<00:02:27.000> showing<00:02:27.299> all<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
that when they were showing all the the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.839 
that when they were showing all the the
things<00:02:28.379> that<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.620> could<00:02:28.769> hop<00:02:28.980> over<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.790> know

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
things that you could hop over you know

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.100 
things that you could hop over you know
maybe<00:02:30.090> they<00:02:30.239> were<00:02:30.299> just<00:02:30.540> doing<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.870> for

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
maybe they were just doing that for

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.920 
maybe they were just doing that for
demonstration<00:02:31.799> purposes<00:02:32.720> hopefully<00:02:33.720> when

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
demonstration purposes hopefully when

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.270 
demonstration purposes hopefully when
you're<00:02:34.079> hopping<00:02:34.260> over<00:02:34.530> things<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.129> not

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
you're hopping over things you're not

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.009 
you're hopping over things you're not
invincible<00:02:35.700> for<00:02:36.239> a<00:02:36.269> second<00:02:36.720> because<00:02:36.810> that's

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
invincible for a second because that's

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.539 
invincible for a second because that's
that<00:02:37.620> that's<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> feeling<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.430> I<00:02:38.489> was

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
that that's the feeling that I was

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.270 
that that's the feeling that I was
getting<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.120> felt<00:02:39.510> like<00:02:39.690> he<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.920> reason<00:02:41.190> why

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
getting it felt like he the reason why

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.619 
getting it felt like he the reason why
he<00:02:41.400> didn't<00:02:41.640> get<00:02:41.730> hit<00:02:41.940> was<00:02:42.090> because<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.480> was

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
he didn't get hit was because that was

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.630 
he didn't get hit was because that was
one<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:42.989> those<00:02:43.079> invincibility<00:02:43.709> one<00:02:44.400> or<00:02:44.519> two

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
one of those invincibility one or two

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.160 
one of those invincibility one or two
seconds<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.150> have<00:02:45.359> when<00:02:45.629> you<00:02:45.720> do<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> certain

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
seconds you have when you do a certain

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.289 
seconds you have when you do a certain
maneuver<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.829> game<00:02:47.010> kind<00:02:47.910> of<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.120> when

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
maneuver in the game kind of like when

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.360 
maneuver in the game kind of like when
you<00:02:48.359> used<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.599> go<00:02:48.750> down<00:02:48.989> into<00:02:49.290> Last<00:02:49.590> Stand<00:02:49.890> you

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
you used to go down into Last Stand you

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.589 
you used to go down into Last Stand you
know<00:02:50.489> how<00:02:50.609> you'd<00:02:50.790> have<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.120> one<00:02:51.329> or<00:02:51.450> two

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
know how you'd have that one or two

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.569 
know how you'd have that one or two
seconds<00:02:51.930> where<00:02:52.079> you<00:02:52.170> couldn't<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.500> hit<00:02:52.680> the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
seconds where you couldn't be hit the

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.309 
seconds where you couldn't be hit the
kill<00:02:53.849> streak<00:02:54.120> setup<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.569> going<00:02:54.810> back<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.230> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
kill streak setup is going back to the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.140 
kill streak setup is going back to the
format<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:56.040> was<00:02:56.160> in<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.579> modern<00:02:56.970> warfare

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
format that it was in in modern warfare

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.660 
format that it was in in modern warfare
3<00:02:57.390> where<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.930> have<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.230> assault<00:02:58.620> package<00:02:59.129> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
3 where you have the assault package the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.750 
3 where you have the assault package the
support<00:03:00.150> package<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.810> specialist<00:03:01.349> package

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
support package and a specialist package

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.309 
support package and a specialist package
now<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> guy<00:03:03.120> said<00:03:03.510> that<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.870> support

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
now the guy said that the support

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.420 
now the guy said that the support
package<00:03:04.829> they<00:03:05.069> took<00:03:05.370> out<00:03:05.609> a<00:03:05.640> lot<00:03:06.060> of<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
package they took out a lot of the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.970 
package they took out a lot of the
assaulting<00:03:08.430> things<00:03:08.730> from<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.030> category<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
assaulting things from that category so

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.740 
assaulting things from that category so
that<00:03:10.980> means<00:03:11.430> there<00:03:11.819> shouldn't<00:03:12.180> be<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.510> no

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
that means there shouldn't be the no

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.599 
that means there shouldn't be the no
skill<00:03:13.140> multi-kill<00:03:13.890> there<00:03:14.190> should<00:03:14.370> be<00:03:14.459> no

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
skill multi-kill there should be no

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.940 
skill multi-kill there should be no
stealth<00:03:14.970> bomber<00:03:15.470> there<00:03:16.470> should<00:03:16.650> be<00:03:16.769> nothing

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
stealth bomber there should be nothing

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.379 
stealth bomber there should be nothing
like<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.519> there<00:03:17.669> instead<00:03:18.030> there's<00:03:18.299> gonna

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
like that in there instead there's gonna

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.140

me I know you can go from 360 to Xbox

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.880 
me I know you can go from 360 to Xbox
one<00:04:59.390> to<00:04:59.600> continued<00:05:00.110> but<00:05:00.290> I'm<00:05:00.380> not<00:05:00.530> sure<00:05:00.740> if<00:05:00.830> you

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:00.890 
one to continued but I'm not sure if you

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:02.890 
one to continued but I'm not sure if you
can<00:05:01.010> go<00:05:01.100> backwards<00:05:01.580> but<00:05:01.760> either<00:05:01.880> way<00:05:02.150> that<00:05:02.720> was

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
can go backwards but either way that was

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.990 
can go backwards but either way that was
a<00:05:02.930> great<00:05:03.230> feature<00:05:03.560> for<00:05:03.950> somebody<00:05:04.580> like<00:05:04.820> me

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
a great feature for somebody like me

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.690 
a great feature for somebody like me
that<00:05:05.030> is<00:05:05.450> gonna<00:05:05.690> get<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:05.990> game<00:05:06.170> twice<00:05:06.700> but

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
that is gonna get the game twice but

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.820 
that is gonna get the game twice but
this<00:05:07.880> also<00:05:08.150> has<00:05:08.480> a<00:05:08.510> downside<00:05:09.200> because<00:05:09.410> what

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
this also has a downside because what

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.670 
this also has a downside because what
that<00:05:10.040> basically<00:05:10.340> means<00:05:10.730> is<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:12.080> the<00:05:12.440> game

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
that basically means is that the game

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.170 
that basically means is that the game
isn't<00:05:13.130> going<00:05:13.250> to<00:05:13.310> be<00:05:13.400> any<00:05:13.550> different<00:05:14.090> on

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
isn't going to be any different on

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.450 
isn't going to be any different on
next-gen<00:05:14.930> because<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.830> they<00:05:16.130> were<00:05:16.190> even

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
next-gen because that they were even

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.320 
next-gen because that they were even
saying<00:05:16.700> that<00:05:16.820> they<00:05:16.910> were<00:05:17.030> saying<00:05:17.240> that

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
saying that they were saying that

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.590 
saying that they were saying that
everything<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:17.990> saw<00:05:18.200> today<00:05:19.240> all<00:05:20.240> those

everything that we saw today all those

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.270

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:34.850 
would just put the footsteps and the

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.910 
would just put the footsteps and the
hearing<00:06:35.240> back

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
hearing back

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.370 
hearing back
to<00:06:36.040> this<00:06:36.220> level<00:06:36.730> modern<00:06:37.510> warfare<00:06:37.600> to<00:06:38.080> called

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
to this level modern warfare to called

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.780 
to this level modern warfare to called
you<00:06:38.530> before<00:06:38.650> then<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:39.220> wouldn't<00:06:39.550> need<00:06:39.730> that

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 
you before then you wouldn't need that

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.880 
you before then you wouldn't need that
and<00:06:40.330> that<00:06:40.540> that<00:06:40.750> might<00:06:40.900> even<00:06:41.050> be<00:06:41.200> distracting

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
and that that might even be distracting

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:43.020 
and that that might even be distracting
because<00:06:41.980> they're<00:06:42.220> already<00:06:42.490> annoying<00:06:42.850> when

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.180 
because they're already annoying when
they<00:06:43.060> say<00:06:43.410> reloading<00:06:44.410> or<00:06:44.680> whatever<00:06:45.010> they've

you<00:06:57.370> about<00:06:57.400> one<00:06:58.270> to<00:06:58.450> two<00:06:58.480> maybe<00:06:58.960> even<00:06:59.110> three

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
you about one to two maybe even three

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.650 
you about one to two maybe even three
seconds<00:06:59.950> to<00:07:00.040> do<00:07:00.220> that<00:07:00.360> so<00:07:01.360> now<00:07:01.600> the

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
seconds to do that so now the

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.630 
seconds to do that so now the
consequence<00:07:02.530> of<00:07:02.740> knifing<00:07:03.310> which<00:07:03.460> is<00:07:03.610> a

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
consequence of knifing which is a

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.030 
consequence of knifing which is a
one-hit<00:07:04.090> kill<00:07:04.390> is<00:07:04.660> the<00:07:05.080> time<00:07:05.650> that<00:07:05.890> you're

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
one-hit kill is the time that you're

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.430

gonna<00:07:06.100> waste<00:07:06.490> to<00:07:06.700> actually<00:07:07.180> do<00:07:07.360> it<00:07:07.540> and<00:07:07.750> I

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 
gonna waste to actually do it and I

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.660 
gonna waste to actually do it and I
think<00:07:08.500> it's<00:07:08.830> interesting<00:07:09.160> that<00:07:09.520> they're

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:09.670 
think it's interesting that they're

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.790 
think it's interesting that they're
gonna<00:07:09.760> let<00:07:10.000> us<00:07:10.060> customize<00:07:10.780> our<00:07:11.080> character<00:07:11.590> and
