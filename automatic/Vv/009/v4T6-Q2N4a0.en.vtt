I<00:06:10.730> would<00:06:11.420> also<00:06:11.690> maybe<00:06:11.840> you'd<00:06:12.020> like<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.170> seen

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
I would also maybe you'd like to seen

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.590 
I would also maybe you'd like to seen

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
this be a touch screen display in here

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.840 
this be a touch screen display in here
for<00:06:15.560> maybe<00:06:15.680> better<00:06:15.950> web<00:06:16.160> browsing<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:16.700> there's

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
for maybe better web browsing so there's

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.010 
for maybe better web browsing so there's
a<00:06:16.910> little<00:06:17.120> bit<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.390> improvement<00:06:17.540> on<00:06:17.900> this

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
a little bit of improvement on this

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.860 
a little bit of improvement on this
device<00:06:18.260> but<00:06:18.800> for<00:06:18.980> a<00:06:19.010> feature<00:06:19.220> phone<00:06:19.780> it's<00:06:20.780> not

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
device but for a feature phone it's not

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.380 
device but for a feature phone it's not
bad<00:06:21.230> price<00:06:21.920> I<00:06:22.520> believe<00:06:22.820> it's<00:06:22.970> going<00:06:23.210> for

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:23.390 
bad price I believe it's going for

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.680 
bad price I believe it's going for
$49.99<00:06:23.780> after<00:06:24.500> 2<00:06:24.650> year<00:06:24.800> contract

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:25.690 
$49.99 after 2 year contract

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.290 
$49.99 after 2 year contract
so<00:06:26.690> it's<00:06:26.870> not<00:06:26.990> too<00:06:27.170> bad<00:06:27.350> for<00:06:27.530> a<00:06:27.590> feature<00:06:27.770> phone

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:28.300 
so it's not too bad for a feature phone

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:32.020 
so it's not too bad for a feature phone
but<00:06:29.300> don't<00:06:29.590> 100%<00:06:30.590> on<00:06:31.160> that<00:06:31.190> price<00:06:31.580> to<00:06:31.790> tell<00:06:31.940> you

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
but don't 100% on that price to tell you

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.210 
but don't 100% on that price to tell you
the<00:06:32.120> truth

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
the truth

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.850 
the truth
so<00:06:34.220> overall<00:06:34.730> with<00:06:35.000> its<00:06:35.930> improved<00:06:36.560> hinge

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
so overall with its improved hinge

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.070 
so overall with its improved hinge
better<00:06:37.220> keyboard<00:06:37.820> better<00:06:38.330> camera<00:06:38.750> than<00:06:38.780> we
