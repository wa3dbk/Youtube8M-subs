00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
so I'm going to change it back to

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.330 
so I'm going to change it back to
confluence<00:02:37.450> so<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.230> it's<00:02:38.500> much<00:02:38.769> easier<00:02:39.190> for

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
confluence so that it's much easier for

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.670 
confluence so that it's much easier for
you<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.550> follow<00:02:39.730> because<00:02:40.090> some<00:02:40.420> of<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> skins

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
you to follow because some of the skins

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.670 
you to follow because some of the skins
look<00:02:41.980> extremely<00:02:42.550> different<00:02:43.060> and<00:02:43.480> it's<00:02:44.440> kind

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
look extremely different and it's kind

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.890 
look extremely different and it's kind
of<00:02:44.769> confusing<00:02:45.370> so<00:02:45.640> installing<00:02:46.060> great<00:02:46.390> sources

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
of confusing so installing great sources

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.039 
of confusing so installing great sources
in<00:02:47.050> XBMC<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:48.400> you<00:02:48.459> go<00:02:48.760> on<00:02:48.910> a<00:02:48.940> system<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.660> then

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
in XBMC so you go on a system and then

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:51.990 
in XBMC so you go on a system and then
file<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.380> manager<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.190> then<00:02:51.310> click<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:51.790> add

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
file a manager and then click on add

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.410 
file a manager and then click on add
source<00:02:53.370> fusion<00:02:54.370> should<00:02:54.580> not<00:02:54.760> appear<00:02:55.120> there

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
source fusion should not appear there

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.440 
source fusion should not appear there
only<00:02:55.690> after<00:02:56.380> you<00:02:56.790> actually<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.970> this<00:02:58.120> step

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
only after you actually do this step

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.100 
only after you actually do this step
then<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.989> will<00:02:59.140> appear<00:02:59.500> here<00:02:59.530> so<00:03:00.130> you<00:03:00.190> got<00:03:00.430> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
then it will appear here so you got a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.710 
then it will appear here so you got a
input<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.470> URL<00:03:04.290> known<00:03:05.290> as<00:03:05.489> HTTP<00:03:06.720> colon

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
input this URL known as HTTP colon

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.589 
input this URL known as HTTP colon
double<00:03:08.590> slash<00:03:09.299> fusion<00:03:10.299> XBMC<00:03:11.019> hub<00:03:11.349> com

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.170 

so<00:03:16.599> once<00:03:17.079> you're<00:03:17.319> done<00:03:17.349> click<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.970> done

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
so once you're done click on the done

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.009 
so once you're done click on the done
button<00:03:19.209> on<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.110> left<00:03:21.269> click<00:03:22.269> on<00:03:22.540> done<00:03:22.810> and

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
button on the left click on done and

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:26.280 
button on the left click on done and
then<00:03:23.440> now<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.739> need<00:03:23.950> to<00:03:24.099> rename<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:25.290> fusion

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
then now you need to rename it to fusion

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.650 
then now you need to rename it to fusion
so<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:29.139> know<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.530> is<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.190> fusion<00:03:30.579> URL<00:03:31.329> but

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
so you know that is the fusion URL but

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.750 
so you know that is the fusion URL but
you<00:03:31.810> just<00:03:32.079> add<00:03:32.260> it<00:03:32.500> for<00:03:32.799> your<00:03:33.069> XBMC<00:03:33.660> sources

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you just add it for your XBMC sources

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.960 
you just add it for your XBMC sources
and<00:03:36.760> then<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.269> just<00:03:37.480> click<00:03:37.690> them<00:03:37.959> done<00:03:38.970> fusion

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
and then you just click them done fusion

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.229 
and then you just click them done fusion
should<00:03:40.540> appear<00:03:40.959> over<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.790> then<00:03:42.790> okay

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
should appear over there and then okay

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.120 
should appear over there and then okay
next<00:03:43.600> step<00:03:43.810> you<00:03:43.959> go<00:03:44.109> back<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.560> your<00:03:44.709> home<00:03:44.889> page
