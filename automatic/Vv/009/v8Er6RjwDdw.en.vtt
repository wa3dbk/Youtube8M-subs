00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
 Pattern 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680
 I am making a pattern 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 Pattern of a coat 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 Ulster style 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.240
 There is such a typical pocket of Ulster 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.640
 Style from the UK 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840
 Stakeout dotted line 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.240
 Very time consuming 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
 It takes a lot of hours 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.320
 Please note 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
 One on the hem 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.000
 The other is 10 or 11 mm from it 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000
 It depends on the thickness of the fabric 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.640
 Because if the cloth is very thin 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 only need to 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.440
 Very small width 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.640
 If the fabric is thick 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
 Need more width 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.640
 Have a good pattern 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040
 It takes at least 4 hours 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
 Mark everything clearly 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
 Collar pocket 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.120
 Sleeve must be accurate 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.520
 This is the result of the pattern we made. 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.640
 This is behind 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.120
 This should correspond to the folded part in the middle of the back 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 Rear belt position 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.720
 Pocket crease 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.080
 These are sleeves 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.280
 These are vertical baselines 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640
 Do this well... 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.200
 Hang up 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.200
 Go to get the cloth 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.840
 I made a pattern here. 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.280
 But you can also not do it 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.040
 If you have a pattern of a jacket 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.840
 Can be expanded into a coat 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.000
 But if the color of the cloth is very light, the chalk pattern cannot be seen clearly. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
 I am not practical 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.560
 So I like to draw accurate patterns first.
