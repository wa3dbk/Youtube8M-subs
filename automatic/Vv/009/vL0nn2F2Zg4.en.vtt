00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
when I originally did receive my unit it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.410 
when I originally did receive my unit it
was<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.530> middle<00:01:21.979> part<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.490> I<00:01:23.030> kind<00:01:23.359> of

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
was with a middle part and I kind of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.060 
was with a middle part and I kind of
changed<00:01:23.780> it<00:01:23.840> to<00:01:24.020> more<00:01:24.259> of<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.409> sign<00:01:24.590> for<00:01:24.829> not<00:01:25.039> a

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
changed it to more of a sign for not a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.190 
changed it to more of a sign for not a
full<00:01:25.310> side<00:01:25.579> part<00:01:25.909> but<00:01:26.179> just<00:01:26.840> something

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
full side part but just something

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.399 
full side part but just something
different<00:01:27.380> us<00:01:27.920> you<00:01:28.549> know<00:01:28.670> what<00:01:28.880> I<00:01:28.909> received

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
different us you know what I received

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.020 
different us you know what I received
now<00:01:30.409> I<00:01:30.649> do<00:01:30.770> say<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:31.219> the<00:01:31.490> hair<00:01:31.700> length<00:01:31.880> is<00:01:32.000> a

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
now I do say that the hair length is a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.800 
now I do say that the hair length is a
20<00:01:32.479> is<00:01:32.659> 20<00:01:33.049> inches<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:34.030> do<00:01:35.030> set<00:01:35.329> up<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.539> here<00:01:35.719> is

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
20 is 20 inches I do set up to here is

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.099 
20 is 20 inches I do set up to here is
20<00:01:36.049> inches<00:01:36.189> but<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.789> hair<00:01:38.030> goes<00:01:38.299> when<00:01:38.960> it's

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:39.109 
20 inches but the hair goes when it's

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:41.529 
20 inches but the hair goes when it's
straightened<00:01:39.499> it<00:01:39.890> goes<00:01:40.429> right<00:01:40.729> under<00:01:41.119> my<00:01:41.299> boob

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
straightened it goes right under my boob

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.029 
straightened it goes right under my boob
my<00:01:42.530> thinking<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.130> more<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.729> I'm<00:01:44.030> 22<00:01:44.659> inches<00:01:45.109> so

yeah I definitely do like the fact that
it<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.229> a<00:01:48.859> little<00:01:49.219> bit<00:01:49.369> longer<00:01:49.990> than<00:01:50.990> most

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
it is a little bit longer than most

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.090 
it is a little bit longer than most

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
one on the nape I do not use any cones

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.080 
one on the nape I do not use any cones
at<00:02:43.780> all<00:02:43.900> actually<00:02:44.590> so<00:02:45.010> an<00:02:45.160> elastic<00:02:45.580> band<00:02:45.790> from

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
at all actually so an elastic band from

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.589 
at all actually so an elastic band from
the<00:02:46.420> ear<00:02:46.600> tabs<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.400> then<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.489> just<00:02:48.550> cook<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.390> to

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
the ear tabs and then I just cook it to

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.870 
the ear tabs and then I just cook it to
my<00:02:49.720> head<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.019> that<00:02:50.170> makes<00:02:50.319> any<00:02:50.410> sense<00:02:50.560> and<00:02:51.130> then

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
my head if that makes any sense and then

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.460 
my head if that makes any sense and then
I<00:02:51.940> actually<00:02:52.120> check<00:02:52.420> out<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.780> first<00:02:53.050> time<00:02:53.260> on

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470

I actually check out the first time on
the<00:02:53.560> top<00:02:53.769> just<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.250> doesn't<00:02:54.280> irritate<00:02:54.610> my

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the top just so it doesn't irritate my

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.740 
the top just so it doesn't irritate my
top<00:02:56.140> area<00:02:56.760> but<00:02:57.760> then<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:57.970> pull<00:02:58.330> out<00:02:58.360> my

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750
