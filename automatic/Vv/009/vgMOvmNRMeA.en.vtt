00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.740
You're a bit late. We were waiting for you two days ago.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.460
There was no parking.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.740
You should have double parked.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.160
I'm not that kind of person

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.380
You're an exemplary citizen

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.900
You respect the the law, you pay taxes one week in advance

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.880
and you do not clap when the pilot lands

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.060
But I am mainly a farmer

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.660
But it's not food we are missing

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.920
We ran out of jobs

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.380
confidence in our politicians

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.840
sense of justice

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.480
purchasing power

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.620
Daddy, why did you give such a bad name to me?

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.220
You don't have a bad name!

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.460
Your name means that sooner or later

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.280
We will pay the amount due.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.860
Do you undestand, Angela?

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.360
We must face the reality:

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.680
there are no financial measures that can save us

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.500
Nobody is willing to give us credit

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.220
What's your plan to save Italy?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.320
We are not supposed to save Italy

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.240
rather to abandon it!

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.320
Do you think we should all move abroad?

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.100
By now, everybody knows who we are...

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.660
our borders are closed

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.560
We have to move to another planet

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.300
to another galaxy...

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.740
and repopulate it with the chromosome pairs

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.340
of the best minds that this country has ever had

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.860
This is the job you and other people have been chosen for

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.120
Are we the best minds?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.620
No, you are the postmen

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.220
You'll bring the embryos

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.160
I knew Fiat prototype was not going to work!

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.480
Let's do it with Volkswagen!

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.640
Are the Germans willing to help us?

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.680
Yes, as long as we leave right now!

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.740
You don't even know when you are going to be back!

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.120
Don't worry darling, It will be like driving on the bypass

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.320
We have the opportunity and the responsability

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460
to make a fresh start

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.220
to rewrite our history

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.480
without making the same mistakes

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.120
Perfect touch down! Welcome to the Leopolda Galaxy

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.120
on the Italy 2 Planet

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.420
ITALY 2 PLANET, SOME YEARS LATER

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.560
Unbelievable! On for each car!!!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.280
Why don't you organize car sharing!!!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.780
The Centrale Bank of Saturn gives an ultimatum to the planet "Italy2".

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.540
The Italian PM replies:"We do not accept any lessons from the aliens"!
