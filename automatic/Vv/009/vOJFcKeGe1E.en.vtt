small amount of fat in this case we can

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000 
small amount of fat in this case we can
just<00:04:42.480> feel<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.900> ribs<00:04:43.110> but<00:04:43.320> it<00:04:43.440> takes<00:04:43.680> some

just feel the ribs but it takes some

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.800 
just feel the ribs but it takes some
effort<00:04:46.700> next<00:04:47.700> we<00:04:47.880> move<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.090> the<00:04:48.330> back<00:04:48.480> section
