one and this comes about halfway through

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.930 
one and this comes about halfway through
the<00:00:30.359> piece<00:00:30.630> where<00:00:31.410> I'm<00:00:31.769> about<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.189> restate<00:00:32.759> the

little of this little guy in the middle

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.250 
little of this little guy in the middle
sort<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.910> bridge<00:01:33.120> section<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.780> piece<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
sort of bridge section of the piece and

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.630 
sort of bridge section of the piece and
this<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.370> recorder<00:01:36.150> it's<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.570> sopra<00:01:37.020> me<00:01:37.260> know

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
this is a recorder it's a sopra me know

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.190 
this is a recorder it's a sopra me know
if<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.940> were<00:01:39.120> subjected<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> playing

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
if you were subjected to playing

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560 
if you were subjected to playing
recorder<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.010> fourth<00:01:41.310> grade<00:01:41.550> like<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.210> guess<00:01:42.390> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
recorder in fourth grade like I guess I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.020 
recorder in fourth grade like I guess I
was<00:01:42.870> or<00:01:43.140> third<00:01:43.410> grade<00:01:43.560> whatever<00:01:44.010> it<00:01:44.130> was<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
was or third grade whatever it was that

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.050 
was or third grade whatever it was that
was<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.510> soprano<00:01:45.960> recorder<00:01:46.229> most<00:01:46.950> likely<00:01:47.370> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
was a soprano recorder most likely this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:56.390 
was a soprano recorder most likely this
is<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> smaller<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.250> higher<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:55.160> sort<00:01:56.160> of<00:01:56.250> a

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
is a smaller and higher a sort of a

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.300 
is a smaller and higher a sort of a
bird-like<00:01:57.330> sound<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:58.050> I<00:01:58.080> kind<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.680> enjoy<00:01:58.950> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
bird-like sound that I kind of enjoy so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.710 
bird-like sound that I kind of enjoy so
we're<00:01:59.460> going<00:01:59.550> to<00:01:59.640> try<00:01:59.820> putting<00:01:59.850> this<00:02:00.330> in<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
we're going to try putting this in the

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
we're going to try putting this in the
middle<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.110> piece<00:02:01.290> let's<00:02:01.530> see<00:02:01.619> what

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
middle of the piece let's see what

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.620 
middle of the piece let's see what
happens<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.369> don't<00:02:02.970> have<00:02:03.210> anything<00:02:03.390> written

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
happens I don't have anything written

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:28.679 
happens I don't have anything written
for<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.200> we're<00:02:04.619> going<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.770> improvise

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:37.569 

let's<00:02:29.689> try<00:02:29.840> another<00:02:29.989> one<00:02:36.129> I'm<00:02:37.129> going<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.489> end

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
let's try another one I'm going to end

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.509 
let's try another one I'm going to end
