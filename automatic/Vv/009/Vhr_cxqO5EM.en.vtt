00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.960
 Y 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.730
 good to all those riven again 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.689
 in world of warcraft and we are facing another 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.310
 guide cortita is a guide of a saddle 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:20.110
 quite normal her but not much 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.390
 people have curiously although yes that 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.740
 many people want to have because all 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480
 you know that I collect mounts of 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.689
 I do not have too many, I just have 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.920
 148 if I'm not wrong and this is a 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.810
 mount that I would like to have for 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.370
 increase that number and apart it's not very 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.920
 hard to get there you just have to 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.530
 get lucky it's about the saddle's 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.530
 blue draco proto that gets in stripe 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:44.230
 north and has a drop similar to let's say 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.020
 in the ashes of alarming let's say I think 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.280
 had between 1 and 2% drop but as 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.220
 it's about a hero iii dungeon that is 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.990
 much easier 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.550
 a birth of the base that you all play 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.170
 to the officer because everyone should play 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 to the officer and you are in the last pressure 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.830
 so what you would have to do is 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.970
 go to your sanctuaries of preference 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.410
 in sanctuary of students for me 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.590
 seven-star sanctuary for the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.850
 rallies in meters around in here with 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.010
 luck the pando is made to run more 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.770
 fast and calm that this this guide 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 I'm going to edit it a little bit to 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.390
 make it faster and more treatable I'm not going 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.030
 to be talking all the time because to 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.440
 Sometimes that's a little difficult sometimes not 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.780
 it's not a little difficult I'm sorry I just 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.790
 of lifting and I do not know how to talk sometimes is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.010
 is here and it would be a little longer and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.540
 if we did not do it like that but you have to 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.119
 go up to the portals room and take the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.890
 portal to the talarÃ¡n that is here just 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.220
 in front of the back door 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.840
 You have to go away to clear to take what 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 the uncle that is there that I have done with my 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.980
 life with the hands you law of granda the 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.170
 I have this big yes 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.720
 I have caught a fish has been with a fishing 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.160
 with a fishing rod with jewelry 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.290
 embedded 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.790
 but well you come to talara here you have 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.430
 to ride in your saddle 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.050
 preference this time for me is max and if 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.690
 you want to see how he gets donax in my 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.400
 channel there is a guide also and you have to 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.270
 go now I tell you in which direction 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.580
 you have to look at the map from here 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.530
 turn a little bit let's say towards here 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.090
 because you have to get here true 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.010
 kilo niell this is the fastest way 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.020
 of arriving from the sanctuary but it 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.000
 you can get for example by taking the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.520
 zeppelin of guts and you get almost 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.540
 direct where you have to go but good 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.890
 you just do not have to go in this 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.800
 address and leave the auto flight and 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.630
 to play Latin I'm going to play the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.920
 game boy for example because it does not work 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.570
 in the game boy has no battery so 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.570
 no yes that has said battery so 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.050
 I can play because now I do not have 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.050
 battery again 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.320
 good 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.670
 I'm going to spend this faster and when 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.670
 come and I'll tell you 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.320
 and there in the background we see our goal 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.990
 he has connected extremely subscribe his 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.940
 channel by the way pretty cool and has 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.680
 got more than 500 subscribers this 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 of a celebrity on YouTube you have to 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.620
 end up some day to grow a 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.629
 little me that I have many less 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.940
 but if we want to go to the fortress of 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:42.830
 edgard in this fortress if I do not 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.599
 I'm wrong there are two dungeons we have to 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.150
 go to the one on the north side of the 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:48.560
 strength that is this this side this 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 entrance the other entrance is a little more 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.250
 hard to tell hi xtreem because 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.280
 That's what I deserve, in fact, I said gold 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.290
 but only deserves more in one thing 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.530
 peculiar is that you have to put it yes or yes 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.569
 in heroic dungeon consider this if not 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.340
 the skull is used that is normal is 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.200
 normal can be repeated every time 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.870
 that you want in a day but never in the 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.069
 mount so it does not make sense is not this 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.720
 saddle I think he taught how 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.120
 take him out in some livestream of mine but 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.349
 I wanted to have a separate video about 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.940
 on how to get law as you can see 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.440
 I had not taught and that's because I 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.049
 I do not have it just now 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.910
 because I do not shut up I go here from time to time 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.110
 when I do not go every day of all 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.370
 the weeks but yes that go 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.260
 I fit column when I remember it 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.750
 Sometimes I go with several characters because 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.910
 it's very easy as you can now 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.130
 check simply is to cross half 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.539
 dungeon without even touching the pits 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.010
 and the bugs around here you can jump 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.870
 for example and move completely from 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.300
 these guys around if you'll have to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.240
 kill these three that I already tell you 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.460
 I remember when I went here the loneliness 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.110
 me to a cataclysm sometimes came from 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.110
 once in a while and we 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.500
 I remember that it cost me a lot more 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.940
 kill these guys but now that I have 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.440
 554 of equipment because I practically kill you 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.660
 one touch even the legendary cloak 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.940
 can kill them automatically you see that 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.590
 I already have quite polished the mechanics of 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.080
 go through these guys and do not touch me 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.090
 in fact you can get to the third boss 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.319
 because this is the first post which the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.849
 the first time I came here he tries to fight 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:12.740
 against him and do not do it please 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.380
 because it can kill you despite being 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.860
 level 90 now this one sometimes adds to 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.660
 Sometimes I do not know what it depends on 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.580
 second box you do not even need to call it and 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.830
 the third boss is the one who releases I think 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.539
 that's caddy or something like that loose 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.910
 the mount here, I recommend them 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:30.380
 kill as quickly as possible because if not 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.900
 they are going to give for ass and they are going to call those of 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.250
 up but apart from me if I get a pair 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.690
 of loads of sacred power and I'm going 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.550
 running a little faster as you can 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.960
 see I have an additional 10% speed 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.940
 this of being shovel have their advantages 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.130
 I think it's a talent and an agreement which 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.539
 me this is the second post from which 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.670
 we just went through like I said these 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.290
 bugs do not even need to touch them 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.120
 yes I think I think it was search for 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.750
 justice or something like my talent 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.090
 preferred for speed 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.280
 and here inside I think this is caddy 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.470
 I think it chews on if this is the 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.360
 forest releases the blue draco proto which is 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.860
 this this is the saddle 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.880
 of these bugs can be passed if you have 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.350
 some skill like run and 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.730
 you pass by but I do not right now 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.740
 I have so I will have to kill them to 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.840
 all these stun by the way so 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.280
 better that they beat us you see that with the 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.560
 legendary layer for loose I could kill 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.930
 without touching me we have even 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.850
 approached these and here you have to kill 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.460
 to the harpooners you have to catch their two 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.140
 harpoons as fast as possible and while 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.820
 it puts you that the bug is within reach 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:29.419
 give two harpoons you see that we download 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:32.660
 life at 33% to 500 million a little 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:34.550
 less than 33% or laudio and then 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.110
 you will immediately get two more bugs 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.240
 one of them will carry a harpoon I have to 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:39.500
 take the third harpoon this by the way 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.960
 agreement that before when we played in 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.730
 auras to put you here meant whiter te 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.470
 automatically killed the fire but 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.860
 now you can not see it is not that it makes me 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.180
 There's not much fish of a minute from me carp 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.830
 tiny green made of fish 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.940
 there while I was taking things for 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.980
 cook like petado 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.360
 here comes back is caddy do not give six to 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.000
 one now says that it is inside the 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.090
 reach we throw him a harpoon more we kill 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.850
 this bug the other and you go out and now 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.500
 It's time to kill Eskadi who dies two touches 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.970
 as you can see and however sure 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.470
 is not going to release now the proto draco that 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:13.420
 I see it coming 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:15.310
 it effectively releases me something else that does not 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.780
 is the product but this bug is the one 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.460
 can release the proto draco and as I say 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.620
 this is a heroic dungeon therefore 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.750
 You can come once a day with each 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.920
 character if you have several to 390 more or 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.780
 less equipped in fact not even 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.430
 you need to be equipped you can come 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.990
 with several characters kill this bug and 

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.420
 try to get the product blue bow 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.980
 because it's the cool mount 

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:34.420
 It's not too pretty but it's a 

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:36.400
 more saddle and for those who 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.770
 put mounts as you can see me 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.320
 I actually have 148 I only need 2 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.930
 for 250 and its will be a great achievement 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.550
 for me so this is a good option 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.080
 a good permeable mount and from here 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.720
 you can go by simply using stone 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.040
 again in fact I will use the withdrawal 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.050
 of the honored because I am a very champion 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:55.920
 honored so the home stone was launched 

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.920
 a little more quickly 

00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.919
 and we go back to where we were before 

00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:06.580
 on magic magic screen of the stone 

00:08:04.899 --> 00:08:08.439
 home but good I hope that I have 

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.849
 served and liked this guide as always 

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:14.249
 that likes favorite subscribed if my 

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:14.249
