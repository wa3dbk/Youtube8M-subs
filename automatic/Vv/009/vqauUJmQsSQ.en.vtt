00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.320
 sculptures made with threads sometimes in 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.540
 medium of nature like here in 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:16.460
 florida or in a mansion in morocco 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.900
 these cobwebs are the specialty of the 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.029
 Parisian artist Sebastian 3 is very 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.980
 practical to work with threads this 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.920
 material is found throughout the world 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:31.519
 of any color and thickness the thread will 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.040
 can manipulate how you want it 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.809
 can create curved or straight lines and the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.809
 result is usually magnificent 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.030
 at home sitting in front of his desk 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.729
 for this Frenchman of 39 years the 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.159
 stable computer their jobs have 

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:51.549
 to be handmade 10 years ago 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.720
 he started making graphic drawings 

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.979
 Inspired by the lines I wanted 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.979
 experiment with children 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.300
 I visited a friend in Brazil and I knew that 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.760
 I could not draw there so I took 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.100
 some woods of yarn and I told myself why 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.290
 I do not try to express my ideas in a 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.050
 three-dimensional 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.330
 in this old industrial warehouse in a 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.119
 Parisian suburb sebastien of his 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.340
 interweave the threads here experience and 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.080
 tests new techniques and will read 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.080
 per row for hours 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.520
 and we live in a time with a huge 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.560
 technological development everything is going fast now 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.230
 we do not know how to take time to do 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.120
 things calmly people no longer 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.700
 ask where do things come from and 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.979
 how they are made what I do is all 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.260
 Otherwise people often ask me 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.760
 where do you get the time to do something 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.100
 well and how much time do you need 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.810
 at the headquarters of a large coffee company 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.750
 in the Elysian fields you can admire 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.790
 This meticulous filigree sculpture 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.800
 made of 11 kilometers of yarn 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.800
 cotton and 10 working days 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.420
 to achieve the optical effect as 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.340
 important is the accuracy always has 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.620
 than having two centimeters between each 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.920
 thread otherwise the object loses its 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.020
 structure his works can be appreciated 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.060
 even in museums like here in the museum 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.010
 of modern art palais de tokyo in paris 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.170
 you take time of your made this 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.970
 installation with graffiti artists and use and 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.970
 the phosphorescent elastics 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.739
 here we had very little site we painted 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.420
 all in black and we work with black light 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.700
 to highlight the neon effect of this 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.160
 way a game arises between volume and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.580
 perspective that prevents perceiving the 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:56.700
 space my intention was to confuse the 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.700
 viewer 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.040
 this piece has a year to live but 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.590
 this is not always the case above all 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.870
 when I work with cotton threads is 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 difficult to know how long it will stay 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.280
 standing the installation to be a product 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.220
 natural with the passage of time 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.930
 wears or loosens is also very 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.150
 exciting when it goes away it's always 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.069
 works outdoors here has extended 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.560
 his threads on a steel bridge in 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.120
 paris but the biggest challenge so far was 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.680
 this installation in the botanical garden 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.680
 from rio de janeiro 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.290
 in the climatic conditions and the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.069
 animals made it difficult for us 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.510
 comply 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.690
 we had to take care of the ants 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.700
 red and the black vipers the monkeys we 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.330
 they threw fruit we had to be very 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.150
 cautious and back to the project 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.190
 current after three hours of weaving these 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.650
 a thousand meters of yarn have a new 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.440
 form excites me the time when 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.420
 I made an idea afterwards, I'm not interested 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.510
 there is no emotional link between my 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.590
 feet so I 'm ready I like to learn 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.349
 something doing it 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.930
 then I dedicate something new to a process 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.209
 short the work of art becomes of 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.209
 new in a common thread
