mine<00:00:11.230> Heather<00:00:12.750> we're<00:00:13.750> talking<00:00:14.020> about<00:00:14.200> making

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
mine Heather we're talking about making

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.289 
mine Heather we're talking about making
something<00:00:15.130> like<00:00:15.340> this<00:00:15.520> on<00:00:15.790> one<00:00:16.059> day<00:00:16.209> on

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
something like this on one day on

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.880 
something like this on one day on
Facebook<00:00:16.539> and<00:00:16.930> I<00:00:17.020> think<00:00:17.230> she<00:00:17.380> ran<00:00:17.529> into<00:00:17.590> a

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
Facebook and I think she ran into a

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.489 
Facebook and I think she ran into a
problem<00:00:18.250> or<00:00:18.670> I<00:00:19.029> read<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:19.720> a<00:00:19.810> recipe<00:00:20.259> and<00:00:20.349> it

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:20.499 
problem or I read in a recipe and it

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:22.249 
problem or I read in a recipe and it
seems<00:00:20.710> more<00:00:20.890> complicated<00:00:21.460> than<00:00:21.640> it<00:00:21.759> had<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:21.970> be

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:22.259 
seems more complicated than it had to be

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:28.079 
seems more complicated than it had to be
so<00:00:23.259> I<00:00:23.289> decided<00:00:23.710> that<00:00:23.890> I<00:00:24.070> would<00:00:24.810> Oh<00:00:26.970> Tigers<00:00:27.970> up

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
so I decided that I would Oh Tigers up

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.029 
so I decided that I would Oh Tigers up
my<00:00:28.240> yeast<00:00:28.419> is<00:00:28.630> writing<00:00:28.929> a<00:00:28.960> book<00:00:29.140> with<00:00:29.349> that<00:00:29.380> um

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
my yeast is writing a book with that um

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.750 
my yeast is writing a book with that um
I<00:00:30.310> I<00:00:30.519> started<00:00:30.970> some<00:00:31.179> prep<00:00:31.449> ahead<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.560> time

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
I I started some prep ahead of time

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.670 
I I started some prep ahead of time
anyway<00:00:33.760> this<00:00:33.970> is<00:00:34.150> an<00:00:34.300> easier<00:00:34.750> way<00:00:34.930> to<00:00:34.960> make<00:00:35.230> no

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
anyway this is an easier way to make no

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.770 
anyway this is an easier way to make no
rice<00:00:36.070> no<00:00:36.840> need<00:00:37.840> bread<00:00:38.620> pasteurized<00:00:39.399> and<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
rice no need bread pasteurized and I

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.990 
rice no need bread pasteurized and I
modified<00:00:41.649> it<00:00:41.680> from<00:00:41.980> a<00:00:42.070> recipe<00:00:42.519> and<00:00:42.640> have<00:00:42.760> lost

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
modified it from a recipe and have lost

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.819 
modified it from a recipe and have lost
the<00:00:43.239> original<00:00:43.329> recipe<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:44.199> now<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.350> can't<00:00:44.680> tell

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
the original recipe so now I can't tell

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:46.740 
the original recipe so now I can't tell
you<00:00:44.920> how<00:00:45.039> to<00:00:45.100> make<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:45.460> so<00:00:45.579> that<00:00:45.730> it's<00:00:45.910> full<00:00:46.600> of

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
you how to make it so that it's full of

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.119 
you how to make it so that it's full of
fat<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.199> calories<00:00:47.969> sorry<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:50.350> really<00:00:50.620> okay

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
fat and calories sorry not really okay

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:52.709 
fat and calories sorry not really okay
so<00:00:51.190> I've<00:00:51.429> already<00:00:51.609> measured<00:00:51.879> everything<00:00:52.359> out

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
so I've already measured everything out

but what you need is one package of

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.700 
but what you need is one package of
active<00:00:56.410> dry<00:00:56.739> yeast<00:00:57.839> quick<00:00:58.839> rise<00:00:59.050> if<00:00:59.379> you<00:00:59.500> can

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
the yeast to stir it up well so it

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:10.440 
the yeast to stir it up well so it
dissolves<00:01:08.380> put<00:01:09.189> saran<00:01:09.490> wrap<00:01:09.729> on<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.360> then

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
the building blocks for protein the most

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.980 
the building blocks for protein the most
of<00:01:33.040> any<00:01:33.250> non<00:01:34.030> meat<00:01:35.369> item<00:01:36.369> so<00:01:36.729> quinoa<00:01:37.479> flowers

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.470 
cup of applesauce then you pour in the
east<00:03:21.310> so<00:03:22.310> this<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.609> like<00:03:22.760> your<00:03:22.819> oil<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.329> sugar

east so this is like your oil and sugar
and<00:03:27.579> use<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.609> whisk<00:03:30.669> it's<00:03:31.669> it's<00:03:32.060> really

and use a whisk it's it's really
interesting<00:03:32.690> is<00:03:32.989> not<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:33.799> hard<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.069> make

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
interesting is not that hard to make

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.120 
interesting is not that hard to make
it's<00:03:34.459> not<00:03:34.519> messy<00:03:35.060> things<00:03:35.329> don't<00:03:35.599> stick<00:03:35.900> um<00:03:36.260> to

today<00:04:40.820> at<00:04:41.000> the<00:04:41.150> store<00:04:41.419> I<00:04:41.449> thought<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.840> would<00:04:41.900> get

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
today at the store I thought I would get

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.189 
today at the store I thought I would get
another<00:04:42.470> one<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.949> that<00:04:43.190> is<00:04:43.310> hot<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:44.360> there

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
another one of that is hot but there

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.650 
another one of that is hot but there
wasn't<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.590> option<00:04:46.130> there<00:04:46.940> was<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.419> mini

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
wasn't that option there was the mini

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.770 
wasn't that option there was the mini
loaf<00:04:47.930> pan<00:04:48.259> option<00:04:48.740> and<00:04:50.199> a<00:04:52.539> two-pound<00:04:53.539> look

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
loaf pan option and a two-pound look

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.740 
loaf pan option and a two-pound look
option<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:54.710> this<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:54.979> 1<00:04:55.160> this<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:55.460> 2<00:04:55.669> I<00:04:55.940> bet<00:04:56.660> this

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
option so this is 1 this is 2 I bet this

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.529 
option so this is 1 this is 2 I bet this
is<00:04:56.900> the<00:04:56.930> one<00:04:57.020> and<00:04:57.199> a<00:04:57.320> half<00:04:57.380> pan<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:59.150> can<00:04:59.180> see

00:04:59.529 --> 00:04:59.539 
is the one and a half pan you can see

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:01.990 
is the one and a half pan you can see
this<00:04:59.870> little<00:05:00.350> one<00:05:00.530> fits<00:05:00.800> inside<00:05:00.949> and

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
this little one fits inside and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.360 
this little one fits inside and
that<00:05:02.600> was<00:05:02.810> neither<00:05:03.230> one<00:05:03.500> who<00:05:03.650> all<00:05:03.770> right<00:05:04.010> i

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
that was neither one who all right i

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.490
