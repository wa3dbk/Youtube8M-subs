00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.210
 so I enjoyed the days gates 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.950
 open harley davidson to present 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.610
 the news of the month of March for 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.379
 try today the tri glide ultra 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.380
 in the beautiful harley dealership 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:19.810
 davidson carqueiranne in Toulon next to 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.150
 toulon more exactly then this sort 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.740
 glide it's for me very disconcerting to 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.740
 drive so I really did not 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.350
 did I go downstairs ask for my street 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.360
 glide so a priori we find the same 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.770
 batwing is a bit the same position except 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.940
 that driving is completely 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.520
 different 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.010
 it's very disconcerting I think 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.630
 someone who does not ride a motorcycle will have 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.410
 a little less hurt me I really 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.870
 really had a hard time finding the position 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.370
 before that brakes much less well 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.040
 that in touring harley of course it's 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.710
 heavier it's normal comfort is 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.450
 royal on the other hand but really at the 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.160
 driving I was really really not at 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.670
 comfortable on this match that we can see that 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.070
 like all dairies glide this one 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.100
 is equipped with ferring lower which 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 conceal the radiators since it is 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.549
 partially liquid cooling 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.409
 by the way when we stop the engine 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.260
 after a few minutes of bush we have 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.760
 still fans turned other 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.450
 particularity of this model 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.110
 unfortunately European laws 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.680
 banned finally European or French 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.960
 forbid the the magnificent of the best 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.180
 7-inch power plants which is a lighthouse 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.369
 of great quality and that is 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.950
 forbidden on tricycles so that's 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.080
 replaced by this chrome flange and it 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.180
 must be satisfied with the two little ones 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.939
 two small charm on the right and on the left 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.280
 on the batwing it's a shame because 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.330
 first of all it's very pretty and then more 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.670
 it's very effective to introduce yourself to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.490
 try in a beautiful color 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.960
 black and ned 5 glos 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.520
 so well equipped a nice ride not that to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.649
 the backside is funny because 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.659
 that mine small and 20 on the turn not 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.830
 that we stealthily see the that allows 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.939
 to amplify the bass of the rear hp in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.619
 done when it's empty it's big 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.510
 subwoofer to amplify a small 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.970
 beautiful little finish nice chest can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.860
 really go on a weekend there a 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.390
 some even say who has more room 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.870
 that in some small cabriolets 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.530
 there are more transportation facilities 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.209
 nice luggage rims back so good 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.730
 this model there is really bardÃ©s 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.290
 of stickers tried - everywhere here is the 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.239
 dashboard with the big boom 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.370
 box 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.200
 it's a shame that ralph and gps on this 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.610
 model damage the black counters this is 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.890
 less pretty I think the counters 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.190
 white of the street glide its more beautiful 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.450
 and then on a machine of this price 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.860
 we see on the touch screen on a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.110
 machine of this price is also a pity 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.319
 not to have made the fund of 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.000
 fairing bread this matte plastic this is a 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.070
 little less class I find when these 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.019
 breads like on some models of cv 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.030
 rise brings a touch right away 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.410
 of class and then even what we have 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.959
 most often under the eyes when we 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.530
 leads the dashboard so this is 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.049
 still an element not to neglect 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.239
 pretty well finished machine a real but 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.840
 really finishing efforts are the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.840
 we feel it 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.040
 So here is another view of the trunk 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.410
 closes badly besides it takes on the clack 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:28.080
 efforts that's saying more 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 well here are thirty seven thousand almost 37 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.440
 million 37 1390 euros the model 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.290
 presented it's still a budget 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.080
 accessible to the motorcycle and car license 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.030
 of course 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:45.300
 here I think it's a machine that 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.140
 will find his audience I do not have 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.840
 specially appreciated driving I 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.180
 think it's not very suitable for our 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.610
 traffic conditions it's 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.260
 perhaps much more suited to 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.760
 American conditions with big 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.230
 straight lines and very little 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.550
 Roundabouts I found his limit 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.550
 at the driving level
