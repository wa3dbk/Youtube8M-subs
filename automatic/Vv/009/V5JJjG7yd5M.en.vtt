00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
year old DJ and trying to get gigs and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.470 
year old DJ and trying to get gigs and
clubs<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.039> can't<00:00:53.309> really<00:00:53.430> speak<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.090> from

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
clubs so I can't really speak on it from

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.099 
clubs so I can't really speak on it from
a<00:00:54.600> personal<00:00:55.110> perspective<00:00:55.850> but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.239> would<00:00:57.960> have

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
a personal perspective but I would have

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.599 
a personal perspective but I would have
to<00:00:58.230> say<00:00:58.410> first<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.800> all<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.070> got<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.550> be

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to say first of all it's got to be

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.860 
to say first of all it's got to be
different<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.940> every<00:01:00.149> country<00:01:00.300> because

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
different in every country because

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.200 
different in every country because
countries<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.039> laws<00:01:02.520> when<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:02.910> comes

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
countries will have laws when it comes

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.230 
countries will have laws when it comes
to<00:01:03.409> employing<00:01:04.409> people<00:01:04.830> from<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.670> certain<00:01:05.970> age

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
to employing people from a certain age

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.990 
to employing people from a certain age
so<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> places<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.460> might<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:08.850> be

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so in a lot of places it might not be

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480 
so in a lot of places it might not be
legal<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:10.080> book<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.830> you're<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.159> young

not even legally old enough to come into
that<00:01:29.880> club<00:01:30.710> so<00:01:31.710> that's<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> factor

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that club so that's gonna be a factor

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.510 
that club so that's gonna be a factor
it's<00:01:32.909> gonna<00:01:33.030> be<00:01:33.180> hard<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.590> booked<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.130> that

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
it's gonna be hard to get booked at that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.660 
it's gonna be hard to get booked at that
age<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:37.770> might<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.189> away<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.579> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
age so you might get away with it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.539 
age so you might get away with it
sometimes<00:01:38.909> but<00:01:39.869> honestly<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.740> my<00:01:40.770> opinion<00:01:41.400> if

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
sometimes but honestly in my opinion if

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.420 
sometimes but honestly in my opinion if
you're<00:01:41.729> still<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.360> young<00:01:42.799> my<00:01:43.799> advice<00:01:44.220> would

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
you're still that young my advice would

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.160 
you're still that young my advice would
be<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.729> start<00:01:45.530> building<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.799> fanbase

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
be to start building a fanbase

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.740 
be to start building a fanbase
in<00:01:49.170> your<00:01:49.409> own<00:01:49.530> age<00:01:49.799> group<00:01:50.479> because<00:01:51.479> by<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
in your own age group because by the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.230 
in your own age group because by the
time<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.320> become<00:01:52.520> legally<00:01:53.520> old<00:01:53.700> enough<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.000> go

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
time you become legally old enough to go

can<00:03:47.520> rock<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.910> decks<00:03:48.180> that<00:03:48.420> would<00:03:48.570> be<00:03:48.720> like<00:03:49.140> an

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
can rock the decks that would be like an

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.690 
can rock the decks that would be like an
interesting<00:03:49.590> party<00:03:50.070> gimmick<00:03:50.430> you're

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
interesting party gimmick you're

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.580 
interesting party gimmick you're
probably<00:03:51.000> already<00:03:51.390> a<00:03:51.690> little<00:03:51.930> bit<00:03:52.020> too<00:03:52.110> old<00:03:52.140> to

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
probably already a little bit too old to

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.229 
probably already a little bit too old to
be<00:03:53.270> interesting<00:03:54.270> enough<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.980> but<00:03:56.239> don't

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
be interesting enough for that but don't

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.699 
be interesting enough for that but don't
start<00:03:57.480> thinking<00:03:57.780> about<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.080> clubs<00:03:58.320> too<00:03:58.500> much

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
start thinking about the clubs too much

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.810 
start thinking about the clubs too much
yet<00:03:59.900> you're<00:04:00.900> still<00:04:01.020> too<00:04:01.350> young<00:04:01.520> that's<00:04:02.520> just

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
yet you're still too young that's just

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.430 
yet you're still too young that's just
the<00:04:02.910> fact<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.390> lot<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.600> people<00:04:03.840> will<00:04:04.050> not<00:04:04.200> book

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
the fact a lot of people will not book

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
the fact a lot of people will not book
you<00:04:04.620> because<00:04:04.980> you're<00:04:05.190> too<00:04:05.430> young<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.850> there's

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
you because you're too young and there's

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.630 
you because you're too young and there's
nothing<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.480> can<00:04:06.660> do<00:04:06.780> about<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.430> except<00:04:08.430> get

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
nothing you can do about that except get

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.759 
nothing you can do about that except get
older<00:04:09.000> and<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.239> takes<00:04:09.510> time<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.320> in<00:04:10.650> the

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
older and that takes time so in the

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.250 
older and that takes time so in the
meantime<00:04:10.980> build<00:04:11.850> your<00:04:12.090> fan<00:04:12.300> base<00:04:12.570> among<00:04:13.050> your

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
meantime build your fan base among your

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.550 
meantime build your fan base among your
own<00:04:13.410> age<00:04:13.709> group<00:04:14.040> that's<00:04:14.550> my<00:04:14.790> advice<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:15.560> then

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
own age group that's my advice and then

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.380 
own age group that's my advice and then
you'll<00:04:16.739> be<00:04:16.769> stronger<00:04:17.549> by<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.730> time<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.209> turn

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
you'll be stronger by the time you turn

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.990 
you'll be stronger by the time you turn
18<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.590> you<00:04:19.859> already<00:04:20.040> have<00:04:20.370> a<00:04:20.400> fan<00:04:20.730> base

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
18 because you already have a fan base

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.880 
18 because you already have a fan base
