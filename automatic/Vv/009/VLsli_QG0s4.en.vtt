00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
this will be our plane i ground

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.160 
this will be our plane i ground
something<00:00:11.820> like<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.240> just<00:00:12.530> drag<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.650> out

material for the house just gonna be
some<00:03:24.540> sort<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> like<00:03:25.680> material<00:03:26.190> just<00:03:26.940> texture

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
some sort of like material just texture

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:37.330 
some sort of like material just texture
like<00:03:28.470> planets<00:03:30.050> drag<00:03:31.050> it<00:03:31.170> onto<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.440> house<00:03:34.280> okay

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:44.120 

no<00:03:38.340> let's<00:03:39.150> take<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.420> little<00:03:39.600> texture<00:03:41.150> mmm<00:03:43.130> no

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
no let's take a little texture mmm no

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:52.930 
no let's take a little texture mmm no
it's<00:03:44.310> super<00:03:44.489> nice<00:03:46.190> multiply<00:03:47.870> you<00:03:48.870> get<00:03:49.020> darker

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.210 

yeah<00:03:53.940> okay<00:03:54.390> so<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.470> there's<00:03:55.739> some<00:03:55.950> sort<00:03:56.160> of

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
yeah okay so go there's some sort of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.090 
yeah okay so go there's some sort of
city<00:03:56.780> and<00:03:59.300> then<00:04:00.300> of<00:04:00.420> course<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.810> could<00:04:01.100> get

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
city and then of course you could get

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.930 
city and then of course you could get
some<00:04:02.310> more<00:04:02.489> buildings<00:04:02.970> by<00:04:04.340> making<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.520> much

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
some more buildings by making this much

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.710 
some more buildings by making this much
more<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:07.170> then<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:09.120> could<00:04:09.270> also<00:04:09.390> create

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
more and then you could also create

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:15.220 
more and then you could also create
other<00:04:10.940> other<00:04:12.200> houses<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.500> place<00:04:13.739> like<00:04:14.610> you

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
other other houses to place like you

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.580 
other other houses to place like you
create<00:04:18.500> cylinder

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.240 

then<00:04:23.590> one<00:04:23.860> makes<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.550> bit<00:04:24.900> bigger<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:28.090> this

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
then one makes a bit bigger like this

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.110 
then one makes a bit bigger like this
gets<00:04:30.250> rotation<00:04:30.760> segments<00:04:31.210> down<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.600> eight<00:04:33.120> and

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
gets rotation segments down to eight and

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.680 
gets rotation segments down to eight and
then<00:04:35.070> make<00:04:36.070> some<00:04:36.340> windows<00:04:36.880> make<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.360> editable

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
then make some windows make the editable

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.890 
then make some windows make the editable
here<00:04:38.730> makes<00:04:39.730> four<00:04:39.940> windows<00:04:40.270> here<00:04:42.570> plus<00:04:43.570> our

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
here makes four windows here plus our

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.180 
here makes four windows here plus our
inner<00:04:44.290> extrude<00:04:45.630> then<00:04:46.630> press<00:04:46.990> the<00:04:47.290> extrude

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
inner extrude then press the extrude

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.470 
inner extrude then press the extrude
make<00:04:48.850> minus<00:04:49.360> three<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.890> you<00:04:51.220> three<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:52.090> split

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
make minus three that you three to split

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.550 
make minus three that you three to split
it<00:04:52.600> from<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:53.530> cylinder<00:04:54.480> then<00:04:55.480> call<00:04:56.140> this<00:04:56.320> one

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
it from the cylinder then call this one

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.130 
it from the cylinder then call this one
windows<00:04:58.290> with<00:04:59.290> this<00:04:59.470> one<00:04:59.730> house<00:05:00.750> all<00:05:01.750> sheets

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
windows with this one house all sheets

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.730 
windows with this one house all sheets
make<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.470> nil<00:05:02.590> object<00:05:02.620> call<00:05:03.340> it<00:05:04.560> soon<00:05:05.560> in

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
make the nil object call it soon in

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.090 
make the nil object call it soon in
their<00:05:05.890> house<00:05:06.100> whatever<00:05:06.790> you<00:05:07.000> want<00:05:07.320> okay<00:05:08.320> get

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
their house whatever you want okay get

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:17.430 
their house whatever you want okay get
the<00:05:09.310> same<00:05:09.520> materials<00:05:15.600> then<00:05:16.600> drag<00:05:16.900> it<00:05:17.020> on<00:05:17.200> to

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
the same materials then drag it on to

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.620 
the same materials then drag it on to
the<00:05:17.560> cloner<00:05:17.800> oh<00:05:18.810> wait<00:05:19.810> we've<00:05:20.080> got<00:05:20.110> something

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
the cloner oh wait we've got something

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.830 
the cloner oh wait we've got something
first<00:05:22.630> you<00:05:22.930> need<00:05:23.380> to<00:05:23.410> make<00:05:24.360> this<00:05:25.360> pivot<00:05:25.810> point

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
first you need to make this pivot point

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.970 
first you need to make this pivot point
axis<00:05:26.530> again<00:05:27.220> on<00:05:27.640> the<00:05:27.760> floor<00:05:28.620> then<00:05:29.620> drag<00:05:29.860> it

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
axis again on the floor then drag it

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.820 
axis again on the floor then drag it
underneath<00:05:30.430> the<00:05:30.850> cloner<00:05:31.090> objects<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:32.680> you've

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
underneath the cloner objects and you've

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:40.020 
underneath the cloner objects and you've
got<00:05:33.450> also<00:05:34.450> Celina<00:05:35.080> buildings<00:05:36.390> so<00:05:38.880> yeah<00:05:39.880> you've

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
got also Celina buildings so yeah you've

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.750 
got also Celina buildings so yeah you've
got<00:05:40.210> a<00:05:40.240> city<00:05:40.980> now<00:05:41.980> you<00:05:42.040> could<00:05:42.310> of<00:05:42.460> course<00:05:42.490> use

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
got a city now you could of course use

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.640 
got a city now you could of course use
as<00:05:43.060> many<00:05:43.210> houses<00:05:43.420> as<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.810> want<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.320> can<00:05:44.440> place
