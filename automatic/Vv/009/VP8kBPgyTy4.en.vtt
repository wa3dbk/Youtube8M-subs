the forget forgotten the name of this
particular<00:00:23.850> armor<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:25.980> sporting<00:00:26.460> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
silver Centurion colors so I think it's

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.569 
silver Centurion colors so I think it's
same<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:29.910> normal<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.929> sure<00:00:31.109> anyway

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
same for normal I'm not sure anyway

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.930 
same for normal I'm not sure anyway
they're<00:00:33.420> very<00:00:33.540> nice<00:00:34.340> this<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.579> think<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
they're very nice this one I think is a

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.630 
they're very nice this one I think is a
repackage<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.230> Toys<00:00:37.469> R<00:00:37.649> Us<00:00:37.829> 3-pack<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.430> I

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
repackage the Toys R Us 3-pack but I

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.389 
repackage the Toys R Us 3-pack but I
could<00:00:39.149> be<00:00:39.210> mistaken<00:00:39.800> they're<00:00:40.800> very<00:00:41.129> well

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
could be mistaken they're very well

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.650 
could be mistaken they're very well
detailed<00:00:42.379> paint<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.070> amazing<00:00:44.760> but<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
detailed paint is just amazing but you

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.410 
detailed paint is just amazing but you
know<00:00:45.780> again<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.410> caveat<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
know again a caveat for that it's a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
know again a caveat for that it's a
hospital<00:00:48.629> product<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.489> some

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
hospital product so there will be some

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.479 
hospital product so there will be some
products<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.480> paint<00:00:52.280> imperfections<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.399> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
products with paint imperfections so you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.860 
products with paint imperfections so you
better<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> lookout<00:00:54.360> for<00:00:54.420> them<00:00:54.690> when

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
better be on the lookout for them when

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.869 
better be on the lookout for them when
you're<00:00:54.989> choosing<00:00:55.170> your<00:00:55.379> figures<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you're choosing your figures but the the

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.180 
you're choosing your figures but the the
paint<00:00:57.180> detail<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> kind<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> quality<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
paint detail and the kind of quality of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.560 
paint detail and the kind of quality of
pain<00:00:59.430> they<00:00:59.579> used<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.969> these<00:01:00.090> figures<00:01:00.449> are

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
pain they used for these figures are

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.990 
pain they used for these figures are
just<00:01:00.780> impressive<00:01:01.789> articulation<00:01:02.789> is<00:01:02.969> very

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
just impressive articulation is very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.250 
just impressive articulation is very
nice<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:05.820> are<00:01:05.880> probably<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.450> missing<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
nice they are probably just missing a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
nice they are probably just missing a
bicep<00:01:07.979> swivel<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.450> hinge<00:01:09.960> wrist<00:01:10.830> that's

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
bicep swivel and a hinge wrist that's

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.560 
bicep swivel and a hinge wrist that's
about<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
about it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.620 
about it
perhaps<00:01:13.170> less<00:01:14.159> hindered<00:01:14.400> ball<00:01:14.909> jointed<00:01:15.360> upper

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
perhaps less hindered ball jointed upper

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
perhaps less hindered ball jointed upper
torso<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.259> ball<00:01:16.500> jointed<00:01:16.799> head<00:01:17.009> that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
torso in ball jointed head that

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.859 
torso in ball jointed head that
everything<00:01:17.970> else<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.360> very<00:01:18.390> well<00:01:18.900> articulated

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
everything else is very well articulated

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.370 
everything else is very well articulated
my<00:01:21.869> only<00:01:22.200> problem<00:01:23.030> downside<00:01:24.030> with<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.930> 3d

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
my only problem downside with this is 3d

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.210 
my only problem downside with this is 3d
the<00:01:25.560> size<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.490> love<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> 4<00:01:27.570> inch<00:01:27.750> scale<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.470> for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the size I love the 4 inch scale but for

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
the size I love the 4 inch scale but for
Ironman<00:01:29.579> figures<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> kind<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.540> fell<00:01:30.720> in<00:01:30.840> love

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
Ironman figures I kind of fell in love

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.890 
Ironman figures I kind of fell in love
already<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.650> 6<00:01:31.860> inch<00:01:32.040> figures<00:01:32.460> which<00:01:32.900> if

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
already with the 6 inch figures which if

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.120 
already with the 6 inch figures which if
you<00:01:34.079> remember<00:01:34.530> they<00:01:34.650> looked<00:01:34.829> something<00:01:35.009> like

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you remember they looked something like

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.980 
you remember they looked something like
this

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.200 
this
I<00:01:37.020> love<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> 6<00:01:37.860> inch<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.340> Hasbro<00:01:38.759> seems<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.150> be

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
I love the 6 inch but Hasbro seems to be

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
I love the 6 inch but Hasbro seems to be
very<00:01:39.450> comfortable<00:01:39.840> with<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.110> 4<00:01:40.320> inch<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.799> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
very comfortable with the 4 inch and I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.100 
very comfortable with the 4 inch and I
think<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.880> trend<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> doing<00:01:42.659> 4<00:01:42.930> inch

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
think that's a trend that doing 4 inch

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.249 
think that's a trend that doing 4 inch
and<00:01:43.290> 12<00:01:43.470> inch<00:01:44.000> the<00:01:45.000> 6<00:01:45.270> inch<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> slowly<00:01:45.930> being

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
and 12 inch the 6 inch is slowly being

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.469 
and 12 inch the 6 inch is slowly being
phased<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.490> don't<00:01:48.030> think<00:01:48.210> we'll<00:01:48.420> see

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
phased out and I don't think we'll see

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.590 
phased out and I don't think we'll see
Ironman<00:01:49.170> figures<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.890> 6<00:01:50.100> inch<00:01:50.340> maybe<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.450> or

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
Ironman figures in 6 inch maybe one or

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.950 
Ironman figures in 6 inch maybe one or
two<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:53.189> rest<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> line<00:01:53.880> 90%<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> line

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
two but the rest of the line 90% of line

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.410 
two but the rest of the line 90% of line
is<00:01:55.049> gonna<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.409> this<00:01:55.560> scale<00:01:56.210> but<00:01:57.210> they<00:01:57.360> do

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
is gonna be in this scale but they do

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.359 
is gonna be in this scale but they do
it's<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> miniaturized<00:01:58.320> version<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it's like a miniaturized version of the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.609 
it's like a miniaturized version of the
six<00:02:00.240> thing<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> said<00:02:01.049> it's<00:02:01.259> missing

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
six thing but like I said it's missing

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.010 
six thing but like I said it's missing
the<00:02:01.770> bicep<00:02:02.460> rotation<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> hinge<00:02:03.450> rotation

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the bicep rotation in the hinge rotation

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.200 
the bicep rotation in the hinge rotation
but<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.619> does<00:02:04.799> retain<00:02:05.100> every<00:02:05.399> articulation
