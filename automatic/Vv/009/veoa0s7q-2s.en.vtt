00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello everyone, today I do this little one 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.349
 video because I received some material 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.340
 that I ordered or does a week ago 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.840
 really very little because more than anything else 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.269
 it was a test he wanted 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:27.599
 do and I'm talking about the online site that 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:33.260
 sells these particular yarns and site 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.260
 it is called filiform threads and shapes 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.079
 www.philips.it then I will leave you 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.050
 the address on the Info box I had already 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.750
 talked about these of these wires in a 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.090
 video that I will link up here indeed 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210
 venelin co2 because in one 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.789
 I'm talking about the review of the wires 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.289
 combined at the end of bergamo so it is 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.370
 the video of bergamo's daughter vi 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.050
 I show the various wires I have 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.899
 bought 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.699
 the other instead where I show you some 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.250
 things that I crochet with 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.380
 I wanted these threads now 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.290
 buy directly from their site 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.360
 because precisely seen that things are true 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.270
 nice that I just wanted to experiment and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.299
 cleo precisely purchased I took four 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.119
 wires 4 bobbins of thread 2 of a type 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.119
 and two of another and now maybe there 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.729
 he took out of the packaging so that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.159
 you can see them well without i 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.079
 reflections that unfortunately the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:41.189
 package does with light up to flush 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.790
 that I want to show you this article 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.750
 is called from rin 1.5 metal and is a 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.780
 spool of 30 meters 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:56.460
 the cost of this reel just from 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.619
 30 meters is 4 euros 20 however as 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.000
 then you will see if you also watch the videos 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.010
 past that of 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.990
 that of the creations rather than 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.030
 other you will see that from a spool like 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.450
 this you will be able to do is a couple of 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.390
 earrings that a pretty bracelet 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.270
 big and there will be more thread 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:19.500
 so anyway he gets enough of it 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.420
 processing this is in turquoise color 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.400
 but on the site there really are 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 lots of colors of this thread 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.120
 peculiarity which it would be 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.850
 apart from that beautiful out because how 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.580
 maybe you can guess it's enough 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:41.070
 silky as a beautiful shiny finish e 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:45.060
 very very particular and very smooth 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:48.989
 soft in short this thread inside 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.420
 to one year in treated copper for which 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.420
 when we go to work it will not be there 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.000
 need virtually dinami give anything 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.690
 because it will remain pretty stiff 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:04.290
 of his own without having to do any 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.010
 treatment I see here is ostellato 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.060
 does with the electric cables a little bit 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:16.400
 to make you see just that inside 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.400
 you see this metal core is present 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:26.160
 the diameter of the wire is 1.5 per 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:31.880
 crochet this kind of 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:36.810
 thread I think a 3 2 and a half three 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.430
 should be fine and this is one of the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.320
 colors that I purchased I will show you 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.079
 soon and what I will surely do 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:47.100
 something obviously for the summer seen 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.280
 I took the color the same yarn 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.110
 even in black it's black I have to say it's one 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.510
 I use my favorite colors 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.580
 lot 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.739
 and nothing to say the same 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:03.390
 characteristics of the first one 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:05.879
 the same cost is always 30 meters e 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.459
 the cost is 4 euros and 20 this too with 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:12.090
 inside the copper wire being 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:14.010
 treaty does not darken apart from that 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:19.229
 you have inside anyway not from allergies 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.239
 because it is treated and does not oxidize now vi 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.539
 I show another type of thread 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.850
 that I took from them the other kind of 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.949
 thread that I took is this here 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.160
 difference of the first thread does not have 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.990
 an inner metal core and is more 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.750
 small because it is a millimeter of 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.240
 diameter is always 30 meters a 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.889
 spool but if I remember correctly it is 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.910
 this and other children is possible 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:47.760
 also choose in larger quantities there 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:50.610
 there are so many colors available 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.960
 I wanted to try both this blue with 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:58.440
 inside the lurex both this silver 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.979
 always with inside in the lurex then 30 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.020
 meters 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.930
 the coast the cost of these and 3 euros e 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.050
 50 I haven't got it to yet 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.539
 test them unlike those that you 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.500
 I showed before so I'll maybe do it 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:17.010
 you can also see those later 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.080
 I assume next week if you don't 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.210
 or less sounds places to what we 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.570
 I will combine and tell you what they will be 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.280
 been my impressions 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.410
 then this site 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.250
 sells more than anything else this kind of 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.440
 special yarns 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.270
 some are called jewel yarns in 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.630
 then several things also sells 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.169
 chains but more than anything else treats yarns e 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.169
 trimmings 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.970
 what about quality is the same 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.750
 obviously the ones I had 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:53.380
 bought at the fair they sent me 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.290
 also a tribute in this envelope here that 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.850
 was inside the package one 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:01.600
 white sachet with which their 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:06.670
 header and inside was this 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:10.270
 long very high elastic 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:12.730
 fuchsia with sciences if you move 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.510
 you see I don't know what I am sincerely 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:25.210
 I will still have sent this too 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:29.440
 May ordered last week and I have 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.880
 received all today that today and Wednesday 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.710
 so let's say that more or less one 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.370
 week it takes at least they have 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:38.230
 employed for me and last night I received 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.390
 late in the evening from them an e-mail me 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.690
 he said the expedition had been 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:45.970
 carried out is that it would arrive 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.880
 precisely with courier I spent 7 euros for 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.900
 the shipment of these yarns are 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.670
 indeed arrived today in fact e 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.140
 nothing else then as they admire 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.780
 elevated that you asked me in 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.520
 several people after watching 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:03.820
 these videos that just that you 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.680
 I will list what could be done what 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.110
 sold are generic information about 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.350
 this seller 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:13.360
 I thought it appropriate to do this 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.000
 small video that maybe you can use 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.540
 with the few indications I gave you 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.910
 at the end inside the bag that 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.520
 inside out on the envelope always 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:27.280
 I show it to you in plastic 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.190
 because there is the header as an address 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.940
 however, there was this fiscal receipt 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:35.980
 with the consideration to be paid is the 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.240
 order number my name and so on 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.540
 etc 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:42.160
 this store by the way I believe that 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:48.910
 also has a physical store that a 

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:52.330
 florence via leonardo da vinci 28 the 

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:53.640
 country is called capalle del fante hundred 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:56.740
 another thing 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:58.330
 capalle firenze so if maybe yes 

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.010
 tried you can also find it go to 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.420
 take a ride to see if they have things 

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:02.920
 more than the site 

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.540
 with this I greet you I give you an appointment 

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.540
 the next hello soon
