00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
is more reflection related than the men

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.839 
is more reflection related than the men
ology<00:00:12.750> since<00:00:13.380> for<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.620> knology<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.280> doesn't

ology since for the knology it doesn't

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.599 
ology since for the knology it doesn't
really<00:00:15.179> work<00:00:15.680> but<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.770> does<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.130> reflection

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
really work but it does for reflection

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.429 
really work but it does for reflection
very<00:00:17.970> good<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.449> wanted<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:18.840> share<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.109> with

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.050 
you anyhow it's something what a scold I
guess<00:00:24.359> said<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.779> drain<00:00:25.080> life<00:00:25.380> spec<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.189> it's

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
guess said the drain life spec and it's

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.419 
guess said the drain life spec and it's
basically<00:00:27.300> you<00:00:27.840> take<00:00:28.080> harvest<00:00:28.680> life<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
basically you take harvest life which is

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
basically you take harvest life which is
here<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:30.029> increases<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.599> damage<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
here which increases the damage and

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.870 
here which increases the damage and
healing<00:00:31.500> down<00:00:31.830> by<00:00:32.009> your<00:00:32.130> drain<00:00:32.369> life<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.820> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
healing down by your drain life and you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.709 
healing down by your drain life and you
also<00:00:33.059> take<00:00:34.100> I<00:00:35.100> mean<00:00:35.670> glyph<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> drain<00:00:36.540> life

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
also take I mean glyph of drain life

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.990 
also take I mean glyph of drain life
which<00:00:36.989> also<00:00:37.230> increases<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.950> healing<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> your

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
which also increases the healing of your

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
which also increases the healing of your
drain<00:00:39.780> life<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.920> also<00:00:41.129> activate

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
drain life then you can also activate

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.150 
drain life then you can also activate
its<00:00:41.940> soul<00:00:42.239> burn<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.930> will<00:00:43.140> increase<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
its soul burn which will increase the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600 
its soul burn which will increase the
drain<00:00:44.610> life<00:00:44.820> healing<00:00:45.120> by<00:00:45.360> fifty<00:00:45.780> percent<00:00:46.610> but

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
drain life healing by fifty percent but

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.660 
drain life healing by fifty percent but
I<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.940> test<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.170> without<00:00:49.800> soul

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
I will test it with and without soul

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.389 
I will test it with and without soul
burn<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.500> without<00:00:52.649> all<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
burn and also with and without all the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.580 
burn and also with and without all the
cool<00:00:53.640> down<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.719> now<00:00:54.930> I'm<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
cool down so just for now I'm going to

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.060 
cool down so just for now I'm going to
light<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:55.920> crazy<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.850> crazy<00:00:56.879> amount<00:00:57.800> ok<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:58.859> i

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
light up crazy a crazy amount ok so i

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
light up crazy a crazy amount ok so i
will<00:00:59.340> be<00:00:59.640> near<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.750> zero<00:01:00.989> percent<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.920> then

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
will be near with zero percent and then

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
will be near with zero percent and then
i'm<00:01:02.160> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:03.000> drain<00:01:03.750> lives<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.290> you

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
i'm going to do to drain lives and you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
i'm going to do to drain lives and you
can<00:01:04.500> see<00:01:04.710> how<00:01:04.739> much<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.220> heals<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.670> just<00:01:06.000> one

can see how much it heals so just one

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.200 
can see how much it heals so just one
more<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.950> ok<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.880> drain

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
more like that ok so this is one drain

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.039 
more like that ok so this is one drain
life<00:01:10.610> without<00:01:11.610> any<00:01:11.939> cool<00:01:12.210> downs<00:01:12.450> or<00:01:12.659> anything

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
life without any cool downs or anything

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.310 
life without any cool downs or anything
that's<00:01:13.350> wandering<00:01:13.830> life<00:01:14.010> secondary<00:01:14.640> life<00:01:15.320> you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that's wandering life secondary life you

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
that's wandering life secondary life you
can<00:01:16.500> see<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.340> drain<00:01:17.610> lives<00:01:17.850> Emmett

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
