00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
together so I'm actually going to do

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.520 
together so I'm actually going to do
this<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:45.270> myself<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.640> secret

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
this to myself this kind of a a secret

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.750 
this to myself this kind of a a secret
part<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> trick<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
part of the trick here and I want to

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380 
part of the trick here and I want to
have<00:00:53.760> these<00:00:55.730> separate<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.910> thought<00:00:57.360> I

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
have these separate that thought I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.700 
have these separate that thought I
missed<00:00:57.629> one<00:00:57.840> for<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> second<00:00:58.410> there<00:00:58.530> but<00:00:58.680> I

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
missed one for a second there but I

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.860 
missed one for a second there but I
didn't<00:00:59.039> okay<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.940> I'm<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.390> show<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
didn't okay and I'm going to show you in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.130 
didn't okay and I'm going to show you in
a<00:01:03.960> second<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.500> these<00:01:04.650> have<00:01:04.920> no<00:01:05.220> two<00:01:05.280> cards

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
a second that these have no two cards

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.289 
a second that these have no two cards
paired<00:01:08.689> next<00:01:09.689> no<00:01:10.049> two<00:01:10.110> pairs<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> cards<00:01:11.299> next

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
paired next no two pairs of cards next

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.179 
paired next no two pairs of cards next
to<00:01:12.390> each<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.170> 12<00:01:13.530> court<00:01:13.920> cards

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
to each other so there's 12 court cards

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.670 
to each other so there's 12 court cards
in<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> deck<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.670> makes<00:01:16.549> that<00:01:17.549> makes<00:01:17.820> some

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
in the deck that makes that makes some

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
in the deck that makes that makes some
six<00:01:19.680> pairs<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.030> cards<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.180> there's<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.810> pair

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
six pairs of cards so there's that pair

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.410 
six pairs of cards so there's that pair
you<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.159> different<00:01:23.960> there's<00:01:24.960> two

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you can see is different there's two

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
you can see is different there's two
three<00:01:28.939> four<00:01:31.340> five<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:34.880> six<00:01:37.009> now<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.159> we<00:01:38.280> put

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
three four five and six now if we put

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.240 
three four five and six now if we put
the<00:01:38.549> cards<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> top<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.540> deck<00:01:40.159> give<00:01:41.159> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the cards on the top of the deck give it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
the cards on the top of the deck give it
a<00:01:41.310> little<00:01:41.400> snap<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.000> little<00:01:42.240> shake<00:01:42.509> all<00:01:43.439> the
