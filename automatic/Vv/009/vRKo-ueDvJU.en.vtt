00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
about in my last video and so this is

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.860 
about in my last video and so this is
the<00:00:08.220> thing<00:00:08.370> it's<00:00:08.820> like<00:00:08.970> my<00:00:09.120> pistol<00:00:09.510> thing<00:00:09.690> and

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the thing it's like my pistol thing and

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.330 
the thing it's like my pistol thing and
I<00:00:09.929> used<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.170> DSR<00:00:10.620> because<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.010> don't<00:00:11.160> know<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.250> just

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
I used a DSR because I don't know I just

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.039 
I used a DSR because I don't know I just
feel<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.509> kind<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.809> thing<00:00:12.870> that

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
feel like this is the kind of thing that

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.900 
feel like this is the kind of thing that
James<00:00:13.320> Bond<00:00:13.620> losing<00:00:14.160> except<00:00:14.580> for<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.759> fact

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
James Bond losing except for the fact

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.820 
James Bond losing except for the fact
that<00:00:15.059> it<00:00:15.360> has<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.690> party<00:00:15.990> rock<00:00:16.170> camel<00:00:16.560> on<00:00:16.680> it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that it has the party rock camel on it

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.410 
that it has the party rock camel on it
and<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.430> doubt<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.640> James<00:00:18.029> Bond<00:00:18.240> would

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
and I really doubt that James Bond would

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.370 
and I really doubt that James Bond would
ever<00:00:18.869> use<00:00:19.199> party<00:00:20.100> rock<00:00:20.310> thing<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.180> um<00:00:21.539> yeah<00:00:22.080> I

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
ever use party rock thing but um yeah I

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.250 
ever use party rock thing but um yeah I
just<00:00:22.800> feel<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> something<00:00:24.779> James

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
just feel like this is something James

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.859 
just feel like this is something James
Bond<00:00:25.500> would<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:27.000> probably<00:00:27.330> use<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.720> much

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
Bond would use you probably use it much

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.759 
Bond would use you probably use it much
better<00:00:28.410> than<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.800> can<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.260> am<00:00:31.529> probably

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
better than I can that I am probably

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.150 
better than I can that I am probably
going<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.750> but<00:00:33.750> yeah<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> feel<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.070> is

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
use silenced pistols just because I you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020 
use silenced pistols just because I you
know<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.530> kind<00:00:52.770> of<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> standard<00:00:53.820> thing

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
know that's kind of this standard thing

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.979 
know that's kind of this standard thing
is<00:00:54.210> like<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.570> whole<00:00:54.719> pistol<00:00:55.879> stuff<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.390> whoa

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
is like the whole pistol stuff but whoa

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.979 
is like the whole pistol stuff but whoa
that<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.530> nice<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.940> game<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.420> let<00:01:00.570> me<00:01:00.690> take

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that was nice of the game so let me take

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
that was nice of the game so let me take
that<00:01:01.020> kill<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:02.070> like<00:01:02.190> totally<00:01:02.340> through

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
that kill if it was like totally through

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.390 
that kill if it was like totally through
the<00:01:02.760> wall<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.030> anyways<00:01:03.300> uh<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:04.229> think<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:05.129> james

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
the wall but anyways uh I think of james

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.240 
the wall but anyways uh I think of james
bond<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.330> silent<00:01:06.720> pistols<00:01:07.250> silenced

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
bond with silent pistols silenced

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.090 
bond with silent pistols silenced
pistols<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.110> think

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
pistols just because that's like I think

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.270 
pistols just because that's like I think
the<00:01:12.090> James<00:01:12.510> Bond<00:01:12.810> stereotype<00:01:13.680> thing<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.930> I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the James Bond stereotype thing and I

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.560 
the James Bond stereotype thing and I
feel<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:17.640> would<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> sniper<00:01:18.150> because

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
feel like he would have a sniper because

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.749 
feel like he would have a sniper because
he's<00:01:18.780> more<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.200> stealthy<00:01:19.650> person<00:01:20.100> who

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
he's more of a stealthy person who

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.070 
he's more of a stealthy person who
really<00:01:20.970> doesn't<00:01:21.210> belong<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.659> call<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:21.840> duty

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
really doesn't belong and call of duty

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.289 
really doesn't belong and call of duty
and<00:01:22.110> that's<00:01:22.409> why<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> wanted<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.369> start

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and that's why I wanted to like start

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
and that's why I wanted to like start
off<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.600> entire<00:01:24.810> thing<00:01:25.229> with<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.799> James

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
off this entire thing with the James

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.460 
off this entire thing with the James
Bond<00:01:26.250> class<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:28.080> call<00:01:28.320> of

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
Bond class because it's so not call of

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950 
Bond class because it's so not call of
duty<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.610> I<00:01:29.670> think<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.090> be<00:01:30.210> fun<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.600> so

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
duty but I think would be fun to do so

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.140 
duty but I think would be fun to do so
yeah<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:31.860> can<00:01:31.890> see<00:01:32.189> I'm<00:01:32.640> doing<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.030> lot

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
yeah as you can see I'm doing a lot

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.760 
yeah as you can see I'm doing a lot
better<00:01:33.210> than<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.630> did<00:01:33.689> in<00:01:33.810> my<00:01:33.930> last<00:01:34.200> life<00:01:34.470> comp

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
better than I did in my last life comp

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.390 
better than I did in my last life comp
thing<00:01:34.950> I've<00:01:35.100> only<00:01:35.310> played<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:36.619> tiny<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:38.009> since

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
Duty comes goober naturally to me like
once<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.159> haven't<00:01:50.340> practiced<00:01:50.909> for<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.180> while<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
once I haven't practiced for a while and

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.190 
once I haven't practiced for a while and
at<00:01:52.560> those<00:01:53.189> times<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.000> think<00:01:54.750> I'm<00:01:54.899> better<00:01:54.990> at

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
at those times I think I'm better at

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.780 
at those times I think I'm better at
sniping<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.770> because<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.009> I'm<00:01:56.219> out<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.640> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
sniping just because like I'm out of it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
sniping just because like I'm out of it
and<00:01:57.060> I<00:01:58.049> don't<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.890> some<00:01:59.820> awkward<00:02:00.270> logic<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and I don't know some awkward logic of

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.460 
and I don't know some awkward logic of
mine

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
mine

unfortunately this is it probably the

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.150 
unfortunately this is it probably the
best<00:02:23.000> map<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.360> be<00:02:23.480> doing<00:02:23.720> this<00:02:23.840> entire<00:02:24.170> James

the adventures I don't even know man but
if<00:02:38.780> you<00:02:39.170> think<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.530> there's<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.860> really<00:02:40.130> cute

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
if you think that there's a really cute

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.340 
if you think that there's a really cute

class that you think is something up
well-known<00:02:45.350> character<00:02:45.860> would<00:02:46.040> use<00:02:46.310> then<00:02:47.060> let

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
well-known character would use then let

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.490 
well-known character would use then let
me<00:02:47.360> know<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.660> I'll<00:02:47.780> try<00:02:47.959> and<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.170> it<00:02:48.290> because<00:02:48.470> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
me know and I'll try and do it because I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.809 
me know and I'll try and do it because I
think<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:49.040> this<00:02:49.130> whole<00:02:49.340> thing<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.549> actually

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
think that this whole thing is actually

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.080 
think that this whole thing is actually
a<00:02:50.030> kind<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.660> cute<00:02:50.870> idea<00:02:51.110> but<00:02:51.459> yeah<00:02:52.459> if<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.910> also

want me to redo this and you like have a
better<00:02:55.400> James<00:02:56.000> Bond<00:02:56.360> class<00:02:56.660> idea<00:02:57.080> then<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.650> know

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
let me know but I think this is a pretty

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.500 
let me know but I think this is a pretty
standard<00:03:01.040> James<00:03:01.400> Bondish<00:03:01.819> kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.150> thing<00:03:02.330> i

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
standard James Bondish kind of thing i

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.220 
standard James Bondish kind of thing i
don't<00:03:02.660> i'm<00:03:03.290> not<00:03:03.380> really<00:03:03.650> sure<00:03:03.799> if<00:03:04.040> he<00:03:04.340> uses

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
don't i'm not really sure if he uses

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.280 
don't i'm not really sure if he uses
sniper<00:03:06.230> rifles<00:03:06.709> all<00:03:07.070> that<00:03:07.400> much<00:03:07.640> but<00:03:08.150> i<00:03:08.450> don't

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
sniper rifles all that much but i don't

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.650 
sniper rifles all that much but i don't
know<00:03:09.350> i<00:03:09.560> just<00:03:09.650> feel<00:03:09.829> like<00:03:09.980> if<00:03:10.459> he<00:03:11.030> has<00:03:11.150> pistols

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
know i just feel like if he has pistols

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.360 
know i just feel like if he has pistols
you'll<00:03:11.989> probably<00:03:12.230> have<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> long-range<00:03:13.010> thing

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
you'll probably have a long-range thing

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.280 
you'll probably have a long-range thing
too<00:03:14.079> that's<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.200> my<00:03:15.380> thinking<00:03:17.079> okay<00:03:18.079> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290

too that's just my thinking okay I
thought<00:03:18.650> that<00:03:18.920> guy<00:03:19.100> was<00:03:19.900> shooting<00:03:20.900> at<00:03:21.019> me

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
thought that guy was shooting at me

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.780 
thought that guy was shooting at me
still<00:03:21.320> but<00:03:21.829> winner<00:03:22.209> wet<00:03:23.209> air<00:03:23.420> I<00:03:24.700> don't<00:03:25.700> like

how I'm not pronouncing the V in that

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.360 
how I'm not pronouncing the V in that

whatever okay one thing I didn't do
those<00:03:34.689> I<00:03:34.749> didn't<00:03:35.230> like<00:03:35.379> change<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.859> score

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129

streaks or the perks to something I

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.250 
streaks or the perks to something I
think<00:03:37.930> James<00:03:38.139> Bond<00:03:38.349> would<00:03:38.499> have<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.719> whoops<00:03:40.719> I

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
think James Bond would have so whoops I

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.089 
think James Bond would have so whoops I
can<00:03:41.969> like<00:03:42.969> a<00:03:42.999> redo<00:03:43.480> James<00:03:44.049> Bond<00:03:44.349> if<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> really

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
can like a redo James Bond if you really

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.819 
can like a redo James Bond if you really
don't<00:03:45.700> think<00:03:45.849> this<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.180> James<00:03:47.139> Bondy<00:03:47.560> at<00:03:47.680> all

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
don't think this is James Bondy at all

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.119 
don't think this is James Bondy at all
but<00:03:48.129> yeah<00:03:48.609> I<00:03:48.909> think<00:03:49.060> it's<00:03:49.420> fine<00:03:50.129> especially

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
scary see James Bond is a lot better at

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:08.869 
scary see James Bond is a lot better at
being<00:04:02.500> himself<00:04:02.709> than<00:04:03.579> I<00:04:03.790> am<00:04:03.969> I<00:04:04.980> wonder<00:04:05.980> why

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.039 

wonder<00:04:09.879> if<00:04:09.909> there's<00:04:10.090> anyone<00:04:10.359> like<00:04:10.510> James<00:04:10.750> Bond

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
wonder if there's anyone like James Bond

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.659 
wonder if there's anyone like James Bond
in<00:04:11.199> real<00:04:11.349> life<00:04:11.560> that's<00:04:12.099> actually<00:04:12.489> pretty

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
in real life that's actually pretty

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.280 
in real life that's actually pretty
close<00:04:12.939> to<00:04:13.209> James<00:04:13.419> Bond

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.690 

I<00:04:17.380> think<00:04:17.950> that<00:04:18.070> would<00:04:18.130> be<00:04:18.190> pretty<00:04:18.370> cool<00:04:18.520> if

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
I think that would be pretty cool if

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.520 
I think that would be pretty cool if
someone<00:04:19.060> were<00:04:21.810> whoops<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:23.080> was<00:04:23.200> just<00:04:23.320> about<00:04:23.410> to

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
someone were whoops I was just about to

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.600 
someone were whoops I was just about to
shoot<00:04:23.740> him<00:04:23.890> oh<00:04:25.050> he's<00:04:26.050> right<00:04:26.260> here<00:04:26.530> haha<00:04:27.070> you're

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
shoot him oh he's right here haha you're

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.550 
shoot him oh he's right here haha you're
screwed<00:04:28.140> no<00:04:29.140> nor<00:04:29.410> mine<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:30.900> thought<00:04:31.900> he<00:04:32.020> was<00:04:32.170> but

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
screwed no nor mine I thought he was but

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:43.050 
screwed no nor mine I thought he was but
he<00:04:32.680> was<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:33.010> oh<00:04:33.190> well<00:04:33.780> who<00:04:34.780> did<00:04:41.790> also<00:04:42.790> I<00:04:42.820> feel

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
he was it oh well who did also I feel

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.130 
he was it oh well who did also I feel
like<00:04:43.210> James<00:04:43.390> Bond<00:04:43.660> would<00:04:43.810> have<00:04:43.960> more

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
like James Bond would have more

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.870 
like James Bond would have more
equipment<00:04:44.440> on<00:04:44.680> him<00:04:44.830> but<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:45.550> know<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:45.760> can't

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
equipment on him but you know you can't

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.540 
equipment on him but you know you can't
have<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.510> 50<00:04:47.050> items<00:04:47.680> of<00:04:47.860> equipment<00:04:47.980> and

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
have like 50 items of equipment and

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.920 
have like 50 items of equipment and
attachments<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.300> everything<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:49.750> called

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
attachments and everything and called

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.340 
attachments and everything and called
duty<00:04:50.290> so<00:04:50.500> i<00:04:50.790> think<00:04:51.790> i<00:04:52.270> did<00:04:52.480> an<00:04:52.600> okay<00:04:52.870> job<00:04:52.900> of

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
duty so i think i did an okay job of

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.310 
duty so i think i did an okay job of
representing<00:04:54.280> James<00:04:54.610> Bond<00:04:54.880> I<00:04:55.180> think<00:04:56.050> dual

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
representing James Bond I think dual

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.530 
representing James Bond I think dual
wield<00:04:56.620> would<00:04:57.190> be<00:04:57.340> cool<00:04:57.610> except<00:04:58.120> then<00:04:58.300> he

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:58.540 
wield would be cool except then he

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.090 
wield would be cool except then he
wouldn't<00:04:58.720> have<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.870> silencer<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.410> I<00:04:59.650> feel<00:04:59.920> like

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
wouldn't have a silencer and I feel like

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.610 
wouldn't have a silencer and I feel like
James<00:05:00.490> Bond<00:05:00.880> with<00:05:01.630> pistol<00:05:02.110> must<00:05:02.410> have

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
James Bond with pistol must have

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.760 
James Bond with pistol must have
silencer<00:05:03.360> otherwise<00:05:04.360> just<00:05:04.420> like<00:05:05.050> no<00:05:05.350> pistol

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
silencer otherwise just like no pistol

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.490 
silencer otherwise just like no pistol
at<00:05:05.890> all<00:05:06.210> that's<00:05:07.210> my<00:05:07.360> thinking

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
at all that's my thinking

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:17.920 
at all that's my thinking
no<00:05:10.130> moon<00:05:12.010> okay<00:05:13.010> where'd<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:13.340> guy<00:05:13.430> go<00:05:16.930> sniper

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
no moon okay where'd this guy go sniper

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:28.830 
no moon okay where'd this guy go sniper
down<00:05:18.700> this<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.910> it<00:05:20.120> pick<00:05:20.450> it<00:05:20.630> up<00:05:26.800> no<00:05:27.800> darn<00:05:28.430> it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
down this is it pick it up no darn it

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.330 
down this is it pick it up no darn it
that's<00:05:29.840> such<00:05:29.990> a<00:05:30.020> go-to<00:05:30.290> spot<00:05:30.560> though<00:05:30.890> I<00:05:31.040> should

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
that's such a go-to spot though I should

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.770 
that's such a go-to spot though I should
have<00:05:31.670> gone<00:05:31.790> somewhere<00:05:32.090> else<00:05:32.300> or<00:05:32.510> just<00:05:32.540> like

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
have gone somewhere else or just like

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.300 
have gone somewhere else or just like
reloaded<00:05:33.290> faster<00:05:33.680> or<00:05:33.770> something<00:05:34.100> I<00:05:34.250> don't

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:34.310 
reloaded faster or something I don't

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.530 
reloaded faster or something I don't
know<00:05:34.430> i<00:05:34.520> think<00:05:34.610> that<00:05:34.880> that<00:05:35.000> was<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.120> lose-lose

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
know i think that that was a lose-lose

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.060 
know i think that that was a lose-lose
situation<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:36.200> probably<00:05:36.740> shouldn't<00:05:37.040> have

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
situation I probably shouldn't have

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.440 
situation I probably shouldn't have
jumped<00:05:37.340> down<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.640> chase<00:05:37.820> that<00:05:37.850> guy<00:05:38.150> because

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
jumped down to chase that guy because

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.430 
jumped down to chase that guy because
the<00:05:38.540> spawns<00:05:38.810> were<00:05:39.020> still<00:05:39.590> spawning<00:05:40.070> but<00:05:41.440> and

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
the spawns were still spawning but and

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.920 
the spawns were still spawning but and
what's<00:05:42.680> done<00:05:42.860> is<00:05:43.010> done<00:05:43.419> James<00:05:44.419> Bond<00:05:44.660> would<00:05:44.750> be

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
what's done is done James Bond would be

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.800 
what's done is done James Bond would be
so<00:05:45.050> much<00:05:45.169> better<00:05:45.230> than<00:05:45.620> me<00:05:45.800> but<00:05:46.690> it's<00:05:47.690> okay
