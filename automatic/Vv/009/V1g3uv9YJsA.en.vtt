00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.640
 in the next two episodes we will go to 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.349
 face them fundamental technical of the 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.349
 stop or receive the ball 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.260
 reception is that technical skill 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.170
 which allows us to manage the ball 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.000
 stopping it or directing it into 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.460
 function of the play immediately 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.170
 next which pass the throw in 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.670
 door or postpone receipt must 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.800
 take place following a hold of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 360-degree peripheral vision 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.720
 the surfaces involved in the execution 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:00.790
 of this fundamental technical are 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:00.790
 inside the outside 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.610
 the school 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.500
 and the neck of both feet 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.760
 the thighs the chest and the head 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 in the first three exercises we will go to 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.570
 analyze the fundamental technical 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.830
 through analytical work a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.830
 backhoe loaders or pairs 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.500
 in the first exercise we will go to 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.540
 develop the fundamentals through a 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.650
 reception on the spot with all the 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.650
 impact surfaces 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.439
 in the subsequent exercises the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.610
 fundamental will be developed to be found 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.610
 a reception in the race 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.120
 in the third and last exercise the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.030
 ball reception will take shape 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.270
 pre-established first by standing still and then in 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.260
 travel all the exercises are 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.260
 organized through a progression 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.950
 all the exercises we go to 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.319
 propose respect the principle of 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.810
 progressivity or rather organized 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.280
 starting from simple exercises up to 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.790
 to get to more exercises 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.790
 complex
