00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.819
 first of all show my 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.250
 indignation against youtube for the abuse 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.900
 what are you doing on my channel 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.850
 I was mainly erased a video of 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.800
 cold wines when the lnd of 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.530
 a video I deleted it presumably 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.760
 they said they claimed rights of 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.890
 compile because allegedly 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.140
 I listened to the wing song in the video 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.850
 with action was true and I have done what 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.130
 same with one that I went up last Saturday 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.750
 as a writer I keep and katy perry and 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.859
 they say you listen to rock you listened to 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.380
 steal in the background and that's why they've taken me 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.880
 have copyright rights that 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.649
 it's completely false and the truth is that 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.909
 I find it totally abusive and written 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.460
 completely indicted although not what 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:39.620
 I show a lot now I could break things 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.789
 here but then focus on what 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.859
 I come to give 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.639
 I come to hail then but what kind 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.329
 which was released on Monday, August 12 

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:49.309
 converting it casually with 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.370
 finally lady gaga with applause that 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.920
 It looks like it's filtered and it seems like a 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.239
 suspicious room pretty suspicious 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.739
 that suddenly it has leaked and 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.719
 have decided to compete with Katy Perry 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 although it is increasing in katy perry 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 the number one with his song 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.780
 he received me on this song we are going to 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.909
 see me in the first that this origin 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 it seems to me that he has sold enough one and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.060
 that still seems to me has sold 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.369
 a lot like because with the trailers and you 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.650
 you beg to pray that he was coming up to his 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.880
 channel before starting to release the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.310
 song 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 I sold a very dark girl a little 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.950
 Gothic in progress in the first video 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.479
 when he burns the wig after 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.130
 funeral 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.470
 in general and a pretty aesthetic 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.689
 Gothic and the truth has surprised me 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.670
 because the song is not for nothing that's 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.530
 an evolution of teenage witch itself is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.539
 true that it does not stay fit because 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 it does not work well I think there is no 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.740
 song of this style that is a bit 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:43.020
 bigger a little more the pop 3 quote that 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 it reminds me a lot of alluvial in I do not know 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.039
 If you know about glass, then you put it on me 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.140
 very much air and makes me throw it out 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.240
 least I hope that soon I will return to the ideal 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 what is that musical style for me is 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.229
 the subsidiary in the truth that wants it has 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.170
 done the song quite well 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.209
 first they hear it or even a lot 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.950
 I did not like it very much but with that listener 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.009
 has gained quite the truth and seeing the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.200
 letter because I do not handle much English and 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.299
 so then preventively of a little 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.099
 of the letter but afterwards the seen the 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.510
 full right and it's been when you've already 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.549
 understood what I saw but completely 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.110
 the song seems to me the letter is 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:18.239
 I think you're one of the best 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.250
 best letters that there may be as soon as 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.230
 issues of overcoming this though 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.000
 those issues in your production 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.310
 I must say that they are somewhat past 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.930
 fashion already but good what kind of the returned 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.599
 to do the truth that has not come out 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.760
 quite well is a very truth subject 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.849
 good very good proposal for this 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 August and the truth deserves number one 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.540
 I think it deserves number one 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.250
 and he believed that it would come to him he deserved his 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.110
 number one for next week but 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.849
 He has decided to take it out before, I do not know 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.549
 finally what will happen are not there in 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.769
 full war good said this I should 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.379
 announce that you have also announced that you already 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.359
 he lost his performance competing again 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.950
 with lady gaga in one night lady gaga and 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.780
 Now it seems that it will not be the night of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.030
 Lady Gaga by Katy Perry will present 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.500
 also for the first time his single steal 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.290
 in videos and music I keep their 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.810
 virtues on August 25 with a 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.120
 exploration that promises to be ideal epic 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.950
 that there is already a promo announcing the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.220
 Katy Perry will be in two video music 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.409
 awards starring in a performance and 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.080
 later agreed the manager of this 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.590
 steal is a little spent is made 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.590
 with the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.350
 whatsapp and the truth is that it's a bit 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.880
 messy because we do not want the letter and 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.400
 the truth is very important or multicolored 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.620
 It is a little confusing to understand the lyrics by 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.990
 those emoticons but good I leave it to you 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.990
 here the two things the promotion for the 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:42.940
 video music awards 2013 and the newspaper of 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.240
 steal comment me down here state that 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.620
 you seemed to subscribe to score and if 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.630
 curiosity you want to know what has 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 seemed like the subject of applause from lady 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.890
 Gaga says that I think it's a pop song 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.210
 pretty good has remembered well spears 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.330
 to remember Madonna what has most 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:00.520
 remembered to david bowie in the form of 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.440
 sing the truth and then I think that 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.090
 it's a completely pop fusion that is 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.190
 what comes to sell the son the disc 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.330
 pop art because I think it meets 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.210
 perfectly with what comes to sell 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.590
 yes it's true that I did not expect that 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.300
 listening burka for example now we 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.460
 expulsion that song was waiting for something 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.200
 much more cane far more house even 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.440
 and the truth is that the song is very 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.650
 commercial very normal pop and a little rock 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.510
 billancourt so pop electronic rock and the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.940
 it's really not bad, I like it 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.920
 enough but yes it is true that I hope 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.260
 that is not the best of the new album and 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 he also thought that surely this 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.770
 first single applause is not the best 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.870
 of the mistiana disk they knew me as 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.150
 have taken it out of the first single I think 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.500
 You do not have strength but you do not have 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.680
 enough strength to be 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.970
 released as first single but in return 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.230
 encouragement with this way 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.000
 for example the song 'born this way' 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.670
 I did not like it at all I was disappointed 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.770
 quite and this education yes I like 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.450
 very much the song so the beginning 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:57.550
 of the guardiola era and for me it was worse 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:59.590
 that this beginning of the era to pop well 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.200
 that if we focus on the first single 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.420
 between born this way applause I think it's going 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.540
 to be undoubtedly a great record and going to 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.130
 far surpass its predecessor more 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.990
 that nothing because to me is what I like 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.470
 pop music is pop culture is 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.390
 no more then mental 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.400
 if nothing else I say goodbye because to go is that 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:18.990
 is talking about this comment I 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.400
 subscribe to score and see you in the 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.400
 next video goodbye
