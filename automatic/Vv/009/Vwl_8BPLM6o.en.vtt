00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
alright guys now we can install the

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.400 
alright guys now we can install the
strip<00:00:02.610> now<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.330> psycho<00:00:03.689> strat<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.110> called<00:00:04.319> a

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
strip now the psycho strat is called a

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.309 
strip now the psycho strat is called a
McPherson<00:00:05.100> strut<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.609> of<00:00:06.240> course<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.930> strut

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
McPherson strut and of course the strut

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.839 
McPherson strut and of course the strut
you<00:00:07.620> guys<00:00:07.740> can<00:00:07.919> probably<00:00:08.010> already<00:00:08.370> tell<00:00:08.519> what

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
you guys can probably already tell what

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.000 
you guys can probably already tell what
it<00:00:08.940> does<00:00:09.090> just<00:00:09.389> by<00:00:09.480> looking<00:00:09.840> at<00:00:09.960> it<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.590> kind<00:00:10.650> of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
it does just by looking at it it kind of

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.220 
it does just by looking at it it kind of
acts<00:00:11.280> as<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.580> shock<00:00:12.090> absorber<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.990> pretty

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
acts as a shock absorber it's pretty

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.890 
acts as a shock absorber it's pretty
much<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.380> spring<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.450> McPherson<00:00:15.450> strut<00:00:15.719> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
much a spring a McPherson strut the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.269 
much a spring a McPherson strut the
reason<00:00:16.199> they<00:00:16.289> call<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.740> because<00:00:17.250> I

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
reason they call it this is because I

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099 
reason they call it this is because I
think<00:00:17.460> some<00:00:17.789> value<00:00:18.060> McPherson<00:00:18.660> came<00:00:18.810> up<00:00:18.960> with

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
think some value McPherson came up with

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.290 
think some value McPherson came up with
it<00:00:19.260> it's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.920> combination<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.760> kind<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.090> two

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
it it's a combination of kind of two

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.509 
it it's a combination of kind of two
different<00:00:21.660> systems<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:22.289> lot<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.710> coil<00:00:23.130> spring

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
different systems a lot of coil spring

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.000 
different systems a lot of coil spring
which<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.150> yellow<00:00:24.359> thing<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.960> also<00:00:25.529> a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
which is this yellow thing and also a

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.130 
which is this yellow thing and also a
piston<00:00:26.880> or<00:00:27.119> something<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.750> call<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.080> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
piston or something just call it a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.859 
piston or something just call it a
cylinder<00:00:28.710> that's<00:00:29.250> inside<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.300> yellow<00:00:30.599> part

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
cylinder that's inside this yellow part

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.950 
cylinder that's inside this yellow part
that<00:00:31.500> moves<00:00:31.740> up<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.070> down<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.630> really<00:00:33.630> easy

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
that moves up and down so really easy

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
that moves up and down so really easy
again<00:00:34.680> some<00:00:35.430> people<00:00:35.460> call<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.940> shock

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
again some people call it a shock

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.840 
again some people call it a shock
absorber<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.989> strategist<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.770> specific<00:00:38.550> type<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
absorber a strategist a specific type of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.510 
absorber a strategist a specific type of
shock<00:00:39.270> absorber<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.399> what

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
shock absorber so now that you know what

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.790 
shock absorber so now that you know what
it<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.640> let's<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:42.059> ahead<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.360> put<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.800> go

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
it is let's go ahead and put it on go

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.910 
it is let's go ahead and put it on go
ahead<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.700> bolt<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> top<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.710> way

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
ahead first bolt on the top in the way

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.700 
ahead first bolt on the top in the way
it<00:00:47.070> goes<00:00:47.190> on<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.270> bolts<00:00:48.750> through<00:00:49.170> here<00:00:49.469> on

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
it goes on is a bolts through here on

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.970 
it goes on is a bolts through here on
top<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:50.820> bottom<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.680> let<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:52.739> do<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
top in here on bottom so let me do that

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.029 
top in here on bottom so let me do that
right<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.870> and<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.500> want<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.800> show<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> guys

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
right now and I want to show you guys

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
right now and I want to show you guys
that<00:00:56.460> crowd<00:00:56.850> or<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.539> problem<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.020> we're<00:00:58.289> going

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that crowd or a problem that we're going

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.939 
that crowd or a problem that we're going
to<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> we'll<00:01:00.210> go<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.660> top<00:01:00.899> screw<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
to have so we'll go to on top screw it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.870 
to have so we'll go to on top screw it
on<00:01:02.039> real<00:01:02.309> quick

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.060 

good<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.659> then<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.020> go<00:01:07.170> ok<00:01:07.500> now<00:01:08.010> I'm

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
good to go so then we go ok now I'm

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.440 
good to go so then we go ok now I'm
going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> bolt<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:08.820> bottom

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to bolt it on bottom

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
going to bolt it on bottom
but<00:01:10.409> look<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:11.700> strut<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> too<00:01:12.540> long<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:14.070> we

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
but look the strut is too long so we

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
but look the strut is too long so we
have<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.340> couple<00:01:14.610> options<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.150> first<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.320> we

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
have a couple options here first what we

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.830 
have a couple options here first what we
can<00:01:16.590> do<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.640> sell<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> tool<00:01:18.330> called<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
can do is they sell this tool called a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.780 
can do is they sell this tool called a
strut<00:01:19.290> compression<00:01:20.040> tool<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> does

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
strut compression tool and what it does

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.420 
strut compression tool and what it does
is<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.420> takes<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.840> coils<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.500> pinches<00:01:23.250> them

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
is it takes these coils and pinches them

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
is it takes these coils and pinches them
together<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.390> whenever<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.840> pinch<00:01:25.110> together

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
together so whenever they pinch together

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.760 
together so whenever they pinch together
the<00:01:25.770> piston<00:01:26.340> pin<00:01:26.670> pretty<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.500> shortened<00:01:28.500> or

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
the piston pin pretty much shortened or

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.530 
the piston pin pretty much shortened or
that<00:01:29.040> little<00:01:29.189> cylinder<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.150> back<00:01:30.329> into

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that little cylinder can go back into

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
that little cylinder can go back into
the<00:01:30.720> piston<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:32.670> pretty<00:01:32.909> much

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the piston so then you're pretty much

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.090 
the piston so then you're pretty much
your<00:01:33.299> entire<00:01:33.329> structure<00:01:34.110> ins<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.979> I'm

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
your entire structure ins but I'm

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.649 
your entire structure ins but I'm
guessing<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.700> lot<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.090> guys<00:01:36.270> whenever

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
guessing that a lot of you guys whenever

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
guessing that a lot of you guys whenever
you're<00:01:36.960> boating<00:01:37.110> go-karts<00:01:37.650> you're<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.979> going

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
you're boating go-karts you're not going

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.850 
you're boating go-karts you're not going
to<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.909> strut<00:01:39.329> compression<00:01:39.810> tool<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.619> what

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to have a strut compression tool so what

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
to have a strut compression tool so what
you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> this<00:01:41.729> instead<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.720> squeezing

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
you can do is this instead of squeezing

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.109 
you can do is this instead of squeezing
this<00:01:43.619> coil<00:01:43.829> together<00:01:44.250> because<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.700> can't<00:01:44.939> by

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this coil together because you can't by

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.630 
this coil together because you can't by
hand<00:01:45.390> no<00:01:45.509> matter<00:01:45.689> how<00:01:45.869> strong<00:01:46.290> mark<00:01:46.590> what<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
hand no matter how strong mark what you
