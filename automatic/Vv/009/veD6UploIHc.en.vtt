mine<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.659> be<00:01:06.750> what<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.740> want

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
mine is going to be what I really want

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.410 
mine is going to be what I really want
to<00:01:08.010> see<00:01:08.070> are<00:01:08.460> those<00:01:08.580> items<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.210> come

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
to see are those items that you come

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
to see are those items that you come
across<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.200> I<00:01:10.380> didn't<00:01:10.979> even<00:01:11.040> know<00:01:11.220> that

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
across and think I didn't even know that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.789 
across and think I didn't even know that
thing<00:01:11.549> existed<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.360> really<00:01:12.720> cool<00:01:12.930> for

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
thing existed and it is really cool for

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.670 
thing existed and it is really cool for
example<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> point<00:01:15.840> master<00:01:16.170> fire<00:01:16.320> control

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
for the Atari 2600 this is a rapid fire

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.770

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
plug the joystick in it and instead of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
plug the joystick in it and instead of
having<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.530> constantly<00:01:25.830> mash<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.790> button

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
having to constantly mash on the button

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.749 
having to constantly mash on the button
in<00:01:27.360> certain<00:01:27.720> games<00:01:27.750> which<00:01:28.280> weakens<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.490> grip

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
in certain games which weakens your grip

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.850 
in certain games which weakens your grip
on<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> controller<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.869> it<00:01:31.320> doesn't<00:01:31.740> give

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
on the controller and it doesn't give

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
on the controller and it doesn't give
you<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.220> accuracy<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:32.970> joystick

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
you as much accuracy with the joystick

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
you as much accuracy with the joystick
this<00:01:34.079> thing<00:01:34.320> allows<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.189> hold<00:01:35.369> down

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
this thing allows you to just hold down

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.710 
this thing allows you to just hold down
on<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.820> button<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.270> means<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
on the button which means you can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.840 
on the button which means you can
maintain<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:37.170> good<00:01:37.530> grip<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> much

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
maintain a good grip and you have much

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.120 
maintain a good grip and you have much
finer<00:01:39.150> control<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.810> love<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.710> because
