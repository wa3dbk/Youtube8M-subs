00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 dear friends get to the openbroadcast 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.680
 tutorial short obs a free tool 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 hurt player and streamer that me 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.550
 you can only put to heart even the 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.559
 very big people like franck den and 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.330
 without using that accordingly 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 actually only proved that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'll explain the simplest ones today 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.699
 Basically things are in there and 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.769
 I hope all of you ask 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.390
 enlighteners should still ask in the end 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.010
 she stays with me after all 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.310
 just below in the comments 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.359
 you see here an infinite wants that 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 Unfortunately it has to do with the fact that I have the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.469
 Monitors must be around you in this 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.059
 program should show but not 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.719
 do not scare those are the same 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.850
 different 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 it is always scary to the back like a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.350
 I always wanted to sit in a perfect row 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 ever make such ubs can be 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 free and salad the link to it is 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.140
 course below in the video 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.149
 description we will first here for 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.710
 See the whole overview here above 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 their stuff but we are interested 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.109
 not at all but we stay up here 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.170
 sometimes in the region 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.180
 this is the important openbroadcast 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.489
 Software is relatively easy to use 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.869
 nevertheless very versatile it works with 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.159
 So we have scenes called here 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.900
 already see very different if he 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.540
 that will be started the first time 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.409
 its just they have a scene can you 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.150
 but edit or new scenes 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.960
 Let's see here we do that 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.180
 but not at first 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.640
 yes I already have my iphone test 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.720
 just done 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.250
 these scenes are just there for that 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 he different attitudes with her 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.659
 Every single scene can save 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.049
 various sources have just here 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.460
 monitor and the webcam yes that has 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.659
 different priorities that is 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 currently not flames to the monitor 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.200
 I pull her behind the webcam 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.200
 upwards, so to speak 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.729
 then I would not see it anymore 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.220
 that means you will notice it 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.710
 sources are arranged so to speak that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 which is at the top is quite premiere over 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.009
 everything stored so if you now 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.939
 he wanted to record play so he needs 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.799
 different sources 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.880
 If you look down here I have just 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.420
 already the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.219
 Gold client and opened to a source 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.680
 you have to do the following 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.019
 right click makes her go 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.150
 Add and then you go 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.980
 Example on monitor recording know 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.830
 You can take a single picture 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.599
 also clean up text slideshow global 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.550
 source that is a webcam or the stop 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.530
 the monitor video equipment if a camera 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.910
 still connected external has one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.700
 I'll give you a short text too 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.920
 can dispose of 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.430
 three Egyptians then you have on top 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.319
 once a text and what we stand 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.360
 but want is the so-called game 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.870
 Recording the game recording more and more 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.280
 purely 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.720
 said to be intended in the case zack 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.930
 incredibly stored above everything 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.410
 Well and then he invites himself down here 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.980
 then I can give the game client her gm 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.930
 Recording always off hook or one 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.760
 of course, also text the text 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.380
 I've got up here now, too 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.510
 the webcam is if you are her 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.900
 usually I delete that 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.090
 webcam just times really delete really adds 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.630
 which then re- enters the global 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.209
 source 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.829
 and then she's up there I want 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.000
 but you do not have so you can 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.470
 of course bigger on windows 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.299
 or less 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.370
 he does that over here over scene 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.769
 edit he clicks on it and that 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.310
 theater he could make the thing smaller now 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.310
 pull 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.859
 greater than 10 o'clock god too big superman or 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.700
 even very small pack us down here 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.440
 back in the corner 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.000
 that was a bit pleasant 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.680
 bigger so i get better 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.569
 can bother and hello 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.400
 that could do with the construction work 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.500
 the same is true of him, of course 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.739
 writing up there could be huge 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.810
 make or mega small 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.060
 so you can have your own layout 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.829
 if he does street or youtube like you 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.319
 Just put it together 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.019
 just quite pleasant so tried one 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.530
 he puts that together a bit 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.450
 you need 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.970
 up here , the microphone has something, too 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.680
 can turn quieter or louder and 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.220
 of course the ingame sound of the ingame 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.500
 sound 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.090
 or the sound recorded when 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.220
 he skype or teamspeak and with others 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.380
 this will be about the thing here yes 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.030
 recorded on the thing is the 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.450
 Fountain with no worries on Lombok there 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.019
 close 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.790
 we go to settings that is 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.110
 what we sometimes need now 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.790
 will need settings in general 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.600
 we do not change anything is important 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.110
 first the first number two three four 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.660
 and five 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.760
 at number 2 you can adjust how 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.320
 good is the video quality that is at 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.360
 youtube videos I would generally on 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.660
 10,000 is the maximum 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.640
 yes that is a super quality 16 mbit 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.290
 and as I said 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.360
 use the large youtuber itself 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.240
 this quality is perfect for 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.740
 youtube and for full hd shots the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.450
 broadcast setting there we can 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.669
 between livestream under tel edition 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.540
 switch back and forth and just something 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.100
 to change 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.560
 for the live stream needs a couple of 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.900
 stream kay represents the release 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.970
 set her where the videos spent 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.919
 will be relatively small yes so gigabyte 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.590
 You can say approximately every ten minutes 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.900
 at the highest video quality that is not 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.890
 a lot of 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.510
 we do not want to take 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.810
 we do not change anything videos you can 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.470
 your fps with her takes a few 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.550
 of course, also the resolution 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.960
 audio also very interesting 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.700
 especially for our let's play here 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.070
 can you make the microphones selection 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.110
 you have or even the louder 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.580
 microphone compared to the one in game do 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.280
 if it is not already down here 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.860
 have chosen that's all great 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.660
 class and in the end could then here 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.550
 same recording states if press 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.790
 I would not have done that already 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.650
 yes you can record or stop if you 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.630
 the stream can have been given and with 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.590
 linked to your twitter account have obs 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.419
 then you can also streaming 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.000
 but that's not gonna happen 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.979
 that would be a bit improper for me 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.020
 nonsense you just do it here if 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.210
 you liked the whole then let 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.560
 me just a thumb or even 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.940
 an abo that would show me 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.930
 that you celebrate what I am doing right now 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.640
 and me a little bit too 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.290
 go on animate especially see 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:07.240
 We'll be back if he does 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.100
 ask if you still ask openly 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.450
 have and in the comments I bet so 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.900
 answer as well as possible 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.640
 I am an incredible lot 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.050
 or just the infinite buddy and 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.390
 wish you in this sense even a 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.390
 very nice day until then your buddy
