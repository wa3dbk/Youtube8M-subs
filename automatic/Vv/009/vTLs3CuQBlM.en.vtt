00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:04.150
 angel you see it because me 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.220
 I don't understand why side iva 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.519
 to measure the relationship with a player from the intensity of the matches 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.590
 with ilo with his prosecutors ie I can't understand why 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.930
 it's not like we have to meet every week with a prosecutor 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.770
 I understand that prosecutors have every interest in proving themselves active in 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.610
 towards their own players but where there are relationships 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.110
 important recent and fresh recent contracts are not reports 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.629
 contractual stipulated for years we are of the opinion that these meetings are frequent 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.089
 they cannot be justified or justified and above all at a time when they are 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:44.060
 Naples 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.490
 precisely this DVD made here for which there is no frost with Lavezzi is not there 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.390
 no fire whatsoever but we do not even notice the need to 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.510
 having to meet us every two or three days with the prosecutors as well as not 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.630
 we meet the prosecutors of the other offers we have never received for 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.930
 which 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.370
 we were interested in receiving them so 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.280
 these are all 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.300
 and chatter 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.410
 let me 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.750
 also 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.990
 let's say that I also appreciate eberle 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.050
 soap opera 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.400
 if they fit 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.520
 many teams that have been matched to our players 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.190
 in the last 2 years especially our players 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 more important and more valued and more appetites and more 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.480
 You are good 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.820
 these teams never occurred 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.440
 have been pushed together 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.230
 for two years now these players have never occurred 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.850
 a transfer for them 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.140
 I do not drink 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.810
 absolutely 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 fall into the trap of commenting on what is not there for me 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.200
 here we never talked about losing you hamsik and lavezzi for which I have nothing 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.870
 from answer
