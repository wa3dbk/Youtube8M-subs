 so that the dough stops sticking to 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.280
 hands start to make dumplings but 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.530
 first you need to cook with 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.910
 part of the test we roll the sausage we cut 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.910
