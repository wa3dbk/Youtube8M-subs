00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.859 
so now that my hair is detangled and
twisted<00:01:06.320> in<00:01:06.440> medium<00:01:06.860> sections<00:01:07.460> I<00:01:07.869> evaluate

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
twisted in medium sections I evaluate

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:10.960 
twisted in medium sections I evaluate
the<00:01:09.020> health<00:01:09.259> of<00:01:09.409> my<00:01:09.680> ends<00:01:10.280> to<00:01:10.430> see<00:01:10.670> if<00:01:10.789> they

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
the health of my ends to see if they

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.600

need<00:01:11.210> dusting<00:01:11.720> or<00:01:12.380> in<00:01:12.530> this<00:01:12.649> case<00:01:12.920> clipping

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
need dusting or in this case clipping

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.749 
need dusting or in this case clipping
now<00:01:14.390> I<00:01:14.420> do<00:01:14.600> know<00:01:15.080> most<00:01:15.440> may<00:01:16.009> suggest<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.550> it's

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
now I do know most may suggest that it's

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:18.430 
now I do know most may suggest that it's
better<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.090> straighten<00:01:17.720> your<00:01:17.810> hair<00:01:17.869> first

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
before clipping your ends but for me I

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.370 
before clipping your ends but for me I
