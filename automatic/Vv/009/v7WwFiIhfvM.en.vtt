00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hi tankers I went there I took 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.580
 testing 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.589
 the ninth tier of the new 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.799
 waffentragers 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:17.220
 the one that is based on the tank pz 4 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:21.150
 very very penetrating gun if not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 mistaken armor penetration 276 and denis then and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 damage 560 and here I leave I leave just in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.260
 Railway map of Tundra 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.200
 and here is the first victim Lorraine gets 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.559
 your deserved damage and keep 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.620
 aiming like fifty hundred 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.219
 twenty second break through 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.399
 passes already in this heavy tank two 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.460
 french hit and third shot 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:59.670
 580 more good then it seems to me 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:03.359
 doesn't see recharge here 88 as far as 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.750
 I remember from memory in the replay unfortunately 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.750
 missing 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:14.070
 so our will not be able to finish off 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 Frenchman hid so it seems to me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.100
 there is something to do on that flank and I 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.400
 I decide to drive closer I initially 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.140
 wanted to go to brother one but see now 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.729
 and that there will be things to do 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 for example to finish off the Frenchman excellent French 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.619
 goes to the hangar it was 50 120 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.600
 I really decide to drive closer 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:47.030
 there are a lot of little red dots here 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:52.189
 yes well there it is all behind the rocks it seems yes 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.189
 ok you have to go means even closer 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 so here's another same fellow melts 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.860
 as I and 95 enemy finishes kills 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.550
 finishing off our 8 waffentreger someone 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:18.510
 tests a-95 young masochist some 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.380
 and in the meantime I'm trying to find 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.100
 any good position to 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.120
 realize your gun so where here 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.049
 so drive up 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:43.200
 neat leg here right here 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:46.010
 t-54 e1 so she kidnapped oh damn well how 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.600
 so how unfortunate can surfboard 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.380
 didn't notice the tower could just give 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:54.030
 the tower 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.069
 their offensive projectile gone so this and 95 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.640
 Come try to allocate somewhere 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:05.070
 ulan-ude for example excellent excellent 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:10.459
 excellent accuracy excellent break through t95 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:14.720
 punished now try again 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:19.010
 one more time neatly sticking out 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.010
 right there was just 395 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:29.450
 More interestingly added dynamics are not well 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:39.230
 really so quickly could not move 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:42.739
 it is clear so there well here the gun is not 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.569
 goes down so much though sort of like with 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.510
 declination angles and everything is not so bad but 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.579
 not to the same extent it is still not 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.209
 American tanks are going you are trying to 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:57.590
 go out and wait 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:04:02.389
 little red school guests this one this one 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:07.389
 esteshka finishing off wow remember well 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:10.780
 fired of course does not mean higher no 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:15.199
 fine fine 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.849
 oh, how I have 2 well what's 1600 x 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.769
 n can survive 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.470
 three such terrible hits from 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.320
 the same friend 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:28.360
 until such a paradox but there is health 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:33.650
 how many 500 x n will be there and here 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:36.080
 the same building still without tower hp 1600 m 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:39.229
 3 times more can be in 4 I do not remember 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.830
 how much health do not think more 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.830
 500 hp 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.070
 such but it vytsepit that there 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:53.210
 reds reds tsena reds 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:57.199
 blush well, everyone hid like 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.280
 disappeared will lose and moreover nobody 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:03.440
 I see whom to shoot so here is something 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.919
 that something bad happened 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.349
 I remember the pains right here I pulled 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.030
 what happened is clear after all or his goals 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.000
 wave hill. 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.300
 but this thing did not notice how she 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.300
 left 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:29.050
 aim 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:33.270
 and all tank destroyed leg seems 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:44.919
 exploded exploded my entire ammunition 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:54.240
 wool hard tin laser yes yes fire 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:55.449
 such a serious nuclear blast u beautiful 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:03.960
 beautiful 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:08.650
 exploded it's not all oh my goodness 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:14.289
 atomic explosion here and so don't stand 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:18.849
 next to the exploding waffentragger it 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:22.750
 scary and it's not all I'm wrong for him 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:24.730
 such up 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.310
 Well guys, we are generally on this all 

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.890
 perhaps emotions emotions gangsters 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.370
 ends beautiful language nothing 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.370
 you say 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.620
 we lost in this fight but in principle 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.330
 For the first impression, I think it is quite 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.380
 enough so that they are out of yourself 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:46.560
 This piece is a big gun with 

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:50.130
 good breakthrough just amazing 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:54.570
 accuracy on the highway pz 4 and I think should 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:57.090
 be nice masking crew with net 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:58.740
 out with a fully pumped disguise 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.770
 I do not think I would feel 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:06.060
 quite well and you will not put one 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:09.890
 a thousand damage well that 's all and on 

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.890
 perhaps until we meet again
