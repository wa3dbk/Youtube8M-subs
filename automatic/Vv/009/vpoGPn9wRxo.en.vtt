00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
now moving on to the next question this

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.070 
now moving on to the next question this
is<00:00:06.930> from<00:00:07.049> Angela<00:00:07.410> Adam<00:00:08.189> they<00:00:08.970> say<00:00:09.300> what<00:00:09.630> must<00:00:09.900> I

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
is from Angela Adam they say what must I

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.720 
is from Angela Adam they say what must I
do<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.320> prevent<00:00:10.769> my<00:00:11.040> hands<00:00:11.460> from<00:00:11.670> shaking

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
do to prevent my hands from shaking

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.990 
do to prevent my hands from shaking
sometimes<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.019> what<00:00:13.170> causes<00:00:13.440> that<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.009> I'm

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
sometimes and what causes that so I'm

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.180 
sometimes and what causes that so I'm
assuming<00:00:15.480> I'm<00:00:15.599> Jay<00:00:15.780> had<00:00:16.170> shaky<00:00:16.590> hands<00:00:17.010> and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
assuming I'm Jay had shaky hands and

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.220 
assuming I'm Jay had shaky hands and
they<00:00:17.310> want<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.640> know<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:18.720> they<00:00:18.869> can<00:00:19.020> prevent

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
they want to know how they can prevent

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.929 
they want to know how they can prevent
it<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.560> what<00:00:19.650> might<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.980> wrong<00:00:20.130> yeah<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
it and what might be wrong yeah the

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.570 
it and what might be wrong yeah the
medical<00:00:21.390> term<00:00:21.840> we<00:00:21.990> use<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.230> shaky<00:00:22.800> hands<00:00:23.250> or

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
medical term we use for shaky hands or

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.330 
medical term we use for shaky hands or
tremors<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:25.170> tremor<00:00:25.470> all<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.830> obvious<00:00:26.189> do

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
tremors and we tremor all the obvious do

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
tremors and we tremor all the obvious do
sometimes<00:00:26.820> when<00:00:26.970> we're<00:00:27.119> even<00:00:27.359> afraid<00:00:27.660> we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
sometimes when we're even afraid we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.679 
sometimes when we're even afraid we
tremor<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.619> cold<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.029> mechanism<00:00:30.300> of

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
tremor when we cold as a mechanism of

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.260 
tremor when we cold as a mechanism of
creative<00:00:31.170> body<00:00:31.619> heat<00:00:31.890> by<00:00:32.430> activating<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
creative body heat by activating and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.030 
creative body heat by activating and
relaxing<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> muscle<00:00:34.230> groups<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:34.649> what<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
relaxing the muscle groups and what a

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.069 
relaxing the muscle groups and what a
tremor<00:00:35.370> actually<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.059> is<00:00:36.570> basically<00:00:36.809> an

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
tremor actually is is basically an

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.020 
tremor actually is is basically an
imbalance<00:00:37.620> between<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.610> group<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
imbalance between the one group of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.660 
imbalance between the one group of
muscles<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.660> making<00:00:39.870> making<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.950> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
muscles that are making making the the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.540 
muscles that are making making the the
joint<00:00:41.940> move<00:00:42.329> okay<00:00:43.110> when<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.739> one<00:00:43.920> contracts

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
joint move okay when that one contracts

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940 
joint move okay when that one contracts
it<00:00:44.820> lifts<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.270> wrist<00:00:45.660> for<00:00:45.870> example<00:00:46.320> when

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
it lifts the wrist for example when

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410 
it lifts the wrist for example when
they're<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> opposite<00:00:47.969> group<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
they're in the opposite group of the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.990 
they're in the opposite group of the
forearm<00:00:48.719> relaxes<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.039> drops<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.969> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
forearm relaxes there is drops so a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.299 
forearm relaxes there is drops so a
tremor<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.199> basically<00:00:52.410> alternate

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
tremor is actually basically alternate

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.430 
tremor is actually basically alternate
alternating<00:00:53.940> movements<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.989> we<00:00:55.140> call

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
alternating movements of what we call

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.720 
alternating movements of what we call
agonist<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> antagonist<00:00:56.539> muscles<00:00:57.539> okay

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
agonist and antagonist muscles okay

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.459 
agonist and antagonist muscles okay
imbalance<00:00:59.730> or<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.969> sync<00:01:00.329> obviously<00:01:01.199> giving

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
imbalance or in sync obviously giving

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.170 
imbalance or in sync obviously giving
that<00:01:01.590> erratic<00:01:02.070> signal<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.640> then<00:01:02.789> giving<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that erratic signal and then giving you

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.450 
that erratic signal and then giving you
the<00:01:03.660> disturbance<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> equilibrium<00:01:05.339> which

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
the disturbance in the equilibrium which

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.789 
the disturbance in the equilibrium which
is<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.640> controlled<00:01:06.150> steady<00:01:06.630> muscle<00:01:07.560> tone<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
is a controlled steady muscle tone and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.460 
is a controlled steady muscle tone and
posture<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.150> tremors<00:01:09.600> brought<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:10.110> as<00:01:10.350> I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
posture so a tremors brought about as I

said<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.460> imbalance<00:01:12.030> between

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
said by the the imbalance between

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.410

big<00:01:55.950> one<00:01:56.189> obviously<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.729> Parkinson's<00:01:57.509> disease

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
big one obviously is Parkinson's disease

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.260 
big one obviously is Parkinson's disease
right<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.950> is<00:01:59.130> primarily<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.729> disease<00:01:59.759> where

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
right which is primarily a disease where

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.370 
right which is primarily a disease where
you<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> shortage<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you have a shortage of a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.929 
you have a shortage of a
neurotransmitter<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> brain<00:02:02.399> called

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
neurotransmitter in the brain called

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.630 
neurotransmitter in the brain called
dopamine<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.770> dopamine<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:05.070> essential

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
dopamine and the dopamine is essential

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.080 
dopamine and the dopamine is essential
obviously<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.680> controlling<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
obviously in controlling and in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.869 
obviously in controlling and in
regulating<00:02:09.720> sustained<00:02:10.410> movement<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.430> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
regulating sustained movement of the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.820 
regulating sustained movement of the
muscles<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.420> motor<00:02:12.750> function<00:02:13.290> specifically

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
muscles so motor function specifically

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.369 
muscles so motor function specifically
in<00:02:14.010> this<00:02:14.160> case<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.300> then<00:02:15.780> what<00:02:16.230> we

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
in this case and you have then what we

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.170 
in this case and you have then what we
call<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> trap<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.220> Parkinson's<00:02:17.819> disease

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
call the trap of Parkinson's disease

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.050 
call the trap of Parkinson's disease
which<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.020> tremor<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.890> rigidity<00:02:20.220> where<00:02:20.940> you

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
which is tremor the rigidity where you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
which is tremor the rigidity where you
quite<00:02:21.270> stuff<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.560> easier<00:02:23.010> or<00:02:23.310> moving

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
quite stuff the a can easier or moving

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.059 
quite stuff the a can easier or moving
slowly<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.270> then<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.569> P<00:02:24.780> being<00:02:25.110> postural

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
slowly and then the P being postural

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.410 
slowly and then the P being postural
instability<00:02:26.280> okay

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
instability okay

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.330 
instability okay
so<00:02:27.629> that's<00:02:27.870> very<00:02:28.080> important<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.709> it<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:29.040> point

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
so that's very important so it can point

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.670 
so that's very important so it can point
to<00:02:29.550> two<00:02:29.819> other<00:02:30.000> medical<00:02:30.510> conditions<00:02:30.959> even<00:02:31.379> a

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
to two other medical conditions even a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.830 
to two other medical conditions even a
thyroid<00:02:32.099> problem<00:02:32.129> can<00:02:32.670> point<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
thyroid problem can point to a to a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
thyroid problem can point to a to a
tremor<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:34.890> brought<00:02:35.069> about<00:02:35.099> by<00:02:35.670> many

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
tremor but it's brought about by many

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.970 
tremor but it's brought about by many
many<00:02:36.480> medical<00:02:36.959> conditions<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.890> be

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
many medical conditions so it can be

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
many medical conditions so it can be
brought<00:02:38.160> about<00:02:38.340> by<00:02:38.580> an<00:02:38.700> array<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:38.970> different

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
brought about by an array of different

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.660 
brought about by an array of different
medical<00:02:39.720> conditions<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.290> must<00:02:41.010> consult<00:02:41.519> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
medical conditions you must consult a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.000 
medical conditions you must consult a
doctor<00:02:41.849> you<00:02:42.480> mentioned<00:02:42.599> beta<00:02:43.290> blockers<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
doctor you mentioned beta blockers and

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.470 
doctor you mentioned beta blockers and
for<00:02:44.340> this<00:02:44.459> and<00:02:44.760> migraines

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
for this and migraines

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.900 
for this and migraines
what<00:02:46.019> does<00:02:46.319> that<00:02:46.349> medication<00:02:46.980> do<00:02:47.129> yeah<00:02:47.730> well<00:02:47.879> a

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
what does that medication do yeah well a

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.699 
what does that medication do yeah well a
beta<00:02:48.150> blocker<00:02:48.390> works<00:02:48.750> specifically<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.680> that

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
beta blocker works specifically on that

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.680 
beta blocker works specifically on that
what<00:02:50.129> we<00:02:50.280> call<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.550> beta<00:02:50.790> receptors<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
what we call the beta receptors and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.600 
what we call the beta receptors and
while<00:02:52.230> they're<00:02:52.440> quite<00:02:52.620> important<00:02:53.129> as<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
while they're quite important as the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.550 
while they're quite important as the
receptors<00:02:54.480> are<00:02:54.660> important<00:02:55.080> in<00:02:55.170> regulating

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
receptors are important in regulating

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.580 
receptors are important in regulating
the<00:02:56.430> speed<00:02:56.910> for<00:02:57.300> example<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.900> your<00:02:58.110> heartbeat

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
the speed for example of your heartbeat

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.220 
the speed for example of your heartbeat
they<00:02:59.129> slow<00:02:59.459> down<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.760> heart<00:03:00.120> rate<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.569> often

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
they slow down the heart rate so often

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.630 
they slow down the heart rate so often
people<00:03:01.379> that<00:03:01.650> suffer<00:03:02.069> with<00:03:02.099> the<00:03:02.310> peripheral

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
people that suffer with the peripheral

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.720 
people that suffer with the peripheral
signs<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.599> anxiety<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.980> bit<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.190> tremor<00:03:05.459> as

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
one of the most common ones are in the

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.880 
one of the most common ones are in the
airway<00:03:23.940> in<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.209> trachea<00:03:24.659> the<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.560> smooth

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
muscle of the trachea when you have

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.619 
muscle of the trachea when you have
asthma<00:03:27.750> for<00:03:28.110> example<00:03:28.560> we<00:03:29.129> we<00:03:29.549> are<00:03:30.090> urged<00:03:30.390> to

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
asthma for example we we are urged to

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:32.300 
asthma for example we we are urged to
stay<00:03:30.900> away<00:03:31.230> from<00:03:31.290> beta<00:03:31.739> blockers<00:03:32.220> because

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
stay away from beta blockers because

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.750 
stay away from beta blockers because
they<00:03:32.580> can<00:03:32.790> facilitate<00:03:33.379> bronchospasm

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
they can facilitate bronchospasm

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.119 
they can facilitate bronchospasm
constriction<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.209> airway<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.260> yeah<00:03:37.769> there

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
constriction of the airway so yeah there

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:42.930 
constriction of the airway so yeah there
are<00:03:38.190> many<00:03:38.250> many<00:03:38.730> diverse<00:03:39.269> functions

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.000 

you
