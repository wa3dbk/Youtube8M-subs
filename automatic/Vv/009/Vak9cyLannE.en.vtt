 announces a new monster hunter 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.519
 Two things are as safe as the name 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:16.980
 in the church 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 firstly, the fans rested from the second 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.470
 rest wonders why this is one 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.390
 role playing game 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 what exactly is it and what is the core 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.930
 ask the thing those belonging to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.980
 a monster hunter release like that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.660
 crisis to the wine 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.160
 therefore takes place only once for all that still 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.090
 not for hunting community belong 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.090
 fast crash course 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.220
 okay people nice that all come here 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.190
 could here is I have you here 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.040
 damned far away that starts again 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.080
 and 1000 dead come from the hunter village 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.790
 to spank us 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:56.890
 who can tell me what you think about us 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:01:01.260
 the fans want to develop the track 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:04.150
 do not want to argue between us 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.000
 births and cutting through her 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.979
 body does not build weapons and armor 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 right and if you liked it 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.509
 monster hunter is an action 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.890
 Roleplay jack huge monster around 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.270
 Items of their carcasses new 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.920
 to build armor and weapons 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.140
 every quest is an epic one 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.399
 bosskampf newcomers usually criticize the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.380
 sluggish control and landing 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.270
 phases of animation of the leather but this 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.050
 supposed inadequacies are 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.460
 pure intention 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.990
 you just can not go blind 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.430
 but must storm his own 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.750
 weaken by tactics and well- timed 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.340
 compensate for actions 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.010
 meet yourself but not hit 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.330
 will be the currency and the 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.990
 most important we almost forgot 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.990
 you can 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.870
 expected with monster hunter 3 ultimate 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.600
 Now you have an extended version of the 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.100
 2010 released monster hunter 3 next 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.500
 nice hd graphic gets her one 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.220
 whole bangs of new monster 35 fishermen 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.750
 it was before 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.750
 now it is 73 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:10.820
 next, you want two new additions 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.190
 imagine place and set 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:16.480
 Bielefeld I can do whatever you can 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 brought a silver 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.500
 braach videos is the new flagship 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.000
 monster quasi the figurehead his horn 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.769
 and his fists but slime off the 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.939
 after a short while something explodes 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.790
 particularly stupid is he smart 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.590
 First of you depends Mesut is 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.269
 veterans already from earlier parts 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.859
 Nobody liked him because he was 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.819
 So often pulled back into the water where you put him 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.349
 could not attack 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.090
 but if he jumps into the water now 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.650
 jump here just what the 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.569
 are you all too small then you are allowed 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.980
 dran boros liked a wood monster 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.450
 It's as big a work as it is 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.450
 Surprisingly , the book has it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:13.450
 but does not think that one 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.450
 walk because sega have upgraded 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.269
 to the format 6 weapon types are now 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.620
 six more were added 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.209
 the most original would probably have that 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.769
 haghorn because he plays with everyone 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.989
 beat music notes your attributes 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.040
 short has the strong who so thick 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:47.659
 things are too slow 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.919
 which puts on the nimble double sound 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.120
 with which you deal quickly and 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.010
 can dodge quickly 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.720
 stark counterpart to this is the guaranteed 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.519
 lance you to a sting the and 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.379
 shoot in wolbeck makes and for 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.500
 Attacks from a distance are suitable 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.500
 arc 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.819
 The new content alone is already great 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.650
 but the coolest gimmick is the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.990
 Compatibility of the opinion on 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 same content 3ds version on the one hand 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.110
 you can get your score from the eu 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.310
 on the 3ds broadcast around yours 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.140
 character continues on the way 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.910
 on the other hand we can expand up to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.650
 three handheld with the eu doubles 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.650
 local more players chased through 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.990
 fans have monster hunter 3 ultimate eh 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.700
 already reserved for all eternity 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.630
 doubts should be advised finally with us 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.310
 to blow the horn 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.870
 It takes time to get to the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.580
 tricky combat mechanics internalized 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 but with every fight you will 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.300
 more efficient and more confident and then 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.890
 grab the monster hunt by the eggs 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.020
 there the beasts can lure that way 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.610
 terrible 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.670
 thinks tuned cube terrible monster 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.950
 with crass skills and we have to 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:53.820
 here completely own or hammer hangs 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.120
 who we are our book on trust 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.870
 we hide on our grip and 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.870
 show 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.910
 and encouraged 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.200
 calm
