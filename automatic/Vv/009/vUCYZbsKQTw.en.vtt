00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
regular LeBron James but there is a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.179 
regular LeBron James but there is a
difference<00:01:57.210> he<00:01:58.049> does<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.500> some<00:01:58.530> increase<00:01:59.159> in

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
stats now according to his diamond

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.959 
stats now according to his diamond
player<00:02:01.799> if<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.250> diamond<00:02:02.670> LeBron

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
player if you have the diamond LeBron

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.030 
player if you have the diamond LeBron
James<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.540> still<00:02:04.170> do<00:02:04.409> believe<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
James I still do believe that the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.039 
James I still do believe that the
diamond<00:02:05.430> LeBron<00:02:05.759> James<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> best<00:02:06.689> abroad

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
diamond LeBron James is the best abroad

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.960 
diamond LeBron James is the best abroad
in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> game<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.799> if<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> diamond

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
in the game so if you have the diamond

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.609 
in the game so if you have the diamond
LeBron<00:02:09.270> James<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:10.020> ahead<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.319> run<00:02:10.530> with

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
LeBron James and go ahead and run with

LeBron James and go ahead and run with
the<00:02:10.739> diamond<00:02:11.099> LeBron

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the diamond LeBron

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.700 
the diamond LeBron
