of<00:00:19.830> other<00:00:19.949> cool<00:00:20.250> spec<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.449> i'm<00:00:21.720> i'm<00:00:22.289> going<00:00:22.439> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
of other cool spec so i'm i'm going to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.900 
of other cool spec so i'm i'm going to
give<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.830> basic<00:00:23.070> idea<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.760> it's<00:00:23.880> like

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
give you a basic idea of what it's like

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.439 
give you a basic idea of what it's like
to<00:00:24.210> use<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.779> laptop<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> day-to-day<00:00:25.590> basis

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.620 

so<00:00:30.500> if<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> start<00:00:31.800> from<00:00:32.070> closed<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.239> can<00:00:33.390> open

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
so if we start from closed we can open

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.619 
so if we start from closed we can open
up<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.340> from<00:00:35.340> sleep<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.030> comes<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:38.480> two<00:00:39.480> to
