about what we want in a car that will do
our<00:02:26.459> family<00:02:27.030> I<00:02:27.180> always<00:02:27.719> thought<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.230> prime

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
our family I always thought the prime

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.990 
our family I always thought the prime
factor<00:02:29.010> with<00:02:29.099> my<00:02:29.250> lot<00:02:29.430> would<00:02:29.549> be<00:02:29.579> how<00:02:29.879> much

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
factor with my lot would be how much

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.449 
factor with my lot would be how much
space<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.810> could<00:02:30.930> give<00:02:31.109> them<00:02:31.290> because<00:02:31.500> they

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
space we could give them because they

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.490 
space we could give them because they
tend<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.909> tend<00:02:33.450> to<00:02:33.480> get<00:02:33.569> rather<00:02:33.719> territorial

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
tend to tend to get rather territorial

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.410 
tend to tend to get rather territorial
and<00:02:34.680> if<00:02:35.370> they<00:02:35.489> don't<00:02:35.639> get<00:02:35.819> enough<00:02:35.939> space<00:02:36.150> they

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
and if they don't get enough space they

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.270 
and if they don't get enough space they
tend<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.750> lash<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.109> to<00:02:37.260> each<00:02:37.379> other<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.159> it's

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
tend to lash out to each other but it's

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.399 
tend to lash out to each other but it's
not<00:02:38.430> just<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.150> about<00:02:39.269> how<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.230> can

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
not just that it's about how much we can

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.770 
not just that it's about how much we can
use<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.920> space<00:02:41.159> it<00:02:41.609> has<00:02:42.000> made<00:02:42.239> us<00:02:42.269> realize

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
use the space it has made us realize

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.349 
use the space it has made us realize
actually<00:02:43.170> we<00:02:43.290> need<00:02:43.469> a<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:43.980> flexible<00:02:44.280> car<00:02:44.819> not
