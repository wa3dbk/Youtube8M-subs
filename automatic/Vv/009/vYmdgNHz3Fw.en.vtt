00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
so that you if you're going to give a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.010 
so that you if you're going to give a
turn<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.880> left<00:02:39.120> one<00:02:39.390> give<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> turn<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
right one so that you're raising the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.800 
right one so that you're raising the
bridge<00:02:42.390> up<00:02:42.980> evenly<00:02:43.980> if<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.850> turn<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.510> of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
bridge up evenly if you just turn one of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.260 
bridge up evenly if you just turn one of
the<00:02:46.020> screws<00:02:46.320> then<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:47.030> saddle<00:02:48.030> will<00:02:48.150> get

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
the screws then the saddle will get

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.729 
the screws then the saddle will get
crooked<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:48.780> you<00:02:48.870> need<00:02:49.020> them<00:02:49.110> both<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.470> come<00:02:49.620> up

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
crooked so you need them both to come up

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.280 
crooked so you need them both to come up
at<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> same<00:02:50.130> time<00:02:50.480> anyway<00:02:51.480> once<00:02:51.690> your<00:02:51.900> your

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
at the same time anyway once your your

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.880 
at the same time anyway once your your
bridge<00:02:52.860> height<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.580> correct<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:55.500> string

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
bridge height is correct and your string

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.490 
bridge height is correct and your string
action<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.670> proper<00:02:57.150> then<00:02:57.930> you're<00:02:58.200> ready<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
action is proper then you're ready to

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.920 
action is proper then you're ready to
play<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.220> let's<00:02:59.430> see<00:02:59.730> how<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.060> thing<00:03:00.360> sounds

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
play so let's see how this thing sounds

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:38.229 
play so let's see how this thing sounds
with<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:02.040> way<00:03:02.160> we've<00:03:02.370> wired<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.850> up

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.050 

okay<00:03:39.239> this<00:03:39.530> is<00:03:40.530> sounding<00:03:40.799> pretty<00:03:40.860> good<00:03:41.069> we're

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
okay this is sounding pretty good we're

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.180 
okay this is sounding pretty good we're
going<00:03:42.150> to<00:03:42.209> check<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.290> should<00:03:43.590> get<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.860> little

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
going to check you should get a little

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.820 
going to check you should get a little
bit<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.400> noise<00:03:44.610> when<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.330> use<00:03:45.599> your<00:03:45.930> first

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
bit of noise when you use your first

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.440 
bit of noise when you use your first
third<00:03:47.790> and<00:03:48.060> fifth<00:03:48.200> positions<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.409> the<00:03:49.530> switch

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
third and fifth positions on the switch

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.690 
third and fifth positions on the switch
you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.599> hear<00:03:51.780> that<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.290> we<00:03:52.950> switch<00:03:53.220> into<00:03:53.579> the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
you can hear that as we switch into the

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.690 
you can hear that as we switch into the
second<00:03:54.239> both<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.409> these<00:03:55.530> coils<00:03:55.829> together<00:03:56.370> will

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
second both of these coils together will

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.809 
second both of these coils together will
cancel<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.360> noise<00:03:57.629> and<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.470> quiet<00:03:58.860> when

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
cancel the noise and so it's quiet when

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.059 
cancel the noise and so it's quiet when
we<00:03:59.909> go<00:04:00.030> back<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.209> position<00:04:00.989> three<00:04:01.530> Center

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
we go back to position three Center

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.589 
we go back to position three Center
pickup<00:04:02.400> will<00:04:02.519> get<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> little<00:04:02.940> bit<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.150> buzz<00:04:03.329> and

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
pickup will get a little bit of buzz and

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.360 
pickup will get a little bit of buzz and
you<00:04:04.079> can<00:04:04.230> control<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.680> buzz<00:04:04.920> by<00:04:05.129> how<00:04:05.310> you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
you can control that buzz by how you

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.119 
you can control that buzz by how you
position<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.910> guitar<00:04:06.950> notice<00:04:07.950> I<00:04:08.040> have

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
position the guitar notice I have

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.479 
position the guitar notice I have
eliminated<00:04:08.519> the<00:04:08.640> buzz<00:04:08.849> now<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.920> comes<00:04:11.160> back

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
eliminated the buzz now it comes back

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.640 
eliminated the buzz now it comes back
single<00:04:12.450> coil<00:04:12.690> pickups<00:04:12.720> are<00:04:13.170> very<00:04:13.349> sensitive

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
single coil pickups are very sensitive

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.430 
single coil pickups are very sensitive
to<00:04:14.010> where<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.819> guitar<00:04:15.090> is<00:04:15.209> placed<00:04:15.599> when

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
to where the guitar is placed when

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.229 
to where the guitar is placed when
you're<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.799> in<00:04:17.039> between<00:04:17.430> positions<00:04:17.940> two

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
you're in the in between positions two

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.020 
you're in the in between positions two
and<00:04:18.539> four<00:04:19.039> doesn't<00:04:20.039> really<00:04:20.130> matter<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.789> the

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
and four doesn't really matter that the

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.590 
and four doesn't really matter that the
noise<00:04:21.539> of<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> buzz<00:04:22.109> is<00:04:22.139> not<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:23.419> so<00:04:24.419> let's

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
noise of the buzz is not there so let's

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.270 
noise of the buzz is not there so let's
try<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.900> in-between<00:04:25.410> position<00:04:25.860> and<00:04:26.039> then<00:04:26.130> our

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
try the in-between position and then our

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.760 
try the in-between position and then our
position<00:04:26.820> one<00:04:27.060> neck<00:04:27.389> pickup<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.020> position

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770
