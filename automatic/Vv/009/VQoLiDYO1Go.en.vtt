 out of date 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.610
 in fact at the time it was updated 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the face but they believed several 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 things that I advocated to bring the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.320

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.640
 The block I have in my hand is the house. 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.050
 red 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.810

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.940
 a base a ready base green base 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.319
 green becomes greener right 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.319

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.310
 I know, man, I lost it, I came here too. 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.069
 not there now the place was already 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.660
 getting the fucking beauty done right then 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.250
 You'll get a block of this. 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.800
 probably that open maria 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.319
 Do not worry, it will. 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.399
 able to make the base beauty and 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:58.530
 stabilize 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.500
 is the first part is that you need 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.750
 to play and asks' will then bag 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.160
 Just so you can get in. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.170
 In this house you need to have a 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.569
 computerized with the color of your team 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.180
 so like here the red house I 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.200
 I need to be in uniform for the door 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.080
 the club 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.820
 you need to be in uniform with the 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.240
 red vests that I'm not even now 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.830
 the pdt everything good 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.630
 I'll show you how to craft then 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.510
 I'll show you right now. 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.850
 Look at you, make the red base. 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.680
 Are you going to do it this way if you 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.270
 green is that way right 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.610
 probably all it will only use the 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.920
 bids let me see that there are exactly 40 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.680
 any base that is you do here 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.440
 will need to walk due to the colors of 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.380
 billion your face and make the 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.530
 collective is very quiet this bread looks 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.510
 just look like this because you're just like 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.970
 if you were to make a normal vest only 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.550
 using hawk of the color you want 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.280
 beauty remembering is red orange 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.140
 green yellow and a zoom 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120
 So how come I have a red vest with 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.190
 You already cut it for good. 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.840
 if I want to get into this green here 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.010
 I can not because I'm with 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.930
 red vest 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.880
 so I can do the following looks 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.280
 to the face because she had 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.510
 I'm going to run into all this from here and 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.490
 I'll put it here 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.670
 ready now I'm wearing 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.170
 green can I come in here? 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.880
 quietly quiet and inside them 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.160
 rolled I almost made another 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.980
 and they put a chest full of 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.450
 hits that never for you for what it is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.340
 ok let's go continue here and 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.800
 Catch this here again 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.140
 besides the bases and the jackets obviously 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.870
 You'll have the guns and catch my 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.270
 since the eagles have diverse models 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.130
 sizes and bosses let me catch the 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.830

 Look fine, it's cool. You look. It's the 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.820
 business on the contrary if you look with the button

 left and shoots right at 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.830
 How cool does it feel that there is something to stir? 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.600
 to act suicidal to some bug here 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.700

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.050
 When I get it because I 'm not in the team. 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.080

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.319
 even since already since since it does not 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.919
 flies in connects in long does this 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:37.020

 control in the hand looks only the bomb explodes 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.569
 everything expensive probably if you have a 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:50.550
 player there already was if rolled it rolled but it goes 

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:52.469
 Speak player because it's expensive, I forgot to 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.349
 speak this template here with 

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:58.860

 even the flag that also if you 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.449
 want to demarcate their territory or do 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.949
 Something like the flags I do not 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.050
 I know what stage bats but if you 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:24.659
