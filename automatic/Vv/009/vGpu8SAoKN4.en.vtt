00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
see it in my later walkthrough gameplays

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.700 
see it in my later walkthrough gameplays
but<00:00:12.150> let's<00:00:12.509> go<00:00:12.690> ahead<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.349> treasure

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
but let's go ahead and do this treasure

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.360 
but let's go ahead and do this treasure
map

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
map

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.390 
map

this is the one you get and it took me a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.240 
this is the one you get and it took me a
bit<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.170> figure<00:00:19.439> out<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> coordination

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
bit to figure out the coordination

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.099 
bit to figure out the coordination
signle<00:00:20.550> at<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:20.880> bottom<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.390> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
signle at the very bottom are the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.420 
signle at the very bottom are the
coordination<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.769> are<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.070> main<00:00:23.220> map

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
coordination that are on the main map

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.890 
coordination that are on the main map
which<00:00:23.730> makes<00:00:23.970> me<00:00:24.119> feel<00:00:24.330> sort<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.750> an

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it March maybe right here that's where

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.060 
it March maybe right here that's where
the<00:00:52.500> coordination<00:00:52.890> sin<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:54.500> either<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.920> is

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the coordination sin so either this is

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.479 
the coordination sin so either this is
going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> zoom<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.570> zoom<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:58.489> pretty

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
going to be a zoom in or zoom out pretty

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.170 
going to be a zoom in or zoom out pretty

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
map then I'm pretty sure this little X

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.780 
map then I'm pretty sure this little X
right<00:01:23.880> here<00:01:24.560> marks<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> spot<00:01:25.920> even<00:01:26.549> though

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
right here marks the spot even though

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.380 
right here marks the spot even though
that's<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.119> coordinate<00:01:27.720> section<00:01:28.430> of<00:01:29.430> an<00:01:30.210> old

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
that's the coordinate section of an old

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.140 
that's the coordinate section of an old
tummy<00:01:30.630> map<00:01:31.040> so<00:01:32.040> happens<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> happens<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.060> on
