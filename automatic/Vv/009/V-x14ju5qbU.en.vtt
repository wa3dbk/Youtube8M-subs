00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
hello everybody I'm here with Alvin's on

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.150 
hello everybody I'm here with Alvin's on
the<00:00:03.000> sky<00:00:03.210> craft<00:00:03.480> creative<00:00:03.870> server<00:00:04.110> and<00:00:04.440> we

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
the sky craft creative server and we

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.190 
the sky craft creative server and we
want<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.549> show<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.000> world's<00:00:06.390> first<00:00:06.569> dark

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
want to show you the world's first dark

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290 
want to show you the world's first dark
oak<00:00:07.410> tree<00:00:07.680> form<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.220> returns<00:00:08.820> enough

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
oak tree form that returns enough

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.190 
oak tree form that returns enough
saplings<00:00:09.750> while<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.590> are<00:00:10.710> able<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.160> fully<00:00:11.400> afk

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
saplings while you are able to fully afk

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.910 
saplings while you are able to fully afk
so<00:00:13.940> first<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> want<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.240> talk<00:00:15.450> about<00:00:15.650> why<00:00:16.650> it's

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so first you want to talk about why it's

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.040 
so first you want to talk about why it's
very<00:00:17.340> hard<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.439> enough<00:00:19.439> saplings<00:00:19.890> back<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
very hard to get enough saplings back in

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.500 
very hard to get enough saplings back in
order<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.350> find<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.490> created<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
order to find out we created this

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.130 
order to find out we created this
structure<00:00:24.869> here<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.550> generate<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
structure here so we generate a lot of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
structure here so we generate a lot of
trees<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.619> top<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.920> each<00:00:29.039> other<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:32.090> you<00:00:33.090> get

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
trees on top of each other so you get

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.380 
trees on top of each other so you get
all<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.960> possible<00:00:34.579> offset<00:00:35.579> position<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
all the possible offset position of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.740 
all the possible offset position of the
trunk<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.649> all<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> leaves<00:00:38.750> yeah

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
trunk and you get all the leaves yeah

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.530 
trunk and you get all the leaves yeah
and<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.730> want<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> find<00:00:42.390> out

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and so we just want you to find out

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.049 
and so we just want you to find out
where<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> possible<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:44.070> Leafs<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.700> grow

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
where it's possible for Leafs to grow

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.930 
where it's possible for Leafs to grow
the<00:00:45.809> drop<00:00:45.989> challenge<00:00:46.410> from<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.829> leaf<00:00:47.280> block<00:00:47.550> is

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
the drop challenge from a leaf block is

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.810 
the drop challenge from a leaf block is
for<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> sapling<00:00:48.930> is<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.530> 20<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.670> total

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
for a sapling is one in 20 so in total

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.439 
for a sapling is one in 20 so in total
we<00:00:51.059> had<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> break<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.440> tea<00:00:52.860> leaf<00:00:53.100> blocks<00:00:53.460> winst

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
we had to break a tea leaf blocks winst

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.720 
we had to break a tea leaf blocks winst
it's<00:00:54.629> some<00:00:55.050> command<00:00:55.469> block<00:00:55.649> testing<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.219> he

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's some command block testing so he

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.790 
it's some command block testing so he
destroyed<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:58.020> Leafs<00:00:58.230> that<00:00:58.379> were<00:00:58.620> just

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
destroyed all the Leafs that were just

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.660 
destroyed all the Leafs that were just
just<00:00:59.780> created<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.289> tree<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> what<00:01:02.550> were

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
just created by a tree and what were

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.960 
just created by a tree and what were
their<00:01:02.730> results<00:01:03.510> means<00:01:03.949> um<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.460> average

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
their results means um we average

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
their results means um we average
between<00:01:06.240> 85<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.110> 90<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> 95<00:01:08.640> even<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.840> some

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
between 85 and 90 to 95 even in some

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.980 
between 85 and 90 to 95 even in some
cases<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.549> would<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.150> have<00:01:12.659> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
cases so that would mean that we have to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
cases so that would mean that we have to
break<00:01:13.850> almost<00:01:14.850> every<00:01:15.090> single<00:01:15.390> leaf<00:01:15.509> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
break almost every single leaf that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.070 
break almost every single leaf that
generates<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> normal<00:01:17.040> tree<00:01:18.799> yep

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.270 

so<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.920> final<00:01:23.130> result<00:01:24.170> was<00:01:25.170> this<00:01:25.380> here<00:01:25.620> this

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
so the final result was this here this

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.430 
so the final result was this here this
tree<00:01:26.640> stump<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.060> removed<00:01:27.570> all<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> Leafs<00:01:28.110> as

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
tree stump I removed all the Leafs as

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.130 
tree stump I removed all the Leafs as
you<00:01:29.190> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.760> generation<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> tree

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you can see the generation of the tree

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
you can see the generation of the tree
is<00:01:31.400> offset<00:01:32.540> in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.930> south<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.030> east

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
is offset in the south and east

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
is offset in the south and east
direction<00:01:36.800> no<00:01:38.240> branches<00:01:39.240> are<00:01:39.480> created<00:01:39.900> at

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
direction no branches are created at

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.510 
direction no branches are created at
this<00:01:40.230> height<00:01:43.100> that's<00:01:44.100> because<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.560> most

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
this height that's because the the most

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.680 
this height that's because the the most
important<00:01:48.920> sapling<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:50.610> yeah<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
important sapling is in the yeah the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.220 
important sapling is in the yeah the
most<00:01:51.870> negative<00:01:53.120> direction<00:01:54.120> it's<00:01:54.390> always<00:01:54.870> this

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
most negative direction it's always this

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.540 
most negative direction it's always this
year<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:56.340> dia<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.880> cannot<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.420> offset<00:01:57.780> by<00:01:57.810> -<00:01:58.550> and

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
year so dia it cannot be offset by - and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.270 
year so dia it cannot be offset by - and
yeah<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.210> get<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.600> structure<00:02:00.900> here<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
yeah you get this structure here and the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.330 
yeah you get this structure here and the
Leafs<00:02:02.550> could<00:02:02.970> generate<00:02:03.570> up<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.620> four<00:02:05.010> blocks

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
Leafs could generate up to four blocks

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.690 
Leafs could generate up to four blocks
away<00:02:05.490> from<00:02:06.000> this<00:02:06.660> trunk<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.230> yeah<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.250> we

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
away from this trunk here yeah and we

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.370 
away from this trunk here yeah and we
really<00:02:08.910> had<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.090> get<00:02:09.330> all<00:02:09.540> of<00:02:09.720> those<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.170> can

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
really had to get all of those you can

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.810 
really had to get all of those you can
generate<00:02:10.920> in<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.910> area<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.720> over<00:02:13.590> here<00:02:14.280> it's

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
generate in this area and over here it's

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.790 
generate in this area and over here it's
three<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> top<00:02:16.770> it's<00:02:17.040> also<00:02:17.220> layer<00:02:17.610> so

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
three and on the top it's also layer so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:24.110 
three and on the top it's also layer so
yeah<00:02:19.800> that's<00:02:20.670> quite<00:02:21.240> a<00:02:21.390> task<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.320> had<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.560> do<00:02:23.120> -

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
yeah that's quite a task we had to do -

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.490 
yeah that's quite a task we had to do -
yeah<00:02:24.720> break<00:02:25.230> all<00:02:25.410> those<00:02:25.680> leaves<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.570> here<00:02:27.570> you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
yeah break all those leaves and here you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.800 
yeah break all those leaves and here you
managed<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:29.459> already<00:02:30.420> has<00:02:30.600> all

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
managed to do it and already has all

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.830 
managed to do it and already has all
final<00:02:31.200> form<00:02:33.950> okay<00:02:34.950> let<00:02:35.790> me<00:02:35.940> just<00:02:35.970> fly<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.540> from

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
final form okay let me just fly in from

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.199 
final form okay let me just fly in from
the<00:02:36.959> top<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.370> I'll<00:02:38.370> show<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:38.670> all<00:02:38.820> the

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
the top and I'll show you all the

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.060 
the top and I'll show you all the
craziness<00:02:39.570> that's<00:02:39.840> happening<00:02:40.320> in<00:02:40.410> there<00:02:43.070> yeah

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
craziness that's happening in there yeah

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.540 
craziness that's happening in there yeah
so<00:02:44.489> we<00:02:44.910> got<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.120> full<00:02:45.420> wall<00:02:45.690> of<00:02:46.130> triple<00:02:47.130> piston

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
so we got a full wall of triple piston

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.630 
so we got a full wall of triple piston
extenders<00:02:48.060> still<00:02:48.959> slime<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.770> lapis<00:02:50.340> blocks

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
extenders still slime and lapis blocks

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.340 
extenders still slime and lapis blocks
on<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> side<00:02:52.910> we<00:02:53.910> even<00:02:54.090> got<00:02:54.300> pissed<00:02:54.810> extenders

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
on the side we even got pissed extenders

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.820 
on the side we even got pissed extenders
from<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> bottom<00:02:55.950> and<00:02:57.080> a<00:02:58.080> lot<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.290> piston

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
from the bottom and a lot of piston

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830 
from the bottom and a lot of piston
extender<00:02:59.190> from<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.580> top<00:02:59.790> we<00:03:00.270> got<00:03:00.390> four

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
extender from the top we got four

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.220 
extender from the top we got four
quintuple<00:03:01.680> piston<00:03:02.010> extenders<00:03:02.959> one<00:03:03.959> on<00:03:04.080> each

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
quintuple piston extenders one on each

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.949 
quintuple piston extenders one on each
side<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.890> to<00:03:05.550> quadruple<00:03:05.760> piston<00:03:06.390> extenders

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
side and to quadruple piston extenders

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.030 
side and to quadruple piston extenders
to<00:03:07.200> break<00:03:08.130> those<00:03:08.340> offset<00:03:08.850> Leafs<00:03:09.170> so<00:03:10.170> we<00:03:10.709> break

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
to break those offset Leafs so we break

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640 
to break those offset Leafs so we break
leaves<00:03:11.550> from<00:03:11.940> all<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.600> six<00:03:12.840> directions<00:03:13.020> that

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
leaves from all the six directions that

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.440 
leaves from all the six directions that
is<00:03:13.770> possible<00:03:14.420> yep<00:03:15.420> so<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.920> guess<00:03:17.520> it's<00:03:17.850> time<00:03:18.150> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
is possible yep so I guess it's time to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.480 
is possible yep so I guess it's time to
see<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> farm<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.050> action

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
see the farm in action

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.690 
see the farm in action
I<00:03:21.200> made<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> command<00:03:22.680> block<00:03:22.860> singie<00:03:23.400> that

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
I made a command block singie that

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.570 
I made a command block singie that
plants<00:03:24.210> the<00:03:24.480> sapling<00:03:24.870> for<00:03:25.470> for<00:03:25.710> us<00:03:25.860> just<00:03:26.220> for

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
plants the sapling for for us just for

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:38.839 
plants the sapling for for us just for
convenience<00:03:27.060> and<00:03:28.100> demonstration<00:03:29.100> purposes

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.480 

okay

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.310 

you<00:03:43.970> can<00:03:44.120> see<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.390> regenerated<00:03:45.170> first<00:03:45.950> the

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
you can see it regenerated first the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.840 
you can see it regenerated first the
fist<00:03:48.320> excited<00:03:48.740> from<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:49.040> wall<00:03:49.190> for<00:03:49.610> the<00:03:49.670> site

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
fist excited from the wall for the site

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.980 
fist excited from the wall for the site
get<00:03:50.470> extended<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:52.400> quintuplets<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.390> then

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
get extended the quintuplets and then

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.110 
get extended the quintuplets and then
the<00:03:54.080> quadruplets<00:03:54.410> also<00:03:55.400> go<00:03:55.550> out<00:03:55.670> single

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
the quadruplets also go out single

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.870 
the quadruplets also go out single
piston<00:03:56.420> extenders<00:03:56.870> from<00:03:57.050> the<00:03:57.140> top<00:03:57.320> and<00:03:57.880> even

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
piston extenders from the top and even

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.580 
piston extenders from the top and even
some<00:03:59.150> double<00:03:59.510> piston<00:03:59.660> extend<00:04:00.080> from<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.320> top

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
some double piston extend from the top

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.570 
some double piston extend from the top
to<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:01.730> those<00:04:02.030> corner<00:04:02.720> blocks<00:04:04.870> yep<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:06.770> cycle

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
to get those corner blocks yep a cycle

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.660 
to get those corner blocks yep a cycle
is<00:04:07.700> about<00:04:08.000> 14<00:04:08.600> seconds<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.950> it<00:04:10.070> takes<00:04:10.250> 40

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
is about 14 seconds so it takes 40

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.810 
is about 14 seconds so it takes 40
seconds<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.840> fully<00:04:12.110> harvest<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.740> tree<00:04:12.920> also

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
seconds to fully harvest the tree also

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.970 
seconds to fully harvest the tree also
because<00:04:14.390> we<00:04:14.540> had<00:04:14.690> to<00:04:14.900> limit<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.500> tree<00:04:15.740> height

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
because we had to limit the tree height

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:22.510 
because we had to limit the tree height
to<00:04:16.850> 7<00:04:17.239> we<00:04:17.600> can<00:04:17.630> only<00:04:17.959> get<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.350> lowest<00:04:19.299> 3<00:04:21.520> three

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
to 7 we can only get the lowest 3 three

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.030 
to 7 we can only get the lowest 3 three
layers<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.270> locks<00:04:23.600> because<00:04:24.380> we<00:04:24.590> need<00:04:24.710> every

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
layers of locks because we need every

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.610 
layers of locks because we need every
single<00:04:25.250> leaf<00:04:25.550> blocks<00:04:25.850> so<00:04:26.210> we<00:04:26.660> only<00:04:26.810> able<00:04:27.470> to

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
single leaf blocks so we only able to

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.460 
single leaf blocks so we only able to
push<00:04:27.800> out<00:04:27.950> those<00:04:28.190> lowest<00:04:29.090> three<00:04:29.930> layers<00:04:31.270> okay

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
push out those lowest three layers okay

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.860 
push out those lowest three layers okay
yeah<00:04:33.470> and<00:04:33.830> yeah<00:04:34.550> we<00:04:34.700> got<00:04:34.820> a<00:04:34.850> little<00:04:35.180> setup<00:04:35.600> for

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
yeah and yeah we got a little setup for

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.840 
yeah and yeah we got a little setup for
those<00:04:36.020> locks<00:04:36.290> they<00:04:36.800> pushed<00:04:37.130> out<00:04:37.340> to<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.610> side

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
those locks they pushed out to the side

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.560 
those locks they pushed out to the side
and<00:04:38.840> further<00:04:39.710> pushed<00:04:39.980> along<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:40.540> into<00:04:41.540> a

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
and further pushed along and into a

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.950 
and further pushed along and into a
bedrock<00:04:42.520> with<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.550> cage<00:04:43.820> you<00:04:44.150> could<00:04:44.390> also<00:04:44.630> use<00:04:44.930> a

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
bedrock with a cage you could also use a

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.750 
bedrock with a cage you could also use a
end<00:04:45.200> portal<00:04:45.500> for<00:04:45.680> that<00:04:45.800> yeah<00:04:46.370> and<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:46.670> to

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
end portal for that yeah and just to

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.910 
end portal for that yeah and just to
break<00:04:47.000> those<00:04:49.960> okay<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.170> guess<00:04:51.410> I'll<00:04:51.590> let<00:04:51.680> the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920 
break those okay I guess I'll let the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.800 
break those okay I guess I'll let the
farm<00:04:52.580> run<00:04:53.240> for<00:04:53.450> a<00:04:53.480> while

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
farm run for a while

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.850 
farm run for a while
and<00:04:53.900> then<00:04:54.230> let's<00:04:54.770> see<00:04:55.010> the<00:04:55.390> results<00:04:56.390> for<00:04:56.930> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
and then let's see the results for the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.260 
and then let's see the results for the
sapling<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.280> operates

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:08.570 

you

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:19.660 
and back again let's stop the forum and

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.800 
and back again let's stop the forum and
see<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.780> test<00:05:20.990> results<00:05:21.669> so<00:05:22.669> are<00:05:23.180> you<00:05:23.479> here<00:05:23.750> for

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
see the test results so are you here for

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.260 
see the test results so are you here for
just<00:05:24.199> a<00:05:24.349> simple<00:05:24.889> dropper<00:05:25.220> that<00:05:25.250> shoots<00:05:25.699> item

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
just a simple dropper that shoots item

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.379 
just a simple dropper that shoots item
in<00:05:26.419> those<00:05:26.539> chests<00:05:26.840> that<00:05:27.199> gets<00:05:28.159> activated<00:05:29.120> each

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
in those chests that gets activated each

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.879 
in those chests that gets activated each
time<00:05:29.690> yeah<00:05:30.650> a<00:05:30.889> tree<00:05:31.460> generates<00:05:31.909> so<00:05:32.780> we<00:05:33.080> had<00:05:33.259> 15

whatever got to mention is why we

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.990 
whatever got to mention is why we
limited<00:05:50.060> tree<00:05:50.539> high<00:05:50.720> to<00:05:50.780> 7<00:05:51.349> yes<00:05:52.130> just<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.669> force

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
limited tree high to 7 yes just to force

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.980 
limited tree high to 7 yes just to force
the<00:05:53.710> leaf<00:05:54.710> generation<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.669> this<00:05:55.819> area<00:05:56.150> so

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
the leaf generation in this area so

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.570 
the leaf generation in this area so
that's<00:05:57.500> mainly<00:05:57.770> why<00:05:58.550> we<00:05:58.960> limit<00:05:59.960> a<00:06:00.020> tree<00:06:00.199> height

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
that's mainly why we limit a tree height

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.670 
that's mainly why we limit a tree height
