00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.970
 hi everyone how is 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:12.090
 I hope you had an excellent 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.000
 beginning of university school year 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.240
 work of whatever they do not feel much 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.789
 a lot of time I know but I have a 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:25.290
 good excuse that it was that I needed so 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.110
 as a time of rest so I'm 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.410
 I escaped for a while to the beach and came back and 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:34.020
 today I entered classes again and I have 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.480
 been very busy with these things and the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.519
 truth is that yes I have left well thrown 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.899
 to the channel but I pretend not to go back to 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:45.300
 do it hopefully and let's hope so 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 so as not to leave it so abandoned, I have 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.620
 a proposal will make videos 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.239
 cortitos where shows outfits of the day 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.850
 as well as complimenting things 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.230
 what are we doing that will make 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.780
 you tell me if you like it 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.970
 and they give me their opinion and all the big ones 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.320
 he says he had to give it to see 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.210
 Facebook 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.450
 so I'm going to leave you somewhere 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:13.690
 in the information box the facebook 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.060
 so they can like me and so 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.180
 let's interact much easier so 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 It is that I leave with the outfit of the day 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.310
 ah 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.310
 I had forgotten to thank everyone 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.860
 you new ones that have come together are almost 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.780
 100 and also the support in the environment 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.780
 they are useless if I'm not mistaken
