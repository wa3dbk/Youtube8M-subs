00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.660
 I remember my name which is fear you think that name is a 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.170
 shit 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.850
 well I wanted to tell you that I think the same 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.140
 Today I come to speak to you of a recognized company which has all my sincere 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.000
 respects 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.749
 for kids entertainement 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:18.289
 I based myself on wikipedia plus my opinions to make this documentary 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.310
 good akiba 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.480
 for kids entertainement is a television and film production company 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.800
 American company specialized in acquiring production and licensing 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 entertainment for children around the world 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.879
 The company is well known for its wide range of television licenses between 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.020
 those that include the multimillionaire franchises of pokémon and yu-gi-oh 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.370
 many of their licenses come in English dubbed from Japanese anime 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.300
 including series like fighting fire don soda keeps 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.280
 while others are western or proprietary animations like inc's 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.660
 club 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 which is a real shit 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.050
 good walking in the wikipedia I found something interesting about this respectable 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.790
 company 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.690
 an article which had the title of criticism and controversy 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.240
 which said the address of 4 kids entertainment has stated that they are looking 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.250
 unanimous opinion so that children in English-speaking countries can 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.590
 we understand judging that such location is necessary for 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.960
 these titles are marketable 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.869
 Hahaha 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.100
 I do not know what the hell is going on in that country 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.890
 maybe the gringos do not have enough brain to understand a 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.120
 cartoon 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.240
 I continue 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.600
 for many titles 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.470
 the categorization that four kits make goes into a few broad 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.729
 categories four kits should seek to Americanize a program by changing the 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.120
 dialogue music 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.950
 food or stereotypes that would be unfamiliar an offensive 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.930
 God, this started to piss off, it's necessary to get the fucking open. 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.479
 binks 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.310
 what a whore has that to do 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.700
 and this other shit that is offensive to Americans hahahahahaha 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.420
 I do not see anything offensive 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.680
 the Japanese culture is far above the American whore mother stop 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.460
 fuck up do not allow to see Japanese food 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.260
 in my opinion the gringos live in a bubble 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.600
 they do not know other shit than their idiotic culture which is a 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.009
 shit of indonesian boar 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.429
 they can also remove some materially suggestive objects like figa rosso 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.619
 weapons religious symbols or content considered too violent or 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:22.209
 sexually suggestive for children 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.060
 for example 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.049
 in mugello 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.930
 the problem of death is avoided in the localized version with characters 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.619
 dead that are sent to the realm of the shadow 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:34.979
 other examples include the elimination in many cases of violence in one 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.289
 piece and the elimination of several episodes of why not 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:41.919
 motherfuckers sons of bitches that putísima mother failed for a 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:45.389
 flying rhino I have to say more to download 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:49.229
 these gringos believe it to be very sensitive as if they had never seen 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:53.099
 someone smoking and the guns or talk because I think it's something 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.450
 every day over there 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.550
 the religious symbols ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha what a laugh that gives me this 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.890
 I do not know why they censor him 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.830
 it really does not make sense if after all the children do not understand who 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.249
 fuck is god 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:08.969
 and this thing that is violent ha ha sure very violent but if the 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.139
 The Yankees' personality is the most violent they have been 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.959
 promoting the war in iraq since the last centuries and call the anime 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.379
 violent ha ha ha ha ha that laugh that gives me 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.799
 but cher what is this sexually suggestive for children the truth only the 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.169
 slow exile and they look like that but not even success should be 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:26.930
 censored 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.839
 Diosque shit company 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.169
 well I want to summarize in a few words the company 4kids entertainment 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:38.649
 Well I'm going to start talking so by the way I'm going to ask a friend gringo 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:42.179
 tacu that hates your country that makes a picket in front of the headquarters of this 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.379
