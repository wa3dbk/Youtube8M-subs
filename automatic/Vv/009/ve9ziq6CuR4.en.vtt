00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
we're gonna go to scene setup and then

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're gonna go to scene setup and then
you're<00:00:15.660> gonna<00:00:15.750> go<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.990> your<00:00:16.139> starter<00:00:16.619> pack<00:00:16.859> and

you're gonna go to your starter pack and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.450 
you're gonna go to your starter pack and
you're<00:00:17.880> gonna<00:00:18.029> look<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.900> ball<00:00:19.680> fracture

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you're gonna look for a ball fracture

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.870 
you're gonna look for a ball fracture
and<00:00:21.650> you<00:00:22.650> can<00:00:22.800> pull<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> or<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> preset<00:00:23.550> you<00:00:23.670> want

I use your eye for the video I'd used I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.830 
I use your eye for the video I'd used I
use<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:30.289> wet<00:00:31.289> lizard<00:00:31.910> it's<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.120> pro<00:00:33.360> shader<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
use the wet lizard it's a pro shader so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.180 
use the wet lizard it's a pro shader so
if<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.989> got<00:00:34.079> pro<00:00:34.290> skaters<00:00:34.620> that's<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> one<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
if you got pro skaters that's the one I

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.680 
if you got pro skaters that's the one I
used<00:00:35.430> for<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> video<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:38.390> we're<00:00:39.390> gonna<00:00:39.510> make

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
used for the video and we're gonna make

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.110 
used for the video and we're gonna make
a<00:00:39.750> new<00:00:39.930> solid<00:00:40.230> change<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> color<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:42.059> is

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
a new solid change the color this is

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
a new solid change the color this is
gonna<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.570> Bragg<00:00:43.520> background<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
gonna be the Bragg background just to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.189 
gonna be the Bragg background just to
have<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.340> set<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.680> make<00:00:49.680> another<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.340> and

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
have it set and make another one and

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:53.680 
have it set and make another one and
make<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.320> one<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> little<00:00:52.710> bit<00:00:52.920> darker<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
make this one a little bit darker a

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.270 
make this one a little bit darker a
darker<00:00:54.690> green<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.289> match<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> wet<00:00:55.829> lizard

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
darker green to match the wet lizard

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.250 
darker green to match the wet lizard
color<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.170> then<00:00:58.170> I'm<00:00:58.289> gonna<00:00:58.440> put<00:00:58.649> a<00:01:00.260> ellipse

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
color and then I'm gonna put a ellipse

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
color and then I'm gonna put a ellipse
tool<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.840> then<00:01:03.840> I'll<00:01:03.989> feather<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.820> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
tool and then I'll feather that out you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.700 
tool and then I'll feather that out you
got<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> press<00:01:06.180> f<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> feather<00:01:06.840> feather<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
got to press f to feather feather the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.890 
got to press f to feather feather the
mask<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.430> that<00:01:09.090> gives<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.570> little

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
mask and that gives you this little

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.370 
mask and that gives you this little
vignette<00:01:10.140> effect<00:01:11.000> pretty<00:01:12.000> simple<00:01:15.170> move<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
vignette effect pretty simple move that

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.260 
vignette effect pretty simple move that
around<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.880> now<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.900> am<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.810> go<00:01:21.810> into

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
around and now I am going to go into

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.100 
around and now I am going to go into
element<00:01:24.270> real<00:01:24.450> quick<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:26.659> I<00:01:27.659> keep<00:01:27.900> forgetting

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
element real quick and I keep forgetting

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.380 
element real quick and I keep forgetting
where<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> but<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.759> under<00:01:30.119> your

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
where this is that but it's under your

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.280 
where this is that but it's under your
group<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.930> settings<00:01:32.689> as<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.960> see<00:01:34.140> I'm

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
group one settings as you can see I'm

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.830 
group one settings as you can see I'm
looking<00:01:34.500> for<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:34.970> it's<00:01:35.970> under<00:01:36.180> particle<00:01:36.689> look

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
looking for it it's under particle look

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.420 
looking for it it's under particle look
and<00:01:36.990> it's<00:01:37.110> called<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.380> multi<00:01:37.710> object<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
and it's called a multi object and

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.859 
and it's called a multi object and
you're<00:01:38.549> gonna<00:01:38.670> want<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> enable<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:41.869> in

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
you're gonna want to enable that and in

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
you're gonna want to enable that and in
order<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.530> pieces<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.310> ball

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
order for the pieces and the ball

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670 
order for the pieces and the ball
fracture<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.329> shown<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> displace

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fracture to be shown you got a displace

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.520 
fracture to be shown you got a displace
you<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.070> enable<00:01:47.640> them<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.689> multi<00:01:49.049> object

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
you got to enable them the multi object

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.020 
you got to enable them the multi object
and<00:01:49.710> then<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.430> displace<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:52.700> so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
and then you got to displace that so

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.070 
and then you got to displace that so
we're<00:01:56.030> gonna

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.070 

click<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.890> little<00:02:00.010> stopwatch<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.810> we<00:02:01.930> can

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
click the little stopwatch so we can

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.950 
click the little stopwatch so we can
have<00:02:02.200> some<00:02:02.380> keyframes<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.840> we're<00:02:04.840> gonna

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
have some keyframes and we're gonna

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.530 
have some keyframes and we're gonna
start<00:02:05.260> at<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.410> zero<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:06.150> move<00:02:07.150> up<00:02:07.270> a<00:02:07.360> couple

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
start at the zero and move up a couple

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.080 
start at the zero and move up a couple
seconds<00:02:07.990> and<00:02:08.170> you're<00:02:08.590> just<00:02:08.710> gonna<00:02:09.090> displace

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
seconds and you're just gonna displace

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.650 
seconds and you're just gonna displace
it<00:02:10.300> as<00:02:10.420> much<00:02:10.630> as<00:02:10.780> you<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:12.000> looks<00:02:13.000> good<00:02:13.240> so

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
it as much as you think looks good so

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.860 
it as much as you think looks good so
then<00:02:13.960> we<00:02:14.050> script<00:02:14.380> through<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> as<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.190> see

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
then we script through it as you can see

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.380 
then we script through it as you can see
pretty<00:02:16.870> simple<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.310> now<00:02:18.700> we're<00:02:18.880> gonna<00:02:19.000> create

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
pretty simple and now we're gonna create

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.190 
pretty simple and now we're gonna create
a<00:02:19.750> camera<00:02:20.580> ID<00:02:21.600> it<00:02:22.600> doesn't<00:02:22.840> really<00:02:22.960> matter

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
a camera ID it doesn't really matter

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.410 
a camera ID it doesn't really matter
what<00:02:23.440> you<00:02:23.590> put<00:02:23.800> I<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:24.580> usually<00:02:25.000> keep<00:02:25.210> it<00:02:25.300> at

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
what you put I just usually keep it at

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.410 
what you put I just usually keep it at
50<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.050> can<00:02:26.110> change<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:27.040> can<00:02:27.910> also<00:02:28.060> put

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
50 you can change it up you can also put

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.130 
50 you can change it up you can also put
a<00:02:29.190> depth<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.340> field<00:02:30.520> on<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.850> but<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
a depth of field on it but for the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.510 
a depth of field on it but for the
purpose<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:32.650> video<00:02:32.890> we're<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.400> gonna

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
purpose of this video we're just gonna

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.750 
purpose of this video we're just gonna
do<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.820> real<00:02:33.970> quick<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:38.050> usually<00:02:38.170> just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
do it real quick and I usually just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.720 
do it real quick and I usually just
keyframe<00:02:39.760> everything<00:02:40.180> just<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.140> case<00:02:41.730> usually

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
keyframe everything just in case usually

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.460 
keyframe everything just in case usually
something<00:02:43.180> messes<00:02:43.630> up<00:02:43.840> on<00:02:44.380> my<00:02:44.560> camera<00:02:45.870> and

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.650 

we're<00:02:50.470> gonna<00:02:50.560> scrub<00:02:51.100> through<00:02:51.370> it<00:02:51.490> again<00:02:51.940> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
we're gonna scrub through it again to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.940 
we're gonna scrub through it again to
where<00:02:52.870> I<00:02:52.900> wanted<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:55.750> camera<00:02:56.200> or

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
where I wanted to have the camera or

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.509 
where I wanted to have the camera or
read<00:02:57.610> through<00:02:57.910> the<00:03:00.060> knee<00:03:01.060> fractured<00:03:01.600> pieces

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
read through the knee fractured pieces

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.470 
read through the knee fractured pieces
so<00:03:03.519> right<00:03:03.640> now<00:03:03.730> I'm<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:03.910> looking<00:03:04.060> for<00:03:04.390> the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
so right now I'm just looking for the

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.060 
so right now I'm just looking for the
right<00:03:04.630> spot<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:07.290> where<00:03:08.290> I<00:03:08.320> want<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.739> camera<00:03:09.040> to

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
right spot to where I want the camera to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.910 
right spot to where I want the camera to
move<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:11.230> for<00:03:11.350> some<00:03:11.470> reason<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.800> wasn't

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
move to and for some reason it wasn't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.870 
move to and for some reason it wasn't
letting<00:03:12.250> me<00:03:12.370> click<00:03:12.670> again<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:14.430> change<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.700> so

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
letting me click again to change it so

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.210 
letting me click again to change it so
that<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.780> change<00:03:17.110> the<00:03:17.260> orbital<00:03:17.620> move<00:03:18.010> it<00:03:18.100> around

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
that I change the orbital move it around

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:24.470 
that I change the orbital move it around
a<00:03:18.430> little<00:03:18.519> bit<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:18.970> then<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.340> want<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.959> go<00:03:23.190> into

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
a little bit and then I want to go into

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.740 
a little bit and then I want to go into
the<00:03:25.480> Z<00:03:25.690> Z<00:03:26.260> depth<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:28.060> let<00:03:28.510> me<00:03:30.120> move<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.570> little

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
the Z Z depth so let me move it a little

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.740 
the Z Z depth so let me move it a little
bit<00:03:32.019> in

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.710 

that<00:03:35.260> seems<00:03:35.500> good<00:03:35.650> right<00:03:35.920> there<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:37.510> you<00:03:37.570> can

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
that seems good right there so you can

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.550 
that seems good right there so you can
see<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.080> camera<00:03:38.410> Kanna<00:03:39.630> goes<00:03:40.630> into<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
see the camera Kanna goes into the

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.730 
see the camera Kanna goes into the
object<00:03:42.370> then<00:03:42.520> you<00:03:42.610> can<00:03:42.760> see<00:03:42.910> kind<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.560> at<00:03:44.560> the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:44.740 
object then you can see kind of at the

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.570 
object then you can see kind of at the
end<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.100> doesn't<00:03:45.370> really<00:03:45.460> do<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.790> good<00:03:46.030> job<00:03:46.090> but

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
end it doesn't really do a good job but

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.110 
end it doesn't really do a good job but
we're<00:03:48.580> just<00:03:48.610> doing<00:03:48.940> a<00:03:49.390> really<00:03:49.900> quick<00:03:50.760> video<00:03:51.760> to

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
we're just doing a really quick video to

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.860 
we're just doing a really quick video to
show<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.330> how<00:03:52.450> easy<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:52.959> effect<00:03:53.709> is<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.720> now

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
show you how easy this effect is and now

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.930 
show you how easy this effect is and now
we're<00:03:56.140> gonna<00:03:56.230> do<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:57.660> new<00:03:58.660> solid<00:03:59.760> we're<00:04:00.760> gonna

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
we're gonna do a new solid we're gonna

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.710 
we're gonna do a new solid we're gonna
put<00:04:01.240> a<00:04:01.270> lens<00:04:01.600> flare<00:04:01.900> just<00:04:02.230> to<00:04:02.410> give<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.680> that

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
put a lens flare just to give it that

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.060 
put a lens flare just to give it that
you<00:04:04.720> know<00:04:04.890> that<00:04:06.450> pop<00:04:07.450> and<00:04:08.350> usually<00:04:08.709> I<00:04:08.739> try<00:04:08.830> to

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
you know that pop and usually I try to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.120 
you know that pop and usually I try to
look<00:04:09.280> for<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.640> lens<00:04:10.239> flare<00:04:10.450> that<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:11.590> already

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
look for a lens flare that is already

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.370 
look for a lens flare that is already
the<00:04:12.880> same<00:04:13.150> color<00:04:13.450> as<00:04:15.480> everything<00:04:16.480> else<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.079> the

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
the same color as everything else so the

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.340 
the same color as everything else so the
main<00:04:17.650> color<00:04:17.859> here<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.220> green<00:04:18.579> so<00:04:19.019> I'm<00:04:20.019> looking

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
main color here is green so I'm looking

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.320 
main color here is green so I'm looking
for<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> green<00:04:20.950> lens<00:04:21.220> flare<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.910> let<00:04:25.060> me<00:04:25.150> go<00:04:25.270> to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
for a green lens flare so let me go to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.440 
for a green lens flare so let me go to
motion<00:04:25.600> graphics<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:27.090> let<00:04:28.090> me<00:04:28.180> get<00:04:28.330> this

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
motion graphics and let me get this

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.560 
motion graphics and let me get this
green<00:04:28.750> goblin<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.620> seems<00:04:29.919> good<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:31.419> know

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
green goblin that seems good you know

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.420 
green goblin that seems good you know
set<00:04:32.020> it<00:04:32.110> to<00:04:32.230> add<00:04:34.410> and<00:04:35.410> then<00:04:35.680> just<00:04:35.980> move<00:04:36.280> it

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
set it to add and then just move it

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:46.900 
set it to add and then just move it
around<00:04:38.040> make<00:04:39.040> it<00:04:39.190> looks<00:04:39.370> somewhat<00:04:40.210> decent

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.200 

and<00:04:47.450> now<00:04:47.720> I'm<00:04:47.990> going<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.590> do<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.210> adjusment

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
and now I'm going to do a adjusment

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.680 
and now I'm going to do a adjusment
layer<00:04:50.240> a<00:04:51.610> color<00:04:52.610> correction<00:04:53.390> and<00:04:54.220> a<00:04:55.220> curves

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
layer a color correction and a curves

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.820 
layer a color correction and a curves
just<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.900> give<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.200> a<00:04:57.350> little<00:04:57.470> bit<00:04:57.680> more

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
just to give it a little bit more

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.640 
just to give it a little bit more
darkness

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.969 

and<00:05:04.190> that's<00:05:04.340> basically<00:05:04.639> guys<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.240> mean<00:05:05.979> that's

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
and that's basically guys I mean that's

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.810 
and that's basically guys I mean that's
just<00:05:07.340> the<00:05:07.490> basics<00:05:07.880> of<00:05:08.000> it<00:05:08.180> you<00:05:08.419> can<00:05:09.190> you<00:05:10.190> can<00:05:10.400> do

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
just the basics of it you can you can do

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.310 
just the basics of it you can you can do
a<00:05:10.850> little<00:05:11.060> bit<00:05:11.210> more<00:05:11.270> fine-tuning<00:05:11.930> like<00:05:12.260> I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
a little bit more fine-tuning like I

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.070 
a little bit more fine-tuning like I
said<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.650> can<00:05:12.800> add<00:05:13.100> a<00:05:13.430> depth<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.449> field<00:05:14.690> to

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
said you can add a depth of field to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.770 
said you can add a depth of field to
make<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.090> can<00:05:17.210> make<00:05:17.360> some<00:05:17.600> of<00:05:17.720> the

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
make it so you can make some of the

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.740 
make it so you can make some of the
pieces<00:05:17.990> look<00:05:18.380> closer<00:05:18.889> some<00:05:19.430> of<00:05:19.550> them<00:05:19.669> in<00:05:20.180> the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
pieces look closer some of them in the

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.290 
pieces look closer some of them in the
background<00:05:20.960> look<00:05:21.380> more<00:05:21.620> blurry<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:23.030> really

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
background look more blurry it's really

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.530 
background look more blurry it's really
up<00:05:23.419> to<00:05:23.449> you<00:05:23.949> also<00:05:24.949> move<00:05:25.490> the<00:05:25.669> camera<00:05:26.060> attract

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
up to you also move the camera attract

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.340 
up to you also move the camera attract
the<00:05:26.690> camera<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:27.590> can<00:05:28.630> zoom<00:05:29.630> in<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:29.960> certain

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
the camera so you can zoom in on certain

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.110 
the camera so you can zoom in on certain
pieces<00:05:30.590> that's<00:05:31.400> just<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.610> little<00:05:31.850> preview

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
pieces that's just a little preview

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.029 
pieces that's just a little preview
right<00:05:32.449> there<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.900> little<00:05:33.560> quick<00:05:33.710> render<00:05:34.810> and

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
right there a little quick render and

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.080 
right there a little quick render and
I'm<00:05:37.039> gonna<00:05:37.160> keep<00:05:37.310> rendering<00:05:37.729> out<00:05:37.850> while<00:05:38.060> I

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:38.090 
I'm gonna keep rendering out while I

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:40.659 
I'm gonna keep rendering out while I
talk<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.860> can<00:05:40.010> like<00:05:40.190> I<00:05:40.280> said<00:05:40.310> you<00:05:40.520> can

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
talk so you can like I said you can

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.060 
talk so you can like I said you can
enable<00:05:40.880> depth<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.360> field<00:05:41.570> to<00:05:41.810> make<00:05:42.080> certain

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
enable depth of field to make certain

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.770 
enable depth of field to make certain
things<00:05:43.280> look<00:05:43.550> more<00:05:43.789> blurry<00:05:44.120> in<00:05:44.600> the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
things look more blurry in the

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.750 
things look more blurry in the
background<00:05:45.229> or<00:05:45.470> up<00:05:45.919> in<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.699> foreground<00:05:47.380> you

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
background or up in the foreground you

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.100 
background or up in the foreground you
also<00:05:49.760> want<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.060> experiment<00:05:50.419> with<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.780> camera

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
also want to experiment with the camera

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.560 
also want to experiment with the camera
positioning<00:05:51.680> and<00:05:53.320> how<00:05:54.320> deep<00:05:54.590> it<00:05:54.800> goes<00:05:54.830> in<00:05:55.250> to

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
positioning and how deep it goes in to

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.800 
positioning and how deep it goes in to
see<00:05:56.570> space<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.380> whatever<00:05:58.360> orbit<00:05:59.360> around<00:05:59.449> the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
see space and whatever orbit around the

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.930 
see space and whatever orbit around the
object<00:06:00.199> if<00:06:00.320> you<00:06:00.470> want<00:06:00.620> to<00:06:00.770> and<00:06:01.430> this<00:06:01.639> this

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
object if you want to and this this

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.990 
object if you want to and this this
effect<00:06:02.300> I<00:06:02.539> mean<00:06:02.780> you<00:06:02.840> can<00:06:02.990> use<00:06:03.169> whatever

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
effect I mean you can use whatever

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.870 
effect I mean you can use whatever
shader<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:05.120> want<00:06:05.590> I<00:06:06.590> would<00:06:07.100> probably<00:06:07.310> use<00:06:07.520> the

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
shader you want I would probably use the

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.279 
shader you want I would probably use the
ice<00:06:08.500> like<00:06:09.500> a<00:06:09.530> nice<00:06:09.770> color<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:11.110> know<00:06:12.110> there's

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:12.289 
ice like a nice color I know there's

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:15.120 
ice like a nice color I know there's
some<00:06:12.440> pro<00:06:12.650> shaders<00:06:13.010> in<00:06:13.340> there<00:06:13.550> that<00:06:14.030> are

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
some pro shaders in there that are

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.300 
some pro shaders in there that are
icicle<00:06:16.130> ice<00:06:16.639> or<00:06:17.090> whatever<00:06:17.180> in<00:06:17.539> frost<00:06:18.190> you<00:06:19.190> know

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
icicle ice or whatever in frost you know

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:25.540 
icicle ice or whatever in frost you know
but<00:06:19.970> for<00:06:20.270> some<00:06:20.510> reason<00:06:21.020> I<00:06:21.110> use<00:06:21.289> the<00:06:24.550> what

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 
but for some reason I use the what

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.640 
but for some reason I use the what
lizard<00:06:25.910> but<00:06:26.660> anyways<00:06:26.900> guys<00:06:26.930> thanks<00:06:27.620> for

watching and that was just a quick
little<00:06:29.270> video<00:06:29.360> of<00:06:29.750> how<00:06:30.650> I<00:06:30.680> did<00:06:30.860> this<00:06:31.160> affect

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
little video of how I did this affect

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.390 
little video of how I did this affect
hopefully<00:06:33.020> y'all<00:06:33.650> can<00:06:33.800> do<00:06:33.889> it<00:06:34.010> that's<00:06:34.190> pretty

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
hopefully y'all can do it that's pretty

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.529 
hopefully y'all can do it that's pretty
easy<00:06:34.460> I<00:06:34.789> mean<00:06:35.030> nothing<00:06:35.630> to<00:06:35.810> it<00:06:35.930> is<00:06:36.020> y'all<00:06:36.199> so
