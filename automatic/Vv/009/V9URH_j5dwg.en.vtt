00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.730
 good all the time we continue the cycle 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.820
 clips dedicated to making 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.840
 homemade remote system 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.279
 controls for outboard boat 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:34.020
 to merge nissan motors tohatsu 572 so 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.610
 I remind you that the first movie is called 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 homemade machine gas controller 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.199
 reverse and connection kit 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.809
 my choice fell on the most common 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.600
 1tp special system before you set 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.200
 all necessary for remote 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.020
 motor control for 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.890
 installation of any sports 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.280
 car steering wheel 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.480
 I made an adapter that looks like it 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 in such a way, here in front of you axis 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:10.390
 steering gear quiksilver 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.509
 we take our adapter put it with 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.320
 this side it will be fixed itself 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.430
 protracted 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.790
 gadget with a nylon sleeve and with this 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:26.229
 hand we have got this 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.540
 a kind of recess under the key here I 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.470
 made the veneer ochku we put in here 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.430
 veneer point 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.369
 and so that the key does not jump out 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.869
 fix it with the usual clamp 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.390
 respectively, from the top we already 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.549
 mounted steering wheel and an additional set 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.439
 holes as you see they are paired 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:51.280
 need to install all this 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:55.509
 case on the console to bring some horizon 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.909
 steering element mount consists of 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.549
 main plate 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.759
 some kind of base plate which 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.520
 welded tube for attachment to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:09.540
 guide tube directly 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.829
 the very shirt chatur cable I'm in the store 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:16.450
 hydraulic and compressor systems 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:20.310
 bought some fitting here such a plan 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:24.040
 fitting from which I sawed off him 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.650
 nut threaded part and welded to 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.610
 our guide tube this way 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.620
 we will fix our shirt your 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.810
 tether tour 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.970
 This item is equipped with one 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.430
 side safety ring for 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 outboard motor and on the other hand i 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:48.090
 welded metal profile later 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.370
 I will say what it is for, that is, it will 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.150
 be a fixer later show how 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.760
 now go to the steering poker 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.570
 friend presented me 2 ex 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.510
 used 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.940
 steering tags from his quad from 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.020
 one of which I actually with the first 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.110
 attempts made directly itself 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.950
 poker which transmits traction from us 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 force under the curtains of the cable to the motor poker 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.500
 we got regulated then here at 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.030
 us a threaded connection we can 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.490
 make it a little longer 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.480
 we can do a little shorter than 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:29.850
 this we can adjust the alignment 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.420
 mounting bolts i.e. mounting bolts 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.910
 to curtain ropes and bolts fastening to 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.370
 the motor itself 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.950
 the whole mechanism made by me has 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.560
 just one mounting point is a point 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.780
 mounts just this ear here we are with 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.310
 reverse side insert the bolt and here 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
 Now what I talked about 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:55.670
 so that our mounting structure is not 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:59.180
 walked across this bolt around the circumference 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.090
 I actually welded for this 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.510
 small profile profile has the same 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.080
 the very width that the distance between 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.620
 clamps so we dress him 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:15.660
 insert between clamps and moment 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:20.330
 festivities around the bolt we have minimally 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.330
 zero van go to the new tests 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.659
 start the steering wheel as we see 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.409
 Makar is easy enough 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:37.020
 moves from one correct point 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:39.419
 Respectively 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.930
 motor from board to board is two with 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.330
 half turn steering wheel 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.090
 approximate angle of rotation by motor 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.370
 get out the center to one of the sides 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.370
 about 35-40 degrees 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.479
 tilting the motor with my system 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.150
 full engine tilting 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:20.830
 return to starting position continued 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:23.569
 taxiing dry bench tests 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:26.470
 the swivel mechanism is considered successful 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.300
 there are two more videos ahead of you. 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:31.789
 one of which is the manufacture of consoles 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.419
 installing this whole thing on the boat 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:40.300
 and the last 4 video test 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.300
 liquid water tests all over all
