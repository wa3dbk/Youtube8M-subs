 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.959
 tutorial of photoshop this we are going to 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:10.480
 learn to create this sepia effect 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.180
 old that looks pretty good ok 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.240
 to get started 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.180
 let's go to our image and let's 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.540
 create a fill layer adjustment and we're going 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.540
 to choose 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.890
 black and white 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.259
 as you see here you have a lot of 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.349
 options you can choose you can click 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.320
 in this icon and it can be both image and 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:38.239
 click and move it to the right or to the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.720
 left as you see says and the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.699
 intensity of the black or is lowered as is 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.000
 Here, for example, I'm going to download a 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.930
 you can not click here where they are 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.210
 the whiter colors and go up are the 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.309
 so we pass blacks and casualties what 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.050
 you go up a bit if you want or you can go give 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.480
 here in automatic so that you what 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.250
 apply automatically although to me 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.230
 like to move a little more like 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.770
 example here I said I 'm going to download a 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.840
 little more men like that ok 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.789
 now we are going to create another layer 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.539
 so that we like it and we will choose 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.400
 curves let's go up a bit this 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:21.030
 down more or less 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 so let's create a point in this part 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 and then let's go down we're like that and we're going 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.180
 to create another point here and we're going to 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.180
 go up like this 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.469
 ok that will give you a little more contrast 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.180
 and now the blacks a little more gray 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.480
 what will make it apply better to 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.890
 effect 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.890
 ok let's go like this 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.750
 ok when they have it closed and we're going to 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.620
 create another layer so we like it 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 it's going to be photo filter and here 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.330
 in filter you simply choose the one that says 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.720
 sepia 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:04.900
 and you raise the intensity to 100% I say the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.930
 density forgiveness and the one marked 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:11.470
 here in conserving the luminosity 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.230
 ok you close the ideas double click to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.880
 enter the merge options here in 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.110
 this part in merger options by 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.940
 defect you're going down here and you 're going to give 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.440
 give admin back click to be 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.920
 stop this and you will move it more or less 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.620
 medium 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.140
 I do not know if you were going to do the same but in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.870
 this side we are going to give alt + click and what 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.459
 let's drag more and here you go 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.250
 move until you are your 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.150
 preference for example then move 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.150
 here for here 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.090
 the music more or less like that 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 although when they have it they give ok and now 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.160
 I will create a texture that that 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.680
 I have here to give you that effect 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.360
 that old effect because I'm going to 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:06.360
 drag and I'm going to put it here I'm going to 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.360
 enlarge 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.040
 A) Yes 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.530
 ok and I'm going to invest it with control and 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.860
 so that it stays in these white lines 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.850
 you see that you see here ok and I'm going to change 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.190
 from normal 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.400
 to plot why for what only are left 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.760
 the white lines as the lines with 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.720
 more light ok I'll position it and I'll go 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:39.460
 to lower the opacity 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:42.830
 even more or less that is very low 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.090
 24 percent and I'm going to lower it up 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.599
 down 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:49.940
 so it is the color of the 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.319
 sepia color because if you want you can 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.870
 see a little the opacity because if 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.440
 look at yourself 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.140
 that effect stronger than what the 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.900
 sepia effect of old Well 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.459
 I hope you have served tutorial 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.890

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.220
