00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.000
 hello we make a small summary of that 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.820
 which were all the major terms in 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.089
 In this case I give a small example on 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:17.030
 a blues 145 so I'm still always 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.120
 three dominant agreements in this case the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.970
 blues and blues is obviously dominating 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.780
 re dominant that dominant me one thing 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.710
 I would like to emphasize the banality 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.930
 learning this concept 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.570
 because we see many times 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.179
 guitarists do a lot of known a 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 lots of things that seem 

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:38.989
 science fiction it is actually 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.890
 much more banal than it can 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.499
 seem seen from this point of view 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.629
 I'm you these terms is clear that if 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:52.059
 we start from the concept in this 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.440
 moment I have an agreement of dominates 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.089
 remember when I told you about the 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.519
 companies already tour and always check by 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.339
 study in all possible shades 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.710
 and you can imagine all the ways in this 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:05.960
 most case of the stairs I would have done 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.920
 case that the dominant one 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.280
 it is the fifth degree of D major king 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.330
 greater for which I all the patterns ad 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.020
 example ago I am the way of god speaks 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.020
 alone 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.880
 wind power etc. and so on 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.160
 I know all the dictatorship perfectly 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.650
 of this scale as a chord of la 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.110
 dominant below this miso scale 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.330
 Lydia extended for all 7 part a long 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.840
 the keyboard remembering my course 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.180
 what a fulcrum of nights driving in this 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.090
 case is the C sharp because in any case 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.160
 the note that we say the agreement of 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 dominant makes the difference in that 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.670
 third major, etc. I'll play with it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.290
 a lot about this from the third 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.700
 major and minor third because I can 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.820
 also superimposes the discourse of the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.800
 major and minor pentatonic on a 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.250
 Rome agreement inter changing these 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.230
 scale grades 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.600
 obviously then I will pass dominant king was 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.160
 what is the dominant and obviously the dominant 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.470
 fifth grade but soul being fifth 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.180
 soulful degree I can always have in 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 this position trying to stay in 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:29.260
 this range 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:32.200
 obviously the king being the fifth of 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:38.320
 soul can start from playing ad 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.459
 example a Doric the pattern though that 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.459
 actually coming back 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.480
 come back 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.790
 the wind becomes the jonica of this 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.700
 sun actually always having below 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.830
 this one will always remain however 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.750
 a miserable scale to say so I can 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.750
 also starting decidedly from the antonia 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.690
 that looks at the painting 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.690
 extended 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.680
 obviously the same speech I will pass then 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.709
 on the dominant mid I dominant what 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.409
 will get the myth undermined obviously is the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.769
 fifth grade of the major for which 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:23.769
 look 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.720
 in reality we have meant playing 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.239
 when under an agreement of neither 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.980
 dominant a scale of me 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.739
 let's go the song I'll play 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.349
 slowly the pattern in such a way that 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.110
 you can see without moving like 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:44.110
 change these three face line scales 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.470
 is 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.230
 is 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.550
 no
