accessory the color to glue this piece

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.599 
accessory the color to glue this piece
I'm<00:01:34.159> using<00:01:34.459> Elmer's<00:01:35.299> glue<00:01:36.039> you<00:01:37.039> need<00:01:37.219> to<00:01:37.369> use

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
I'm using Elmer's glue you need to use

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:41.469 
I'm using Elmer's glue you need to use
water-based<00:01:38.389> glue<00:01:39.159> anything<00:01:40.479> since

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
water-based glue anything since

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.399 
water-based glue anything since
synthetic<00:01:42.229> base<00:01:42.469> will<00:01:43.130> just<00:01:43.429> eat<00:01:43.609> your

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
synthetic base will just eat your

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.819 
synthetic base will just eat your
styrofoam<00:01:45.409> in<00:01:46.399> a<00:01:46.579> blink<00:01:46.819> of<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.029> eye<00:01:47.770> here<00:01:48.770> we

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
styrofoam in a blink of the eye here we

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:49.179 
styrofoam in a blink of the eye here we
go

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
go

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.949 
go
so<00:01:49.969> give<00:01:50.359> it<00:01:50.389> a<00:01:50.630> little<00:01:50.810> bit<00:01:51.079> time<00:01:51.829> to<00:01:52.159> cure<00:01:52.459> and

00:01:52.949 --> 00:01:52.959 
so give it a little bit time to cure and

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:57.819 
so give it a little bit time to cure and
I<00:01:53.959> will<00:01:54.409> prepare<00:01:54.950> wires<00:01:56.109> for<00:01:57.109> the<00:01:57.229> power<00:01:57.499> and

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
I will prepare wires for the power and

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.219 
I will prepare wires for the power and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
wiring done at that point when I'm

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.740 
wiring done at that point when I'm
testing<00:02:06.139> I'm<00:02:06.319> connecting<00:02:07.069> a<00:02:07.509> signal<00:02:08.509> and

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750

when everything installed and working

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.370 
when everything installed and working
properly<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:17.030> will<00:02:17.570> be<00:02:17.780> special

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
properly it will be special

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.330

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.520 

already<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.940> how<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.480> looks<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.960> after<00:02:27.290> I

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
already that's how it looks like after I

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.370 
already that's how it looks like after I
mounted<00:02:28.120> time<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.360> program<00:02:29.810> you<00:02:30.020> can<00:02:30.200> actually

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
mounted time to program you can actually

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.800 
mounted time to program you can actually
guys<00:02:30.680> program<00:02:31.190> before<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.970> mounting<00:02:32.570> or

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
guys program before you mounting or

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.290 
guys program before you mounting or
after<00:02:33.470> for<00:02:33.680> me<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:33.860> doesn't<00:02:34.100> matter<00:02:34.460> two

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
after for me it doesn't matter two

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.000 
after for me it doesn't matter two
things<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.720> need<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.990> program<00:02:36.200> first<00:02:36.680> very

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
things I need to program first very

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
important the duration of the pulse so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.680 
important the duration of the pulse so
