the palette and I diluted this color

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.820 
the palette and I diluted this color
down<00:01:39.300> with<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.630> alcohol<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.259> create<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> hint

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
down with the alcohol to create a hint

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.779 
down with the alcohol to create a hint
of<00:01:40.920> color<00:01:41.190> for<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.580> more<00:01:41.729> subtle<00:01:41.970> shadow<00:01:42.330> I<00:01:46.789> also

trick to make this effect work is to

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.670 
trick to make this effect work is to

to begin to blend the edges of the wax
into<00:03:59.239> your<00:03:59.480> skin<00:03:59.780> I<00:03:59.989> find<00:04:00.739> using<00:04:00.890> the<00:04:01.099> flat

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
into your skin I find using the flat

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.770 
into your skin I find using the flat
edge<00:04:01.459> works<00:04:01.700> really<00:04:01.969> well<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.390> blend<00:04:02.599> out<00:04:02.659> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
edge works really well to blend out the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.809 
edge works really well to blend out the
wax<00:04:02.989> where<00:04:03.769> the<00:04:03.890> point<00:04:04.159> to<00:04:04.310> your<00:04:04.459> end<00:04:04.609> is<00:04:04.790> a

wax where the point to your end is a

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.250 
wax where the point to your end is a
little<00:04:05.060> bit<00:04:05.180> better<00:04:05.420> for<00:04:05.689> getting<00:04:05.810> to<00:04:06.079> tight

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
little bit better for getting to tight

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:14.170 
little bit better for getting to tight

I purposefully kept the lips pretty thin

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.650 
I purposefully kept the lips pretty thin
since<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.609> wanted<00:04:16.820> them<00:04:16.970> to<00:04:17.000> look<00:04:17.299> like<00:04:17.359> they're
