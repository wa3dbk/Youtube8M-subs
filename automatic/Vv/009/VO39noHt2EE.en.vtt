hi this is matthew from the next web and
today<00:00:05.990> we're<00:00:06.140> going<00:00:06.230> to<00:00:06.290> be<00:00:06.439> talking<00:00:06.620> about

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
today we're going to be talking about

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.580 
today we're going to be talking about
the<00:00:07.189> I<00:00:07.220> helicopter<00:00:08.090> which<00:00:08.330> is<00:00:08.480> a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
the I helicopter which is a

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.540 
the I helicopter which is a
remote-control<00:00:09.590> helicopter<00:00:10.190> they<00:00:10.400> it's

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:10.550 
remote-control helicopter they it's

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.299 
remote-control helicopter they it's
controlled<00:00:10.970> by<00:00:11.120> your<00:00:11.300> iPhone<00:00:11.709> using<00:00:12.709> a<00:00:12.950> small

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309 
controlled by your iPhone using a small

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.190 
controlled by your iPhone using a small
infrared<00:00:13.969> emitter<00:00:14.269> that<00:00:14.599> plugs<00:00:14.839> into<00:00:15.019> your

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
infrared emitter that plugs into your

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.010 
infrared emitter that plugs into your
headphone<00:00:15.620> jack<00:00:16.120> because<00:00:17.120> the<00:00:17.330> emitter<00:00:17.750> plugs

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
headphone jack because the emitter plugs

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.530 
headphone jack because the emitter plugs
into<00:00:18.200> your<00:00:18.289> headphone<00:00:18.650> jack<00:00:18.950> like<00:00:19.340> so<00:00:19.580> it<00:00:20.330> does

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
into your headphone jack like so it does

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.360 
into your headphone jack like so it does
need<00:00:20.690> to<00:00:20.750> be<00:00:20.840> charged<00:00:21.320> up<00:00:21.590> because<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.100> doesn't

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
need to be charged up because it doesn't

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.260 
need to be charged up because it doesn't
a<00:00:22.400> program<00:00:22.670> to<00:00:22.730> provide<00:00:22.940> enough<00:00:23.240> power

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
a program to provide enough power

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.840 
a program to provide enough power
through<00:00:23.780> the<00:00:23.870> jack<00:00:24.110> to<00:00:24.350> omit<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:25.430> infrared

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:25.850 
through the jack to omit the infrared

beam<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:26.330> helicopter<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:26.990> needs<00:00:27.350> so<00:00:28.130> you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
beam to the helicopter that needs so you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.560 
beam to the helicopter that needs so you
will<00:00:28.340> need<00:00:28.430> to<00:00:28.520> charge<00:00:28.820> that<00:00:29.030> up<00:00:29.180> but<00:00:29.300> it<00:00:29.420> comes

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
will need to charge that up but it comes

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.760 
will need to charge that up but it comes
with<00:00:29.600> a<00:00:29.750> cable<00:00:29.960> that<00:00:30.140> charges<00:00:30.530> both

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
with a cable that charges both

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.799 
with a cable that charges both

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
simultaneously off of a USB now the

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.630 
simultaneously off of a USB now the
helicopter<00:00:35.809> is<00:00:35.839> controlled<00:00:36.800> by<00:00:36.920> the<00:00:37.100> controls

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
helicopter is controlled by the controls

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.549 
helicopter is controlled by the controls
on<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.999> screen<00:00:38.269> of<00:00:38.359> the<00:00:38.390> iPhone<00:00:38.749> here<00:00:39.019> you

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
on the screen of the iPhone here you

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.799 
on the screen of the iPhone here you
have<00:00:39.769> up<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.339> down<00:00:40.550> or<00:00:40.789> acceleration<00:00:41.390> there

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
have up and down or acceleration there

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.930 
have up and down or acceleration there
and<00:00:42.050> then<00:00:42.409> forward<00:00:42.890> back<00:00:43.159> left<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.699> right

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
and then forward back left and right

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.299 
and then forward back left and right
this<00:00:44.510> is<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.719> three-channel<00:00:45.199> helicopter<00:00:45.949> so<00:00:46.159> it

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
this is a three-channel helicopter so it

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.489 
this is a three-channel helicopter so it
does<00:00:46.460> not<00:00:46.609> have<00:00:46.820> control<00:00:47.030> for<00:00:47.510> yah<00:00:47.690> so<00:00:48.379> it

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:48.499 
does not have control for yah so it

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.169 
does not have control for yah so it
won't<00:00:48.679> be<00:00:48.769> banking<00:00:49.339> or<00:00:49.460> anything<00:00:49.789> but<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.059> does

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
won't be banking or anything but it does

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.229 
won't be banking or anything but it does
provide<00:00:50.510> stable<00:00:51.050> flight<00:00:51.289> for<00:00:51.620> indoors<00:00:52.239> indoor

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
provide stable flight for indoors indoor

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:54.790 
provide stable flight for indoors indoor
use<00:00:53.449> which<00:00:53.690> is<00:00:53.839> what<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.109> is<00:00:54.170> primarily<00:00:54.559> used

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
use which is what this is primarily used

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.860 
use which is what this is primarily used
for<00:00:55.010> you<00:00:55.640> have<00:00:55.789> your<00:00:55.940> counterweight<00:00:56.479> here

your four blade system with the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.479 
your four blade system with the
propeller<00:00:59.539> blade<00:00:59.809> if<00:01:00.589> they<00:01:00.769> do<00:01:00.829> provide<00:01:01.100> you

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
propeller blade if they do provide you

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.279 
propeller blade if they do provide you
with<00:01:01.729> extras<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.329> those<00:01:02.569> blades<00:01:02.809> which<00:01:03.139> is

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
with extras of those blades which is

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.070 
with extras of those blades which is
nice<00:01:03.499> and<00:01:03.800> then<00:01:04.280> you<00:01:04.370> do<00:01:04.550> get<00:01:04.729> extra<00:01:05.239> missiles

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
nice and then you do get extra missiles

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.450 
nice and then you do get extra missiles
here<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.620> you<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.890> use<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.190> hit<00:01:07.310> your

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
here that you can use to hit your

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.620 
here that you can use to hit your
targets<00:01:07.939> these<00:01:08.899> targets<00:01:09.350> are<00:01:09.850> used<00:01:10.850> for<00:01:11.180> you

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
targets these targets are used for you

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.060 
targets these targets are used for you
know<00:01:11.719> kind<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:11.990> target<00:01:12.380> practice<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:12.920> you're

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
know kind of target practice so you're

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.440 
know kind of target practice so you're
flying<00:01:13.310> around<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:13.790> shoot<00:01:13.939> the<00:01:14.030> missile<00:01:14.149> in

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
flying around you shoot the missile in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.980 
flying around you shoot the missile in
it<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.399> missiles<00:01:17.299> are<00:01:17.390> located<00:01:17.840> right

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it and so the missiles are located right

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.350 
it and so the missiles are located right
here<00:01:18.049> underneath<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> helicopter<00:01:19.360> now

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
here underneath the helicopter now

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.850 
here underneath the helicopter now
you've<00:01:20.570> got<00:01:20.659> a<00:01:20.689> small<00:01:20.930> activity<00:01:21.350> like<00:01:21.530> here

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
you've got a small activity like here

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.789 
you've got a small activity like here
underneath<00:01:22.610> is<00:01:22.909> a<00:01:22.939> USB<00:01:23.600> ports<00:01:24.020> proprietary

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
underneath is a USB ports proprietary

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.310 
underneath is a USB ports proprietary
mini<00:01:25.100> USB<00:01:25.280> port<00:01:25.729> for<00:01:25.759> charging<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:26.420> an<00:01:26.899> on/off

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
mini USB port for charging and an on/off

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.850 
mini USB port for charging and an on/off
switch<00:01:27.579> and<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:28.789> you've<00:01:29.180> got<00:01:29.450> your<00:01:29.860> little

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
switch and then you've got your little

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.950 
switch and then you've got your little
missiles<00:01:31.189> there<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:31.610> then<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.030> IR<00:01:32.329> goes<00:01:32.539> into

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
missiles there and then the IR goes into

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.999 
missiles there and then the IR goes into
the<00:01:33.369> cockpit<00:01:34.369> here<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.750> flies<00:01:36.170> relatively

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
the cockpit here but it flies relatively

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.090 
the cockpit here but it flies relatively
stable<00:01:37.280> just<00:01:38.210> like<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:38.750> pivots<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.590> then

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
stable just like so pivots and then

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.209 
stable just like so pivots and then
forward<00:01:40.670> or<00:01:40.880> backwards<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:42.859> let's

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
forward or backwards like so so let's

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.410 
forward or backwards like so so let's
give<00:01:43.399> it<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.549> spin<00:01:43.789> and<00:01:43.850> see<00:01:44.359> how<00:01:44.750> it<00:01:44.840> works<00:01:46.420> ok

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
give it a spin and see how it works ok

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.940 
give it a spin and see how it works ok
so<00:01:47.810> now<00:01:47.929> we're<00:01:48.049> ready<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.259> do<00:01:48.380> a<00:01:48.409> little<00:01:48.619> fine

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
so now we're ready to do a little fine

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.099 
so now we're ready to do a little fine
we've<00:01:49.250> got<00:01:49.369> our<00:01:49.490> controls<00:01:49.880> here<00:01:50.149> we've<00:01:51.079> got

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
we've got our controls here we've got

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.109 
we've got our controls here we've got
our<00:01:51.259> acceleration<00:01:52.070> here<00:01:52.579> and<00:01:52.759> then<00:01:52.880> of<00:01:53.030> course

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
our acceleration here and then of course

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.959 
our acceleration here and then of course
our<00:01:53.539> directional<00:01:54.109> pad<00:01:54.350> over<00:01:54.619> here<00:01:54.859> so<00:01:55.789> let's

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
our directional pad over here so let's

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.179 
our directional pad over here so let's
go<00:01:56.119> ahead<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:56.390> take<00:01:56.659> this<00:01:57.170> thing<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:57.439> a<00:01:57.649> spin

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.620 

so<00:02:01.189> in<00:02:01.340> applying<00:02:01.609> this<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:01.999> found<00:02:02.359> it<00:02:02.479> to<00:02:02.600> be

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
so in applying this I found it to be

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.560 
so in applying this I found it to be
very<00:02:03.049> very<00:02:03.590> good<00:02:03.859> in<00:02:04.340> general<00:02:04.820> right<00:02:05.119> on<00:02:05.299> par

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
very very good in general right on par

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.029 
very very good in general right on par
with<00:02:05.600> any<00:02:05.780> of<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.140> other<00:02:06.259> small<00:02:06.619> micro

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
with any of the other small micro

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.210 
with any of the other small micro
copters<00:02:07.249> like<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.179> syma<00:02:08.539> s107<00:02:09.350> any<00:02:09.619> of<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
copters like the syma s107 any of the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.150 
copters like the syma s107 any of the
ones<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.490> have<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.820> joy

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
ones that have the joy

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.600 
ones that have the joy
stabilization<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.840> vertical<00:02:13.560> flight<00:02:13.830> was

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
stabilization so the vertical flight was

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.220 
stabilization so the vertical flight was
a<00:02:14.640> little<00:02:14.910> gin<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.360> simply<00:02:15.900> because<00:02:15.960> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
a little gin here simply because you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.920 
a little gin here simply because you
don't<00:02:16.500> have<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.760> physical<00:02:17.760> lever<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.780> you're

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
don't have the physical lever so you're

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.840 
don't have the physical lever so you're
working<00:02:19.140> with<00:02:19.380> on-screen<00:02:19.800> controls<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.670> the

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
working with on-screen controls so the

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.280 
working with on-screen controls so the
up<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> down<00:02:21.300> movement<00:02:21.690> is<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.810> little<00:02:22.050> hard<00:02:22.170> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
up and down movement is a little hard to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
up and down movement is a little hard to
control<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:23.250> forward<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:23.700> back<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.030> great

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
control but forward and back is great

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.170 
control but forward and back is great
very<00:02:25.020> little<00:02:25.350> spin<00:02:25.710> problems<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:27.000> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
very little spin problems which is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.300 
very little spin problems which is
common<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.990> guys<00:02:28.310> very

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
common with these little guys very

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.610 
common with these little guys very
sturdy<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:30.120> will<00:02:30.330> find<00:02:30.630> yourself<00:02:30.990> Smashing

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
sturdy you will find yourself Smashing

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.530 
sturdy you will find yourself Smashing
and<00:02:31.680> banging<00:02:31.890> into<00:02:32.250> things<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.790> falling<00:02:33.420> out

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and banging into things and falling out

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.120 
and banging into things and falling out
of<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> sky<00:02:33.720> getting<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> war<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.740> lot<00:02:34.950> with

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
of the sky getting the war a lot with

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.470 
of the sky getting the war a lot with
them<00:02:35.250> which<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.430> why<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> extra<00:02:36.030> blades<00:02:36.240> are

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
them which is why the extra blades are

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.540 
them which is why the extra blades are
nice<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.350> it<00:02:37.530> generally<00:02:37.710> held<00:02:38.250> up<00:02:38.400> really

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
nice but it generally held up really

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.940 
nice but it generally held up really

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
well the casing is sturdy so it doesn't

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.350 
well the casing is sturdy so it doesn't
feel<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.520> will<00:02:41.580> have<00:02:41.730> any<00:02:41.880> major<00:02:42.120> issues
