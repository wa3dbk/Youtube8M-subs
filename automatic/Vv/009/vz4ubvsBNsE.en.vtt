00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
as fast as the SOG there but as you can

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.789 
as fast as the SOG there but as you can
see<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.120> definitely<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:32.989> it's<00:02:33.019> pretty

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
genki than this one and I definitely

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.920 
genki than this one and I definitely
like<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.239> SOG<00:03:29.660> flash<00:03:30.019> to<00:03:30.290> better<00:03:31.299> now<00:03:32.299> the

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
like the SOG flash to better now the

these knives is a lot
not<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> lot<00:04:27.590> different<00:04:27.950> but<00:04:28.040> about<00:04:28.310> double

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
not a lot different but about double

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.350 
not a lot different but about double
this<00:04:29.420> one's<00:04:29.660> about<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:30.290> one<00:04:30.440> was<00:04:30.590> about<00:04:31.360> $52

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
this one's about this one was about $52

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.320 
this one's about this one was about $52
I<00:04:32.570> think<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.140> this<00:04:33.400> one<00:04:34.400> was<00:04:34.850> 25<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:37.330> an

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
I think and this one was 25 so an

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.330 
I think and this one was 25 so an
all-around<00:04:38.930> comparison<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.770> using<00:04:40.220> the

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
all-around comparison and using the

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.730 
all-around comparison and using the
knife<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.730> could<00:04:40.910> definitely<00:04:41.210> feel<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.470> one

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
knife I could definitely feel this one

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.540 
knife I could definitely feel this one
more<00:04:43.010> in<00:04:43.130> my<00:04:43.280> pocket<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.090> think<00:04:44.210> for<00:04:44.540> EDC<00:04:45.550> the

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
more in my pocket so I think for EDC the

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.170 
more in my pocket so I think for EDC the
SOG<00:04:46.850> is<00:04:47.120> definitely<00:04:47.600> going<00:04:47.780> to<00:04:47.870> win<00:04:48.910> for<00:04:49.910> a

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
SOG is definitely going to win for a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.810 
SOG is definitely going to win for a
tactical<00:04:51.020> defender<00:04:51.590> I<00:04:51.830> definitely<00:04:52.370> think<00:04:52.610> the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
tactical defender I definitely think the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.350 
tactical defender I definitely think the
SOG<00:04:53.060> is<00:04:53.390> faster<00:04:54.110> lighter<00:04:54.980> and<00:04:55.370> that

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
SOG is faster lighter and that

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.820 
SOG is faster lighter and that
definitely<00:04:56.630> wins<00:04:57.050> too<00:04:58.010> but<00:04:58.760> as<00:04:59.000> far<00:04:59.390> as<00:04:59.450> a<00:04:59.830> good

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
definitely wins too but as far as a good

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.770 
definitely wins too but as far as a good
blade<00:05:01.330> sharpness<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:03.100> a<00:05:04.240> quality<00:05:05.240> knife<00:05:05.450> for

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
blade sharpness and a quality knife for
