00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 and the world community discovered 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.480
 deadly device which 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.210
 threaten the health of all mankind them 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.889
 turned out to be a banal mercury thermometer 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 Russia under complete prohibition he can 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 turn up in just a few years why 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.839
 decided to get rid of him and what they want 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.800
 to replace 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.660
 figured out vladimir golds these people 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.369
 who declared war ordinary 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.539
 a thermometer so that there is almost 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.519
 every Russian house 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.039
 but what about the meeting before Russia? 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:34.770
 in japan delegates hundreds of countries under the auspices 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.600
 may banned mercury thermometers 2020 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.250
 year we urge to completely stop 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.140
 production use mercury 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.270
 thermometer for measuring temperature 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.070
 are they really going to encroach on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.530
 home first aid kits will walk on 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.510
 apartments and withdraw mom Kate surprised 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.980
 international initiative goals 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 security she certainly measure 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.370
 baby temperature 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.770
 electronics but such a thermometer is often 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.210
 fails big tried 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 several models everywhere deviations by 12 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.420
 degree that for small children 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.580
 essentially 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.020
 Essentially not only for the child but also 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.270
 for many adult Russians that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.700
 called feel the difference mercury 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.409
 a thermometer costs 30 rubles for an electronic 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.180
 will have to pay 10 times more 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.100
 it's hard to imagine a crowd of Russian 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.380
 citizens voluntarily changing thermometers 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.479
 even despite all medical and 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.200
 incredible stories from practice not 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.240
 quite competent mother began to measure 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.070
 thermometer Simon unborn child 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 and measures through the anus of thermometers 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.390
 And the thermometer was on this trash notes he 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 there burst insert that is it 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.909
 the hardest operation as we 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.650
 accustomed to seeing him a thermometer appeared in 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.869
 1717 thanks to the scholar fahrenheit in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.670
 based ignition tube with mercury at 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.320
 heating the liquid metal expands when 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.450
 cooling is compressed term 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.579
 device performance tends to 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.590
 infinity if not human 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 a factor thermometer interfere with tea im 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.610
 try to measure the temperature in the cup 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.070
 for the year in Russia beat 9 million 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.780
 Thermometers are 18 tons of mercury 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.450
 our first action is to collect all 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.950
 mercury droplets interesting mercury is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.560
 not only in thermometers but also in 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.360
 energy-saving lamps such here more often 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.860
 of course used in offices but there are also 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.020
 in residential buildings they contain give 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 not milligrams of liquid metal but for 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.940
 comparisons in ordinary thermometers 2 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.820
 grams of mercury is a thousand times more 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.440
 but in the organization of health 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.930
 suggest not to distinguish and prohibit 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.090
 all mercury devices at once 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.010
 Japanâ€™s first convention 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.180
 the queue is addressed to africa where the local 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.830
 actively mine gold 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.300
 use for this mercury she 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.400
 attracts the grains of precious metal 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.680
 They are doing it not only adults but also 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.560
 children so that all danger becomes clear 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.850
 classes worth show frames chronicles 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.200
 tremor tremor is severe symptoms 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.990
 mercury poisoning 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.060
 but who it stops by the river fireplace 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.860
 my dear 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.989
 the village and my whole family 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.209
 Russia meanwhile has already signed the convention 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.920
 we have long been trying to ban mercury 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.690
 thermometers and restrict entry 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.580
 from China, State Duma Deputy Sergei 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.239
 Kalashnikov promotes electronic 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.880
 technique 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.070
 by example with a good minimum 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.250
 Ministry of Health Promotion 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.050
 use non mercury thermometers very 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.420
 replacement will take place especially since 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.890
 This is a cheap electronics product of course. 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.269
 it may be better 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.370
 inventions thermometer which 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.110
 connects to the phone is full 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.910
 self-test device has risen 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.400
 temperature immediately call the doctor 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.769
 and warn you in advance about the epidemic but 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.140
 again the weak point the price of the novelty will be 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.850
 cost 500 rubles and out again 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.480
 mercury thermometer for overwhelming 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.060
