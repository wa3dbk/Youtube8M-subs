curb glass in the front those are what's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.749 
curb glass in the front those are what's
called<00:01:19.950> for<00:01:20.520> 80<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.210> 480<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.610> specifically<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
called for 80 or 480 I specifically that

has 720 or 1080 lines of resolution

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.840 
has 720 or 1080 lines of resolution
basically<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.100> means<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> multiply

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
basically that means when you multiply

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.020 
basically that means when you multiply
that<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.780> number<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.170> lines<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.770> resolution

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
that the number of lines of resolution

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.010 
that the number of lines of resolution
horizontally<00:01:42.030> by<00:01:42.180> vertically<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.810> end<00:01:42.930> up

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
horizontally by vertically to end up

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
television that makes a huge difference

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
television that makes a huge difference
for<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> clarity<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.890> look<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.980 
for the clarity and the the look of the
screen<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:53.759> much<00:01:54.119> much<00:01:54.360> prettier<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:54.960> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990

screen it's much much prettier on a
hi-def<00:01:55.470> television<00:01:56.750> 1080<00:01:57.750> obviously<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.409> more

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
hi-def television 1080 obviously is more

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
hi-def television 1080 obviously is more
than<00:01:58.649> 720<00:01:59.280> so<00:01:59.640> if<00:01:59.729> you're<00:01:59.820> looking<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.060> the
