to another minecraft video so today guys
I<00:00:03.480> want<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.810> build<00:00:04.020> an<00:00:04.740> infinitely<00:00:05.250> droids

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
I want to build an infinitely droids

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.450 
I want to build an infinitely droids
actually<00:00:05.819> how<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.180> actually<00:00:06.540> build<00:00:06.720> one<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
actually how to actually build one and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.560 
actually how to actually build one and
first<00:00:08.460> of<00:00:08.580> all<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.700> want<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> tell<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.210> that<00:00:09.240> i

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
first of all I want to tell you that i

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.540 
first of all I want to tell you that i
have<00:00:09.599> actually<00:00:10.110> changed<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.710> texture<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
have actually changed the texture of the

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.999 
have actually changed the texture of the
slow<00:00:11.910> as<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.420> see<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:13.170> looks<00:00:13.469> much

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
slow as you can see it looks much

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
slow as you can see it looks much
lighter<00:00:14.340> than<00:00:14.549> before<00:00:14.700> so<00:00:15.120> what<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.450> did<00:00:15.630> is

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
lighter than before so what I did is

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.260 
lighter than before so what I did is
went<00:00:16.770> into<00:00:17.039> Photoshop<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.550> played<00:00:17.910> one<00:00:18.119> with

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
went into Photoshop and played one with

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.960 
went into Photoshop and played one with
the<00:00:18.330> texture<00:00:18.600> media<00:00:18.869> slightly<00:00:19.230> brighter<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
the texture media slightly brighter and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.130 
the texture media slightly brighter and
yeah<00:00:20.970> I'll<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.539> want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> start<00:00:21.960> building

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
yeah I'll think I want to start building

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.679 
yeah I'll think I want to start building
as<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> slow<00:00:22.920> block<00:00:23.220> sack<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.820> it

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
as well with the slow block sack is it

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.359 
as well with the slow block sack is it
look<00:00:24.930> pretty<00:00:25.170> nice<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.619> modern<00:00:25.920> houses<00:00:26.099> I've

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
look pretty nice with modern houses I've

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.660 
look pretty nice with modern houses I've
really<00:00:26.670> built<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.750> little<00:00:27.990> things<00:00:28.199> which<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
really built a little things which I in

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.919 
really built a little things which I in
a<00:00:29.789> different<00:00:30.150> world<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> looks<00:00:30.689> pretty

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
a different world and it looks pretty

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
a different world and it looks pretty
nice<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> decided<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> go<00:00:32.099> ahead<00:00:32.189> make<00:00:32.820> an

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
nice so I decided to go ahead make an

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.600 
nice so I decided to go ahead make an
infinite<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.710> generator<00:00:35.100> because<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.489> do

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
infinite so is generator because I do

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.670 
infinite so is generator because I do
really<00:00:35.940> require<00:00:36.690> quite<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.960> lot<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> slight<00:00:37.469> and

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
really require quite a lot of slight and

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.250 
really require quite a lot of slight and
be<00:00:38.610> easy<00:00:38.820> actually<00:00:39.120> together<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.780> star<00:00:40.020> and

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
be easy actually together the star and

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.020 
be easy actually together the star and
this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> their<00:00:40.770> slow<00:00:41.010> generator<00:00:41.489> for<00:00:41.820> I<00:00:41.879> which

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
this is their slow generator for I which

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.360 
this is their slow generator for I which
already<00:00:42.210> done<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.920> I'm<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> show<00:00:44.280> you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
already done and I'm going to show you

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.270 
already done and I'm going to show you
how<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.550> actually<00:00:45.200> have<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> stern<00:00:46.739> it'll<00:00:47.100> pick

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
how to actually have a stern it'll pick

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.670 
how to actually have a stern it'll pick
up<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> slow<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> way<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> do<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.559> need

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
up the slow the way to do this you need

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.180 
up the slow the way to do this you need
a<00:00:49.739> shovel<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> just<00:00:50.820> aim<00:00:51.030> down<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.890> slow

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a shovel and just aim down on the slow

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
a shovel and just aim down on the slow
layer<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.039> yeah<00:00:56.149> just<00:00:57.149> click<00:00:57.480> or

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
layer and just and yeah just click or

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.639 
layer and just and yeah just click or
just<00:00:58.590> hold<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.010> shift<00:00:59.460> key<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.379> I'll<00:01:01.379> de<00:01:01.559> la

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
just hold the shift key and I'll de la

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.939 
just hold the shift key and I'll de la
within<00:01:01.890> few<00:01:02.129> seconds<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.550> had<00:01:02.730> two<00:01:03.000> sacks<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.449> 16

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
within few seconds I had two sacks of 16

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
within few seconds I had two sacks of 16
or<00:01:04.949> before<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> want<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:05.909> how<00:01:06.090> many<00:01:06.299> I'm

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
or before so I want to see how many I'm

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.440 
or before so I want to see how many I'm
going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> actually<00:01:07.380> gather<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.979> within<00:01:08.450> the

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
going to actually gather now within the

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.600 
going to actually gather now within the
next<00:01:09.659> three<00:01:10.110> seconds<00:01:10.500> as<00:01:10.619> well<00:01:12.020> let<00:01:13.020> me<00:01:13.170> see

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
next three seconds as well let me see

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.840 
next three seconds as well let me see
from<00:01:14.610> me<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:14.939> one<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.110> three<00:01:16.530> okay<00:01:17.490> let<00:01:17.759> me

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
from me now one two three okay let me

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.570 
from me now one two three okay let me
see<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> had<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.290> already<00:01:19.500> gathered<00:01:20.369> from

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
see so I had these already gathered from

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340 
see so I had these already gathered from
before<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.150> i<00:01:21.180> wouldnt<00:01:21.750> like<00:01:21.930> other<00:01:22.170> night

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
before so i wouldnt like other night

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.890 
before so i wouldnt like other night
10-15<00:01:22.920> seconds<00:01:23.369> I've<00:01:23.549> look<00:01:24.540> how<00:01:24.659> many<00:01:24.810> have

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
10-15 seconds I've look how many have

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.310 
10-15 seconds I've look how many have
already<00:01:24.960> collected<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.070> i<00:01:27.000> could<00:01:27.600> turn<00:01:27.869> these

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
already collected so i could turn these

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.910 
already collected so i could turn these
probably<00:01:28.920> into<00:01:29.310> 16<00:01:29.759> blocks<00:01:30.290> and<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.409> half<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
probably into 16 blocks and a half in a

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.859 
probably into 16 blocks and a half in a
white<00:01:32.130> house<00:01:32.400> probably<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.479> bit<00:01:33.659> less

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
white house probably a little bit less

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.670 
white house probably a little bit less
and<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> see<00:01:34.560> already<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.460> some<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.680> it'll

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
and you see already have some so it'll

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.810 
and you see already have some so it'll
be<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> lot<00:01:37.979> easier<00:01:38.159> now<00:01:38.369> to<00:01:39.049> get<00:01:40.049> snow<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:41.610> make

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
be a lot easier now to get snow or make

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.280 
be a lot easier now to get snow or make
snow<00:01:42.030> blocks<00:01:42.329> from<00:01:42.509> snow<00:01:42.810> layers<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
snow blocks from snow layers and

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
snow blocks from snow layers and
together<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.130> snow<00:01:44.340> days<00:01:44.520> will<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> lot

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
together the snow days will be a lot

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
together the snow days will be a lot
easier<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.960> i'm<00:01:46.590> actually<00:01:46.770> gonna<00:01:47.009> do<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.399> now

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
easier so i'm actually gonna do is now

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.190 
easier so i'm actually gonna do is now
as<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.270> said<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> want<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> try<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
