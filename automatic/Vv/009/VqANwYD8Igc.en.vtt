00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.759
 this is one of the most important body bilding exercises 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.359
 but before continuing on our journey despe moratti - the difference 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:25.119
 between natural bodybuilding and bodibi 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.140
 black bodibilding and it is nothing else but this discipline however it falls out 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.679
 cake from the use of doping drugs 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.079
 this is another distinction I must make on my part 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.920
 since especially in the 80s 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.660
 bodibilding competitions are where people met and that's all 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 comparison between them on a sporting level 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.490
 they use doping drugs in 99% of the gases 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.130
 in a rebel Arabic instead of a bottle. as I said before and search 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.190
 to approach the majority of people by telephone 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.830
 nonlodire from drugs 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.860
 from this a special methodology created right here was born 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 in Italy called biio 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.500
 text the acronym of the initials of short intense infrequent and organized 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.950
 what things the god 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.110
 good because our body cannot react to intense efforts greater than 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 an hour and a half 2 hours 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.670
 in fact everyone thinks they like results in all sports 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.170
 and someone in life too 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.420
 you always have to work 10 hours a day every week on a week 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.580
 removed week 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.789
 filled with oblivion 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.850
 thanks scientific studies lasted about 8 years 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.110
 It has been discovered that muscle tonicity can also be maintained 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.310
 training twice a week 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.280
 trend of over an hour an hour and twenty at the most here is why brief intense 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.010
 our body reacts to strangely intense stresses then with 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.600
 extremely heavy weights 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.300
 that I try this method is very easy to reach 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.040
 in frequency. because you only need to re2 at most 3 times a week in 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.400
 some cases we went out to get icw results only once a week 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.369
 example athletes who do other sports and therefore cannot recover 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.300
 organized organized because you succeed 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.970
 open plan during the year 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.890
 the body depending on the hormonal rhythms present one we have high steron rate 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.410
 in the summer autumn part, therefore, some are inserted 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 and methods to the parliament of force especially or in that season 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.969
 when instead cortisol shalke it stresses it 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.509
 which tends to rise in the first months of the year from 

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:38.319
 let's say from January to March, let's hold a shorter parliament just for 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.659
 try to limit as much as possible this hormone to cortisol which tends to burn 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:46.909
 muscle mass therefore to prevent your performance from stopping in the 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:47.609
 bodybuilding
