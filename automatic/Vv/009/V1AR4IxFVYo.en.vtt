00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
how you work on the pressure so the key

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.050 
how you work on the pressure so the key
messages<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.740> are<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.700> ask<00:01:14.939> the

I<00:01:43.020> ensure<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.890> work<00:01:44.070> together<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.939> a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
I ensure that we work together with a

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.190 
I ensure that we work together with a
cohesive<00:01:45.390> approach

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
cohesive approach

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.499 
cohesive approach
it's<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.860> togetherness<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.520> ensures<00:01:48.479> that

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
it's a togetherness that ensures that

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's a togetherness that ensures that
the<00:01:48.960> team<00:01:49.200> operates<00:01:49.740> as<00:01:49.950> one<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.240> why

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
the team operates as one and this is why

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.940 
the team operates as one and this is why
I<00:01:51.390> believe<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.840> hamburger<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.740> bun

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
I believe a hamburger and a bun

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.429 
I believe a hamburger and a bun
operators<00:01:53.610> one<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.240> can't<00:01:54.479> have<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.960> without

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
operators one you can't have one without

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.530 
operators one you can't have one without
the<00:01:55.590> other<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.490> for<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.149> all<00:01:57.390> about

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the other and so for me it's all about

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.110 
the other and so for me it's all about
teamwork

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.610 

now<00:02:01.120> as<00:02:01.240> cheesy<00:02:01.540> as<00:02:01.690> that<00:02:01.780> sounds<00:02:02.200> that's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
now as cheesy as that sounds that's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.290 
now as cheesy as that sounds that's
basically<00:02:03.070> your<00:02:03.340> opinion<00:02:03.820> it's<00:02:04.060> your

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
basically your opinion it's your

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.720 
basically your opinion it's your
approach<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.140> hamburger<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:05.950> the<00:02:06.460> bun

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
approach to the hamburger and the bun

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.210 
approach to the hamburger and the bun
relationship<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:07.810> it's<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.770> as<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.009> say<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
relationship so it's just as I say a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
relationship so it's just as I say a
question<00:02:09.460> to<00:02:09.759> catch<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.060> off<00:02:10.090> guard<00:02:10.240> to<00:02:11.140> see

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
question to catch you off guard to see

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.170 
question to catch you off guard to see
how<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:11.740> react<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.400> pressure<00:02:12.640> really<00:02:13.060> as

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
how you react on the pressure really as

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.890 
how you react on the pressure really as
simple<00:02:13.450> as<00:02:13.660> that

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
simple as that

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.380 
simple as that
and<00:02:14.530> again<00:02:14.770> there<00:02:15.010> may<00:02:15.130> be<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.310> whole<00:02:16.060> multitude

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
and again there may be a whole multitude

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.300 
and again there may be a whole multitude
of<00:02:16.840> answers<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.380> how<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:17.890> respond

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
of answers of how you want to respond

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.390 
of answers of how you want to respond
but<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.610> just<00:02:18.790> gives<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> quick<00:02:19.120> example

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
if you use your common sense for a

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.140 
if you use your common sense for a
couple<00:02:31.989> of<00:02:32.230> seconds<00:02:32.590> you'll<00:02:33.250> understand<00:02:33.700> that

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
couple of seconds you'll understand that

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.020 
couple of seconds you'll understand that
a<00:02:34.299> car<00:02:34.569> or<00:02:35.500> cars<00:02:35.980> come<00:02:36.370> in<00:02:36.459> different<00:02:36.609> shapes

you to come up with a figure would be

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.130 
you to come up with a figure would be
pure<00:02:41.950> guesswork<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:43.269> that's<00:02:43.510> what<00:02:43.689> this

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
pure guesswork and that's what this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
just makes quick assumptions now if you

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.729 
just makes quick assumptions now if you
think<00:02:51.370> about<00:02:51.459> industries<00:02:52.150> like<00:02:52.359> IT<00:02:52.629> or<00:02:53.230> sales
