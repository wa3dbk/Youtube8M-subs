00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
I used to be a really big PC gamer

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.740 
I used to be a really big PC gamer
especially<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.610> 90s<00:00:03.060> which<00:00:03.330> was<00:00:03.600> the

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
especially in the 90s which was the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.780 
especially in the 90s which was the
period<00:00:03.929> when<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.230> lot<00:00:04.589> of<00:00:04.830> great<00:00:05.220> games<00:00:05.520> were

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
period when a lot of great games were

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.700 
period when a lot of great games were
coming<00:00:06.180> out<00:00:06.299> games<00:00:06.600> like<00:00:06.810> XCOM<00:00:07.350> which<00:00:07.560> was

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
coming out games like XCOM which was

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.310 
coming out games like XCOM which was
also<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.010> very<00:00:08.250> scary<00:00:08.580> game<00:00:08.849> but<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.870> scariest

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
also a very scary game but the scariest

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.620 
also a very scary game but the scariest
game<00:00:10.469> that<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> can<00:00:10.830> think<00:00:10.980> of<00:00:11.160> on<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> PC<00:00:11.880> were

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
game that I can think of on the PC were

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.470 
game that I can think of on the PC were
the<00:00:12.780> System<00:00:13.110> Shock<00:00:13.139> series<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:14.150> both<00:00:15.150> games

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the System Shock series and both games

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.820 
the System Shock series and both games
were<00:00:15.599> very<00:00:15.809> good<00:00:16.049> in<00:00:16.199> fact<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.650> make<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
were very good in fact you can make a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.380 
were very good in fact you can make a
legitimate<00:00:17.279> argument<00:00:17.400> that<00:00:17.820> number<00:00:18.060> two<00:00:18.240> was

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
legitimate argument that number two was

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.779 
legitimate argument that number two was
better<00:00:18.570> than<00:00:18.750> one<00:00:18.990> but<00:00:19.619> I<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.949> very<00:00:20.400> fond

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
better than one but I have very fond

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.580 
better than one but I have very fond
memories<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.480> first<00:00:21.750> one<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.230> fact<00:00:22.410> I

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
memories of the first one in fact I

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.300 
memories of the first one in fact I
don't<00:00:22.650> think<00:00:22.980> I've<00:00:23.279> ever<00:00:24.000> been<00:00:24.210> really<00:00:24.900> as

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
don't think I've ever been really as

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.519 
don't think I've ever been really as
legitimately<00:00:26.310> terrified<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.320> was

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
legitimately terrified of what I was

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.160 
legitimately terrified of what I was
about<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.769> encounter<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.300> next<00:00:30.599> floor<00:00:30.900> as

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
about to encounter on the next floor as

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.340 
about to encounter on the next floor as
I<00:00:31.529> was<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.099> system<00:00:32.520> shock<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:34.110> another

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I was in system shock and it's another

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.290 
I was in system shock and it's another
one<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.590> those<00:00:34.770> games<00:00:35.070> where<00:00:35.280> it's<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.210> know

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
one of those games where it's you know

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.299 
one of those games where it's you know
kind<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> psychotic<00:00:37.110> computer<00:00:37.770> goes<00:00:38.010> nuts

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
kind of a psychotic computer goes nuts

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.119 
kind of a psychotic computer goes nuts
and<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:39.570> kind<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.989> cliched<00:00:40.410> concept<00:00:40.890> now

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and it's kind of a cliched concept now

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.569 
and it's kind of a cliched concept now
but<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.020> one<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> only<00:00:43.920> games<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
but this was one of the only games to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.270 
but this was one of the only games to
really<00:00:44.850> confront<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.570> issue<00:00:45.629> where<00:00:46.280> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
really confront this issue where it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.770 
really confront this issue where it
really<00:00:47.550> felt<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.090> were<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> one<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
really felt like you were in one of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.619 
really felt like you were in one of
these<00:00:48.870> sci-fi<00:00:49.500> horror<00:00:49.860> movies<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
these sci-fi horror movies and it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
these sci-fi horror movies and it
pioneered<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.379> lot<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.770> things<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.520> kind

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
pioneered a lot of things that are kind

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
pioneered a lot of things that are kind
of<00:00:53.969> cliche<00:00:54.449> today<00:00:55.160> things<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:57.530> games

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
of cliche today things like well games

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
of cliche today things like well games
like<00:00:58.829> dead<00:00:59.250> space<00:00:59.550> now<00:00:59.910> kind<00:01:00.270> of<00:01:00.359> ripoff<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
like dead space now kind of ripoff the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
like dead space now kind of ripoff the
exact<00:01:01.469> formula<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> fact<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.730> would<00:01:03.000> call<00:01:03.210> it

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
exact formula in fact I would call it

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.609 
exact formula in fact I would call it
almost<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.660> direct<00:01:03.870> ripoff<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> game

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
almost a direct ripoff of the game

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.910 
almost a direct ripoff of the game
itself<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.220> things<00:01:06.150> like<00:01:06.500> doom<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.770> would

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
itself but things like doom three would

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
itself but things like doom three would
copy<00:01:08.159> things<00:01:08.520> like<00:01:08.700> picking<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.150> logs<00:01:09.510> and

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
copy things like picking up logs and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.870 
copy things like picking up logs and
listening<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> logs<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.430> wander<00:01:11.700> through

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
listening to logs as you wander through

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.719 
listening to logs as you wander through
a<00:01:12.060> dark<00:01:12.330> station<00:01:12.979> getting<00:01:13.979> emails<00:01:14.460> getting

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
a dark station getting emails getting

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
a dark station getting emails getting
taunted<00:01:15.360> periodically<00:01:15.960> by<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.650> villain<00:01:17.070> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
taunted periodically by the villain of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.940 
taunted periodically by the villain of
the<00:01:17.460> piece<00:01:17.490> which<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.240> done<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> lot<00:01:19.049> today<00:01:19.290> but

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
the piece which is done a lot today but

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
the piece which is done a lot today but
in<00:01:20.100> System<00:01:20.490> Shock<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.479> quite

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
in System Shock that was really quite

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.120 
in System Shock that was really quite
something<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.290> was<00:01:22.380> one<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> first

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
something and it was one of the first

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
something and it was one of the first
games<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.850> really<00:01:24.450> introduced<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.229> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
games that really introduced in a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.969 
games that really introduced in a
pervasive<00:01:25.680> fashion<00:01:26.540> spoken<00:01:27.540> audio<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
pervasive fashion spoken audio and a

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.969 
pervasive fashion spoken audio and a
very<00:01:29.720> unorthodox<00:01:30.720> soundtrack<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> had<00:01:31.950> a

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
very unorthodox soundtrack that had a

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.109 
very unorthodox soundtrack that had a
lot<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> electronic<00:01:33.000> sounds<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.920> kind<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
lot of electronic sounds to it kind of a

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.260 
lot of electronic sounds to it kind of a
synth<00:01:36.119> score<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:38.250> concept<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> game

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
synth score and the concept of this game

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.810 
synth score and the concept of this game
is<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:40.470> you're<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> character<00:01:41.700> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is that you're you're a character that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
is that you're you're a character that
was<00:01:42.000> caught<00:01:42.240> for<00:01:42.270> hacking<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.350> trioptimum

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
was caught for hacking the trioptimum

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.090 
was caught for hacking the trioptimum
servers<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> instead<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.079> jail<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
servers and instead of going to jail you

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.280 
servers and instead of going to jail you
are<00:01:47.280> instead<00:01:47.640> contracted<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.540> design<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
are instead contracted to design and

that<00:03:23.430> went<00:03:23.669> on<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> station<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.630> really<00:03:25.440> was

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
that went on the station it really was

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.420 
that went on the station it really was
an<00:03:26.069> immersive<00:03:27.079> dread<00:03:28.079> filled<00:03:28.440> experience<00:03:29.160> and

was a legitimate threat that really
could<00:03:37.049> wipe<00:03:37.260> out<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.590> entire<00:03:37.620> station<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.700> it

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
could wipe out the entire station and it

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.210 
could wipe out the entire station and it
was<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.720> was<00:03:39.900> just<00:03:40.019> really<00:03:40.440> really<00:03:40.889> intense

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the second one really upped the ante

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.110 
the second one really upped the ante
when<00:03:44.639> it<00:03:44.790> came<00:03:45.000> to<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.889> wrongness<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.760> the

when it came to the the wrongness of the

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.930 
when it came to the the wrongness of the
mutations<00:03:48.690> because<00:03:49.250> even<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.459> first<00:03:50.639> game

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
mutations because even in the first game

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.270

technological mutations that like the

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.740 
technological mutations that like the

the cybernetic said she was grafting on

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.440 
the cybernetic said she was grafting on
in<00:03:58.049> fact<00:03:58.769> she<00:03:59.040> was<00:03:59.069> trying<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.459> create<00:03:59.910> her<00:04:00.239> own
