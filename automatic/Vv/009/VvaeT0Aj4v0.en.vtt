longer<00:01:46.020> do<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:47.280> on<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.610> little

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
longer do that also on that little

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.300 
longer do that also on that little
nipple<00:01:48.270> off<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> push<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.189> was

nipple off if you push that and that was
also<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> button<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.149> i<00:01:51.299> would<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
also a button and i would use that to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.310 
also a button and i would use that to
hide<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.040> desktop<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:54.170> fortunately<00:01:55.170> that's

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
hide the desktop and fortunately that's

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.469 
hide the desktop and fortunately that's
gone<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.770> well<00:01:55.799> so<00:01:56.430> i<00:01:56.460> went<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.030> apple<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.360> ask

how<00:01:59.399> are<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.090> going<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.329> get<00:02:00.420> around<00:02:00.689> loss<00:02:01.259> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
how are you going to get around loss of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920 
how are you going to get around loss of
two<00:02:01.680> functionalities<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.640> mls<00:02:03.270> with<00:02:03.420> really

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
two functionalities on mls with really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.709 
two functionalities on mls with really
no<00:02:04.560> service<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.250> their<00:02:05.820> response<00:02:06.119> was<00:02:06.299> use

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
no service and their response was use

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.270 
no service and their response was use
hot<00:02:06.930> corners<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.380> I've<00:02:07.590> never<00:02:07.770> used<00:02:08.039> hot

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
hot corners and I've never used hot

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.710 
hot corners and I've never used hot
corners<00:02:08.640> before<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:09.119> essentially<00:02:09.509> what<00:02:09.660> that

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
corners before but essentially what that

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080 
corners before but essentially what that
means<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.470> swipe<00:02:10.709> your<00:02:10.860> mouse<00:02:11.039> up<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.970> one

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
means is you swipe your mouse up to one

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.980 
means is you swipe your mouse up to one
of<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.239> quarters<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.780> mom

of the quarters your mom

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.140 
of the quarters your mom
and<00:02:13.470> it<00:02:13.560> activates<00:02:13.710> something<00:02:14.400> so<00:02:14.910> now<00:02:15.000> I've

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and it activates something so now I've

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.910 
and it activates something so now I've
got<00:02:15.330> mine<00:02:15.540> set<00:02:15.570> every<00:02:16.080> time<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> swipe<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:16.680> up<00:02:16.770> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
got mine set every time I swipe it up to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.520 
got mine set every time I swipe it up to
the<00:02:17.010> upper<00:02:17.100> right<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.640> activates<00:02:18.060> expose<00:02:18.600> my

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.420 
shows desktop it's not nearly as elegant
and<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:23.940> easy<00:02:24.150> as<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.690> was<00:02:24.720> on<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.860> Mighty

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430

and it's easy as it was on the Mighty
Mouse<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.970> definitely<00:02:27.540> miss<00:02:27.840> having<00:02:28.140> those

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
Mouse I definitely miss having those

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.840 
Mouse I definitely miss having those
buttons<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.070> that<00:02:29.130> I'm<00:02:29.520> going<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
buttons but I think that I'm going to

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.220 
buttons but I think that I'm going to
get<00:02:30.060> used<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.690> only<00:02:30.810> had<00:02:31.020> this

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
get used to it have you only had this

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.190 
get used to it have you only had this
for<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.400> over<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.730> day<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:34.110> I'll

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
for just a little over a day and I'll

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.600 
for just a little over a day and I'll
think<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.470> fair<00:02:34.710> to<00:02:34.740> make<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> judgment<00:02:35.520> call

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
think it's fair to make a judgment call

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.810 
think it's fair to make a judgment call
on<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.850> quite<00:02:36.150> yet<00:02:36.180> but<00:02:37.550> after<00:02:38.550> you<00:02:38.640> guys<00:02:38.760> to

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
believe this will work with windows but

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.830 
believe this will work with windows but
only<00:02:58.980> if<00:02:59.100> you<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.700> proper<00:03:00.000> drivers<00:03:00.660> it's

only if you have the proper drivers it's
a<00:03:00.900> question<00:03:01.230> I've<00:03:01.320> been<00:03:01.350> getting<00:03:01.650> quite<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.980> bit

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
a question I've been getting quite a bit

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.890 
a question I've been getting quite a bit
I<00:03:02.490> would<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.000> go<00:03:03.060> out<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.270> buy<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.420> just<00:03:03.600> for

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
I would have go out and buy it just for

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.900 
I would have go out and buy it just for
Windows<00:03:04.470> but<00:03:04.710> if<00:03:04.830> you're<00:03:04.980> using<00:03:05.160> bootcamp<00:03:05.520> on

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
Windows but if you're using bootcamp on

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.640 
Windows but if you're using bootcamp on
your<00:03:06.120> Mac<00:03:06.270> certainly<00:03:07.140> want<00:03:07.320> to<00:03:07.410> use<00:03:07.560> your

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
original mouse you know go ahead you may

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.360 
original mouse you know go ahead you may
have<00:03:10.230> limited<00:03:10.380> functionality<00:03:10.950> but<00:03:11.220> at<00:03:11.310> least

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
have limited functionality but at least

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.030 
have limited functionality but at least
use<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.790> a<00:03:11.910> point<00:03:12.180> device<00:03:12.710> it's<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.830> little

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
use it as a point device it's a little

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.610 
use it as a point device it's a little
bit<00:03:14.130> low<00:03:14.340> profile<00:03:14.790> compared<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:16.230> magic

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
bit low profile compared to the magic

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.560 
bit low profile compared to the magic
mouse<00:03:16.770> if<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.070> look<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:17.850> there's<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.420> big

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
mouse if you look so there's a big

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.240 
mouse if you look so there's a big
difference<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.740> means<00:03:19.830> me<00:03:20.100> have

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
difference there so it means me have

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.400 
difference there so it means me have
