let's give it a taste it's interesting
from<00:04:15.060> memory<00:04:15.510> I<00:04:15.780> think<00:04:16.350> that<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.459> closer

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
from memory I think that this is closer

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.580 
from memory I think that this is closer
to<00:04:17.970> the<00:04:18.209> regular<00:04:18.570> Pepsi<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.019> we<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.320> then

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
to the regular Pepsi that we have then

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.470 
to the regular Pepsi that we have then
the<00:04:19.769> Pepsi<00:04:20.250> with<00:04:20.489> sugar<00:04:20.700> in<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:20.910> glass<00:04:21.060> bottle

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
the Pepsi with sugar in the glass bottle

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.030 
the Pepsi with sugar in the glass bottle
and<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.660> reason<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.049> say<00:04:22.260> that<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.740> because

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
and the reason I say that is because

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.430 
and the reason I say that is because
there's<00:04:23.640> a<00:04:23.730> bite<00:04:24.090> here<00:04:24.420> with<00:04:24.630> this<00:04:24.870> that<00:04:25.410> I

there's a bite here with this that I
can't<00:04:25.860> remember<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.580> think<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:27.120> remember

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
can't remember and I think I remember
