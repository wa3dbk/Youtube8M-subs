00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.080
 in the country good in this video 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.120
 about decorating cookies we confuse 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.650
 let's make this moon and good in the 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.799
 that looks very much like a moon 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.780
 but a little yes that it seems true 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.949
 Well, I'll show you how I did it 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.630
 and nothing if you want to see it then stay 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.789
 good for what is the bottom of the moon 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.130
 I will use this color well and beige 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.560
 ivory and then I will be adding 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.110
 little things then we extend the fondant 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.690
 of the background color that we want in this 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.280
 case this ivory and now let's go 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.280
 cutting the shapes of the moons 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.149
 do not be scared jce by my hands of 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.070
 colors is that I was having before the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.949
 fondant and then they stayed there and 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.329
 this takes time to go good when 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.510
 we have cut the moons what 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:02.890
 we do is apply the cmc the glue 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.280
 special in cookies and we paste the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.280
 fondant 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.470
 now let's put the eye then 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.440
 with the bottom of a brush itself 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.960
 we make a little hole and there we go 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.960
 insert a white ball 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.149
 we squeeze a little with a toothpick 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.610
 let's do another little hole in the 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.090
 half of the white to put a ball 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.090
 black 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.140
 well in this way now let's do 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.140
 with a pink ball a gap 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.930
 we make a pink ball we crush it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.520
 and we put it as freight 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.150
 I do not know if it looks like a moon is 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.740
 the whole truth but good is what is 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.600
 try 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.600
 now let's tap the loop t 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.040
 well and now let's aim the edge of 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
 Moon 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.870
 ah 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.129
 and it is already done the moon is not 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.579
 that looks a lot like a moon but 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:01.650
 good is what was tried I hope that you 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.519
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.519
