i'm dan ackerman and we're taking a look
at<00:00:05.059> that<00:00:05.180> all-important<00:00:05.960> question<00:00:06.050> once

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:06.680

question we grabbed our good friend mr.
stopwatch<00:00:32.059> and<00:00:32.359> we<00:00:32.629> ran<00:00:32.780> both<00:00:33.079> systems

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
stopwatch and we ran both systems

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.860 
stopwatch and we ran both systems
through<00:00:33.829> not<00:00:34.370> terribly<00:00:34.789> scientific<00:00:35.420> but<00:00:35.629> you

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
through not terribly scientific but you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.569 
through not terribly scientific but you
know<00:00:35.929> real-world<00:00:36.379> situations<00:00:37.100> to<00:00:37.219> see<00:00:37.399> who

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
know real-world situations to see who

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.549 
know real-world situations to see who
would<00:00:37.670> respond<00:00:38.059> faster<00:00:38.479> first<00:00:38.989> one<00:00:39.229> very

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
would respond faster first one very

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.770 
would respond faster first one very
important<00:00:39.949> a<00:00:40.039> boot<00:00:40.370> up<00:00:40.550> test<00:00:40.850> so<00:00:41.239> return<00:00:41.510> both

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
important a boot up test so return both

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.719 
important a boot up test so return both
systems<00:00:42.170> on<00:00:42.319> at<00:00:42.469> the<00:00:42.559> same<00:00:42.739> time<00:00:42.979> two<00:00:43.399> fingers

two<00:00:43.969> different<00:00:44.239> stop<00:00:44.420> watches<00:00:44.899> as<00:00:45.530> you<00:00:45.589> can

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:45.799 
two different stop watches as you can

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:48.009 
two different stop watches as you can
see<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.249> ipad<00:00:46.489> finished<00:00:47.269> its<00:00:47.389> boot<00:00:47.569> up<00:00:47.690> cycle

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:48.019 
see the ipad finished its boot up cycle

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.450 
see the ipad finished its boot up cycle
first<00:00:48.229> followed<00:00:48.769> by<00:00:48.799> the<00:00:48.920> netbook<00:00:49.280> took

first followed by the netbook took

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.489 
first followed by the netbook took
almost<00:00:49.609> twice<00:00:49.969> as<00:00:49.999> long<00:00:50.329> now<00:00:50.989> obviously<00:00:51.350> for

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
almost twice as long now obviously for

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:53.110 
almost twice as long now obviously for
this<00:00:51.620> test<00:00:51.829> we've<00:00:52.039> speed<00:00:52.549> of<00:00:52.670> this<00:00:52.760> up<00:00:52.940> so<00:00:53.030> you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
this test we've speed of this up so you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.119 
this test we've speed of this up so you
can<00:00:53.239> see<00:00:53.269> this<00:00:53.539> in<00:00:53.749> kind<00:00:53.989> of<00:00:54.049> fast<00:00:54.289> motion<00:00:54.530> but

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
can see this in kind of fast motion but

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.789 
can see this in kind of fast motion but
the<00:00:55.339> iPad<00:00:55.819> took<00:00:56.030> 20<00:00:56.389> 3.1<00:00:57.049> seconds<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.530> boot<00:00:57.649> up

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:57.799 
the iPad took 20 3.1 seconds to boot up

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.340 
the iPad took 20 3.1 seconds to boot up
while<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.339> netbook<00:00:58.760> took<00:00:59.119> 50<00:00:59.719> point<00:01:00.079> five

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350

seconds<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.829> boot<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:00.979> that's<00:01:01.190> almost<00:01:01.639> twice

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
seconds to boot up that's almost twice

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.660

as<00:01:01.999> long<00:01:02.449> now<00:01:03.139> our<00:01:03.289> next<00:01:03.319> test<00:01:03.859> we<00:01:04.159> decided<00:01:04.550> to

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
as long now our next test we decided to

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.730 
as long now our next test we decided to
load<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:04.940> our<00:01:05.030> favor<00:01:05.300> website<00:01:05.690> cnet.com<00:01:06.080> and

load up our favor website cnet.com and

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.890 
load up our favor website cnet.com and
see<00:01:07.160> how<00:01:07.310> long<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.670> takes<00:01:07.700> Safari<00:01:08.300> on<00:01:08.510> both

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
see how long it takes Safari on both

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.960 
see how long it takes Safari on both
systems<00:01:09.140> to<00:01:09.560> render<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:09.890> page<00:01:10.130> now<00:01:10.730> for<00:01:10.940> our

these machines now our next test is
probably<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:29.960> little<00:01:30.290> more<00:01:30.440> technical<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:31.190> took

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
probably a little more technical we took

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.580 
probably a little more technical we took
the<00:01:31.580> SunSpider<00:01:32.210> javascript<00:01:33.110> test<00:01:33.350> that's<00:01:33.530> a

the SunSpider javascript test that's a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.190

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
apples to oranges maybe some people

apples to oranges maybe some people
would<00:02:10.219> say<00:02:10.280> it's<00:02:10.489> more<00:02:10.609> like<00:02:10.759> oranges<00:02:11.150> to

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
would say it's more like oranges to

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.490 
would say it's more like oranges to

is<00:02:18.860> a<00:02:18.980> lot<00:02:19.100> faster<00:02:19.310> because<00:02:19.670> it's<00:02:19.940> really

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
is a lot faster because it's really

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.820 
is a lot faster because it's really
optimized<00:02:20.600> for<00:02:20.720> its<00:02:20.870> Hardware<00:02:21.230> when<00:02:21.590> you<00:02:21.680> take
