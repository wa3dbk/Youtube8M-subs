00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.290 
know which one should i get and you have
been<00:00:20.010> using<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.369> about<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> month<00:00:20.699> or<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
been using for about a month or so so I

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.939 
been using for about a month or so so I
thought<00:00:21.420> I'd<00:00:21.570> revisit<00:00:22.080> this<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.590> just<00:00:22.740> kind

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
thought I'd revisit this and just kind

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.890 
thought I'd revisit this and just kind
of<00:00:22.980> give<00:00:23.160> an<00:00:23.250> overview<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.300> three<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> them

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
of give an overview of all three of them

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
of give an overview of all three of them
you<00:00:25.050> know<00:00:25.109> basically<00:00:25.380> side<00:00:25.680> by<00:00:25.859> side<00:00:26.130> alright

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
you know basically side by side alright

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.189 
you know basically side by side alright
so<00:00:26.670> that's<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.970> idea<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.990> first

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
so that's the idea with this so first

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.540 
so that's the idea with this so first
let's<00:00:28.349> start<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> shuffle<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.460> on

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
let's start with the shuffle this is on

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.710 
let's start with the shuffle this is on
the<00:00:29.670> low<00:00:29.789> end<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.119> course<00:00:30.300> it'll<00:00:30.539> run<00:00:30.689> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the low end of course it'll run you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.690 
the low end of course it'll run you
fifty<00:00:31.080> bucks<00:00:31.289> has<00:00:31.529> two<00:00:31.740> gigs<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.160> memory<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
fifty bucks has two gigs of memory and

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700 
fifty bucks has two gigs of memory and
the<00:00:32.730> idea<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.570> shuffles<00:00:33.930> basically<00:00:34.380> it's

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the idea of the shuffles basically it's

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
the idea of the shuffles basically it's
the<00:00:34.920> lightest<00:00:35.309> weight<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.630> these

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the lightest weight of all of these

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
the lightest weight of all of these
bases<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.140> lowest<00:00:37.469> amount<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.710> storage<00:00:37.950> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
bases the lowest amount of storage the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.430 
bases the lowest amount of storage the
light<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> smallest<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.750> has<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> least

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
light is the smallest and has the least

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.830 
light is the smallest and has the least
features<00:00:40.920> new<00:00:41.579> though<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.030> does<00:00:42.210> have<00:00:42.390> support

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
features new though it does have support

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.090 
features new though it does have support
for<00:00:42.989> playlists<00:00:43.379> which<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:43.860> really

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
for playlists which is actually really

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.440 
for playlists which is actually really
cool<00:00:44.219> i<00:00:44.370> think<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.730> was<00:00:44.820> something<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> i

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cool i think that was something that i

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.940 
cool i think that was something that i
really<00:00:45.510> didn't<00:00:46.020> like<00:00:46.110> about<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> shuffle<00:00:46.829> is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
really didn't like about the shuffle is

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
really didn't like about the shuffle is
it<00:00:47.460> was<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.940> know<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> name<00:00:48.450> suggests

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it was you know as the name suggests

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.450 
it was you know as the name suggests
just<00:00:49.260> shuffles<00:00:49.620> through<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> music<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.309> now

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
just shuffles through the music but now

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.790 
just shuffles through the music but now
you<00:00:51.000> can<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.329> multiple<00:00:51.539> playlists<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.440> here

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
you can have multiple playlists on here

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
you can have multiple playlists on here
and<00:00:52.949> easily<00:00:53.430> change<00:00:53.789> playlist<00:00:54.270> that<00:00:54.390> makes<00:00:54.660> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
and easily change playlist that makes a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869 
and easily change playlist that makes a
shuffle<00:00:55.050> much<00:00:55.260> more<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:56.250> know<00:00:56.309> interesting<00:00:56.579> i

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
shuffle much more you know interesting i

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760 
shuffle much more you know interesting i
think<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.420> i<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> quite<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.590> bit

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
think to me i use this quite a bit

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.500 
think to me i use this quite a bit
actually<00:00:58.920> i've<00:00:59.460> left<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.910> my<00:00:59.940> car<00:01:00.210> and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
actually i've left this in my car and

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.610 
actually i've left this in my car and
basically<00:01:00.719> i'll<00:01:00.840> listen<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.500> know<00:01:01.590> on

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620

the<00:01:01.800> road<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.160> whatnot<00:01:02.340> nice<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.510> way<00:01:03.570> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the road or whatnot nice little way just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:04.969 
the road or whatnot nice little way just
to<00:01:03.899> basically<00:01:04.049> have<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.379> portable<00:01:04.710> storage

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to basically have some portable storage

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.429 
to basically have some portable storage
with<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:06.210> this<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.810> nano<00:01:07.080> has

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
with you so that's this one the nano has

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.990 
with you so that's this one the nano has
basically<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.070> big<00:01:08.250> transformation<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.939> know

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
basically a big transformation you know

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.450 
basically a big transformation you know
before<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.510> was<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.470> larger<00:01:10.860> version<00:01:11.250> had<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
before it was the larger version had a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
before it was the larger version had a
camera<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.720> fifth<00:01:12.869> gen

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
camera on it in the in the fifth gen

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
camera on it in the in the fifth gen
this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.470> 6th<00:01:13.770> gen<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.820> we<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.150> touch

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
this is the 6th gen now we have a touch

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
this is the 6th gen now we have a touch
screen<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.960> has<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> multi-touch<00:01:16.920> screen

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
screen on it has a multi-touch screen

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
screen on it has a multi-touch screen
basically<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.299> can<00:01:18.450> flick<00:01:18.689> through<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
basically you can flick through the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
basically you can flick through the

device<00:01:36.180> all<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.509> but<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.750> sizes<00:01:37.140> are<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
device all right but the sizes are the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.170 
device all right but the sizes are the
same<00:01:37.439> you<00:01:37.740> got<00:01:37.860> eight<00:01:38.040> gigs<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.430> 16<00:01:38.850> gigs<00:01:39.060> in

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
the prices are also the same so it's a

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.010 
the prices are also the same so it's a
little<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> step<00:01:41.790> up<00:01:42.000> between<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.720> but

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
little like a step up between this but

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.710 
little like a step up between this but
before<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.549> touch<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.970> I've<00:01:45.390> been<00:01:45.540> kind

before the the touch and I've been kind

before the the touch and I've been kind
of<00:01:45.750> called<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> ipod<00:01:46.439> shuffle<00:01:46.829> touch<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> kind

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
of what I've been calling it because

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
of what I've been calling it because
it's<00:01:48.930> sort<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> shuffle<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> terms

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's sort of like the shuffle in terms

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's sort of like the shuffle in terms
of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> size<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.259> weight<00:01:52.590> but<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> has<00:01:53.220> a

little bit more you can get up to 16
gigs<00:03:35.120> I<00:03:35.360> think<00:03:35.630> 16<00:03:36.050> or<00:03:36.230> it's<00:03:36.320> gonna<00:03:36.380> be<00:03:36.500> 32<00:03:36.890> gigs

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
gigs I think 16 or it's gonna be 32 gigs

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.890 
gigs I think 16 or it's gonna be 32 gigs
I<00:03:37.250> think<00:03:37.430> 32<00:03:37.700> gig<00:03:38.060> is<00:03:38.240> actually<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.660> sweet

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
I think 32 gig is actually the sweet

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.080 
I think 32 gig is actually the sweet
spot<00:03:39.170> you<00:03:39.560> get<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> lot<00:03:40.040> more<00:03:40.070> storage<00:03:40.580> for<00:03:40.820> not

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
spot you get a lot more storage for not

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.970 
spot you get a lot more storage for not
a<00:03:41.120> whole<00:03:41.450> lot<00:03:41.630> more<00:03:41.810> money<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.320> if<00:03:42.709> you<00:03:42.860> just
