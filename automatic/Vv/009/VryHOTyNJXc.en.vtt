I think that was a pretty cool character
I<00:01:39.920> think<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.159> would<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.340> been<00:01:40.370> a<00:01:40.460> lot<00:01:40.640> better

I think it would have been a lot better

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
just pops on but that really kind of

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.110 
just pops on but that really kind of
makes<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.920> different<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.790> doesn't<00:02:23.060> actually

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120

them<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.880> they<00:02:47.180> tend<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.510> spread<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.140> face

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
them is they tend to spread the face

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620 
them is they tend to spread the face
over<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.250> body<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.670> I'm<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:49.970> too<00:02:50.210> keen<00:02:50.420> on
