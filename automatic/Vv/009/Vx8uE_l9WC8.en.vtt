on<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.860> back<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.280> counterweight<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.920> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920

of one of my bushes out there so I kind
of<00:00:32.719> not<00:00:33.719> real<00:00:33.899> impressed<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.649> guy<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
of not real impressed with the guy that

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.100 
of not real impressed with the guy that
topped<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.520> maybe<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.450> shouldn't<00:00:36.719> say<00:00:36.899> that<00:00:36.930> on

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
topped it maybe I shouldn't say that on

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.180 
topped it maybe I shouldn't say that on
here<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.149> don't<00:00:39.149> know<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.620> almost<00:00:40.620> wished<00:00:41.070> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
here but I don't know I almost wished I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.680 
here but I don't know I almost wished I
would<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.399> just<00:00:41.670> topped<00:00:41.879> it<00:00:42.059> myself<00:00:42.239> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
would have just topped it myself and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.150 
would have just topped it myself and
then<00:00:44.809> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> adjusted<00:00:46.260> rate<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.620> logs<00:00:46.920> or

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
then kind of adjusted rate on logs or

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
then kind of adjusted rate on logs or
something<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:48.360> anyways<00:00:48.690> here's<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
something but so anyways here's the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.299 
something but so anyways here's the
simplicity<00:00:50.899> got<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.079> loader<00:00:52.590> on<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.070> it's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
simplicity got the loader on here it's a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.240 
simplicity got the loader on here it's a
simplicity<00:00:53.670> loader<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.739> tiller<00:00:55.949> came

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
simplicity loader and the tiller came

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.189 
simplicity loader and the tiller came
came<00:00:56.789> from<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.059> simplicity<00:00:57.270> dealer<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> I'm

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
came from the simplicity dealer to I'm

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.619 
came from the simplicity dealer to I'm
not<00:00:58.350> sure<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.710> simplicity<00:00:59.280> simplicity<00:01:00.090> made

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
not sure for simplicity simplicity made

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.549 
not sure for simplicity simplicity made
the<00:01:00.750> tiller<00:01:00.989> or<00:01:01.079> not<00:01:02.210> but<00:01:03.210> his<00:01:04.170> tiller<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the tiller or not but his tiller is

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
the tiller or not but his tiller is
heavy<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.610> really<00:01:05.939> works<00:01:06.119> well<00:01:06.330> as

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
heavy and it really really works well as

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
heavy and it really really works well as
a<00:01:06.540> counterweight<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.000> I'm<00:01:09.750> gonna<00:01:09.979> go<00:01:10.979> ahead

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
a counterweight so I'm gonna go ahead

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.240 
a counterweight so I'm gonna go ahead
and<00:01:11.159> start<00:01:11.460> her<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.500> then<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:13.619> think<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.070> got

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and start her up and then I think I got

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.380 
and start her up and then I think I got
a<00:01:15.259> I'll<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.530> use<00:01:16.650> some<00:01:17.060> chains<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> stuff

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
a I'll have to use some chains and stuff

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.910 
a I'll have to use some chains and stuff
like<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:18.869> I'll<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.259> get<00:01:19.409> those<00:01:19.560> around

about calling a cold start or anything
but<00:01:40.610> basically<00:01:41.610> give<00:01:42.180> her<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.450> toke

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.520 

I've<00:02:53.299> actually<00:02:53.599> got<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:53.930> little<00:02:53.989> bit<00:02:54.170> of<00:02:54.319> snow<00:02:54.409> I

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
I've actually got a little bit of snow I

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.059 
I've actually got a little bit of snow I
need<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.920> fall<00:02:55.159> before<00:02:55.400> I<00:02:56.680> we're<00:02:57.680> done<00:02:57.860> his

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
need to fall before I we're done his

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.619 
need to fall before I we're done his
limbs<00:02:58.310> so<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.549> think<00:02:58.819> I'm<00:02:58.909> gonna<00:02:59.090> set<00:02:59.269> up<00:02:59.299> let

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
limbs so I think I'm gonna set up let

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:00.839 
limbs so I think I'm gonna set up let
you<00:02:59.780> watch<00:02:59.930> me

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:21.460 
you watch me
loader<00:03:01.849> see<00:03:02.540> how<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:02.780> works<00:03:02.959> for<00:03:03.140> snow

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:07:12.020 

you<00:03:21.980> know<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.250> does<00:03:22.430> for<00:03:22.670> zoom
