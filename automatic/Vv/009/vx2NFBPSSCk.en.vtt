well he guarded when he was two years
old<00:04:29.190> but<00:04:29.729> it<00:04:29.850> was<00:04:29.940> it<00:04:30.180> was<00:04:30.300> negative<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.020> what

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
old but it was it was negative so what

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.650 
old but it was it was negative so what
is<00:04:31.590> there<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:32.130> tell<00:04:32.310> well<00:04:32.970> actually<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
tested too young getting tested anytime

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.000 
tested too young getting tested anytime
before<00:04:45.330> three<00:04:45.690> months<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:46.020> age<00:04:46.199> you'll<00:04:46.800> get<00:04:46.949> a

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
before three months of age you'll get a

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.879 
before three months of age you'll get a
false<00:04:47.250> negative<00:04:47.490> so<00:04:48.479> go<00:04:49.320> ahead<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.530> get<00:04:49.710> me<00:04:49.860> a

false negative so go ahead and get me a

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.200 
false negative so go ahead and get me a
peripheral<00:04:50.340> blood<00:04:50.520> smear<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
peripheral blood smear and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.020 
peripheral blood smear and
electrophoresis<00:04:52.460> 16<00:04:53.460> is<00:04:53.580> too<00:04:53.820> late<00:04:53.970> for

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
electrophoresis 16 is too late for

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.300 
electrophoresis 16 is too late for
sentence<00:04:54.540> to<00:04:54.870> start<00:04:55.169> showing<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.860> mean<00:04:56.070> why

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
sentence to start showing up I mean why

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.540 
sentence to start showing up I mean why
now<00:04:56.520> well<00:04:57.449> you<00:04:57.810> did<00:04:58.110> say<00:04:58.470> that<00:04:58.830> he<00:04:58.949> moved<00:04:59.190> to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
now well you did say that he moved to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.000 
now well you did say that he moved to
Aspen<00:05:00.300> from<00:05:00.479> California<00:05:01.080> which<00:05:01.289> has<00:05:01.560> a<00:05:01.590> lower

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
Aspen from California which has a lower

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.510 
Aspen from California which has a lower
altitude<00:05:02.340> than<00:05:02.970> appear<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:03.570> rest<00:05:03.750> and<00:05:04.520> he

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
altitude than appear in rest and he

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.820 
altitude than appear in rest and he
might<00:05:05.789> have<00:05:05.820> had<00:05:06.180> an<00:05:06.389> inflation<00:05:07.080> with<00:05:07.440> further

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
might have had an inflation with further

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.520 
might have had an inflation with further
neat<00:05:08.160> photo<00:05:08.580> beginning<00:05:09.360> him<00:05:09.600> well<00:05:10.169> can<00:05:10.410> it

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
neat photo beginning him well can it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.050 
neat photo beginning him well can it
looks<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:11.160> drew<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.580> short<00:05:11.850> straw

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
looks like you drew the short straw

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.900 
looks like you drew the short straw

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
don't I tell you more about sickle cell

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.310 
don't I tell you more about sickle cell
anemia<00:05:23.220> you<00:05:24.210> inherited<00:05:24.660> it<00:05:24.810> from<00:05:24.840> both<00:05:25.139> your

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
anemia you inherited it from both your

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.870 
anemia you inherited it from both your
mother<00:05:25.440> and<00:05:25.590> your<00:05:25.830> father<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.400> it's<00:05:26.789> a

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
mother and your father and it's a

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.640 
mother and your father and it's a
disease<00:05:27.150> that<00:05:27.210> affects<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.840> hemoglobin<00:05:28.530> in

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
disease that affects the hemoglobin in

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.320 
disease that affects the hemoglobin in
your<00:05:28.680> red<00:05:28.889> blood<00:05:28.919> cells<00:05:29.340> do<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.120> know<00:05:30.180> what

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
your red blood cells do you know what

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.500 
your red blood cells do you know what
hemoglobin<00:05:30.780> is<00:05:30.900> oh<00:05:31.800> yeah<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:33.030> learned<00:05:33.419> that

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
hemoglobin is oh yeah I learned that

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.890 
hemoglobin is oh yeah I learned that
biology<00:05:34.639> oxygen<00:05:35.639> attaches<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.419> and<00:05:36.630> then

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
biology oxygen attaches to it and then

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.800 
biology oxygen attaches to it and then
that<00:05:37.139> supplies<00:05:37.620> our<00:05:37.830> whole<00:05:37.950> buddy<00:05:38.810> good

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
that supplies our whole buddy good

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.810 
that supplies our whole buddy good
you're<00:05:40.020> right<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.470> sickle<00:05:41.010> cell<00:05:41.190> anemia<00:05:41.610> the

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
you're right and sickle cell anemia the

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.879 
you're right and sickle cell anemia the
hemoglobin<00:05:42.419> molecule<00:05:42.870> is<00:05:43.110> mutated<00:05:43.680> and

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
hemoglobin molecule is mutated and

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.500 
hemoglobin molecule is mutated and
instead<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.550> keeping<00:05:44.669> its<00:05:44.940> normal<00:05:45.270> round

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
instead of keeping its normal round

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.050 
instead of keeping its normal round
shape<00:05:45.870> and<00:05:46.110> collecting<00:05:47.070> oxygen<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.789> makes<00:05:47.940> the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
shape and collecting oxygen it makes the

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.029 
shape and collecting oxygen it makes the
blood<00:05:48.180> cells<00:05:48.510> dip<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.500> makes<00:05:49.650> it<00:05:49.770> fold

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
blood cells dip and it makes it fold

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.379 
blood cells dip and it makes it fold
into<00:05:50.220> a<00:05:50.280> crescent<00:05:50.520> they'll<00:05:50.789> kind<00:05:51.030> of<00:05:51.150> like<00:05:51.240> the

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
into a crescent they'll kind of like the

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:54.080 
into a crescent they'll kind of like the
edge<00:05:51.690> of<00:05:51.810> your<00:05:51.930> fingernail<00:05:52.380> oh<00:05:52.669> is<00:05:53.669> that<00:05:53.940> why
