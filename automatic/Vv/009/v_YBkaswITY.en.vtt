up<00:01:42.570> doing<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> hand<00:01:43.140> hammering<00:01:43.530> ourselves

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
up doing the hand hammering ourselves

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.499

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
absolutely it was gonna cost so much

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.859

more<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.790> done<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.570> thought<00:01:48.720> well

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
more to have it done and I thought well
