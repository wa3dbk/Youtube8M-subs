and<00:00:43.170> check<00:00:44.070> for<00:00:44.100> any<00:00:44.280> fray<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.120> file

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and check for any fray and you can file

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
and check for any fray and you can file
that<00:00:45.629> down<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:46.200> double-check<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:47.039> while
