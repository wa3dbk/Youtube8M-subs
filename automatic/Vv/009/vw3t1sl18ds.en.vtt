distortion<00:00:54.120> pedals<00:00:54.479> so<00:00:55.440> you're<00:00:55.769> gonna<00:00:55.859> have

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
distortion pedals so you're gonna have

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.559 
distortion pedals so you're gonna have
to<00:00:56.069> use<00:00:56.249> the<00:00:56.629> on-board<00:00:57.629> distortion<00:00:59.089> it<00:01:00.089> takes

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
to use the on-board distortion it takes

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.680 
to use the on-board distortion it takes
some<00:01:00.989> tweaking<00:01:01.499> to<00:01:01.879> get<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> good<00:01:03.209> sound<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.629> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
some tweaking to get a good sound out of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.830 
some tweaking to get a good sound out of
this<00:01:03.870> amp<00:01:04.170> for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> distortion<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this amp for the distortion and on the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.930 
this amp for the distortion and on the
drive<00:01:10.260> channel<00:01:10.620> doesn't<00:01:11.340> really<00:01:11.460> have<00:01:11.730> that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
drive channel doesn't really have that

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.750

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.630 

as<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.080> can<00:02:02.200> see<00:02:02.410> it's<00:02:02.560> very<00:02:02.620> clear<00:02:03.370> very

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
as you can see it's very clear very

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.250

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
glassy now on to the drive channel I

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.870 
glassy now on to the drive channel I
have<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.470> distortion<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.430> tin

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
have the distortion of tin

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.210 
have the distortion of tin
oh<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.540> I've<00:02:13.660> had<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:14.020> reverb<00:02:14.410> on<00:02:14.590> five<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
oh and I've had the reverb on five and

00:02:15.220 --> 00:03:37.650 
oh and I've had the reverb on five and
I'm<00:02:15.370> going<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.610> leave<00:02:16.030> it

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.890 

and<00:03:38.170> it's<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> drive<00:03:38.770> channel<00:03:39.190> for<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
and it's the drive channel for you it's

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.670 
and it's the drive channel for you it's
pretty<00:03:41.320> good

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
pretty good

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:48.930 
pretty good
I<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:43.120> good<00:03:43.360> for<00:03:43.630> what<00:03:44.170> I<00:03:44.200> do<00:03:45.960> now<00:03:46.960> on<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
I it's good for what I do now on to the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.070 
I it's good for what I do now on to the
more<00:03:49.870> drive<00:03:50.170> channel

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
more drive channel

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
more drive channel
I<00:03:52.590> think<00:03:53.220> it's<00:03:53.310> really<00:03:53.670> fuzzy<00:03:54.090> so<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:54.960> don't<00:03:55.350> use

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
I think it's really fuzzy so I don't use

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:19.789 
I think it's really fuzzy so I don't use
it<00:03:56.130> but

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.240 

so<00:04:21.210> that's<00:04:22.210> all<00:04:22.629> that<00:04:22.690> for<00:04:23.139> you<00:04:23.259> um<00:04:23.470> you<00:04:24.099> know<00:04:24.220> I

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
so that's all that for you um you know I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.920 
so that's all that for you um you know I
think<00:04:24.580> the<00:04:24.759> clean<00:04:24.970> channel<00:04:25.330> is<00:04:25.419> very<00:04:25.690> very

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
think the clean channel is very very

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.140 
think the clean channel is very very
good<00:04:26.169> I<00:04:26.410> recommend<00:04:27.069> it<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.370> anybody<00:04:27.729> who<00:04:27.940> plays

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
good I recommend it to anybody who plays

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.760 
good I recommend it to anybody who plays
blues<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:30.360> or<00:04:31.360> plays<00:04:32.280> anything<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:34.120> would

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
blues or or plays anything that would

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.029 
blues or or plays anything that would
need<00:04:35.770> a<00:04:35.830> good<00:04:36.069> clean<00:04:36.370> channel<00:04:36.759> like<00:04:38.039> like

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
need a good clean channel like like

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:56.520 
need a good clean channel like like
reggae<00:04:53.069> so<00:04:54.270> in<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.389> drive<00:04:55.720> channel<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:56.229> guess

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
reggae so in the drive channel I guess

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.070 
reggae so in the drive channel I guess
for<00:04:56.860> rock<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:57.880> I<00:04:57.909> would<00:04:58.210> not<00:04:58.449> recommend<00:04:58.750> this

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
for rock but I would not recommend this

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.960 
for rock but I would not recommend this
amp<00:04:59.409> to<00:04:59.650> any<00:04:59.979> metal<00:05:02.069> so<00:05:04.710> it's<00:05:05.710> 100<00:05:06.370> watts<00:05:06.610> it's

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
amp to any metal so it's 100 watts it's

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.640
