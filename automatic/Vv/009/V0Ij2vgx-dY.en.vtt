00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.970 
and i thought that i could pull it off
by<00:03:24.250> not<00:03:24.519> putting<00:03:24.730> flash<00:03:25.090> on<00:03:25.380> instead<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.440> got<00:03:26.829> an

by not putting flash on instead I got an

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.440 
by not putting flash on instead I got an
understood<00:03:27.459> spose<00:03:27.820> picture<00:03:29.250> so

and you probably don't make can't really
make<00:03:34.870> what<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:35.410> but<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:36.730> like<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:36.910> trade

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300
