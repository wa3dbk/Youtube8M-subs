running people into your sentry gun you

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.309 
running people into your sentry gun you
rack<00:02:10.099> up<00:02:10.310> so<00:02:10.729> many<00:02:11.000> kills<00:02:11.360> with<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:11.780> entry<00:02:12.170> in

rack up so many kills with this entry in

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.619 
rack up so many kills with this entry in
this<00:02:12.500> position<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.730> i<00:02:13.760> get<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.120> soldier<00:02:14.450> off

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.270 
this position so i get this soldier off
guard<00:02:14.870> he<00:02:15.110> wasn't<00:02:15.409> expecting<00:02:15.799> a<00:02:15.860> century<00:02:16.220> I

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
guard he wasn't expecting a century I

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.740 
guard he wasn't expecting a century I
don't<00:02:16.519> think<00:02:16.760> either<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.390> or<00:02:17.420> he<00:02:17.599> was

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
don't think either that or he was

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.899 
don't think either that or he was
distracted<00:02:18.290> with<00:02:18.379> something<00:02:18.680> its<00:02:18.799> spawn<00:02:19.129> who

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
distracted with something its spawn who

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.640 
distracted with something its spawn who
knows<00:02:20.150> he's<00:02:20.599> didn't<00:02:20.870> even<00:02:21.019> turn<00:02:21.110> around<00:02:21.409> once

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
knows he's didn't even turn around once

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.649 
knows he's didn't even turn around once
