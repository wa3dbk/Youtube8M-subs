00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.669 
trailer calm a question I get often is
regarding<00:00:10.730> how<00:00:11.540> to<00:00:11.570> choose<00:00:11.959> the<00:00:12.320> number<00:00:12.469> of

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:12.679 
regarding how to choose the number of

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.799 
regarding how to choose the number of
sets<00:00:12.980> and<00:00:13.249> reps<00:00:13.639> when<00:00:13.910> designing<00:00:14.240> a<00:00:14.419> training

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
sets and reps when designing a training

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.650 
sets and reps when designing a training
program<00:00:15.169> okay<00:00:16.090> there's<00:00:17.090> an<00:00:17.270> inverse

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
program okay there's an inverse

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.630 
program okay there's an inverse
relationship<00:00:17.810> between<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.860> number<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:19.280> reps

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
relationship between the number of reps

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.240 
relationship between the number of reps
and<00:00:19.910> sets<00:00:20.360> okay<00:00:20.900> so<00:00:21.020> depending<00:00:21.830> on<00:00:22.040> the

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
and sets okay so depending on the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.180 
and sets okay so depending on the
objective<00:00:22.970> of<00:00:23.120> the<00:00:23.300> client<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:24.500> level<00:00:25.040> of

the trainee it will determine how many
it<00:00:29.270> will<00:00:29.540> determine<00:00:29.990> the<00:00:30.050> number<00:00:30.200> of<00:00:30.350> reps

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
it will determine the number of reps

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.860 
it will determine the number of reps
that<00:00:30.830> you<00:00:30.950> perform<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.700> that<00:00:32.239> number<00:00:32.509> will

goal is geared towards muscular

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.069 
goal is geared towards muscular
endurance<00:00:40.190> then<00:00:41.149> you<00:00:41.329> want<00:00:41.510> to<00:00:41.600> perform<00:00:41.929> a

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
endurance then you want to perform a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.169 
endurance then you want to perform a
higher<00:00:42.320> number<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.800> repetitions<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.699> if

00:00:44.169 --> 00:00:44.179 
higher number of repetitions and if

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:46.000 
higher number of repetitions and if
there's<00:00:44.359> a<00:00:44.449> higher<00:00:44.659> number<00:00:44.929> of<00:00:45.199> reps<00:00:45.499> there

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
there's a higher number of reps there

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.700 
there's a higher number of reps there
should<00:00:46.339> thus<00:00:46.640> be<00:00:46.670> a<00:00:47.149> lower<00:00:47.539> number<00:00:47.659> of<00:00:48.170> sets

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
should thus be a lower number of sets

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.369 
should thus be a lower number of sets
okay<00:00:49.280> if<00:00:49.909> the<00:00:50.120> goal<00:00:50.390> on<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.719> other<00:00:50.809> hand<00:00:51.050> is

muscle mass you want to utilize a
moderate<00:00:56.870> range<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.530> repetitions<00:00:58.280> and<00:00:58.539> thus<00:00:59.539> a

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
moderate range of repetitions and thus a

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.040 
moderate range of repetitions and thus a
moderate<00:01:00.350> range<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.979> sex<00:01:01.969> okay<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:02.479> here<00:01:02.929> we

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
moderate range of sex okay so here we

have absolute strength where the goal is
to<00:01:05.390> increase<00:01:05.690> strength<00:01:06.320> irrespective<00:01:07.280> of

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
to increase strength irrespective of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.310 
to increase strength irrespective of
body<00:01:07.579> weight<00:01:07.759> if<00:01:08.270> on<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.509> other<00:01:08.689> hand<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
body weight if on the other hand the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.840 
body weight if on the other hand the
goal<00:01:09.530> is<00:01:10.270> maximum<00:01:11.270> strength<00:01:11.630> speed<00:01:12.140> or<00:01:12.439> power

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
goal is maximum strength speed or power

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.380 
goal is maximum strength speed or power
you'll<00:01:13.850> use<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.509> lower<00:01:14.930> rep<00:01:15.649> bracket<00:01:16.189> and<00:01:16.399> if

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
you'll use a lower rep bracket and if

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
you'll use a lower rep bracket and if
you<00:01:17.570> do<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:18.020> lower<00:01:18.320> number<00:01:18.350> of<00:01:18.710> reps<00:01:18.920> you<00:01:19.189> should

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
you do a lower number of reps you should

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.459 
you do a lower number of reps you should
do<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.549> higher<00:01:20.000> number<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.450> sets<00:01:20.810> okay<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:21.200> this

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
do a higher number of sets okay so this

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:23.050 
do a higher number of sets okay so this
is<00:01:21.680> for<00:01:21.860> people<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.460> are<00:01:22.579> interested<00:01:22.759> in

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
is for people that are interested in

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.060 
is for people that are interested in
increasing<00:01:23.420> their<00:01:23.750> strength<00:01:24.140> but<00:01:24.380> not<00:01:24.860> their

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
increasing their strength but not their

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.240 
increasing their strength but not their
body<00:01:25.280> weight<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.030> any<00:01:26.570> power<00:01:27.079> speed<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.950> for

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
body weight so any power speed is for

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.429 
body weight so any power speed is for
any<00:01:28.549> sport<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:28.969> involves<00:01:29.240> jumping
