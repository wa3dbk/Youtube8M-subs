today we're going to make a hopping frog

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.160 
today we're going to make a hopping frog
we're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.030> start<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.570> rectangular

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
we're going to start with a rectangular

we're going to start with a rectangular
sheet<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.469> paper<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.280> you're<00:00:11.969> going<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.120> start

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
sheet of paper and you're going to start

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.980 
sheet of paper and you're going to start
with<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.870> blank<00:00:13.349> side<00:00:13.650> down<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.839> we're<00:00:15.839> going

with the blank side down and we're going

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.960 
with the blank side down and we're going
to<00:00:16.020> fold<00:00:16.260> one<00:00:16.500> corner<00:00:17.090> over<00:00:18.090> like<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
to fold one corner over like this and

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.880 
to fold one corner over like this and
then<00:00:20.970> open<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.420> up<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.630> then<00:00:22.199> fold<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890

off to the side like that it's one of
the<00:00:55.260> front<00:00:55.530> legs<00:00:56.000> do<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.120> same<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.660> other

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the front legs do the same on the other

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.560 
the front legs do the same on the other
side<00:00:59.329> now<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.629> make<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.550> body<00:01:02.570> so

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
side now we're going to make the body so

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.570 
side now we're going to make the body so
bring<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.960> bottom<00:01:04.350> sheet<00:01:04.650> right<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bring this bottom sheet right up to the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.820 
bring this bottom sheet right up to the
middle<00:01:06.470> and<00:01:08.119> then<00:01:09.119> we're<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.770> make<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
middle and then we're going to make a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.100 
middle and then we're going to make a
full<00:01:11.760> right<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> middle<00:01:12.570> here<00:01:12.659> just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
full right in the middle here just

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.789 
full right in the middle here just
really<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.590> find<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.920> where<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.250> middle<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
really to find out where the middle is

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.550 
really to find out where the middle is
so<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.400> crease<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:18.560> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
so just make a little crease there and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.390 
so just make a little crease there and
we're<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.799> take<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.220> edge<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
we're going to take this edge to that

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560 
we're going to take this edge to that
little<00:01:23.400> crease<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.150> we're<00:01:24.299> going<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.479> go

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
little crease and we're going to go

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.560 
little crease and we're going to go
underneath<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.380> front<00:01:25.590> legs<00:01:26.479> so<00:01:27.479> I'm<00:01:27.540> going

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
underneath the front legs so I'm going

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.800 
underneath the front legs so I'm going
to<00:01:27.750> fold<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.080> underneath<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> front<00:01:28.799> legs

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
to fold it underneath the front legs

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.590 
to fold it underneath the front legs
right<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> middle<00:01:31.790> like<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:33.390> going

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
right to the middle like that I'm going

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.609 
right to the middle like that I'm going
to<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.810> same<00:01:34.049> thing<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> other<00:01:34.470> side

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
to do the same thing on the other side

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.120 
to do the same thing on the other side
so<00:01:35.159> they<00:01:35.369> meet<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.270> middle<00:01:39.890> okay<00:01:40.890> I'm

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so they meet in the middle okay I'm

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.760 
so they meet in the middle okay I'm
going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> bring<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.700> bottom<00:01:42.180> sheet<00:01:42.770> get

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
going to bring this bottom sheet get

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.420 
going to bring this bottom sheet get
into<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.100> middle

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.050 

and<00:01:48.330> this<00:01:48.510> is<00:01:48.690> the<00:01:48.840> tricky<00:01:49.320> part<00:01:49.350> now<00:01:50.060> I'm

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
and this is the tricky part now I'm

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.780 
and this is the tricky part now I'm
going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.330> open<00:01:51.480> this<00:01:51.660> up<00:01:52.220> take<00:01:53.220> these<00:01:53.490> two

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
going to open this up take these two

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.190 
going to open this up take these two
corners<00:01:54.540> here<00:01:54.780> bring<00:01:55.110> them<00:01:55.260> out<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.830> side

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
corners here bring them out to the side

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.880 
corners here bring them out to the side
and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.350> flatten<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.980> down<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and then flatten it down so that it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:13.780 
and then flatten it down so that it
looks<00:02:05.869> like<00:02:06.869> this<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> we've<00:02:11.220> done<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.870> fold<00:02:12.870> it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
looks like this so we've done is fold it

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.240 
looks like this so we've done is fold it
so<00:02:14.790> from<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.690> bringing<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.770> up<00:02:16.980> these<00:02:17.250> two

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
so from here bringing this up these two

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.640 
so from here bringing this up these two
corners<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.520> then<00:02:21.030> folding<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.570> down<00:02:21.780> these

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
corners and then folding it down these

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.860 
corners and then folding it down these
don't<00:02:22.830> have<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.100> come<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> point<00:02:23.970> like

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
don't have to come to the point like

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.940 
don't have to come to the point like
they<00:02:25.050> are<00:02:25.670> here<00:02:26.670> just<00:02:27.200> cut<00:02:28.200> them<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.560> an<00:02:28.650> angle

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
they are here just cut them to an angle

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.620 
they are here just cut them to an angle
like<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.000> same<00:02:30.150> way<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.420> did<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
like that in the same way we did the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.030 
like that in the same way we did the
front<00:02:30.870> legs<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.350> do<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:31.680> legs

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
front legs going to do the back legs

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.710 
front legs going to do the back legs
again<00:02:32.459> put<00:02:32.700> your<00:02:32.880> finger<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.270> mill<00:02:33.480> here

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
again put your finger in the mill here

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.810 
again put your finger in the mill here
and<00:02:34.320> then<00:02:34.800> turn<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:35.820> one<00:02:36.120> sheet<00:02:36.420> back<00:02:36.900> and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
and then turn this one sheet back and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.030 
and then turn this one sheet back and
angle<00:02:38.820> so<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.480> comes<00:02:39.989> out<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.910> same<00:02:42.150> thing

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
angle so it comes out and the same thing

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.430 
angle so it comes out and the same thing
on<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> other<00:02:44.310> side<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:46.170> then<00:02:46.260> we're<00:02:46.410> just

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
on the other side and then we're just

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.220 
on the other side and then we're just
going<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.739> flip<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.100> over<00:02:47.720> we're<00:02:48.720> almost<00:02:48.810> done

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
going to flip it over we're almost done

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.020 
going to flip it over we're almost done
we're<00:02:49.470> going<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> fold<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.160> in<00:02:50.370> half<00:02:50.400> work

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
we're going to fold it in half work

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.680 
we're going to fold it in half work
naturally<00:02:51.959> fold<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:53.030> so<00:02:54.030> it's<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.390> for<00:02:54.570> all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
naturally fold here so it's just for all

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.860 
naturally fold here so it's just for all
these<00:02:54.840> things<00:02:55.140> meet<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.980> then<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.180> last<00:02:57.390> fold

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
these things meet and then one last fold

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.680 
these things meet and then one last fold
is<00:02:58.190> going<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.459> not<00:02:59.730> in<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.330> middle<00:03:00.660> here

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
is going to be not in the middle here

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.020 
is going to be not in the middle here
but<00:03:01.650> just<00:03:01.890> a<00:03:02.040> little<00:03:02.160> bit<00:03:02.340> below<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:02.610> middle

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
but just a little bit below the middle

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.300 
but just a little bit below the middle
and<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:06.480> it's<00:03:06.630> going<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.810> be<00:03:06.900> /<00:03:07.769> fold<00:03:08.130> it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
and so it's going to be / fold it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.490 
and so it's going to be / fold it's
going<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.549> be<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> little<00:03:08.910> bit<00:03:09.090> below<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
going to be a little bit below the

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.490 
going to be a little bit below the
midpoint<00:03:10.680> here<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.400> reason<00:03:12.360> is<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:13.200> make<00:03:13.350> it

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
midpoint here and reason is to make it

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.270 
midpoint here and reason is to make it
hop<00:03:14.060> I'm<00:03:15.060> going<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.299> use<00:03:15.390> two<00:03:15.630> hands<00:03:16.280> you're

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
hop I'm going to use two hands you're

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.830 
hop I'm going to use two hands you're
going<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.180> want<00:03:18.299> to<00:03:18.390> push<00:03:18.690> this

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
going to you don't want to push this

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.360 
going to you don't want to push this
down<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.290> hire<00:03:19.530> otherwise<00:03:20.010> it's<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
down to hire otherwise it's going to

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.759 
down to hire otherwise it's going to
lose<00:03:20.519> his<00:03:20.700> hop<00:03:20.970> and<00:03:21.780> put<00:03:21.930> your<00:03:22.080> thumb<00:03:22.320> lightly

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
lose his hop and put your thumb lightly

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.759 
lose his hop and put your thumb lightly
on<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.070> top<00:03:23.370> part<00:03:23.700> here<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.390> then<00:03:25.140> just<00:03:25.380> move

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
on this top part here and then just move

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.150 
on this top part here and then just move
your<00:03:25.920> thumb<00:03:26.160> down<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.239> and<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.980> reason

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
your thumb down like that and the reason

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.979 
your thumb down like that and the reason
by<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.760> way<00:03:29.910> that<00:03:30.090> this<00:03:30.299> is<00:03:30.540> below<00:03:30.959> the

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
by the way that this is below the

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.620 
by the way that this is below the
midpoint<00:03:31.579> because<00:03:32.579> otherwise<00:03:32.880> when<00:03:33.510> you're

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
midpoint because otherwise when you're

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.710 
midpoint because otherwise when you're
doing<00:03:33.810> this<00:03:34.640> you<00:03:35.640> see<00:03:35.820> right<00:03:36.000> now<00:03:36.030> if<00:03:36.570> you

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
doing this you see right now if you

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.390 
doing this you see right now if you
looked<00:03:36.930> at<00:03:37.019> from<00:03:37.200> above<00:03:37.590> you<00:03:37.950> wouldn't<00:03:38.220> see

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
looked at from above you wouldn't see

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.050 
looked at from above you wouldn't see
the<00:03:38.519> bottom<00:03:38.880> part<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:40.100> if<00:03:41.100> it<00:03:41.700> were<00:03:41.790> right<00:03:41.970> in

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
the bottom part and if it were right in

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.210 
the bottom part and if it were right in
the<00:03:42.090> middle<00:03:42.329> though<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:42.959> your<00:03:43.440> thumb<00:03:43.709> moving

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
the middle though this your thumb moving

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.430 
the middle though this your thumb moving
down<00:03:44.340> might<00:03:44.549> get<00:03:44.730> caught<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.180> this<00:03:45.440> second

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
down might get caught on this second

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.190 
down might get caught on this second
part<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.890> that's<00:03:47.040> why<00:03:47.220> you<00:03:47.280> want<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:48.170> make<00:03:49.170> sure

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
part so that's why you want to make sure

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.650 
part so that's why you want to make sure
it<00:03:49.470> doesn't<00:03:49.620> get<00:03:49.799> caught<00:03:50.040> there<00:03:50.329> okay<00:03:51.329> so<00:03:51.390> this

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
it doesn't get caught there okay so this

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.550 
it doesn't get caught there okay so this
is<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.110> finished<00:03:52.320> frog<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:54.450> can<00:03:54.630> kind<00:03:55.440> of

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
is the finished frog and you can kind of

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.430 
is the finished frog and you can kind of
curl<00:03:55.919> the<00:03:56.160> front<00:03:56.669> legs<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:57.060> little<00:03:57.120> bit<00:03:57.440> of

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
curl the front legs a little bit of

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.990 
curl the front legs a little bit of
course<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.859> can<00:03:58.980> put<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.400> little

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
course you can put a little

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.710 
course you can put a little
eyes<00:04:00.600> on<00:04:01.020> the<00:04:01.170> top<00:04:01.530> either<00:04:01.830> drawn<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.460> or<00:04:02.720> get

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
eyes on the top either drawn in or get

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.630 
eyes on the top either drawn in or get
those<00:04:03.960> little<00:04:04.290> ones<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:04.920> glue<00:04:05.340> on<00:04:05.520> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
those little ones that you glue on the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.240 
those little ones that you glue on the
top<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.120> well<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:07.560> that's<00:04:07.710> how<00:04:07.860> you<00:04:07.920> do<00:04:08.100> the

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
top as well and that's how you do the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.810 
top as well and that's how you do the
origami<00:04:09.000> hopping<00:04:09.570> frog
