mean when you're tracking

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.930 
mean when you're tracking
I<00:02:55.010> think<00:02:55.700> sonic<00:02:56.120> integrity<00:02:56.750> isn't<00:02:57.710> as<00:02:57.860> huge<00:02:58.670> of

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
I think sonic integrity isn't as huge of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.060 
I think sonic integrity isn't as huge of
a<00:02:59.030> factor<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.960> know<00:03:00.110> like<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.650> really<00:03:00.830> just

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
a factor you know like you really just

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.100 
a factor you know like you really just
need<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.280> picture<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.480> pretty<00:03:02.930> much<00:03:03.050> just
