 trotters while the stake of the samu in the series this 15 th reserves at 13 years 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.609
 lingered in la liga from the csn launched the sunday before christmas if my 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:41.840

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.100

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.720
 in the open sea without knowing almost all 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.250
 and finally right now because I actually think that whoever is in the lead 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.090
 of our selection is also one of the essentials I thought for
