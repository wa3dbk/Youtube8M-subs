battery wires have completely come off

going<00:04:52.770> to<00:04:52.830> happen<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.310> mean<00:04:53.550> they<00:04:54.120> just<00:04:54.150> leave

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570

it<00:04:54.720> dangly<00:04:55.230> literally<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.040> unless<00:04:56.940> I

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
it dangly literally and unless I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.480 
it dangly literally and unless I
actually<00:04:57.180> use<00:04:57.690> the<00:04:58.050> zip<00:04:58.410> ties<00:04:58.650> they<00:04:59.190> would<00:04:59.340> be

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
actually use the zip ties they would be

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.310 
actually use the zip ties they would be
dangling<00:04:59.970> even<00:05:00.300> more<00:05:00.480> so<00:05:00.630> I<00:05:00.660> can't<00:05:00.960> believe<00:05:01.200> it

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
dangling even more so I can't believe it

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.090 
dangling even more so I can't believe it
I<00:05:01.350> mean<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.490> wires<00:05:03.090> here<00:05:03.540> have<00:05:04.530> simply

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
I mean that the wires here have simply

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.420 
I mean that the wires here have simply
come<00:05:06.000> right<00:05:06.390> off<00:05:06.420> in<00:05:06.960> that's<00:05:07.590> that's<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.190> mad

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430

man I mean how can they think that but
everything<00:05:11.190> oh<00:05:12.080> wait<00:05:13.080> we<00:05:13.350> bent<00:05:13.620> all<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:14.160> we

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
everything oh wait we bent all and we

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:17.930 
everything oh wait we bent all and we
bent<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.970> dog<00:05:15.300> bone<00:05:15.510> really<00:05:16.380> nicely<00:05:16.910> you<00:05:17.910> can

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
bent a dog bone really nicely you can

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.460 
bent a dog bone really nicely you can
see<00:05:18.240> here<00:05:18.560> bent<00:05:19.560> dog<00:05:19.770> bone<00:05:20.570> very<00:05:21.570> sweet<00:05:22.080> quite

a<00:05:22.500> nice<00:05:22.710> Bend<00:05:23.070> and<00:05:23.910> I<00:05:24.630> think<00:05:24.990> apart<00:05:25.380> from<00:05:25.530> that

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
a nice Bend and I think apart from that

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.670 
a nice Bend and I think apart from that
steering<00:05:27.419> is<00:05:27.660> good<00:05:28.940> that<00:05:29.940> is<00:05:30.090> good<00:05:30.620> but<00:05:31.620> I

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
steering is good that is good but I

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.400 
steering is good that is good but I
think<00:05:31.980> really<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:32.280> just<00:05:32.640> got<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.410> replace

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
think really you just got to replace

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.800 
think really you just got to replace
this<00:05:34.650> one<00:05:35.120> bent<00:05:36.120> dog<00:05:36.300> bone<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:38.180> put<00:05:39.180> in<00:05:39.300> six

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
this one bent dog bone and put in six

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.930 
this one bent dog bone and put in six
volt<00:05:40.050> pump<00:05:40.290> pack<00:05:40.560> in<00:05:40.800> there<00:05:41.040> because<00:05:41.580> these

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
volt pump pack in there because these

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.850 
volt pump pack in there because these
separate<00:05:42.450> batteries<00:05:42.900> aren't<00:05:43.440> doing<00:05:43.620> good<00:05:43.770> at

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
separate batteries aren't doing good at

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.800 
separate batteries aren't doing good at
all<00:05:44.040> to<00:05:44.460> pick<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.700> out<00:05:44.820> the<00:05:45.300> battery

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
all to pick it out the battery

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.590 
all to pick it out the battery
compartment<00:05:46.710> had<00:05:47.100> my<00:05:47.250> for<00:05:47.550> a<00:05:47.730> rechargeable

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
compartment had my for a rechargeable

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.920 
compartment had my for a rechargeable
battery<00:05:48.630> now<00:05:49.350> we<00:05:49.410> got<00:05:49.560> to<00:05:49.650> find<00:05:49.860> it

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.820 

obviously<00:05:54.930> I<00:05:54.990> think<00:05:55.050> probably<00:05:57.379> it<00:05:58.379> might<00:05:58.620> be

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
obviously I think probably it might be

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.680 
obviously I think probably it might be
under<00:05:59.129> here<00:05:59.280> but<00:05:59.580> the<00:05:59.699> ground<00:05:59.940> is<00:06:00.060> very<00:06:00.090> very

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
under here but the ground is very very

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:15.530 
under here but the ground is very very
wet<00:06:00.900> so<00:06:01.139> I'm<00:06:01.229> just<00:06:01.379> gonna<00:06:01.500> get<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.800> sloth

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.600 

no<00:06:16.230> one<00:06:16.530> under<00:06:16.740> there<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.160> it<00:06:17.220> must<00:06:17.430> have<00:06:17.490> come

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
no one under there so it must have come

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.970 
no one under there so it must have come
off<00:06:17.960> must<00:06:18.960> have<00:06:19.110> come<00:06:19.260> off<00:06:19.290> somewhere<00:06:19.710> when<00:06:19.860> we

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
off must have come off somewhere when we

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.040 
off must have come off somewhere when we
actually<00:06:20.130> landed<00:06:20.610> the<00:06:20.940> jump<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:21.480> maybe<00:06:21.750> over

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
actually landed the jump so maybe over

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:32.180 
actually landed the jump so maybe over
here<00:06:22.260> somewhere<00:06:28.910> two<00:06:29.910> zip<00:06:30.150> ties<00:06:30.560> on<00:06:31.560> it<00:06:31.740> and

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
here somewhere two zip ties on it and

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.980 
here somewhere two zip ties on it and
originally<00:06:32.880> obviously<00:06:33.300> they<00:06:33.450> were<00:06:33.600> one<00:06:33.810> was

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
originally obviously they were one was

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.390 
originally obviously they were one was

but<00:06:36.270> what<00:06:36.480> has<00:06:36.630> happened<00:06:36.750> is<00:06:37.140> you<00:06:37.620> can<00:06:37.770> see

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
but what has happened is you can see

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.230 
but what has happened is you can see
cables<00:06:39.270> have<00:06:39.450> come<00:06:39.660> right<00:06:40.290> off<00:06:40.320> here<00:06:40.800> so<00:06:41.210> all<00:06:42.210> I

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 
cables have come right off here so all I

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.060 
cables have come right off here so all I
can<00:06:42.450> say<00:06:42.630> is<00:06:42.690> if<00:06:42.840> you<00:06:42.960> have<00:06:43.170> a<00:06:43.200> hypo<00:06:43.560> seven<00:06:43.890> and

can say is if you have a hypo seven and

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.670

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
in there upgrade it to a six volt

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.050 
in there upgrade it to a six volt
