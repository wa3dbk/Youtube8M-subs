them in this machine and it squeezes

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.330 
them in this machine and it squeezes
that<00:02:06.340> crimp<00:02:06.640> ring<00:02:06.729> down<00:02:07.240> around<00:02:07.450> there<00:02:07.660> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that crimp ring down around there and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.070 
that crimp ring down around there and
done<00:02:09.340> it<00:02:09.459> for<00:02:09.580> finished<00:02:09.880> air<00:02:10.479> spring<00:02:10.750> balance

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
done it for finished air spring balance

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.980 
done it for finished air spring balance
obviously<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:12.190> too<00:02:12.370> long<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:13.030> fit<00:02:13.209> on<00:02:13.450> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
obviously it's too long to fit on the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.860 
obviously it's too long to fit on the
shoppings<00:02:14.410> over<00:02:14.500> like<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:14.920> supposed<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
shoppings over like it's supposed to and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.120 
shoppings over like it's supposed to and
trying<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.020> compress<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.560> thing<00:02:17.769> by<00:02:17.920> hand

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
trying to compress this thing by hand

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.440 
trying to compress this thing by hand
and<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:18.550> going<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> end<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.180> with<00:02:19.420> a

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
and you're going to end up with a with a

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.870 
and you're going to end up with a with a
lot<00:02:19.660> enough<00:02:19.930> mess<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.560> what<00:02:20.769> we<00:02:20.920> do<00:02:21.100> we

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
lot enough mess so what we do we

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.729 
lot enough mess so what we do we
invented<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.360> little<00:02:22.630> machine<00:02:22.750> here<00:02:23.230> you

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
invented this little machine here you

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:24.960 
invented this little machine here you
stick<00:02:23.950> this<00:02:24.070> in<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:24.280> we<00:02:24.550> put<00:02:24.700> some<00:02:24.850> air

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
stick this in here we put some air

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.729 
stick this in here we put some air
pressure<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.810> then<00:02:26.170> we<00:02:26.290> roll<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
pressure to it and then we roll the

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.470 
pressure to it and then we roll the
sleeve<00:02:26.980> down<00:02:27.250> over<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.550> piston<00:02:27.940> in<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.120> uniform

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
sleeve down over the piston in a uniform

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.320 
sleeve down over the piston in a uniform
matter<00:02:28.810> and<00:02:29.709> then<00:02:30.010> we<00:02:30.310> can<00:02:30.459> install<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.060> on<00:02:31.239> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
matter and then we can install it on the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.020 
matter and then we can install it on the
shock<00:02:31.540> wave<00:02:32.040> all<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.489> to<00:02:33.610> do<00:02:33.760> is

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
shock wave all we have to do is

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.330 
shock wave all we have to do is
lubricate<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.660> o-rings<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.290> the<00:02:35.620> piston<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
lubricate the o-rings in the piston and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.820 
lubricate the o-rings in the piston and
in<00:02:36.580> the<00:02:36.670> cap<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.150> slide<00:02:37.810> it<00:02:38.080> over<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.590> shock

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
in the cap and slide it over the shock

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.830 
in the cap and slide it over the shock
assembly<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:40.090> I'll<00:02:40.239> do<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> right<00:02:40.870> now<00:02:42.840> slip

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
assembly so I'll do that right now slip

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.590 
assembly so I'll do that right now slip
it<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.110> there

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.810 

lining<00:02:48.600> up<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:52.550> now<00:02:53.550> we<00:02:53.610> have<00:02:53.790> a

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
lining up just so now we have a

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.060 
lining up just so now we have a
completed<00:02:54.180> shockwave<00:02:54.660> almost<00:02:55.410> complete

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
completed shockwave almost complete

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.670 
completed shockwave almost complete
we<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.850> put<00:02:56.970> an<00:02:57.060> eye<00:02:57.180> mount<00:02:57.420> on<00:02:57.600> here<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.500> can

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
we can put an eye mount on here we can

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
we can put an eye mount on here we can
put<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:59.040> stud<00:02:59.670> mount<00:02:59.880> on<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.930> we'll<00:03:01.290> put

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
put a stud mount on here and we'll put

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.040 
put a stud mount on here and we'll put
our<00:03:01.530> bearing<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.690> then<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.870> will<00:03:03.960> be

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
our bearing in here and then it will be

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.900 
at upwards of 600 psi with this
apparatus<00:03:12.870> right<00:03:13.320> here<00:03:13.590> we<00:03:14.190> apply<00:03:14.580> water

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
apparatus right here we apply water

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.910 
apparatus right here we apply water
pressure<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.660> thing<00:03:15.900> until<00:03:16.170> literally

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
pressure to this thing until literally

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.730 
pressure to this thing until literally
it<00:03:17.340> bursts<00:03:17.850> and<00:03:18.000> that<00:03:18.600> tells<00:03:18.900> us<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.200> the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
it bursts and that tells us that the

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.980 
it bursts and that tells us that the
rubber<00:03:19.980> material<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.670> good<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.120> also<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
rubber material is good and also the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.720 
rubber material is good and also the
crimp<00:03:22.260> ring<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.070> compression<00:03:23.610> on<00:03:23.700> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
crimp ring that the compression on the

crimp ring that the compression on the
crimp<00:03:24.000> ring<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.450> good<00:03:24.810> too<00:03:25.080> as<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.220> see

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
crimp ring is good too as you can see

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.300 
crimp ring is good too as you can see
when<00:03:27.270> we<00:03:27.360> applied<00:03:27.690> about<00:03:27.960> 620<00:03:28.860> psi<00:03:29.280> of

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
when we applied about 620 psi of

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.850 
when we applied about 620 psi of
pressure<00:03:29.460> it<00:03:30.240> exploded<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.900> bag<00:03:31.080> along<00:03:31.650> the

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
pressure it exploded the bag along the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.280 
pressure it exploded the bag along the
bias<00:03:32.100> angle<00:03:32.580> of<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.820> fabric<00:03:33.210> it<00:03:33.720> didn't<00:03:34.110> pull

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
bias angle of the fabric it didn't pull

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.630 
bias angle of the fabric it didn't pull
the<00:03:34.440> rubber<00:03:34.620> out<00:03:34.830> from<00:03:35.040> under<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.310> crimp<00:03:35.550> ring

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
the rubber out from under the crimp ring

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.030 
the rubber out from under the crimp ring
on<00:03:35.970> either<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.300> cap<00:03:36.510> or<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.050> piston<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.890> we

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
on either the cap or the piston so we

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.310 
on either the cap or the piston so we
know<00:03:38.190> that's<00:03:38.370> a<00:03:38.550> good<00:03:38.760> crimp<00:03:39.210> this<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:39.840> exactly

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
know that's a good crimp this is exactly

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.530 
know that's a good crimp this is exactly
what<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.650> supposed<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:40.920> look<00:03:41.100> like<00:03:41.160> now<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
what it's supposed to look like now the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.540 
what it's supposed to look like now the
working<00:03:42.780> pressure<00:03:43.200> on<00:03:43.560> these<00:03:43.800> shockwaves<00:03:44.370> is

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
working pressure on these shockwaves is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.490 
working pressure on these shockwaves is
between<00:03:44.910> 80<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.420> 150<00:03:46.260> psi<00:03:46.770> so<00:03:47.090> at<00:03:48.170> 620<00:03:49.170> were

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
between 80 and 150 psi so at 620 were

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250 
between 80 and 150 psi so at 620 were
about<00:03:50.220> six<00:03:50.700> times<00:03:50.940> working<00:03:51.540> pressure<00:03:51.810> which

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
about six times working pressure which

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.460 
about six times working pressure which
by<00:03:52.739> anybody<00:03:53.280> standard<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.239> great<00:03:54.660> safety

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
by anybody standard is a great safety

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.620 
by anybody standard is a great safety
margin<00:03:55.860> well<00:03:56.430> now<00:03:56.610> that<00:03:56.790> you've<00:03:56.970> seen<00:03:57.270> how<00:03:57.570> we

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
margin well now that you've seen how we

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.440 
margin well now that you've seen how we
make<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> shock<00:03:58.620> wave<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:59.550> can<00:03:59.700> see<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.030> value

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
make a shock wave you can see the value
