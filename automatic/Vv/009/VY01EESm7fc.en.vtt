00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.790

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
sure but I'm gonna start by playing my

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.610 
sure but I'm gonna start by playing my
flyers<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.520> hopefully<00:01:16.970> start<00:01:17.270> killing<00:01:17.620> you

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620

removal skull that can hit creature than
that<00:02:09.619> be<00:02:09.770> good<00:02:09.920> but<00:02:10.520> either<00:02:10.700> way<00:02:10.910> turn<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
that be good but either way turn to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.180 
that be good but either way turn to
searing<00:02:12.200> blaze<00:02:12.320> is<00:02:12.560> pretty<00:02:12.800> good<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.100> right

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190

he's gotta flames of the fire ran and I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.420 
he's gotta flames of the fire ran and I
guess<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.320> wish<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.800> would<00:02:15.920> have<00:02:15.950> had<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.190> ground

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
guess I wish I would have had the ground

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.830 
guess I wish I would have had the ground
swell<00:02:16.640> up<00:02:16.760> but<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:16.970> mean<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.180> still<00:02:17.300> need<00:02:17.600> another

left<00:02:23.540> in<00:02:23.780> hand<00:02:24.050> I<00:02:24.200> guess<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.680> really<00:02:24.860> only<00:02:25.070> have

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.340 
left in hand I guess I really only have
one<00:02:25.459> useful<00:02:25.760> guard<00:02:26.090> left<00:02:26.239> a<00:02:26.360> hand<00:02:26.570> too<00:02:26.750> so<00:02:27.140> I

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
one useful guard left a hand too so I

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.380 
one useful guard left a hand too so I
need<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.010> draw<00:02:28.220> some<00:02:28.250> more<00:02:28.430> gas<00:02:28.730> if<00:02:29.000> I<00:02:29.120> actually

need to draw some more gas if I actually

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.100 
need to draw some more gas if I actually
want<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:30.080> think<00:02:30.290> about<00:02:30.410> wearing<00:02:30.770> this

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

morphic I'm not gonna Bobby it doesn't

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.510 
morphic I'm not gonna Bobby it doesn't
matter<00:02:36.990> i<00:02:37.080> can't<00:02:37.320> ground<00:02:37.500> swell<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.040> i<00:02:38.280> can

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
matter i can't ground swell so i can

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.750 
matter i can't ground swell so i can
crack<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:38.760> whenever<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.240> want<00:02:40.520> because<00:02:41.520> I'm<00:02:41.640> not

crack it whenever I want because I'm not
gonna<00:02:41.940> save<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.300> I<00:02:42.770> mean<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.800> mean<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.100> could<00:02:44.400> do

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
gonna save it I mean I mean I could do

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.890 
gonna save it I mean I mean I could do
that<00:02:44.610> I<00:02:44.790> could<00:02:45.000> save<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.540> get<00:02:45.810> the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that I could save it so I get the

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.860 
that I could save it so I get the
landfill<00:02:46.260> so<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.470> could<00:02:46.650> ground<00:02:46.830> swell<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.970> on

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
landfill so I could ground swell and on

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.330 
landfill so I could ground swell and on
his<00:02:49.110> turn<00:02:49.350> or<00:02:49.500> something<00:02:49.740> like<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
his turn or something like that if I

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.040 
his turn or something like that if I
needed<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.820> but<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.270> really<00:02:51.810> don't<00:02:51.960> think

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
needed to but I really don't think

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.810 
needed to but I really don't think
that'll<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.410> necessary<00:02:52.530> this<00:02:53.250> claustrophobia

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
that'll be necessary this claustrophobia

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.060 
that'll be necessary this claustrophobia
is<00:02:53.910> just<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.210> completely<00:02:54.810> dead<00:02:55.200> card<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.890> this

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
is just a completely dead card in this

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.910 
is just a completely dead card in this
matchup<00:02:56.780> all<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.050> he's<00:02:58.200> got<00:02:58.350> one<00:02:58.530> carne

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
matchup all right so he's got one carne

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.050 
matchup all right so he's got one carne
and<00:02:59.010> he<00:02:59.130> thought<00:02:59.250> about<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.520> for<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> little<00:02:59.880> bit

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and he thought about it for a little bit

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.030 
and he thought about it for a little bit
so<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.570> gives<00:03:01.080> me<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.350> idea<00:03:01.650> that<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:01.920> not

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
so that gives me the idea that it's not

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.750 
so that gives me the idea that it's not
a<00:03:02.100> knowledge<00:03:02.880> is<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.570> at<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.930> alanda<00:03:04.700> so<00:03:05.700> i

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
a knowledge is not at just alanda so i

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030 
a knowledge is not at just alanda so i
can<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.150> coatl<00:03:06.540> back<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.020> then<00:03:07.440> recasted

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
can get the coatl back and then recasted

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.949 
can get the coatl back and then recasted
this<00:03:08.190> chariot<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:09.180> I'm<00:03:09.360> probably<00:03:09.480> gonna<00:03:09.720> do

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
this chariot so I'm probably gonna do

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.449 
this chariot so I'm probably gonna do
that<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:10.350> first<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:10.860> attack<00:03:11.190> and

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
that but first I'm going to attack and

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.290 
that but first I'm going to attack and
see<00:03:11.760> what<00:03:12.209> he<00:03:12.390> has<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.510> say<00:03:12.690> about<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:14.910> he

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
see what he has to say about that if he

you also get to you also get to have a

you also get to you also get to have a
2-1<00:03:55.440> creature<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:56.640> anyway<00:03:57.349> enough<00:03:58.349> about

that<00:03:58.620> let's<00:03:59.310> attack<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.030> 45<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:02.810> we're<00:04:03.810> on

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
that let's attack you 45 and we're on

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.900 
that let's attack you 45 and we're on
our<00:04:04.019> way<00:04:04.200> here<00:04:04.650> i'm<00:04:04.829> down<00:04:05.069> to<00:04:05.099> nine<00:04:05.489> but<00:04:05.879> i

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
our way here i'm down to nine but i

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.039 
our way here i'm down to nine but i
think<00:04:06.209> i<00:04:06.299> should<00:04:06.480> be<00:04:06.510> able<00:04:06.599> to<00:04:06.810> kill<00:04:06.930> him

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
think i should be able to kill him

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.449 
think i should be able to kill him
quicker<00:04:07.640> i'm<00:04:08.640> considering<00:04:09.090> i've<00:04:09.390> got<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
quicker i'm considering i've got the

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.130 
quicker i'm considering i've got the
equivalent<00:04:11.910> of<00:04:11.940> nine<00:04:12.150> power<00:04:12.450> on<00:04:12.690> board<00:04:12.930> if<00:04:13.079> I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
equivalent of nine power on board if I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.319 
equivalent of nine power on board if I
drawl<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.680> can<00:04:13.829> kill<00:04:14.040> a<00:04:14.069> mix<00:04:14.310> turn<00:04:14.519> I<00:04:14.760> didn't

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
drawl and I can kill a mix turn I didn't

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:16.490 
drawl and I can kill a mix turn I didn't
play<00:04:15.450> land<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.840> turned<00:04:16.079> your<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.320> good
