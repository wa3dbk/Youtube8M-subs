I guess what's so frustrating about the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.029 
I guess what's so frustrating about the
drug<00:02:05.979> movement<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.590> much<00:02:08.800> of<00:02:08.830> a

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
drug movement is that it's not much of a

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.430 
drug movement is that it's not much of a
movement<00:02:09.280> that's<00:02:09.750> too<00:02:10.750> many<00:02:10.899> stoners

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
movement that's too many stoners

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.490 
movement that's too many stoners
involved<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.600> no<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:13.840> if<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.050> mean<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.380> is

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
involved but no but if that mean that is

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.090 
involved but no but if that mean that is
one<00:02:14.709> problem<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:15.160> also<00:02:15.520> just<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:15.970> the

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
one problem but also just the the

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.380 
one problem but also just the the
inconsistency<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.730> fact<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.060> somebody

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
inconsistency the fact that somebody

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.730
