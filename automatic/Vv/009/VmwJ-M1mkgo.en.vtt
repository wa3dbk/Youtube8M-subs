00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello friends I recently dropped out 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.390
 opportunity to do so i was starting my own 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.040
 previous video and although exactly the same 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.170
 start the next ugly but exactly 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.080
 it happened to me recently 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.250
 opportunity rather did not fall sent 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.230
 impossibility of inviting and not making 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.820
 review and go to Cuba is difficult 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.619
 say why I'm doing reviews 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.689
 gaming equipment they event events 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.070
 related to the game but as and probably 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 the vast majority of players 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.060
 I created an account of the world of tanks became 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 be interested in real armored vehicles and 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.650
 I decided long ago that I would definitely visit this one 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 the museum is only a question when I assumed 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.500
 that an event of this level will attend 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.730
 a lot of water makers who will 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.230
 professionally cover data 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 certainly very interesting events 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.040
 he himself was going to go there roles 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.239
 simple viewer going to beat and in 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.110
 time to move to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.820
 arranged place 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.559
 however it turned out that the event 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.030
 preparing a bit messy and about 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.980
 inviting water makers think in 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 the last moment as a result did not have time 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.649
 agree the most common 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.539
 organizational issues first 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.890
 guest accommodation fare 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.320
 because many of them live for thousands 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.789
 kilometers from Cuban so look at 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230
 this event in terms of simple 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.969
 the viewer you will have to search 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.430
 tell about what was going on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.210
 necessarily so hot off I 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.250
 share my own 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.170
 impressions impressions more from 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.400
 events not from museum museum this 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.020
 separate topic for any video 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 duration of short announcements 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 long review or a whole series 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.970
 videos with him and I do not want this year I 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.680
 Be sure to choose the time and try 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.390
 walk through the Cuban calm 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.890
 then I'll take the camera and 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.990
 I will tell about the museum for those who are not there yet 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.759
 was in terms of a mere visitor and 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 a man with pleasure playing world 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.790
 of tanks this saturday i didn't 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.680
 photography and filming is not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.659
 happening for the channel just because 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.460
 that I was not going to do them as a family 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.680
 photo will be for a family album 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.450
 the most interesting moments will surely be 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.610
 on the official wargame channel watch out for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.460
 him and in a nutshell I will talk about what 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.930
 saw so let's get started first 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 congratulations to all the lucky ones 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 got an invitation to open a new one 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.259
 patch in the Cuban friends and their families 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.450
 events turned out very interesting in 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.070
 anyway my family and wife who 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.390
 about the tanks they know only that they are even in 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.399
 peacetime can easily and successfully 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 fight her for my time and children 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.240
 junior and senior school age and 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.250
 of course I myself we all stayed very 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.020
 satisfied 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.119
 first than met us the museum is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.710
 E25 free code booklets and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.270
 although on a normal day, of course you are not 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.860
 get such a gift I would not be surprised 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.330
 if soon along with the ticket 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.430
 cards will be issued with free 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.960
 small receptions of museum visitors 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.370
 who play tanks now 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.170
 probably the vast majority 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.840
 and wargaming and kubinka collaborate all 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.400
 closer to this cooperation by the way was 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 dedicated to a separate story guide 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.690
 wargaming museum in a nutshell 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.310
 tank maus who like you all know 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.110
 exist in unity in the world of specimen 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.670
 and imagine yourself an empty case from 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.930
 one of the two prototypes created and 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.940
 empty tower from another 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.620
 bring to working condition by 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.540
 original drawings in many ways repeating 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.100
 job ferdinand porsche copying 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.170
 restoring a solution conceived by him 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.370
 the filling of the tank will be created throughout 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.470
 the world almost by hand 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.180
 a second big project that probably 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.250
 can finish this year already 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.410
 it is lifting and bringing in suitable for 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.700
 exposure to the shape of the tank square-1 during 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.530
 great domestic teremu 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.489
 crossing the river dong again 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.560
 follow official news 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.959
 for sure these works will be given a lot more 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.130
 attention but let's continue the museum as 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.080
 It is supposed to have several kiosks 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.970
 selling about tank products 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.580
 the products are of course quality but absolutely 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.680
 not cheap very detailed book models 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.690
 charms icons magnets circles to 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.400
 similar jewelry even for yourself 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.170
 set aside for souvenirs and a thousand or two 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.790
 if you think about your friends 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.799
 or more so take the children with you 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.780
 bold greatly increase this amount 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.250
 there are many little things that will fall 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.140
 to taste anyone 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.730
 wargaming and some other big ones 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.320
 sponsor companies generous willingly 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.450
 distributed small but pleasant prizes 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.070
 everyone can wait for their 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.840
 queues ask a question play a game you 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:37.910
 literally press the receive button 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 bonus codes right tanchiki flash drives and other 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.600
 small for nice prizes I do not know why 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.340
 but my child got this 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.780
 files that were faithful to store and 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.280
 take care 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.920
 of course there was a Serbian comrade in the world Sergey 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.510
 on rate Hamidovich Burkatovsky those who 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.800
 I still don't know his real feelings 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.510
 leave the opportunity to look for him 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.400
 and I advise those who know to find out where 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.070
 took this this fun and indeed 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.150
 instructive by the way a small offtopic for 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.320
 backstage sulfur produced at me 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.180
 impression of a very tired person 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.739
 after especially heavy transfers to 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.959
 I am working in the same way, and 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.280
 rubs tired aching eyes but I 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.840
 not at all sure of my ability 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.640
 literally half an hour like a bun for 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.170
 jump onto the stage and a hundred and five hundred and times 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.300
 answer the same questions on 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.070
 who already answered perry answered while this 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.650
 Comrade can my respect 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.480
 asked questions and answers very much 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.970
 many answered quickly clearly and in detail 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.080
 up the question basically came down to those for 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.120
 which is banned on the official forum 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.850
 because they published many many many 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.100
 time when ponerfyat when the fruit when 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.660
 will fix when they correct the balance and further 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.010
 the same treasured tank or maps 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.470
 whose fate or which especially 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.300
 worries the author of the question as one can 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.000
 swoop to improve the gameplay oh and let's 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.290
 as in another project we remove from tanks hp 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.630
 against live on such questions answered 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.160
 deployed very intelligibly for example on 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.930
 suggestion that historical battles 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.479
 can be done much historically given 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.130
 something like this answer who would have thought 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.360
 but it turns out in wargaming works 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.310
 a lot of things not stupid 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.229
 developers and a whole staff of specially 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.700
 trained testers almost 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.470
 each new mode long before 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.400
 getting into the general test is going through 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.510
 many iterations 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.580
 tries out completely different 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.200
 Options for the same historical battles 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.310
 were checked including with the maximum 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.440
 possible on a personal computer 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.120
 approaching reality without 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.340
 Auto Range Auto Range 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.080
 no x therefore similar as a result 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.120
 It turned out not a game or even a simulator 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.009
 they are hard to explain 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.169
 wargaming and 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.610
 and cited as an example the situation as 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:23.409
 on tests almost identical 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.150
 conditions there were cases when one tank 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:27.219
 destroy another with one hit 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.839
 and almost in the next battle the same two 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:30.699
 tank without visible results shoot 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.319
 give each other a few minutes 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:33.669
 players such an approximation to reality 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.039
 mean at best right away 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.899
 I personally would not be surprised to bury the regime 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.550
 responsible for realism in the army but comrades 

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:41.919
 Vega is very correct and intelligible everything 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.860
 will explain and another player seems all 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:46.569
 understood 1 of 80 million mode 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.189
 confrontation who was born literally 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:50.169
 on the knee is an exception to the rule 

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:51.879
 it was expected that the team is not difficult for him 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:53.740
 will collect from the available queues 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.509
 but the beginning mode caused a lot 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.729
 negative ratings and many players on 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.689
 just in case it was turned off i think that 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:00.249
 primarily because of this 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.629
 the balancer was out of breath trying 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.849
 staff the team from what 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:05.830
 left and gave setups obviously coming out 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.539
 for normal rules as a result 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.580
 confrontations of the next patch brought 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.139
 from the game, by the way, the monks said that 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.959
 after processing it is quite possible this 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.520
 regime again returned separately told about 

00:06:13.959 --> 00:06:16.899
 creating waters and streams this 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.759
 activities are interesting to many players 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:20.860
 so wargaming is planning 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.629
 pay special attention to gold or 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:24.610
 premium account mile appliances but will 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:26.529
 encouraged novice Delilah letspleery 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.529
 Now the question is thought out exactly how 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:30.490
 you can celebrate merit in this part of the game 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.080
 it is clear that if you download the program 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:34.089
 video capture show your hangar and 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.680
 to say that I would have t18 rosary 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.509
 data with the tracks armor gun and 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.639
 I will surely pump it over with it 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:41.620
 vundervaflyu then wait for the year right 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:42.879
 of course not worth it but if you make a video 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.469
 who will like those who are their 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.089
 I saw and even better than the unique 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:47.469
 work then in the game for its part 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.659
 I will try not to leave such work without 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.580
 attention was still a lot of things 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.259
 interesting in general for myself I did 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.669
 such conclusions 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.589
 event t d d d g attend very 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:58.719
 I wonder if your city or close 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.430
 from him something like that is carried out boldly 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.490
 going and come do not lose 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.939
 this time and the second armored museum in 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:05.740
 Cuban woman 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.330
 This is something very large scale and 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.289
 amazing for those who never 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.819
 played world of tanks 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.169
 so for those who deserved and 

00:07:09.819 --> 00:07:13.719
 undeservedly considers himself experienced 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.490
 tankers myself I will definitely go there 

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:16.689
 more time for himself but for a 

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:18.430
 the results will also make 

00:07:16.689 --> 00:07:19.340
 interesting videos for you 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.010
 I will not be there alone 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:24.220
 martial wait and see with respect jay 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.220
 mayor
