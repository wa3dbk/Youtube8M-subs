pitch break through these two beams and
hit<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.360> plate<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.840> we'll<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.080> able<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
hit that plate and we'll be able to

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.340 
hit that plate and we'll be able to
collect<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.920> force<00:01:47.130> that's<00:01:47.280> generated<00:01:48.350> first

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
