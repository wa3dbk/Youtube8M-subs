00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.830
 I welcome everyone to Henry Yu today 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.230
 present to your attention a small 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 Comparison product completeness will be 5 days 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.499
 let's get started 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.149
 unlocking device and check 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:15.929
 so that we do not have open applications 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.710
 as we see them not 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.300
 let's start let's say applications 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 by him 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.919
 ah pad was a little faster 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.210
 application let's say 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.660
 what's this 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.410
 both devices as we see connected clare 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.060
 graze 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.520
 in this case the same thing let's open 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 then appstore 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.270
 and he was with us 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.560
 so minister of estonia start page 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 do 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.920
 and some 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.210
 ah background was the first little bit 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.210
 Yuri Koyev 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.060
 a sort of 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.120
 Correspondent for this is a matter of opinion because articles 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 more modern chip 6 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.770
 let's say 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.870
 run 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.500
 a toy 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 river delta 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.869
 a move like in the markets it was simple 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.620
 now you can check 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.050
 let's say internet 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.050
 how it works with us later 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.869
 let's say 

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:20.229
 yes so there 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.229
 eg 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:26.639
 and again 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.999
 iphone 5 we have a winner 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.999
 by speed 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.409
 Well, in general, based on this test that 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:37.569
 from the next picture what 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.729
 risks by all indicators iphone 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:43.029
 the fifth is a little faster and ahead 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:44.629
 ipad mini a lot of some 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.689
 applications this is the rate of receipt 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.539
 significant 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:51.539
 let's press the copyright programs 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.849
 they can open boiling to his wife sometimes 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.849
 even in speed 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.120
 but as for so dimensional some 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.129
 comparison 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.209
 I have it here no matter how talk about anything 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:09.349
 it's much bigger because this one 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:10.539
 the tablet 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.869
 iphone 5 so i can compare 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.159
 positively so horizontally 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.359
 and we see that in principle he 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.629
 a little shorter than forgiveness we have them 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.939
 opinion and as for the thickness 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:26.339
 I would say attoev 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:29.199
 can't be quite a bit 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:31.899
 then a lot of things melt barely noticeable 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:34.899
 unprotected no screen protector so 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.169
 count under which displace 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.009
 very difficult 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.009
 that's how I present them now 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.169
 that is, they are basically the same in thickness 

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:52.669
 but according to her, of course we have it 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.169
 heavier 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.209
 times so 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.409
 en said 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.279
 one and a half two 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.279
 but how will 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.539
 thanks for watching henry news
