ekans could have any intimidating the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.350 
ekans could have any intimidating the
max<00:01:10.500> HP<00:01:10.680> max<00:01:11.070> defense<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.939> take<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
max HP max defense so I can take a

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
max HP max defense so I can take a
u-turn<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.740> case<00:01:13.799> because<00:01:14.729> fizzy

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
u-turn or in this case because fizzy

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.969 
u-turn or in this case because fizzy
starters<00:01:15.479> brave<00:01:15.780> word<00:01:16.049> fucking<00:01:16.530> everything

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
starters brave word fucking everything

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
starters brave word fucking everything
so<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.369> know<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> braver<00:01:18.180> easily

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
so you know I take a braver easily

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.600 
so you know I take a braver easily
because<00:01:18.840> he's<00:01:18.960> out<00:01:19.080> minus<00:01:19.350> one<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.490> know

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
because he's out minus one and you know

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.700 
because he's out minus one and you know
all<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.090> shit<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:22.080> thinking<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.560> might

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
all that shit so I'm thinking he might

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.969 
all that shit so I'm thinking he might
be<00:01:22.920> scarfed<00:01:24.049> just<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.200> know<00:01:25.320> looking<00:01:25.799> at<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
be scarfed just you know looking at the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.590 
be scarfed just you know looking at the
damage<00:01:26.159> i'm<00:01:26.490> thinking<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.939> he<00:01:27.090> was<00:01:27.210> banded

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
damage i'm thinking if he was banded

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.910 
damage i'm thinking if he was banded
probably<00:01:28.020> would<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.259> done<00:01:28.380> at<00:01:28.530> least<00:01:28.710> half

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
probably would have done at least half

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.340 
probably would have done at least half
because<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.280> thing<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.610> quite<00:01:30.240> strong<00:01:30.659> so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
because that thing is quite strong so

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.990 
because that thing is quite strong so
he's<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.920> bring<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.189> rhyperior<00:01:32.670> i

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
he's going to bring in rhyperior i

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.550 
he's going to bring in rhyperior i
really<00:01:33.420> don't<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> anything<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.229> hit<00:01:34.439> him

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
really don't have anything to hit him

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.050

the glare just thinking uh whatever

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.960 
the glare just thinking uh whatever
comes<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> paralyzed<00:01:46.020> but

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
comes in is going to get paralyzed but

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.429 
comes in is going to get paralyzed but
right<00:01:47.970> perior<00:01:48.299> being<00:01:48.509> paralyzed<00:01:48.899> isn't<00:01:49.229> that

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
right perior being paralyzed isn't that

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.810 
right perior being paralyzed isn't that
bad<00:01:49.680> unless<00:01:50.009> he's<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.310> running<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.640> rock

polish<00:01:51.149> set<00:01:51.689> but<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.229> figured<00:01:52.829> best<00:01:53.340> switch

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
polish set but I figured best switch

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.859 
polish set but I figured best switch
right<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.030> fu-manchu's<00:01:54.360> since<00:01:54.810> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
right now would be fu-manchu's since I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.569 
right now would be fu-manchu's since I
am<00:01:54.990> water<00:01:55.290> grounded<00:01:55.920> i<00:01:55.979> could<00:01:56.130> probably<00:01:56.340> take

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
am water grounded i could probably take

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.670 
am water grounded i could probably take
an<00:01:56.729> earthquake's<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.299> don't<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.020> wasn't<00:01:58.469> really

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
an earthquake's I don't I wasn't really

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.649 
an earthquake's I don't I wasn't really
expecting<00:01:58.860> earthquake<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.939> coming<00:02:00.479> as

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
expecting earthquake to coming as

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
expecting earthquake to coming as
probably<00:02:01.500> thinking<00:02:01.920> something<00:02:02.280> else<00:02:02.399> but

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
probably thinking something else but

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.310 
probably thinking something else but
then<00:02:02.939> Auerbach<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.780> earthquake<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
then Auerbach was an earthquake is

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.810 
then Auerbach was an earthquake is
probably<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> best<00:02:04.890> move<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.369> for<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.790> I

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
probably the best move to go for and I

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.910 
probably the best move to go for and I
could<00:02:06.030> have<00:02:06.119> switched<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.570> jumpluff<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.770> I

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
could have switched into jumpluff but I

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
could have switched into jumpluff but I
brought<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.340> wish<00:02:08.489> cash<00:02:08.729> probably<00:02:09.300> thinking<00:02:09.569> I

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
brought in wish cash probably thinking I

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.839 
brought in wish cash probably thinking I

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
could probably take a hit but life orb

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.750 
could probably take a hit but life orb

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
it's just there to take a hit and then

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.590 
it's just there to take a hit and then
just<00:05:54.260> you<00:05:54.380> know<00:05:54.530> dish<00:05:54.800> back<00:05:55.070> damaged<00:05:55.550> so<00:05:56.120> but
