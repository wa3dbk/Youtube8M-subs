wipe<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.370> but<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:26.760> pretty<00:01:27.030> sure<00:01:27.120> you'd<00:01:27.660> begin

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
wipe to but I'm pretty sure you'd begin

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.140 
wipe to but I'm pretty sure you'd begin
from<00:01:28.050> a<00:01:28.080> pet<00:01:28.260> store<00:01:28.290> then<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.190> know<00:01:29.340> tenth

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
from a pet store then you know tenth

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.090 
from a pet store then you know tenth
grade<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.660> they<00:01:30.690> easily<00:01:30.990> throw<00:01:31.410> food<00:01:31.800> as<00:01:31.890> far

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
grade so they easily throw food as far

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.300 
grade so they easily throw food as far
as<00:01:32.190> I<00:01:32.310> know

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
as I know

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.670 
as I know
I've<00:01:33.820> asked<00:01:34.060> people<00:01:34.150> with<00:01:34.480> a<00:01:34.600> pet<00:01:35.290> store<00:01:35.470> they

said yes either they take the photo
pretty<00:01:37.420> easily<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.140> I'm<00:01:38.710> hoping<00:01:38.980> backs<00:01:39.220> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pretty easily so I'm hoping backs I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.300 
pretty easily so I'm hoping backs I
don't<00:01:40.630> know<00:01:40.690> how<00:01:40.780> to<00:01:40.840> raise<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.410> brine<00:01:41.950> Trevor

tank<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.359> really<00:03:43.540> don't<00:03:43.690> want<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.900> see<00:03:44.049> you

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
tank so I really don't want to see you

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.370 
tank so I really don't want to see you
know<00:03:44.970> all<00:03:45.970> my<00:03:46.450> stuff<00:03:46.780> that's<00:03:46.989> gonna<00:03:47.109> be<00:03:47.200> back

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
know all my stuff that's gonna be back

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.640 
know all my stuff that's gonna be back
there<00:03:47.650> there's<00:03:48.010> only<00:03:48.069> what<00:03:48.340> I<00:03:48.370> have<00:03:48.519> right<00:03:48.670> now

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
there there's only what I have right now

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.870 
there there's only what I have right now
you<00:03:50.650> don't<00:03:50.829> want<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> see<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:51.609> I<00:03:51.670> thought

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
you don't want to see that so I thought

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.620 
you don't want to see that so I thought
it'd<00:03:52.000> hide<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> now<00:03:53.200> all<00:03:53.409> I<00:03:53.439> have<00:03:53.680> is<00:03:53.890> a

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
it'd hide it so I now all I have is a

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.360 
it'd hide it so I now all I have is a
the<00:03:54.750> Prime<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.440> stress<00:03:55.680> code<00:03:55.950> which<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.220> use

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
the Prime in the stress code which I use

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.440 
the Prime in the stress code which I use
for<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.880> betas<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.630> my<00:03:58.020> saltwater<00:03:59.180> my<00:04:00.180> little

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.920 
just take it now if I feel like doing
that<00:04:19.940> noise<00:04:20.940> could<00:04:21.060> have<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> backup<00:04:21.600> I<00:04:21.750> don't

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
that noise could have a backup I don't

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.030 
that noise could have a backup I don't
have<00:04:22.020> time<00:04:22.170> to<00:04:22.290> get<00:04:22.380> to<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.530> store<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.890> check

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
have time to get to the store and check

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.160 
have time to get to the store and check
it<00:04:23.190> every<00:04:23.370> Co<00:04:23.490> days<00:04:23.730> for<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.690> week

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
need to get it up and go and release the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.370 
need to get it up and go and release the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
water in the sand and the salt and in a

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.170 
water in the sand and the salt and in a
couple<00:04:46.650> weeks<00:04:46.770> or<00:04:46.980> so<00:04:47.220> I'll<00:04:47.430> see<00:04:47.640> Bunch<00:04:47.850> able

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
couple weeks or so I'll see Bunch able

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.980 
couple weeks or so I'll see Bunch able
to<00:04:48.240> get<00:04:48.390> one<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:49.620> live<00:04:49.980> rock<00:04:50.250> in<00:04:50.490> maybe<00:04:50.990> cuz

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
to get one the live rock in maybe cuz

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.090 
to get one the live rock in maybe cuz
been<00:04:52.170> a<00:04:52.200> while<00:04:52.440> so<00:04:52.620> I'll<00:04:52.710> try<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:52.860> think<00:04:53.010> that

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
been a while so I'll try to think that

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.470 
been a while so I'll try to think that
you<00:04:53.190> could<00:04:53.280> the<00:04:53.370> live<00:04:53.520> walk<00:04:53.700> in<00:04:53.850> before<00:04:54.180> or

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
you could the live walk in before or

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.170 
you could the live walk in before or
after<00:04:55.190> then<00:04:56.190> cycling<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.730> think<00:04:56.910> it's<00:04:57.030> after

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
after then cycling I think it's after

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.290 
after then cycling I think it's after
but<00:04:57.650> I'll<00:04:58.650> make<00:04:59.070> sure<00:04:59.280> that<00:04:59.520> I<00:04:59.580> can<00:04:59.820> throw<00:05:00.090> in

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
but I'll make sure that I can throw in

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.050 
but I'll make sure that I can throw in
there<00:05:00.480> but<00:05:01.070> yeah<00:05:02.070> she'd<00:05:02.310> be<00:05:02.340> updated<00:05:02.760> on<00:05:02.790> this

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
there but yeah she'd be updated on this

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.100 
there but yeah she'd be updated on this
