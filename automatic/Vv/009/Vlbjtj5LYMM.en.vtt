first-person ploy right now i'm in the
stages<00:00:21.560> of<00:00:21.589> testing<00:00:22.220> a<00:00:22.489> camera<00:00:22.849> system<00:00:22.999> that<00:00:23.390> i

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
stages of testing a camera system that i

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.470 
stages of testing a camera system that i
made<00:00:23.720> over<00:00:23.749> the<00:00:24.109> last<00:00:24.199> few<00:00:24.650> weeks<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.480> putting

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
made over the last few weeks and putting

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.249 
made over the last few weeks and putting
out<00:00:26.599> on<00:00:26.749> a<00:00:27.130> stable<00:00:28.130> airplane<00:00:28.609> platform<00:00:29.539> I<00:00:29.869> sky

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
out on a stable airplane platform I sky

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:38.200 
out on a stable airplane platform I sky
f<00:00:31.249> s<00:00:32.290> th<00:00:33.640> 9x<00:00:34.660> flight<00:00:35.660> system<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:36.590> that<00:00:37.280> is<00:00:37.820> a<00:00:37.850> 9

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
f s th 9x flight system so that is a 9

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.479 
f s th 9x flight system so that is a 9
channel<00:00:38.660> radio<00:00:38.840> for<00:00:39.679> under<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.160> hundred

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.900 
channel radio for under a hundred
dollars<00:00:41.059> including<00:00:41.559> shipping<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:43.250> I<00:00:43.609> thought

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
dollars including shipping so I thought

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.229 
dollars including shipping so I thought
that<00:00:44.030> was<00:00:44.149> amazing<00:00:44.420> so<00:00:45.230> I<00:00:45.260> purchased<00:00:45.710> one

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
that was amazing so I purchased one

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.250 
that was amazing so I purchased one
considering<00:00:47.239> i<00:00:47.629> have<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:48.250> send<00:00:49.250> my<00:00:49.690> dx6i<00:00:50.690> back

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
considering i have to send my dx6i back

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.439 
considering i have to send my dx6i back
to<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.070> manufacturer<00:00:52.579> because<00:00:52.940> i<00:00:53.120> lost

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
to the manufacturer because i lost

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.930 
to the manufacturer because i lost
elevator<00:00:54.050> control<00:00:54.469> he<00:00:54.980> can't<00:00:55.219> really<00:00:55.429> fly<00:00:55.820> an

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
elevator control he can't really fly an

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.079 
elevator control he can't really fly an
airplane<00:00:56.179> without<00:00:56.570> elevator<00:00:57.109> control<00:00:58.089> so

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
airplane without elevator control so

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.200 
airplane without elevator control so
what<00:00:59.329> do<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.449> have<00:00:59.719> here<00:01:00.159> if<00:01:01.159> you<00:01:01.489> look<00:01:01.640> back<00:01:01.879> to

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
what do we have here if you look back to

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.810 
what do we have here if you look back to
my<00:01:02.420> previous<00:01:02.600> videos<00:01:03.230> you'll<00:01:03.890> see<00:01:04.159> that<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.489> got

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
my previous videos you'll see that I got

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:12.100 
my previous videos you'll see that I got
this<00:01:05.950> six<00:01:06.950> degrees<00:01:07.280> of<00:01:07.310> freedom<00:01:09.100> chip<00:01:10.810> it<00:01:11.810> also

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
this six degrees of freedom chip it also

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.800 
this six degrees of freedom chip it also
includes<00:01:12.680> magnetometers<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.360> read

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
includes magnetometers so it can read

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.110 
includes magnetometers so it can read
orientation<00:01:18.010> that<00:01:19.010> will<00:01:19.220> help<00:01:19.460> me<00:01:19.640> with<00:01:19.850> my

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:20.120 
orientation that will help me with my

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.750 
orientation that will help me with my
shaking<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.870> head<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.200> no<00:01:21.380> position<00:01:22.070> if<00:01:22.580> you

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
shaking the head and no position if you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.980 
shaking the head and no position if you
don't<00:01:22.910> know<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.060> i'm<00:01:23.180> talking<00:01:23.480> about<00:01:23.510> i<00:01:23.660> am

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
don't know what i'm talking about i am

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.980 
don't know what i'm talking about i am
talking<00:01:24.440> about<00:01:24.530> first<00:01:25.340> person<00:01:25.790> video<00:01:25.990> looking

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
talking about first person video looking

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.770

left<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.530> looking<00:01:28.280> right<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:29.240> is<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.600> most

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
left and looking right that is the most

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.290 
left and looking right that is the most
challenging<00:01:30.710> part<00:01:31.010> of<00:01:31.220> building<00:01:31.880> your<00:01:32.090> own

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
challenging part of building your own

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.390 
challenging part of building your own
first<00:01:33.110> person<00:01:33.590> video<00:01:33.740> system<00:01:34.460> on<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.730> budget

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
first person video system on a budget

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.400 
first person video system on a budget
now<00:01:37.400> here's<00:01:38.150> what<00:01:38.330> we're<00:01:38.450> going<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.660> do<00:01:38.780> we're

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
now here's what we're going to do we're

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.200 
now here's what we're going to do we're
going<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.620> take<00:01:39.860> this<00:01:40.010> chip<00:01:40.340> it's<00:01:40.760> powered<00:01:41.180> by

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
going to take this chip it's powered by

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.830 
going to take this chip it's powered by
5<00:01:41.630> volts<00:01:42.190> coincidentally<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:44.090> are<00:01:44.240> my<00:01:44.390> goggles

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
5 volts coincidentally so are my goggles

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.840 
5 volts coincidentally so are my goggles
so<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:45.620> I'm<00:01:45.710> going<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:45.920> do<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.400> I'm<00:01:46.640> going<00:01:46.760> to

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.720 
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
tap<00:01:47.090> into<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.480> goggles<00:01:48.080> power<00:01:48.410> source<00:01:48.740> power

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
tap into the goggles power source power

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.390 
tap into the goggles power source power
