an alternative way of making the holes

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.559 
an alternative way of making the holes
is<00:02:32.569> supreme<00:02:33.080> measure<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:33.650> create<00:02:33.950> guide<00:02:34.569> this

is supreme measure and create guide this

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.360 
is supreme measure and create guide this
is<00:02:35.630> a<00:02:35.780> more<00:02:36.020> accurate<00:02:36.500> way<00:02:36.650> of<00:02:36.830> making<00:02:37.280> sure

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
is a more accurate way of making sure

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.610 
is a more accurate way of making sure
that<00:02:37.580> the<00:02:37.819> gaps<00:02:38.120> are<00:02:38.390> equidistant

go through the first hole and pull the

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.360 
go through the first hole and pull the
thread<00:02:47.780> through<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.680> so<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:48.980> was<00:02:49.069> about<00:02:49.190> a

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
thread through and so it was about a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.699 
thread through and so it was about a
