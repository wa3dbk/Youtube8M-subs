another format I think we've had in the
formats<00:03:45.200> now<00:03:45.409> that's<00:03:46.370> where<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:47.120> can<00:03:47.239> pretty

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
formats now that's where you can pretty

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.690 
formats now that's where you can pretty
much<00:03:47.540> tell<00:03:47.930> when<00:03:48.859> a<00:03:48.919> degenerate<00:03:49.430> deck<00:03:49.549> is

played in that format you pretty much

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.950 
played in that format you pretty much
know<00:04:24.430> what<00:04:24.760> your<00:04:24.940> extreme<00:04:25.330> card<00:04:25.600> choice<00:04:25.810> is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960

the deck in today's day and age and it's

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.840 
the deck in today's day and age and it's
a<00:04:35.710> lot<00:04:35.830> weaker<00:04:36.010> than<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.340> previous<00:04:36.670> deck

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.820 
a lot weaker than the previous deck
doesn't<00:04:37.330> mean<00:04:37.660> that<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.990> deck<00:04:38.140> doesn't<00:04:38.410> do

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
doesn't mean that the deck doesn't do

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.640 
doesn't mean that the deck doesn't do
the<00:04:39.190> same<00:04:39.400> functionally<00:04:40.180> like<00:04:40.930> flamboyant

the same functionally like flamboyant
thing<00:04:41.770> that<00:04:41.920> it<00:04:42.010> used<00:04:42.220> to<00:04:42.400> so<00:04:42.640> I<00:04:42.880> know<00:04:43.240> just

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
thing that it used to so I know just

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.480

something<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.410> lot<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.650> players<00:04:44.920> take<00:04:45.280> for

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
something that a lot of players take for

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.430 
something that a lot of players take for
granted<00:04:45.730> is<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.540> previous<00:04:46.930> floor<00:04:47.200> mats
