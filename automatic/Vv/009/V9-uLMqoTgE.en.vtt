stones what I have here is an atlas
stone<00:00:04.710> then<00:00:05.130> we<00:00:05.220> just<00:00:05.400> took<00:00:05.490> out<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:05.879> mold

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
stone then we just took out of the mold

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.589 
stone then we just took out of the mold
and<00:00:06.919> you'll<00:00:07.919> see<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.670> top<00:00:08.849> there's<00:00:09.179> like<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
and you'll see on the top there's like a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.220 
and you'll see on the top there's like a
little<00:00:10.110> I<00:00:10.519> guess<00:00:11.519> nipple<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.870> lack<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
little I guess nipple for lack of a

little I guess nipple for lack of a
better<00:00:13.259> word<00:00:13.910> sticking<00:00:14.910> out<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> what<00:00:16.109> we've

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
better word sticking out and what we've

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.769 
better word sticking out and what we've
got<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.529> do<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.740> we've<00:00:16.890> got<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.130> grind<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.609> off

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
got to do is we've got to grind that off

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.900 
got to do is we've got to grind that off
so<00:00:18.779> what<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> what<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:19.980> normally<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.670> feel

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
so what I what I do normally is I feel

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.609 
so what I what I do normally is I feel
the<00:00:21.029> stone<00:00:21.240> up<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:21.689> fill<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> mold<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.410> and

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the stone up or fill the mold up and

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.890 
the stone up or fill the mold up and
then<00:00:23.070> overfill<00:00:23.699> so<00:00:23.910> I<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.150> grind<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> also

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
then overfill so I can grind this also

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.900 
then overfill so I can grind this also
don't<00:00:25.050> have<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> really<00:00:25.380> big<00:00:25.560> classify<00:00:26.130> we

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
don't have a really big classify we

don't have a really big classify we
still<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.330> bit<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.630> flat<00:00:27.960> flat

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260

still want a little bit this flat flat
spot<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.070> rest<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> stone<00:00:29.580> away<00:00:30.390> on

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
spot so you can rest the stone away on

check<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.330> out

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.930 

second<00:01:00.240> thing<00:01:00.450> safety<00:01:01.410> glasses<00:01:01.650> and<00:01:02.370> then<00:01:02.910> I

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
second thing safety glasses and then I

00:01:02.940 --> 00:02:12.050 
second thing safety glasses and then I
was<00:01:03.330> a<00:01:03.360> respirator<00:01:04.080> whatever

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.420 

so<00:02:13.060> that's<00:02:13.270> it<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:14.020> moving<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.560> flat<00:02:14.770> spot<00:02:15.070> I

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so that's it for moving the flat spot I

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.550 
so that's it for moving the flat spot I
can<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.210> through<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.690> can<00:02:16.720> sand<00:02:17.110> this<00:02:17.290> if

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
can go through and I can sand this if

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.350 
can go through and I can sand this if
there<00:02:17.740> are<00:02:17.800> any<00:02:17.920> uh<00:02:18.570> like<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:22.150> any

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
there are any uh like there's any

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.300 
there are any uh like there's any
roughness<00:02:22.660> around<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> scene<00:02:23.530> then<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.070> can<00:02:24.220> go

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
roughness around the scene then I can go

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.830 
roughness around the scene then I can go
through<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.670> saying<00:02:24.880> that<00:02:25.120> I'd<00:02:25.360> rather<00:02:25.540> use<00:02:25.810> a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
through and saying that I'd rather use a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.360 
through and saying that I'd rather use a
flap<00:02:26.260> disk<00:02:26.700> rather<00:02:27.700> than<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.120> diamond<00:02:28.660> cup

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
flap disk rather than a diamond cup

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.130 
flap disk rather than a diamond cup
grinder<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.790> that<00:02:31.000> because<00:02:31.240> that<00:02:31.960> will

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
grinder for that because that will

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.020 
grinder for that because that will
really<00:02:32.350> be<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.710> pretty<00:02:33.220> aggressive<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.820> could

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
really be a pretty aggressive you could

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:56.100 
really be a pretty aggressive you could
take<00:02:34.270> out<00:02:34.480> some<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:55.060> rough<00:02:55.300> well<00:02:55.600> one<00:02:55.960> good

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
take out some so rough well one good

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.810 
take out some so rough well one good
thing<00:02:56.170> about<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.740> is<00:02:56.860> the<00:02:57.070> bottom<00:02:57.370> being<00:02:57.520> rough

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
thing about it is the bottom being rough

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.460 
thing about it is the bottom being rough
like<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.270> will<00:02:58.510> allow<00:02:58.690> you<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.930> grip<00:02:59.320> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
like this will allow you to grip the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.440 
like this will allow you to grip the
stone<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.710> little<00:02:59.830> bit<00:03:00.130> better<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.030> if<00:03:01.330> you

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
stone a little bit better but if you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.910 
stone a little bit better but if you
want<00:03:01.720> to<00:03:01.960> patch<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:04.410> see<00:03:05.410> how<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.620> top

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
want to patch that see how the top

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.270 
want to patch that see how the top
smooth<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:09.010> then<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> bottom<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.510> rough

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
smooth and then the bottom is rough

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.950 
smooth and then the bottom is rough
which<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.550> say<00:03:12.820> top<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.300> bottom<00:03:13.600> because<00:03:13.810> when

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
which I say top and bottom because when

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.210 
which I say top and bottom because when
you<00:03:14.050> lift<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.350> stone<00:03:14.530> you'll<00:03:14.770> have<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.010> flat

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
you lift the stone you'll have the flat

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.820 
you lift the stone you'll have the flat
spot<00:03:15.520> down<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.780> this<00:03:17.020> becomes<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.500> bottom

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
spot down now this becomes the bottom

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.560 
spot down now this becomes the bottom
but<00:03:17.980> when<00:03:18.010> you<00:03:18.190> pour<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.460> stone<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.180> the<00:03:19.330> mold

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
but when you pour the stone and the mold

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.260 
but when you pour the stone and the mold
this<00:03:19.960> is<00:03:20.140> actually<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.710> top<00:03:20.940> another<00:03:21.940> thing<00:03:22.180> I

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
this is actually the top another thing I

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:29.290 
this is actually the top another thing I
used<00:03:22.540> just<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.020> little

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.420 

before<00:03:30.300> you<00:03:30.450> ever<00:03:30.570> patch<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.200> stone<00:03:31.470> want<00:03:32.370> to

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
before you ever patch it stone want to

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.880 
before you ever patch it stone want to
make<00:03:32.580> sure<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.910> stones<00:03:33.180> wet<00:03:33.590> so

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
make sure the stones wet so
