you<00:02:39.910> should<00:02:40.480> always<00:02:41.260> mix<00:02:41.800> it<00:02:41.980> until<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.430> boils

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
you should always mix it until it boils

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.830 
you should always mix it until it boils
slowly<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:44.530> also<00:02:44.800> leave<00:02:45.160> some<00:02:45.660> places<00:02:46.660> that

slowly and I also leave some places that

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.050 
slowly and I also leave some places that
we<00:02:47.519> refine<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:49.600> wait<00:02:50.489> then<00:02:51.489> three<00:02:51.790> times

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
we refine and wait then three times

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.840 
we refine and wait then three times
again<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.600> then<00:02:53.110> wait<00:02:53.380> three<00:02:53.739> times

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
again and then wait three times

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.820 
again and then wait three times
and<00:02:55.000> some<00:02:55.360> say<00:02:55.570> we<00:02:56.110> should<00:02:56.290> mix<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.590> three

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
and some say we should mix it three

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.759 
and some say we should mix it three
times<00:02:57.100> right<00:02:57.390> three<00:02:58.390> times<00:02:58.690> left<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.620> the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
times right three times left but the

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.009 
times right three times left but the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019

few seconds more

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.500 
few seconds more
so<00:03:26.049> we<00:03:26.200> call<00:03:26.409> it<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.950> comes<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.549> to<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.879> so<00:03:28.330> it

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
so we call it it comes up to you so it

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:46.910 
so we call it it comes up to you so it
is<00:03:28.629> exactly<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.260> time

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.090 

we<00:03:47.280> should<00:03:47.550> miss<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.420> moment<00:03:48.840> so<00:03:49.710> you<00:03:49.770> should

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
we should miss that moment so you should

00:03:50.100 --> 00:04:03.000 
we should miss that moment so you should
watch<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.340> carefully

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.960 

from<00:04:04.010> a<00:04:04.310> few<00:04:04.520> seconds

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.020 

oh<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.630> way<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:10.080> cold<00:04:10.380> yeah<00:04:11.070> really<00:04:11.760> cool

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030

thing

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:47.670 

so<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.630> boils<00:04:29.150> tip<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.270> up

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.710 

so<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:48.820> comes<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.270> bit<00:04:49.419> up<00:04:49.600> and<00:04:50.350> I<00:04:50.440> can<00:04:50.650> take<00:04:50.860> it

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
so it comes a bit up and I can take it

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.030 
so it comes a bit up and I can take it
and<00:04:52.720> then<00:04:52.900> we<00:04:53.080> shaved<00:04:53.410> okay

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
and then we shaved okay

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.370 
and then we shaved okay
