style<00:03:09.760> cars<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:11.380> I<00:03:11.410> think<00:03:11.709> that<00:03:11.739> one's<00:03:12.010> pretty

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
style cars but I think that one's pretty

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.729 
style cars but I think that one's pretty
cool<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.930> so<00:03:13.930> big<00:03:14.200> how<00:03:15.450> Dante<00:03:16.450> something<00:03:16.900> the

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
cool so so big how Dante something the

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.710 
cool so so big how Dante something the
seller<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:21.010> know<00:03:21.130> what<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.640> may<00:03:22.120> have<00:03:22.239> got<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
seller you know what I may have got the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.259 
seller you know what I may have got the
I<00:03:23.160> think<00:03:24.160> this<00:03:24.280> is<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.459> one<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.850> had<00:03:25.030> free

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
I think this is the one that had free

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.789 
I think this is the one that had free
shipping<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:25.840> order<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.290> over<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.530> certain

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
shipping if you order it over a certain

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.280 
shipping if you order it over a certain
amount<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.340> that's<00:03:27.670> why<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:27.970> got<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.360> car<00:03:28.900> set

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
amount and that's why I got the car set

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.220 
amount and that's why I got the car set
to<00:03:29.650> get<00:03:29.769> me<00:03:29.920> over<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.280> free<00:03:30.459> shipping<00:03:31.230> plateau

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
to get me over the free shipping plateau

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.530 
to get me over the free shipping plateau
which<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.160> awesome<00:03:33.340> when<00:03:33.820> you<00:03:33.880> when<00:03:34.420> it's

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
which is awesome when you when it's

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.479 
which is awesome when you when it's
coming<00:03:34.750> from<00:03:34.959> Germany<00:03:35.230> because<00:03:36.010> i<00:03:36.100> have

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
coming from Germany because i have

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.210 
coming from Germany because i have
another<00:03:36.760> order<00:03:37.180> that's<00:03:37.390> coming<00:03:37.810> but<00:03:37.989> this<00:03:38.920> one

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
another order that's coming but this one

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.330 
another order that's coming but this one
I<00:03:39.519> think<00:03:39.820> was<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.239> free<00:03:40.540> shipping<00:03:40.720> one

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
I think was the free shipping one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.190 
I think was the free shipping one
because<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.549> was<00:03:42.970> trying<00:03:43.390> to<00:03:43.540> figure<00:03:43.600> out<00:03:43.720> why<00:03:43.900> i

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
because I was trying to figure out why i

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.990 
because I was trying to figure out why i
buy<00:03:44.560> stuff<00:03:44.620> already<00:03:45.040> got<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:45.790> that's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
buy stuff already got but that's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.449 
buy stuff already got but that's
probably<00:03:46.299> what<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.780> was<00:03:46.980> but<00:03:47.980> i<00:03:48.130> think<00:03:48.190> that

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
probably what it was but i think that

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.300 
probably what it was but i think that
garage<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:49.450> pretty<00:03:49.750> cool<00:03:49.959> looking<00:03:50.170> at<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.709> never

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
remember seeing it in the in the stores

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.819 
remember seeing it in the in the stores

Mickey Mouse set
but<00:04:08.020> that<00:04:08.830> is<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.430> hall<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.590> it<00:04:11.590> pretty<00:04:11.800> much

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
but that is the hall and it pretty much

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.710 
but that is the hall and it pretty much
started<00:04:12.480> with<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:13.750> Mickey<00:04:14.050> Mouse<00:04:14.080> set<00:04:14.620> and
