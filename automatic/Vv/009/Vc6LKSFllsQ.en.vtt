on<00:02:13.000> a<00:02:13.060> full<00:02:13.420> eight<00:02:13.690> by<00:02:13.930> 11<00:02:13.960> sheet<00:02:14.440> there's<00:02:15.400> a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
on a full eight by 11 sheet there's a

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.240 
on a full eight by 11 sheet there's a
one<00:02:15.760> inch<00:02:15.910> margin<00:02:16.360> here<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.990> 1<00:02:17.650> inch<00:02:17.800> margin

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
one inch margin here a 1 inch margin

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.160 
one inch margin here a 1 inch margin
here<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.940> 1<00:02:19.210> inch<00:02:19.390> margin<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:19.960> because

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
here and a 1 inch margin here because

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.800 
here and a 1 inch margin here because
that's<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.500> default<00:02:20.710> on<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.250> computer<00:02:21.730> right

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
that's the default on the computer right

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.180 
that's the default on the computer right
well<00:02:22.810> then<00:02:23.230> you're<00:02:23.770> going<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.950> take<00:02:24.040> your

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
well then you're going to take your

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.970 
well then you're going to take your
handy-dandy<00:02:24.730> ruler<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:26.290> are<00:02:26.500> going<00:02:26.800> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
handy-dandy ruler and you are going to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.840 
handy-dandy ruler and you are going to
measure<00:02:27.700> down<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:29.200> make<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.680> 8<00:02:29.950> by<00:02:30.220> 8<00:02:30.400> square

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
measure down to make this 8 by 8 square

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.730 
measure down to make this 8 by 8 square
so<00:02:31.420> basically<00:02:31.870> you're<00:02:32.110> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.320> take<00:02:32.500> away

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
so basically you're going to take away

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.710 
so basically you're going to take away
that<00:02:32.920> top<00:02:33.160> part<00:02:33.400> okay<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.420> it's<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.660> to

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
that top part okay and it's going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440 
that top part okay and it's going to
look<00:02:34.870> like<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:35.880> sometimes<00:02:36.880> you<00:02:37.120> have<00:02:37.150> to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
look like this sometimes you have to

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.350 
look like this sometimes you have to
trim<00:02:37.810> these<00:02:37.990> edges<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:39.370> get<00:02:39.550> them<00:02:39.670> just<00:02:40.030> rot

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
trim these edges to get them just rot

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.320 
trim these edges to get them just rot
but<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.200> best<00:02:41.470> trip<00:02:41.770> to<00:02:41.980> do<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.730> put

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
but the best trip to do that is to put

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.960 
but the best trip to do that is to put
it<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.630> on<00:02:43.870> your<00:02:43.990> board<00:02:44.350> lay<00:02:45.220> it<00:02:45.370> on<00:02:45.459> your<00:02:45.640> board

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
it up on your board lay it on your board

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.900 
it up on your board lay it on your board
flip<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.140> over<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.620> then<00:02:47.709> exacto<00:02:48.700> knife

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
flip it over and then exacto knife

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.270 
flip it over and then exacto knife
anything<00:02:49.540> away<00:02:49.750> that<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.470> don't<00:02:50.800> need<00:02:50.980> that

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
anything away that you don't need that

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.760 
anything away that you don't need that
way<00:02:51.760> it's<00:02:52.270> a<00:02:53.010> dead<00:02:54.010> template<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.090> okay<00:02:55.770> so

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
way it's a dead template to that okay so

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.880 
way it's a dead template to that okay so
um<00:02:57.660> the<00:02:58.660> next<00:02:58.989> thing<00:02:59.080> we're<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.410> do<00:02:59.620> is

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
um the next thing we're going to do is

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:07.979 
um the next thing we're going to do is
you<00:03:00.130> need<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:01.350> glue<00:03:02.350> your<00:03:02.910> board<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:06.989> back

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
you need to glue your board to the back

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.440 
you need to glue your board to the back
of<00:03:08.020> your<00:03:08.290> picture<00:03:08.650> frame<00:03:08.920> now<00:03:09.640> I<00:03:09.970> thought<00:03:10.270> that

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
of your picture frame now I thought that

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.620 
of your picture frame now I thought that
it<00:03:10.570> would<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:11.020> super<00:03:11.680> simple<00:03:12.310> if<00:03:12.610> I<00:03:13.270> went<00:03:13.510> ahead

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
it would be super simple if I went ahead

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.770 
it would be super simple if I went ahead
and<00:03:14.100> built<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.340> guys<00:03:15.519> a<00:03:15.549> template<00:03:16.180> of<00:03:16.360> how<00:03:16.720> to

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
and built you guys a template of how to

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.100 
and built you guys a template of how to
lay<00:03:17.350> these<00:03:17.680> testers<00:03:18.250> out<00:03:18.549> so<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.450> did<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:19.870> and

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
lay these testers out so I did that and

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.330 
lay these testers out so I did that and
i'm<00:03:20.470> going<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.680> upload<00:03:20.830> these<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:23.340> upload

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
i'm going to upload these to upload

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.400 
i'm going to upload these to upload
these<00:03:24.519> online<00:03:24.760> so<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.570> guys<00:03:25.750> can<00:03:26.080> click

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
these online so that you guys can click

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.850 
these online so that you guys can click
on<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.670> print<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.500> again<00:03:29.500> i

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
on that and just print it again i

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.650 
on that and just print it again i
believe<00:03:30.400> that<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.730> will<00:03:30.850> print<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> bottom

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
believe that it will print on the bottom

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.479 
believe that it will print on the bottom
part<00:03:32.080> of<00:03:32.320> your<00:03:32.500> word<00:03:32.680> document<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.310> you'll

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
part of your word document and you'll

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.759 
part of your word document and you'll
still<00:03:33.760> have<00:03:33.880> to<00:03:33.970> cut<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.330> top<00:03:34.510> off<00:03:34.750> but<00:03:35.470> this

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
still have to cut the top off but this

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.340 
still have to cut the top off but this
shows<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.489> exactly<00:03:36.670> where<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.570> lay<00:03:37.780> your<00:03:38.110> mini

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
shows you exactly where to lay your mini

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.770 
shows you exactly where to lay your mini
testers<00:03:38.830> so<00:03:39.040> that<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.310> get<00:03:39.459> that<00:03:39.640> S<00:03:39.880> shape<00:03:40.209> now

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
testers so that you get that S shape now

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.530 
testers so that you get that S shape now
granite<00:03:41.230> you<00:03:41.350> could<00:03:41.530> do<00:03:41.709> lead<00:03:42.459> consult<00:03:43.360> you

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
granite you could do lead consult you

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.140 
granite you could do lead consult you
know<00:03:43.660> lead<00:03:43.959> right<00:03:44.350> here<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.860> do<00:03:44.950> an<00:03:45.070> L<00:03:45.310> or<00:03:45.580> you

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
know lead right here and do an L or you

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.720 
know lead right here and do an L or you
could<00:03:46.330> do<00:03:46.480> director<00:03:47.170> and<00:03:47.500> do<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.650> d<00:03:47.950> we<00:03:48.489> do<00:03:48.640> it

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
could do director and do a d we do it

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.789 
could do director and do a d we do it
every<00:03:48.820> one<00:03:49.090> anyway<00:03:49.690> back<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.530> we're

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
every one anyway back to this we're

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.210 
every one anyway back to this we're
going<00:03:50.920> to<00:03:50.980> glue<00:03:51.250> this<00:03:51.549> to<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.060> board<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.680> your

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
going to glue this to the board so your

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.820 
going to glue this to the board so your
best<00:03:54.459> bet<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.269> do<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.870> is<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.170> want<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.500> stay

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
best bet to do that is you want to stay

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.100 
best bet to do that is you want to stay
in<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:58.890> template<00:03:59.890> line<00:04:00.360> okay<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:01.989> we're

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
in this template line okay so we're

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.500 
in this template line okay so we're
going<00:04:02.200> to<00:04:02.290> flip<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.590> over<00:04:02.799> on<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.130> back<00:04:03.510> and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
going to flip it over on the back and

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.479 
going to flip it over on the back and
kind<00:04:04.750> of<00:04:04.870> hold<00:04:05.140> it<00:04:05.260> up<00:04:05.380> to<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> light<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:06.310> where

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
kind of hold it up to the light to where

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.520 
kind of hold it up to the light to where
we<00:04:06.670> can<00:04:06.880> see<00:04:07.209> where<00:04:07.480> our<00:04:07.510> pencil<00:04:08.079> marks<00:04:08.290> are

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
we can see where our pencil marks are

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.920 
we can see where our pencil marks are
and<00:04:08.799> we're<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.519> to<00:04:09.549> glue<00:04:11.040> like<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.720> in<00:04:13.720> a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
and we're going to glue like that in a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.590 
and we're going to glue like that in a
line<00:04:14.140> that<00:04:14.890> way<00:04:15.130> when<00:04:15.400> we<00:04:15.549> stick<00:04:15.880> it<00:04:15.910> on<00:04:16.180> here

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
line that way when we stick it on here

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.699 
line that way when we stick it on here
it<00:04:17.290> is<00:04:17.530> stuck<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> board<00:04:18.580> but<00:04:19.390> any<00:04:19.720> ripple

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
it is stuck to the board but any ripple

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.069 
it is stuck to the board but any ripple
watermarks<00:04:21.489> that<00:04:21.760> this

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
watermarks that this

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.670 
watermarks that this
glue<00:04:22.229> gun<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:23.030> gives<00:04:24.030> us<00:04:24.330> will<00:04:24.930> be<00:04:24.960> covered<00:04:25.530> up

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
glue gun and gives us will be covered up

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.830 
glue gun and gives us will be covered up
with<00:04:25.889> those<00:04:26.039> testers<00:04:26.639> okay<00:04:27.270> so<00:04:27.330> keep<00:04:27.689> your

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
with those testers okay so keep your

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.890 
with those testers okay so keep your
glue<00:04:28.080> in<00:04:28.379> your<00:04:28.650> in<00:04:29.250> your<00:04:29.310> thing<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:29.909> then<00:04:30.539> it's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
glue in your in your thing and then it's

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.200 
glue in your in your thing and then it's
very<00:04:31.110> simple<00:04:31.379> from<00:04:31.710> there<00:04:31.979> you<00:04:32.669> just<00:04:32.699> take

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
very simple from there you just take

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.350 
very simple from there you just take
this<00:04:33.740> and<00:04:34.740> you're<00:04:34.949> 19<00:04:35.370> little<00:04:35.669> pre-selected

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
this and you're 19 little pre-selected

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.990 
this and you're 19 little pre-selected
testers<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.199> you<00:04:37.710> begin<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.099> lay<00:04:38.610> them<00:04:38.849> out

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
testers and you begin to lay them out

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.399 
testers and you begin to lay them out
and<00:04:39.469> a<00:04:40.469> little<00:04:40.979> dot<00:04:41.189> of<00:04:41.219> hot<00:04:41.909> glue<00:04:42.120> right<00:04:42.990> like

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
and a little dot of hot glue right like

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.730 
and a little dot of hot glue right like
this<00:04:43.560> like<00:04:44.370> that<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:45.240> then<00:04:45.539> you<00:04:45.719> lay<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.620> on

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
this like that and then you lay it on

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.820 
this like that and then you lay it on
the<00:04:46.860> board<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.669> stick<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.240> down<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:49.319> then<00:04:49.740> you

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
the board and stick it down and then you

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.249 
the board and stick it down and then you
go<00:04:49.919> to<00:04:49.979> your<00:04:50.129> next<00:04:50.219> one<00:04:50.490> any<00:04:50.729> lay<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.050> stick

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
go to your next one any lay it and stick

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.550 
go to your next one any lay it and stick
it<00:04:52.289> down<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:52.969> so<00:04:53.969> on<00:04:54.180> and<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.419> forth<00:04:54.569> and<00:04:55.530> you

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
it down and so on and so forth and you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.770 
it down and so on and so forth and you
stick<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.669> in<00:04:57.590> like<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:59.270> now<00:05:00.270> these<00:05:00.449> long

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
stick it all in like that now these long

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.180 
stick it all in like that now these long
ones<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.199> have<00:05:01.319> to<00:05:01.379> pay<00:05:01.560> attention<00:05:01.590> if

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
ones you have to pay attention if

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.730 
ones you have to pay attention if
there's<00:05:02.659> actually<00:05:03.659> three<00:05:03.690> that<00:05:04.379> goes<00:05:04.560> in

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
there's actually three that goes in

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.369 
there's actually three that goes in
there<00:05:05.780> okay<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.169> then<00:05:07.740> two<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:09.090> one<00:05:09.539> another

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379 
there okay and then two and one another

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.439 
there okay and then two and one another
thing<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.710> keep<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.129> mind<00:05:11.190> is<00:05:11.729> when<00:05:12.030> you<00:05:12.180> have<00:05:12.389> a

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
thing to keep in mind is when you have a

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.050 
thing to keep in mind is when you have a
tester<00:05:13.080> that<00:05:13.949> is<00:05:14.370> twisted<00:05:15.440> kind<00:05:16.440> of<00:05:16.620> sideways

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
tester that is twisted kind of sideways

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.860 
tester that is twisted kind of sideways
you<00:05:18.060> might<00:05:18.300> want<00:05:18.629> to<00:05:19.219> untwist<00:05:20.219> it<00:05:20.639> to<00:05:21.479> make<00:05:21.689> it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
you might want to untwist it to make it

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.010 
you might want to untwist it to make it
straight<00:05:22.229> up<00:05:22.259> and<00:05:22.469> down<00:05:23.539> before<00:05:24.539> you<00:05:24.689> lay<00:05:24.870> it

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
straight up and down before you lay it

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.360 
straight up and down before you lay it
in<00:05:25.169> because<00:05:25.379> when<00:05:25.620> you<00:05:25.740> look<00:05:25.979> at<00:05:26.129> this<00:05:26.310> you

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
in because when you look at this you

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.689 
in because when you look at this you
want<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:26.759> be<00:05:26.879> able<00:05:26.969> to<00:05:27.120> read<00:05:27.389> each<00:05:27.690> one<00:05:27.719> of<00:05:27.990> them

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
want to be able to read each one of them

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.610 
want to be able to read each one of them
so<00:05:29.699> whatever<00:05:30.180> floats<00:05:30.539> you<00:05:30.719> wrote<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:31.169> one's

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
so whatever floats you wrote that one's

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.709 
so whatever floats you wrote that one's
kind<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:31.949> crooked<00:05:32.279> but<00:05:32.490> so<00:05:33.419> we're<00:05:33.509> going<00:05:33.599> to

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
kind of crooked but so we're going to

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:36.320 
kind of crooked but so we're going to
lay<00:05:33.900> see<00:05:34.830> we<00:05:34.949> want<00:05:35.159> to<00:05:35.219> we<00:05:35.909> don't<00:05:35.940> want<00:05:36.180> too

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
lay see we want to we don't want too

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.269 
lay see we want to we don't want too
much<00:05:36.449> red<00:05:36.779> in<00:05:36.810> that<00:05:36.990> one<00:05:37.319> so<00:05:37.650> we<00:05:37.770> might<00:05:37.949> go<00:05:38.099> back

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
much red in that one so we might go back

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.570 
much red in that one so we might go back
to<00:05:38.580> a<00:05:38.819> big<00:05:39.779> poppa<00:05:40.050> orange<00:05:40.560> on<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.800> end<00:05:41.099> and<00:05:41.490> a

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
to a big poppa orange on the end and a

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.879 
to a big poppa orange on the end and a
yellow<00:05:41.849> and<00:05:42.830> then<00:05:43.830> maybe<00:05:44.009> a<00:05:44.129> blue<00:05:44.490> here<00:05:45.889> very

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
yellow and then maybe a blue here very

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:50.019 
yellow and then maybe a blue here very
meticulous<00:05:47.789> stuff<00:05:48.180> here<00:05:48.509> with<00:05:48.690> these<00:05:48.839> testers

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
meticulous stuff here with these testers

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:55.490 
meticulous stuff here with these testers
maybe<00:05:51.029> a<00:05:51.150> white<00:05:52.460> and<00:05:53.460> another<00:05:53.789> red<00:05:54.180> and<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.259> red

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
maybe a white and another red and a red

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.249 
maybe a white and another red and a red
and<00:05:55.889> a<00:05:55.949> green<00:05:56.150> how<00:05:57.150> does<00:05:57.330> that<00:05:57.360> look<00:05:57.629> so

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
and a green how does that look so

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:01.670 
and a green how does that look so
there's<00:05:58.589> your<00:05:58.889> s<00:05:59.219> isn't<00:05:59.669> that<00:05:59.879> fun<00:06:00.319> so<00:06:01.319> then

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
there's your s isn't that fun so then

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.869 
there's your s isn't that fun so then
next<00:06:02.370> step<00:06:02.819> would<00:06:03.599> be<00:06:03.659> to<00:06:03.870> changer<00:06:04.879> now

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:05.879 
next step would be to changer now

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:08.119 
next step would be to changer now
granted<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.300> is<00:06:06.479> all<00:06:06.690> glued<00:06:06.960> down<00:06:07.199> you<00:06:07.979> would

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
granted this is all glued down you would

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.240 
granted this is all glued down you would
take<00:06:08.339> this<00:06:09.349> well<00:06:10.349> this<00:06:10.529> one's<00:06:10.740> not<00:06:10.889> glued<00:06:11.099> down

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
take this well this one's not glued down

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.290 
take this well this one's not glued down
but<00:06:11.849> you<00:06:11.969> would<00:06:12.089> lay<00:06:12.300> it<00:06:12.479> over<00:06:13.069> right<00:06:14.069> and<00:06:14.339> then

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
but you would lay it over right and then

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.860 
but you would lay it over right and then
you<00:06:15.449> would<00:06:15.599> just<00:06:15.779> secure<00:06:16.259> the<00:06:16.409> back<00:06:17.599> with<00:06:18.599> your

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
you would just secure the back with your

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.939 
you would just secure the back with your
little<00:06:19.940> security<00:06:20.940> Dewey<00:06:21.479> heckis<00:06:21.990> make<00:06:22.620> sure

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
little security Dewey heckis make sure

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:26.269 
little security Dewey heckis make sure
when<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.300> put<00:06:24.330> your<00:06:24.710> well<00:06:25.710> I<00:06:25.919> guess<00:06:26.129> it

00:06:26.269 --> 00:06:26.279 
when you put your well I guess it

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.149 
when you put your well I guess it
wouldn't<00:06:26.460> matter<00:06:26.639> just<00:06:27.629> these<00:06:28.229> are<00:06:28.620> going<00:06:29.039> to

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
wouldn't matter just these are going to
