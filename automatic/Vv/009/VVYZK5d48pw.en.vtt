one time young punks lucky there
obviously<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.950> felt<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.640> might<00:01:41.820> have<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
obviously I felt like you might have a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
obviously I felt like you might have a
queen<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:43.079> might<00:01:43.259> not<00:01:43.439> of<00:01:43.829> course<00:01:44.070> which<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
queen you might not of course which is

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.530 
queen you might not of course which is
why<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> play<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.299> even<00:01:45.479> though

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
why we make the play but even though

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.760 
why we make the play but even though
like<00:01:45.630> i<00:01:45.750> said<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.020> even<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> does<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
like i said if even if it does have the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.039 
like i said if even if it does have the
queen<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.610> not<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.850> terrible<00:01:48.479> shape<00:01:48.540> simply

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
queen we're not in terrible shape simply

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.660 
queen we're not in terrible shape simply
because<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> five<00:01:50.369> or<00:01:50.640> the

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
because we can get the five or the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
because we can get the five or the
diamond<00:01:51.119> which<00:01:51.240> gives<00:01:51.450> us<00:01:51.540> enough<00:01:51.810> outs<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
diamond which gives us enough outs to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.830 
diamond which gives us enough outs to
