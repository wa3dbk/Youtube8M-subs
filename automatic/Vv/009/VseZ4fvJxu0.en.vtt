00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
breathe in air you bring in oxygen it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.520 
breathe in air you bring in oxygen it
goes<00:01:32.100> into<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.789> lungs<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.570> then<00:01:34.319> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
goes into your lungs and then you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.320 
goes into your lungs and then you
breathe<00:01:34.830> out<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.729> blow<00:01:36.410> carbon<00:01:37.410> dioxide<00:01:38.069> out

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330
