00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello you love to welcome 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.750
 a new video on kids surprise 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.880
 and today with another pocket 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 letter i had some time ago 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.299
 you already explained what pocket liter 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.240
 and that's a new one now 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 trend is and I have the last ones now 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.779
 Two days back three tinkered and the 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.850
 I just wanted to show you 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 this will happen in separate videos 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.849
 because i have to tell everyone specifically how 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.980
 I made them so you can do that 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.790
 maybe you can do it and so on 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.440
 looks my current throughout and 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 we'll go to the top three 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.850
 fan as a background I have completely 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.190
 normal motive paper I've taken 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 this one pale blue decided to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.760
 white dots 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.730
 the boxes themselves always have to be 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.149
 cut 65 in the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 width 9 or 91 in length 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.440
 So you make yourselves 9 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 such small boxes I have that 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.780
 paper can handle me that way 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.770
 Cut that, so to speak, three times 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.049
 65 wide and 3 x 91 so I have 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.299
 it has not been shared in the middle so 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.619
 you see, here I have structure 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.070
 fit worked 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.200
 I'll get you you times quickly so 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.150
 she at vbs is called the snow deko 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.310
 actually, the structure fit something 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.750
 coarse grained is many they know 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.759
 maybe even from my video 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 with the mobile phone cases where they applied 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.000
 I got it and I got it 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.820
 Never the templates of Schieber yet 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.650
 taken and that if that big 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.899
 templates in here you can see it already 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.149
 I put that on top of it 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.460
 the structure fits nicely over it 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:51.270
 appliances with a normal household 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.950
 swam and yes then this is pattern 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.940
 first only in white 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.130
 then I have mine 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.990
 an inkpad what this rainbow 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.200
 has progressed and there I have it so 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.510
 a little bit yes colored here 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.430
 I always have this rest around 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 What else I had on swimming I have 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 wiped away a bit 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.590
 so that I still everywhere on the paper 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.100
 a bit different structure button 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.260
 have 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.190
 I have a gift ribbon here 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.690
 glued and here are little deko hearts 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.690
 I have made the work so 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 scattering for wedding and though very much 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 to heart 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.330
 I also fit with structure 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.290
 brushed in and dried 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.480
 leave and I am there with the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.380
 ink pad over here you can still see 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:43.930
 so small towns in the next drive 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:46.540
 I heart what you see up here 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.270
 just put it on and hair with 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.460
 structure fit with advice so one 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.920
 small imprint arises and also here 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.870
 I have the whole thing with the rainbow 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.430
 inkpad so a little bit younga 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.440
 adapted then I have here so 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
 gifts glued tape again that it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.660
 have been here repeatedly with up here 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.250
 I have a bit of colorful paper with it 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.780
 a little bit more and lay 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.150
 come in that it is not quite so 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.410
 everything looks neutral here too 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.830
 small pictures here on it 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.330
 made and repeated here below 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:23.920
 I have so much more 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.810
 left in blue because of the selection 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.550
 I did not have the background paper 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.510
 as much as the possibilities say so much 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.830
 to play here 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.180
 and yes that's the pocket letter 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.800
 I agree with the structure 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.170
 if I am so I personally 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:42.670
 feel it so with the structure fit 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.350
 I do not have that kind of worker 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.630
 free travel around me creative 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.970
 let it out so I felt 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.580
 I had a lot to back off by 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.739
 this structure just fit that and that 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.380
 is my first brocke leaves follow it 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.470
 two more with the structure fits 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.000
 take a look at it and yes if 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.530
 you want to trade if you 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.690
 myself as I did can be 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.980
 to know us in the comments if the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.550
 is sent to the yes 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.230
 Back still good work this is not 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.340
 I know that show it cool if 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.020
 one then sends the letter 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.070
 prevent so small things purely in 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.140
 the middle comes is called a small one 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.010
 Wanted letter of 1 itself and the 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:24.020
 included any craft things 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:29.390
 nobody stops the city so much 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.200
 rheinstetten something sweet clinging 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:35.690
 many sticky notes 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.300
 I have that from others, too 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.930
 again stickers small scattering articles 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.640
 animals and so therefore sees the whole of 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.520
 that here is a good one and then come 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.680
 still in if you have the whole thing 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.690
 sent that was the first one now 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.400
 Maybe it will continue now and this one 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.870
 I think that's really nice then me 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.870
