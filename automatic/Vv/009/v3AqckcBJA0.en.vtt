video<00:00:17.279> I'm<00:00:17.609> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> do<00:00:18.000> kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
video I'm going to do kind of a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.560 
video I'm going to do kind of a
unscientific<00:00:19.680> scientific<00:00:20.279> test<00:00:20.520> I'm<00:00:21.449> going

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
unscientific scientific test I'm going

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.279 
unscientific scientific test I'm going
to<00:00:21.689> see<00:00:21.990> how<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.670> old<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.060> new<00:00:24.240> cabin<00:00:24.930> filters

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
to see how the old and new cabin filters

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.640 
to see how the old and new cabin filters
affect<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:27.090> flow<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.359> air<00:00:27.630> into<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> vehicle

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
affect the flow of air into the vehicle

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.790 
affect the flow of air into the vehicle
I<00:00:28.680> have<00:00:29.550> no<00:00:29.730> tools<00:00:30.420> whatsoever<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:31.260> test<00:00:31.529> how

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I have no tools whatsoever to test how

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.319 
I have no tools whatsoever to test how
clean<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.309> air<00:00:32.460> coming<00:00:32.700> into<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> vehicle<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
clean the air coming into the vehicle is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.100 
clean the air coming into the vehicle is
but<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.960> kind<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.920> crudely<00:00:35.250> test<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.960> flow

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
but I can kind of crudely test the flow

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.319 
but I can kind of crudely test the flow
of<00:00:37.200> air<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.770> here<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.070> am<00:00:38.190> holding<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:39.030> old

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of air so here I am holding the old

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.400 
of air so here I am holding the old
dirty<00:00:39.780> filter<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> vehicle<00:00:41.180> and<00:00:42.410> now

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
dirty filter from the vehicle and now

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.490 
dirty filter from the vehicle and now
here<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> am<00:00:43.829> holding<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.520> new<00:00:44.640> filter<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.570> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
here I am holding the new filter so in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950 
here I am holding the new filter so in
the<00:00:46.620> next<00:00:46.770> couple<00:00:46.950> clips<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.960> first

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
the next couple clips will be first

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.010 
the next couple clips will be first
doing<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> flow<00:00:49.680> you'll<00:00:49.980> be<00:00:50.100> seeing<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> flow

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
doing the flow you'll be seeing the flow

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.979 
doing the flow you'll be seeing the flow
from<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.230> air<00:00:52.559> ducts<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.129> car<00:00:53.750> with<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
from the air ducts in the car with the

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
from the air ducts in the car with the
old<00:00:55.260> filter<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.710> place<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:57.000> the

old filter in place and then with the
new<00:00:57.300> filter<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> place<00:00:59.719> okay<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.780> here's<00:01:01.050> what

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
new filter in place okay so here's what

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.049 
new filter in place okay so here's what
I<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:01.800> incredibly<00:01:02.219> scientific<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
I have not incredibly scientific but it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.050 
I have not incredibly scientific but it
should<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.449> trick<00:01:03.719> I've<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.430> weather

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
should do the trick I've got a weather

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.690 
should do the trick I've got a weather
station<00:01:06.360> which<00:01:06.869> shows<00:01:07.320> me<00:01:07.560> wind<00:01:08.100> speed<00:01:08.460> right

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
station which shows me wind speed right

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.950 
station which shows me wind speed right
here<00:01:09.290> okay<00:01:10.290> here's<00:01:10.590> my<00:01:10.740> outdoor<00:01:11.750> part<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.840> that

okay so need to kind of do a

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.580 
okay so need to kind of do a
freeze-frame<00:03:15.420> here<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.810> didn't<00:03:16.109> realize<00:03:16.319> how

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
freeze-frame here I didn't realize how

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.530 
freeze-frame here I didn't realize how
much<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:17.189> wind<00:03:17.670> buffeting<00:03:18.000> against<00:03:18.329> the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
much the wind buffeting against the

microphone and the camera was affecting

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.209 
microphone and the camera was affecting
what<00:03:21.629> I<00:03:21.659> was<00:03:21.870> saying<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:22.769> as<00:03:22.920> you<00:03:23.040> can<00:03:23.159> see

is able to move the air at 15 miles an

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.729 
is able to move the air at 15 miles an
hour<00:03:30.060> rather<00:03:30.420> than<00:03:30.629> 11<00:03:30.989> miles<00:03:31.200> per<00:03:31.439> hour

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
hour rather than 11 miles per hour

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.039 
hour rather than 11 miles per hour
that's<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.310> 40%<00:03:32.970> increase<00:03:33.329> in<00:03:33.359> speed<00:03:33.810> or

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
that's a 40% increase in speed or

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.229 
that's a 40% increase in speed or
roughly<00:03:34.560> between<00:03:35.099> a<00:03:35.129> 33<00:03:35.609> and<00:03:35.700> 40<00:03:35.970> percent

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
roughly between a 33 and 40 percent

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.629 
roughly between a 33 and 40 percent
increase<00:03:36.409> I'm<00:03:37.409> not<00:03:37.739> sure<00:03:37.980> how<00:03:38.099> that<00:03:38.129> translate

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
increase I'm not sure how that translate

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.699 
increase I'm not sure how that translate
into<00:03:38.670> how<00:03:39.030> much<00:03:39.180> volume<00:03:39.629> but<00:03:40.049> obviously<00:03:40.530> it's

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
into how much volume but obviously it's

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.349 
into how much volume but obviously it's
gonna<00:03:40.799> be<00:03:40.980> more<00:03:41.129> volume<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.700> air<00:03:41.819> coming<00:03:42.120> in

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
gonna be more volume of air coming in

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.129 
gonna be more volume of air coming in
the<00:03:43.290> other<00:03:43.500> important<00:03:44.430> thing<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.879> think<00:03:45.209> about

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
the other important thing to think about

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:47.780 
the other important thing to think about
is<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.500> fact<00:03:46.530> that<00:03:46.829> you're<00:03:47.010> not<00:03:47.189> working<00:03:47.400> your

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
is the fact that you're not working your

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.030 
is the fact that you're not working your
blower<00:03:48.359> as<00:03:48.659> hard<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.889> can<00:03:51.260> move<00:03:52.260> as<00:03:52.530> much<00:03:52.799> air

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
blower as hard you can move as much air

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.809 
blower as hard you can move as much air
probably<00:03:53.310> on<00:03:53.549> setting<00:03:54.150> three<00:03:54.480> or<00:03:54.569> four<00:03:54.870> as

probably on setting three or four as

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.740 
probably on setting three or four as
setting<00:03:56.819> three<00:03:56.970> or<00:03:57.090> four<00:03:57.269> with<00:03:57.419> the<00:03:57.569> new

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
setting three or four with the new

with the old filter so you know

obviously<00:04:03.359> changing<00:04:04.319> your<00:04:04.409> filter<00:04:04.709> will<00:04:04.739> help

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
obviously changing your filter will help

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.140 
obviously changing your filter will help
