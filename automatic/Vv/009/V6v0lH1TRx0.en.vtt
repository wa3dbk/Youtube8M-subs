00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.870
 We stretch our paper to wrap in 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.789
 a flat surface and we measure 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.010
 approximately how much paper is what 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.490
 We are going to need better than about 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.490
 missing 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.040
 i 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.090
 For the back of the gift we are going to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.560
 secure the paper with a piece of tape 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.560
 adhesive so it does not move 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 the gift on the other side 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.590
 we cut out the excess paper 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.590
 and we make sure it with 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.890
 for the tips we are going to bend the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.399
 corners inwards forming some 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 triangles 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.160
 and again we insure with tape 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.810
 we do the same 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:15.050
 we fold the corners inside 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.560
 we form some triangles and we make sure 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.560
 with ribbons 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.270
 we set the bar for the part of 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.140
 Above the gift , we turn it over and 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.140
 your masters ready 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.170
 under the bar 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.170
 we flipped the box 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.930
 we tie it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.210
 we make a knot so that the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.210
 ribbon and at the end a bow 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 now let's wrap up another kind of 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.810
 figures in this case a bottle of 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.680
 shampoo stretch the paper and place the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.229
 bottle down we roll up and what's left 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.730
 down we bend it and the top to the other 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.430
 theme and here comes another figure 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.970
 we put the bottle in half and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970
 we roll up 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.680
 secure with tapes and the part that 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.420
 We're going to twist the one above and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.230
 the one below 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.230
 now with a clean pipes we are going to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.230
 ensure 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.140
 as if there was a sweet 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.680
 and it is longer one side than the other 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.349
 you can cut 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.290
 and that's how we have a gift left in 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:48.540
 form of candy for the latter is a 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.700
 gift with irregular shape is not 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.829
 totally closed the box we are going to 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 extend our statement and make sure 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:59.590
 have enough paper to cover it 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.590
 I put the box upside down 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:07.670
 and we secure the paper with tape 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.000
 we wrap around the other side we make a 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.000
 fold 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.270
 and we re-insure with fine 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.880
 for the bottom part as the first 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.620
 example we bend the tips towards 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.620
 inside forming some triangles 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.390
 and we assure with inks 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.140
 and we repeat the same thing on this side 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.160
 since our gift they have not returned 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.160
 now we are going to put a bow 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.769
 all right 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.890
 i 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.199
 and we finished 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.669
 some examples of how you can wrap 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.669
 gifts with different shapes
