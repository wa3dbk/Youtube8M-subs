00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.940 

I<00:01:10.510> also<00:01:11.510> see<00:01:11.840> that<00:01:11.870> it's<00:01:12.200> more<00:01:12.380> natural

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
I also see that it's more natural

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.060 
I also see that it's more natural
because<00:01:13.250> it's<00:01:13.610> like<00:01:13.850> their<00:01:14.120> family<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.860> have

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
because it's like their family you have

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.520 
because it's like their family you have
your<00:01:16.100> father<00:01:16.460> mother<00:01:16.790> brother<00:01:17.510> sister<00:01:17.630> all

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
your father mother brother sister all

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.170 
your father mother brother sister all
are<00:01:18.800> in<00:01:18.890> different<00:01:19.070> age<00:01:19.400> but<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.090> are

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
are in different age but you are

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.969 
are in different age but you are
learning<00:01:20.540> all<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:20.840> time<00:01:20.869> so<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.710> school<00:01:21.950> is

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
learning all the time so the school is

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.340 
learning all the time so the school is
not<00:01:22.310> different<00:01:22.729> actually<00:01:23.119> from<00:01:23.300> their<00:01:23.479> actual

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
not different actually from their actual

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.070 
not different actually from their actual
learning<00:01:25.010> it's<00:01:26.000> not<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.390> same<00:01:26.600> age<00:01:26.810> group

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
learning it's not the same age group

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080 
learning it's not the same age group
it's<00:01:27.259> there's<00:01:27.530> no<00:01:27.710> need<00:01:27.950> for<00:01:27.979> compare<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.880> and
