00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
see there's a really bad example but I

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.070 
see there's a really bad example but I
don't<00:02:38.640> move<00:02:38.820> it's<00:02:38.970> not<00:02:39.090> bad<00:02:39.300> example<00:02:39.750> actually

but anyway em you know like there's a

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.670 
but anyway em you know like there's a
certain<00:02:42.480> look<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.930> a<00:02:42.990> ghetto<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.350> suits<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
certain look of a ghetto that suits a

you<00:03:35.580> know<00:03:35.640> I<00:03:35.730> mean<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.320> definitely<00:03:37.590> think<00:03:37.770> that

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
you know I mean so definitely think that

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.290 
you know I mean so definitely think that
if<00:03:38.250> you're<00:03:38.370> going<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.550> get<00:03:38.640> tattoo<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.060> if<00:03:39.180> I

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
if you're going to get tattoo you if I

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.120 
if you're going to get tattoo you if I
was<00:03:39.540> gonna<00:03:39.630> have<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> tattoo<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:41.010> definitely

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
was gonna have a tattoo and I definitely

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.350 
was gonna have a tattoo and I definitely
think<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.490> should<00:03:41.580> probably<00:03:41.820> have<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> meaning

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
think you should probably have a meaning

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.430 
think you should probably have a meaning
behind<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.810> it's<00:03:42.990> definitely<00:03:43.290> something

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
behind it and it's definitely something

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.840 
behind it and it's definitely something
that<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.770> would<00:03:43.890> have<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.160> have<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.490> I<00:03:44.610> was<00:03:44.730> ever

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
that I would have to have if I was ever

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.130 
that I would have to have if I was ever
going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.120> get<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.240> tattoo<00:03:45.570> what<00:03:45.840> you<00:03:45.960> probably

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
going to get a tattoo what you probably

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.380 
going to get a tattoo what you probably
want<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.710> be<00:03:46.800> honest<00:03:47.160> and<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:48.360> my

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
want to be honest and because my

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.580 
want to be honest and because my
opinions<00:03:48.840> and<00:03:48.990> stuff<00:03:49.140> change<00:03:49.350> all<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.560> time

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
opinions and stuff change all the time

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.560 
opinions and stuff change all the time
and<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.730> things<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.060> like<00:03:51.240> James

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
and I think the things that like James

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.660 
and I think the things that like James
holidays<00:03:52.020> so<00:03:52.380> I<00:03:52.410> definitely<00:03:53.220> think<00:03:53.520> that

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
holidays so I definitely think that

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.520 
holidays so I definitely think that
tattoo<00:03:54.570> should<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.900> meanings<00:03:55.200> behind<00:03:55.290> them

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
tattoo should have meanings behind them

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.560 
tattoo should have meanings behind them
and<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.680> definitely<00:03:55.920> think<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.330> some<00:03:57.330> girls

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
and I definitely think that some girls

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.050 
and I definitely think that some girls
are<00:03:57.840> more<00:03:58.680> suited<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.070> tattoos<00:03:59.490> and<00:03:59.730> other

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
are more suited to tattoos and other

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.580 
are more suited to tattoos and other
