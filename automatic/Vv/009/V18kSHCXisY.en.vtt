the<00:00:34.590> beta<00:00:35.250> test<00:00:35.670> phase<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.370> that's<00:00:38.370> exciting

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 
the beta test phase so that's exciting

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.299 
the beta test phase so that's exciting

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
this village and I'm probably gonna ask

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.049 
this village and I'm probably gonna ask
the<00:00:45.840> help<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.829> building<00:00:47.520> team<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the help of my building team for that

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.020 
the help of my building team for that
just<00:00:48.420> show<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.809> gets<00:00:49.050> done<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.879> bit

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
just show it gets done a little bit

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.720 
just show it gets done a little bit
faster<00:00:51.809> then<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.469> need<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.770> make<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.129> entrance

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
faster then I need to make the entrance

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.619 
faster then I need to make the entrance
to<00:00:54.059> goblin<00:00:54.690> town<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.440> need<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:56.270> finish<00:00:57.270> up

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to goblin town and I need to finish up

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.000 
to goblin town and I need to finish up
the<00:00:58.379> library<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.730> well<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.629> figure<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> good

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the library as well as figure out a good

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.830 
the library as well as figure out a good
way<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.370> add<00:01:03.059> more<00:01:03.899> mobs<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.530> dungeons<00:01:05.159> and

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
way to add more mobs to dungeons and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.390 
way to add more mobs to dungeons and
probably<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.650> means<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:08.130> spawn<00:01:08.610> us<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
probably by the means of spawn us and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.910 
probably by the means of spawn us and
once<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.880> done<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:13.290> think<00:01:13.680> we're<00:01:13.890> just

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
once that is done and I think we're just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
once that is done and I think we're just
going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> start<00:01:14.750> doing<00:01:15.770> beta<00:01:16.770> tests<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
going to start doing beta tests on this

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.280 
going to start doing beta tests on this
map<00:01:18.450> on<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.470> titanium<00:01:20.100> server<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:22.020> is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
map on the titanium server so that is

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
map on the titanium server so that is
very<00:01:22.320> exciting<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:24.119> can't

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
very exciting because I'm really can't

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
very exciting because I'm really can't
wait<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.409> actually<00:01:25.560> start<00:01:26.009> playing

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
wait for you to actually start playing

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.730 
wait for you to actually start playing
this<00:01:26.520> map<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.330> i<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.780> feedback<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.560> you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this map so i can have feedback from you

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
this map so i can have feedback from you
guys<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.150> don't<00:01:30.329> like

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
guys what you like what you don't like

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
guys what you like what you don't like
what<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:30.900> would<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.560> see<00:01:31.860> added<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.520> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
what you would like to see added to this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.260 
what you would like to see added to this
to<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:33.509> map<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.860> that's<00:01:35.490> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.820> my<00:01:36.000> hopes

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to this map so that's kind of my hopes

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.010 
to this map so that's kind of my hopes
because<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.820> use<00:01:38.820> those<00:01:39.030> ideas<00:01:39.600> for

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
because then I can use those ideas for

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.420 
because then I can use those ideas for
the<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:41.299> regions<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.630> still<00:01:43.430> being

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
the next regions that are still being

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.420 
the next regions that are still being
built<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.689> would<00:01:46.110> be<00:01:46.259> great<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:47.070> your

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
built so that would be great to use your

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.109 
built so that would be great to use your
feedback<00:01:48.000> right<00:01:48.600> away<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:49.259> new<00:01:49.740> regions<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.970> we

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
feedback right away in new regions so we

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.819 
feedback right away in new regions so we
can<00:01:51.329> really<00:01:51.780> make<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.920> cool<00:01:54.140> yeah<00:01:55.140> game

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
can really make this a cool yeah game

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.480 
can really make this a cool yeah game

mode<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:15.100> real<00:03:15.370> server<00:03:15.960> so<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.470> we<00:03:17.740> have<00:03:17.860> a<00:03:17.890> name

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
mode a real server so and we have a name

mode a real server so and we have a name
for<00:03:18.400> that<00:03:18.430> that's<00:03:18.850> amethyst<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:21.310> to<00:03:21.520> to

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
for that that's amethyst and just to to

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.750 
for that that's amethyst and just to to
get<00:03:22.260> things<00:03:23.260> clear<00:03:23.800> of<00:03:24.070> what<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.550> actually

get things clear of what this actually

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.020 
get things clear of what this actually
is<00:03:25.030> i<00:03:25.180> think<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:26.200> would<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.590> better<00:03:27.250> to<00:03:27.459> have

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
is i think it would be better to have

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.960 
is i think it would be better to have
the<00:03:28.390> amethyst<00:03:28.870> name<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:30.040> video<00:03:30.370> series<00:03:30.820> as

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
the amethyst name in the video series as

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.660 
the amethyst name in the video series as
well<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.450> that<00:03:31.630> as<00:03:31.780> well<00:03:32.070> as<00:03:33.070> soon<00:03:33.280> as<00:03:33.400> I<00:03:33.490> reach

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
well so that as well as soon as I reach

25 videos in this series I will start
the<00:03:37.209> series<00:03:37.450> with<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:37.959> name<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.610> will
