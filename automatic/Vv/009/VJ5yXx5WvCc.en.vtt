00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 kriga tv today we have the following 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.300
 heading debriefing and this time we 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.860
 we will consider leopard 1 and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.710
 far-reaching cars we start with vk 3002 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.720
 db since armor and other machines here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 these were considered before 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.140
 say something about sand cars 2 3 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.359
 4 levels of carapace 35-38 338 for nothing 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.609
 especially I can not they pass quite 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.480
 fast and dwell on them is not worth it 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.520
 pantser 4 as I mentioned in that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.090
 review in the debriefing and to E100 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.329
 The mouseup machine is not bad, in principle, but 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 we go further so to code 3002 db in 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.460
 hangar i don't have it i don't show it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.579
 I can but seem better all the mods and so 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.920
 typewriter we have 6 levels of their principle she 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.710
 for what level is quite a fit armor 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 we have a frontal tower with a top tower 100 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.449
 millimeters and so 80 stock and in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 body armor principle 80 millimeters 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.750
 allows us to play more or less somehow 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.880
 safe and beat some shells 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.619
 we don't have to go ahead 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.590
 Still, the average tank speed he has 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.640
 not bad but you need to know that we are a weapon 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.229
 I'm very punching 132 penetration damage 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.650
 367 and pretty decent fast-fire 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.000
 seven shots per minute with time 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.770
 day if you have a normal crew 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.170
 also problems will not be all pretty 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.630
 not bad and accuracy too 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.060
 I think that the gun is not bad if that 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.070
 breakthrough is not enough but it is necessary with this 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.230
 put up getting into the sixes of problems you 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.810
 will not experience but in the battles above 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.870
 level well maybe some yes will be 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.030
 uncomfortable situation so go further 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.910
 tank panther we have next in line 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.210
 and this car is pretty ambiguous 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.220
 we don't have armor here especially 85 armor 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.010
 Deals damage to the body is not broken 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.660
 very very easy armor turret 50 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.790
 millimeters are generally funny numbers 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.770
 even talk about them is not necessary plus 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.229
 huge commander turret in general 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.729
 there are several 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.860
 engines that have to be put 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.810
 necessarily in general the difference is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.940
 the power of them is and first the machine is not 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.310
 very mobile too and her gun 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.350
 at first is not the most funny either 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.140
 level six low penetration I already 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.480
 lacks very much and will have to either 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.220
 gritting his teeth to pass open viewers 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.100
 immediately on the panther file either open 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:29.360
 7 and a half millimeter fishing rod 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.040
 71 centimeters and meters and generally how to be 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.660
 lay down hands all and a half 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.540
 centimeters to VK 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.269
 l100 breakthrough we have already under 200 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.489
 units damage 225 and excellent 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.959
 fire rate accuracy is very 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.850
 worthy weapon the only thing 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.890
 small one-time damage 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.230
 but she is very quick-firing very accurately 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.329
 and generally very much 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.299
 so go ahead panther 2 i let's 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.920
 longoria I twist it I left the topic all 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.709
 I've mostly in the hangar they 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.810
 skated here is model 2 so pretty 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.700
 I like her very much 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.639
 very mobile and worth the gun with 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.989
 royal tiger how to apply and 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.609
 rate of fire almost 13 half 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.019
 shots per minute is four with 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.590
 a small half second recharge 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:15.859
 guidance time is 166 too bad and 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.069
 less than 03 shooting accuracy 029 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:20.810
 very accurate cannon there is armor turret 120 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.930
 millimeters and a focus bath 100 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.329
 in general, the car is very good 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.639
 maneuverable has great 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.629
 tool well and in principle some 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:35.389
 lamb and so we go on farther y 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.689
 us here goes 9 10 me too 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:42.889
 it turns out Wang hang up yes he stands by 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:44.659
 I will now take away the E50 and here 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.599
 inviting someone me hard 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:48.260
 invites but visible armor hull and 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.659
 tower armor 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.549
 tower brand 240 millimeters and not much 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.090
 big commander tower and you can 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:55.699
 to tank 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.400
 very well then goes our armor 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:00.349
 corps 120 also can tank it as 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.400
 heavy tank armor very very 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.799
 with dignity 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.530
 let's put on robust and that we 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.540
 see reloading six shots in 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.489
 about a minute we have about 10 seconds 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.949
 recharge but maybe a little bit 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.229
 It will be less if you put a rammer 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:17.090
 let's do it seven shots with 

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:19.010
 a little good for a minute 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.920
 also temporarily because 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.370
 barely if u put strongly and 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.620
 mixing then 19 is very fast and 03 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.320
 Accuracy if you take into account that one-time 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.970
 damage from this tool we have very 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.220
 not bad from 650 units and 220 penetration 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.620
 very worthy weapon for the ninth 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.090
 level I like her very much 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.590
 the car is quite mobile thanks 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.750
 a 1200 horsepower engine that's 70 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.000
 tons of wrinkle fast machine 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.950
 armored machine Blythe good 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.140
 tool and passed without any problems 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.310
 The basics only with the drain will have a little bit 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:01.220
 tinker and so go ahead with us further 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.990
 goes leopard 1 I'm here to go to him also 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.820
 could not 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:09.080
 leopard 1 cars of course to war 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.780
 p55 competition is good but leopard too 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.930
 the leopard is distinguished by its magnificent 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.940
 gun rate of almost 12 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.210
 shots per minute reload 5 point 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:22.040
 one tenth of a second information 025 total 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:26.180
 just some pathetic 025 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.110
 firing accuracy 027 gun just higher 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.920
 all praise 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.890
 one-time damage 650 units we have now 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.150
 it is 150 units each and two hundred breaks. 

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.310
 seventy five millimeters 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.210
 the most magnificent weapon suits 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.430
 everything 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.380
 then we have a tower which 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.919
 armored front worse than the sides and 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.250
 poop 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:49.440
 but it is generally made of the fact that 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.330
 there is a pretty big gun mask well 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.460
 you should not count on her car 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.319
 by the way is very very mobile though 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.380
 Maxim Allochka with us in my not the most 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:06:01.050
 high 65 basically ok i thought 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:03.569
 lower honestly the car is pretty fast 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.979
 and mobile we are pretty good 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.720
 engine 830 horses for 55 tons if not 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.550
 put some modules that 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.000
 weigh two and a half tons to 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.639
 the machine will still be so you can set 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.810
 module let's say rammer and 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.479
 stabilizer or anything against it 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.240
 reinforced drives and the machine will have 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:27.000
 50 tons and engines of 830 horses will be 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.630
 let us fly around the map with good 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.210
 the instrument 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:32.550
 but we have no enemies of the corps 70 armor 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:35.039
 not serious in the tenth level and armor 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.210
 towers 50 here there is a mask sometimes 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.880
 does not break the leg 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:40.949
 it happens very very rarely so 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.050
 fear all sorts of high-explosive monsters by type 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.560
 storming the tigers they just vshotyat you 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:49.020
 1 well then we disassembled all the cars of this 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.659
 branch, I think it is pretty good if 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.120
 consider what is in the end is a leopard 

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:55.620
 150 tr. 2 only difficulties 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.960
 probably the sixth and 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:59.039
 seventh level, well, then everything goes 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.590
 like clockwork 

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:04.349
 so swing to health well what is it 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.969
 It was debriefing German branches with 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.969
 You have been a circle tv all bye
