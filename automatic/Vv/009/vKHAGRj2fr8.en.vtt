00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.500
 fc 200 fc 200 this is the camera 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.329
 between the phantom is between and there 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.859

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.329
 download and if the download then 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:24.590
 finished then you have here somewhere 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:28.160
 such a file fc 200 underlined 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.810
 firmware that be a zip file archive 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.320
 file you have to first of all 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.720
 to open 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.739
 that goes under windows for example or 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.359
 even if you have an additional program 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.240
 installed as her I have a for example 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.490
 very good 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.400
 tip program like that and then you have there 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.860
 two files in it once the actual 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.190
 firmware form bin and a version of 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.950
 xt marks her and unpacks her 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.480
 first of all and if you do that then 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.240
 I have the theme easy 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.520
 Unzipped to the desktop then he goes 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.750
 Next, the right marked 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.840
 mouse button and then click here 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:11.410
 the removable disk go in here 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.680
 In my case this is the sd card that I have 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.960
 here on the sd card reader to the pc 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.010
 we have sent the 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.130
 just go there 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.320
 then they are copied to it and if 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.560
 that is finished then it goes to the 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.190
 camera next as I went then 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:35.100
 and turn on the remote control and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.100
 then also turn your head there 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.230
 before we have to turn our heads 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.470
 Of course, make sure that here 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.780
 the camera is still switched on 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.910
 I have done here before and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.160
 if that is up and then the head can 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.800
 then we can now use the sd card 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.610
 the firmware on it again in the head 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 insert 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.230
 and once it's done switch 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.540
 we open the camera 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.580
 Now the camera goes up and then 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.590
 you see here at the led that is now 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.000
 for such a fast blind, that comes 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.500
 means that the firmware update 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.460
 is carried out 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.040
 that takes a bit and eventually 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.280
 the camera lights up green again 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.350
 and then the firmware update 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.210
 completely executed 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.860
 Last but not least, you take the micro 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.990
 sd card again from the camera of the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.660
 vision out and put them in the sd 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.390
 a card reader of the pc 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.120
 and here you open the folder 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.870
 Now you see the file firmware here 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.350
 points 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.580
 which was renamed in firmware point 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.920
 back 0 0 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.930
 and if that happened there 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.450
 you recognize that the firmware 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.370
 update also went through clean 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.400
 otherwise there would still be firmware here 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.350
 stand points and that means there that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.750
 could have worked here now 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.990
 the SD card, of course, this firmware 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.820
 delete file again 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:06.460
 Last but not least, you then put the sd 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.800
 card back in the head therefore one and 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.230
 could then be phantom between velvet 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.150
 updated camera again completely normal 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:14.710
 use 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.110
 the update itself does not have that many 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.240
 Innovations brought only two new ones 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.770
 Modes few modes have been added 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.980
 with 24 or 25 images per 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.200
 second 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.730
 yes that was it again from me if 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.200
 you liked my movie then pleased 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.140
 Of course I have nice comments 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.520
 Here below a positive review 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:35.020
 recommend me further and if you do it 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.450
 should not have done then 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.880
 subscribe me you should more 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.650
 have any questions about this copter or too
