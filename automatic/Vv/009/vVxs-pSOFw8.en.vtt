00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
 at 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.440
 and diaw everybody welcome on 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.860
 this new video I hope you 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.480
 be well 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.890
 today I present you a 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.210
 new cif route so that's it 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.410
 are a lot of people who are fond of it 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.100
 there are many people who asked us 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.900
 your cellar 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.730
 you have to know that it's really less 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 effective than before but still is it 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.239
 that we can always allow d in g 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.770
 and do a little bit of human so 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.360
 for this cellar water which one 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.160
 know this sector it's simply 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.750
 the cosmodrome is trying all of caval is 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.850
 here so I advise you all 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.440
 just to be at least two to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.600
 many names and two problems for 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.610
 the first part so here we are 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
 stayed about half an hour here he 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.920
 be aware that there are always four 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.239
 modes that spawn at his place there are 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.280
 a ship that is going to go over 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.540
 so we stayed pretty much there last 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.729
 here I will show you right now 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.930
 the result we will move forward a little more 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.150
 quickly obviously I have not let you 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.680
 half an hour so that's after a 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 half an hour frankly not bad in g 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.560
 to a lot of ink in blue so I 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.750
 think I had three or four 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.400
 it seems to me that I had one at 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.409
 on it we see there I'm going to pick you up 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.090
 go see a little bit of everything so 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.260
 obviously also frankly it 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.760
 was not shit no it's not 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.979
 bent on picking up ammo etc. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.110
 you empty all your ammo and as 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.230
 usually ammunition waiting for your 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.100
 in your charger so that's why 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.570
 it's for the method for 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.980
 plaintiffs and 8 before but now that's it 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.840
 we used it we were 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.360
 2 so roughly in turn it takes 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.650
 know that you can also recover d 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.540
 1 gram on the few funds your 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.890
 allies so here that's it so I had to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.860
 I think about three or four years 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.730
 g blue I was obsessed with a 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.530
 half an hour because there is another 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.630
 colleague who joined us so here is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.620
 it's g home after half an hour 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.940
 game anyway we spent a little 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.230
 a little less time in the 25 minute and I 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.410
 had a lot more in g you can the 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.330
 see 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.370
 so frankly that's all going to go 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.450
 quite effective I think there is also 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.160
 another guy who we region 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.060
 this is him so there is an unknown excuse 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.320
 I remembered more of your nickname 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.690
 I'm ready if he did not recognize them or 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.560
 not the tramp pgm in any case a 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.570
 little big up to you 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.770
 a little tip also for twenty 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.360
 eight cases you'll see so like 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.679
 usually there are public events 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.780
 which appear a little anywhere 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.879
 So here the public event happened 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.989
 to the spawn while we are there and we know 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.190
 that events more than that attracts 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.510
 still a lot of people so here I am 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.610
 I did not even bother I swung 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.769
 poor pomegranate the little marker that goes 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.370
 to make sure that I have that I participate 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.989
 at the event 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.489
 and here I am going to leave the others 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.109
 have the three steps of 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.510
 the event and I managed to have it in 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.859
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.889
 in passing just wanted to tell you that 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.030
 this video and in 1080p 60 fps so 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:35.049
 I hope that the rendering is going to be pretty 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.849
 pretty you will tell me in the 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.379
 comments what do you think you 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.700
