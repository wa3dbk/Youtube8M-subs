00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.980 
show you my brand new kitchen design so
far<00:00:05.730> I've<00:00:05.940> been<00:00:05.970> doing<00:00:06.270> designs<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
far I've been doing designs with the

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.009 
far I've been doing designs with the
salt<00:00:07.680> tax<00:00:07.859> member<00:00:08.340> texture<00:00:09.269> path<00:00:09.450> but<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
salt tax member texture path but I

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.780 
salt tax member texture path but I
figure<00:00:10.290> most<00:00:10.530> people<00:00:10.889> play<00:00:11.190> without<00:00:11.519> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
figure most people play without the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.450 
figure most people play without the
texture<00:00:12.150> path<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.570> I<00:00:12.630> should<00:00:12.809> probably<00:00:12.900> do

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
texture path so I should probably do

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.950 
texture path so I should probably do
design<00:00:14.460> videos<00:00:14.849> without<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.480> texture<00:00:15.780> pack

little blocks you know black wall blocks

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.699 
little blocks you know black wall blocks
are<00:02:10.890> basically<00:02:11.459> flat-screen<00:02:12.330> TV

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709

enter<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.590> c-shape<00:02:31.280> island<00:02:31.819> we<00:02:32.090> have<00:02:32.359> another

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:32.719 
enter the c-shape island we have another

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.569 
enter the c-shape island we have another
sink<00:02:33.170> right<00:02:33.379> here<00:02:33.439> and<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.219> course<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.459> were

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:34.579 
sink right here and of course you were

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.509 
sink right here and of course you were
using<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.120> lever<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:36.409> simulate<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:37.069> faucet

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
using the lever to simulate the faucet

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.280 
using the lever to simulate the faucet
you<00:02:37.700> can<00:02:37.879> replace<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.299> with<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.780> pressure

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
you can replace it with the pressure

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.929 
you can replace it with the pressure
plate<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.590> you<00:02:39.709> want<00:02:39.920> but<00:02:40.159> I<00:02:40.189> like<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.790> design

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
plate if you want but I like this design

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
are just booth would on top of the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.440 
are just booth would on top of the
pressure<00:02:48.169> plate<00:02:48.790> couple<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.849> furnaces<00:02:50.239> and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
pressure plate couple of furnaces and

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.199 
pressure plate couple of furnaces and
two<00:02:51.760> stone<00:02:52.760> pressure<00:02:53.060> plates<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.659> I<00:02:54.439> built<00:02:54.889> a

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
two stone pressure plates and I built a

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.080 
two stone pressure plates and I built a
section<00:02:56.209> of<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.780> ceiling<00:02:57.200> right<00:02:57.439> here<00:02:58.090> just

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
section of the ceiling right here just

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.640 
section of the ceiling right here just
so<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.329> can<00:02:59.480> show<00:02:59.629> you<00:02:59.689> how<00:02:59.959> I<00:02:59.989> build<00:03:00.409> the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
so that I can show you how I build the

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.789 
so that I can show you how I build the
the<00:03:01.069> bent<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.669> duct<00:03:02.030> mechanism<00:03:02.900> so<00:03:03.439> that's

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
the bent the duct mechanism so that's

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.580 
the bent the duct mechanism so that's
the<00:03:03.919> iron<00:03:04.340> block<00:03:04.669> this<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.590> cobblestone

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the iron block this is the cobblestone

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.000 
the iron block this is the cobblestone
wall<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.099> this<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.060> cobblestone<00:03:08.659> stair<00:03:09.049> stone

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
wall and this is cobblestone stair stone

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.699 
wall and this is cobblestone stair stone
stairs<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.400> think<00:03:10.579> they<00:03:10.639> call<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.819> yeah<00:03:10.969> so<00:03:11.709> go

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
stairs I think they call it yeah so go

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.860 
stairs I think they call it yeah so go
like<00:03:12.889> this<00:03:13.040> it<00:03:13.370> kind<00:03:13.760> of<00:03:13.819> you<00:03:14.030> know<00:03:14.060> looks<00:03:14.480> very

I've done that's why you get the smokes

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.219 
I've done that's why you get the smokes
out<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:21.590> smell<00:03:22.010> out<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.400> kitchen<00:03:23.229> all

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:24.229
