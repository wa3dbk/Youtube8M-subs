how<00:01:08.260> shiny<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.800> is<00:01:08.890> I<00:01:09.330> painted<00:01:10.330> it<00:01:10.450> with<00:01:11.380> glossy

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860

how shiny it is I painted it with glossy
accents<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.580> I<00:01:12.700> thought<00:01:12.880> okay<00:01:13.390> I'm<00:01:13.570> going<00:01:13.690> to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
accents and I thought okay I'm going to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.710 
accents and I thought okay I'm going to
try<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.110> because<00:01:14.230> it'll<00:01:15.130> kind<00:01:15.700> of<00:01:15.880> give<00:01:16.570> it<00:01:16.600> a

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
try that because it'll kind of give it a

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.690 
try that because it'll kind of give it a
little<00:01:16.750> bit<00:01:17.110> of<00:01:17.200> a<00:01:17.260> shine<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:17.860> only<00:01:18.130> put<00:01:18.460> it<00:01:18.550> on

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
little bit of a shine I only put it on

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.820 
little bit of a shine I only put it on
the<00:01:18.880> rose<00:01:19.090> part<00:01:19.540> though<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.590> now<00:01:20.740> I'm

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
the rose part though and now I'm

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:21.960 
the rose part though and now I'm
thinking<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.220> wonder<00:01:21.340> if<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.580> should<00:01:21.640> go<00:01:21.850> back

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
thinking I wonder if I should go back

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.120 
thinking I wonder if I should go back
and<00:01:22.030> put<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.450> on<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.690> white<00:01:22.900> part<00:01:23.260> 2<00:01:23.590> because

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
and put it on the white part 2 because

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.560 
and put it on the white part 2 because
then<00:01:24.160> it'll<00:01:24.490> have<00:01:24.670> a<00:01:24.700> little<00:01:24.790> protection<00:01:25.360> from

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
then it'll have a little protection from

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.990 
then it'll have a little protection from
staining<00:01:26.440> or<00:01:26.950> anything<00:01:27.310> like<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:27.940> I

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
staining or anything like that but I

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.570 
staining or anything like that but I
really<00:01:28.240> like<00:01:28.360> how<00:01:28.510> it<00:01:28.540> turned<00:01:28.660> out<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.550> then<00:01:30.550> I

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
really like how it turned out and then I

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.540 
really like how it turned out and then I
also<00:01:31.230> put<00:01:32.230> the<00:01:32.409> glossy<00:01:32.980> accents<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
also put the glossy accents on the

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.490 
also put the glossy accents on the
little<00:01:33.820> pink<00:01:34.000> frame<00:01:34.300> that<00:01:34.480> I'd<00:01:34.600> had<00:01:34.810> and<00:01:35.110> i

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
little pink frame that I'd had and i

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.110 
little pink frame that I'd had and i
will<00:01:35.680> say<00:01:35.890> that<00:01:35.920> when<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.490> add<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.730> glossy

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
will say that when you add the glossy

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.210 
will say that when you add the glossy
accents<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.780> makes<00:01:38.050> these<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.530> lot<00:01:38.800> firmer

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
accents it makes these a lot firmer

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.220 
accents it makes these a lot firmer
they're<00:01:39.640> not<00:01:39.820> as<00:01:40.060> flimsy<00:01:40.570> as<00:01:40.810> they<00:01:41.170> were

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
they're not as flimsy as they were

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.830 
they're not as flimsy as they were
before<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:43.150> I<00:01:43.180> did<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.600> same<00:01:43.630> thing

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
before and then I did the same thing

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.570 
before and then I did the same thing
with<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.290> brown<00:01:44.650> frame<00:01:44.980> and<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.310> don't<00:01:45.460> really

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
with the brown frame and I don't really

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.540 
with the brown frame and I don't really
like<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.030> look<00:01:46.810> on<00:01:46.990> this<00:01:47.290> one<00:01:47.470> too<00:01:47.680> much<00:01:47.890> but<00:01:48.370> I

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
like the look on this one too much but I

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.980 
like the look on this one too much but I
painted<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.300> gun<00:01:49.450> metal<00:01:49.750> gray<00:01:49.960> and

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
painted it with the gun metal gray and

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.130 
painted it with the gun metal gray and
then<00:01:50.770> wiped<00:01:51.159> it<00:01:51.340> off<00:01:51.520> where<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.180> you<00:01:53.020> know

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
then wiped it off where the you know

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
then wiped it off where the you know
kind<00:01:53.409> of<00:01:53.440> worthy<00:01:53.740> ornate<00:01:54.100> parts<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.610> it<00:01:54.760> were

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
kind of worthy ornate parts of it were

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.540 
kind of worthy ornate parts of it were
and<00:01:55.510> I<00:01:55.630> liked<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.080> enough<00:01:56.350> but<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:57.040> think<00:01:57.370> that<00:01:57.520> I

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
and I liked it enough but I think that I

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.130 
and I liked it enough but I think that I
liked<00:01:57.820> it<00:01:57.970> better<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.690> way<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.110> looks

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
liked it better the way that it looks

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.890 
liked it better the way that it looks
with<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.620> pink<00:01:59.920> so<00:02:00.790> but<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.120> probably<00:02:01.420> still

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
with the pink so but I probably still

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.899 
with the pink so but I probably still
going<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.080> use<00:02:02.229> this<00:02:02.470> I<00:02:02.740> might<00:02:03.340> point<00:02:03.549> paint<00:02:03.820> it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
going to use this I might point paint it

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.680 
going to use this I might point paint it
black<00:02:04.060> go<00:02:04.299> hun<00:02:04.659> and<00:02:05.110> then<00:02:05.799> I<00:02:06.340> also<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:07.150> some

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 
butterflies are so cute and then I do

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:27.300 
butterflies are so cute and then I do
have<00:03:25.930> this<00:03:26.079> one<00:03:26.319> little<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.650> had<00:03:26.799> a<00:03:26.829> little<00:03:27.069> bit

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
have this one little I had a little bit

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.920 
have this one little I had a little bit
of<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.549> green<00:03:27.790> left<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.389> was<00:03:28.509> too<00:03:28.720> dark

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
of the green left and it was too dark

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.360 
of the green left and it was too dark
for<00:03:29.049> pretty<00:03:29.470> much<00:03:29.530> anything<00:03:29.889> other<00:03:30.159> than<00:03:30.310> a

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
for pretty much anything other than a

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.960 
for pretty much anything other than a
leaf<00:03:30.609> so<00:03:30.939> I<00:03:30.970> did<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.479> little<00:03:31.989> leaf<00:03:32.759> the<00:03:33.759> only

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
leaf so I did a little leaf the only

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.140 
leaf so I did a little leaf the only
thing<00:03:34.150> I<00:03:34.239> can<00:03:34.299> say<00:03:34.959> about<00:03:35.199> these<00:03:35.620> is<00:03:35.979> that<00:03:36.150> when

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
thing I can say about these is that when

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.839 
thing I can say about these is that when
they<00:03:37.359> dry<00:03:37.750> they<00:03:38.409> really<00:03:38.769> shrink<00:03:39.189> quite<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.609> bit

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
they dry they really shrink quite a bit

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.710 
they dry they really shrink quite a bit
and<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:41.709> know<00:03:41.829> they<00:03:41.979> might<00:03:42.220> be<00:03:42.430> flat<00:03:42.909> when

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and you know they might be flat when

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.890 
and you know they might be flat when
they're<00:03:43.959> drying<00:03:44.409> but<00:03:45.129> once<00:03:45.370> they're<00:03:45.639> dry

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.749 
they're drying but once they're dry
they're<00:03:46.900> not<00:03:47.079> flat<00:03:47.319> anymore<00:03:47.709> they<00:03:48.400> kind<00:03:48.669> of

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:48.759
