show you a automatic I won't be showing
how<00:00:28.130> to<00:00:28.339> build<00:00:28.759> this<00:00:28.970> because<00:00:29.509> it<00:00:30.439> was<00:00:30.980> rather

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
how to build this because it was rather

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.860 
how to build this because it was rather
difficult<00:00:31.909> for<00:00:32.450> me<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:33.940> recreate<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.210> in<00:00:35.360> this

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
difficult for me to recreate it in this

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:53.590 
difficult for me to recreate it in this
regular<00:00:38.870> world<00:00:39.640> um<00:00:42.610> shut<00:00:43.610> that<00:00:43.760> off<00:00:52.600> but

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
regular world um shut that off but

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.230 
regular world um shut that off but
anyways<00:00:53.990> when<00:00:54.980> you<00:00:55.100> stand<00:00:55.430> right<00:00:55.520> there<00:00:55.670> on

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:56.240 
anyways when you stand right there on

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
anyways when you stand right there on
little<00:00:56.890> spot<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:57.920> snow<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:59.420> gas<00:00:59.600> are<00:00:59.870> able<00:01:00.140> to

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
little spot of snow the gas are able to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.590 
little spot of snow the gas are able to
see<00:01:00.470> you<00:01:00.620> but<00:01:00.800> because<00:01:01.130> they<00:01:01.760> aim<00:01:01.970> right<00:01:02.540> above

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
see you but because they aim right above

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.090 
see you but because they aim right above
your<00:01:03.080> head<00:01:03.260> like<00:01:03.980> right<00:01:04.460> above<00:01:04.909> your<00:01:05.239> head<00:01:06.100> you

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
your head like right above your head you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.170 
your head like right above your head you
can<00:01:07.250> stand<00:01:07.520> there<00:01:07.759> and<00:01:07.820> they'll<00:01:08.060> never

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
can stand there and they'll never

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.419 
can stand there and they'll never
actually<00:01:08.479> hit<00:01:08.869> you<00:01:09.109> they'll<00:01:09.950> continually

00:01:10.419 --> 00:01:10.429 
actually hit you they'll continually

actually hit you they'll continually
shoot<00:01:10.820> at<00:01:10.999> right<00:01:11.210> here<00:01:11.600> and<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:13.159> system<00:01:13.700> I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
shoot at right here and the system I

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.919 
shoot at right here and the system I
once<00:01:15.530> a<00:01:15.829> tree<00:01:16.299> automatically<00:01:17.299> grows<00:01:17.600> it

once a tree automatically grows it

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:21.340 
once a tree automatically grows it
pushes<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.070> tree<00:01:19.340> right<00:01:20.179> into<00:01:20.539> where<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.079> gas

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
pushes the tree right into where the gas

anywhere else then the gas is likely to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:50.379 
anywhere else then the gas is likely to
take<00:01:47.299> suffocation<00:01:48.079> damage<00:01:48.409> because<00:01:49.369> some<00:01:50.359> of

take suffocation damage because some of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.449 
take suffocation damage because some of

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
cube crowd server help me build that but

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.100 
cube crowd server help me build that but
other<00:02:15.080> than<00:02:15.319> that<00:02:15.379> the<00:02:16.220> idea<00:02:17.120> for<00:02:17.209> this<00:02:17.629> build

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
other than that the idea for this build

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.880 
other than that the idea for this build
was

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.830 
was
mine<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:20.200> i<00:02:21.200> believe<00:02:21.740> impulse<00:02:22.580> made<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.270> video<00:02:23.510> of

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
mine I i believe impulse made a video of

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.460 
mine I i believe impulse made a video of
a<00:02:24.680> gas<00:02:25.490> cannon<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.380> i<00:02:27.910> decided<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.360> make<00:02:30.140> this

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
a gas cannon and i decided to make this

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.110 
a gas cannon and i decided to make this
from<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:33.190> now<00:02:34.190> I'd<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.340> to<00:02:34.640> point<00:02:34.940> out

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
from that and now I'd like to point out

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.120 
from that and now I'd like to point out
a<00:02:35.180> couple<00:02:35.330> things<00:02:35.780> about<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.470> farm<00:02:36.770> first

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
a couple things about this farm first

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.120 
a couple things about this farm first
off<00:02:37.400> is<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.780> right<00:02:39.020> here<00:02:39.050> these<00:02:39.590> are<00:02:39.650> seven

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
off is this right here these are seven

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.090 
off is this right here these are seven
layers<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.430> snow<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.410> they<00:02:42.410> put<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.860> high

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
layers of snow and they put you high

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.780 
layers of snow and they put you high
enough<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.880> where<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.300> reach<00:02:45.050> the<00:02:45.790> block

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
enough to where you can reach the block

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.920 
enough to where you can reach the block
of<00:02:47.000> dirt<00:02:47.239> because<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.200> redstone<00:02:48.680> here<00:02:48.890> and

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
of dirt because of the redstone here and

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.140 
of dirt because of the redstone here and
it<00:02:50.930> still<00:02:51.380> keeps<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.709> low<00:02:51.980> enough<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.940> where

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
it still keeps you low enough to where

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.840 
it still keeps you low enough to where
the<00:02:53.360> gas<00:02:53.750> are<00:02:54.200> unable<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:54.980> shoot<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.700> end

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
the gas are unable to shoot you and end

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.000 
the gas are unable to shoot you and end
up<00:02:55.970> hitting<00:02:56.180> right<00:02:56.510> over<00:02:56.750> here<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.260> these<00:02:57.950> are

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
up hitting right over here and these are

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.509 
up hitting right over here and these are
half<00:02:58.400> slabs<00:02:58.790> because<00:02:59.780> if<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:01.010> was<00:03:01.190> no<00:03:01.340> half

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
half slabs because if this was no half

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.490 
half slabs because if this was no half
slab<00:03:01.850> then<00:03:02.239> fire<00:03:02.570> would<00:03:02.900> still<00:03:03.140> be<00:03:03.260> able<00:03:03.350> to

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
slab then fire would still be able to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.140 
slab then fire would still be able to
get<00:03:03.620> here<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.010> that<00:03:04.580> would<00:03:04.790> melt<00:03:04.940> the<00:03:05.090> snow

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
get here and that would melt the snow

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320

not want to fully AFK you'd still want

the gas that would be right here and he

would no longer shoot these two Pistons
here<00:05:26.080> the<00:05:27.080> gas<00:05:27.260> are<00:05:27.560> unable<00:05:27.889> to<00:05:28.190> shoot

anything on this top row and these just

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.700 
anything on this top row and these just
push<00:05:31.639> it<00:05:31.669> down<00:05:31.940> so<00:05:32.750> then<00:05:32.960> they're<00:05:33.229> able<00:05:33.349> to

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
push it down so then they're able to

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.950 
push it down so then they're able to
shoot<00:05:34.280> all<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:34.849> wood<00:05:35.030> blocks<00:05:37.360> now<00:05:38.360> I'm<00:05:38.690> not

shoot all the wood blocks now I'm not
