00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.790 
all right so um that didn't work out too
well<00:04:40.570> maybe<00:04:40.870> I'll<00:04:41.020> do<00:04:41.170> that<00:04:41.200> again<00:04:41.590> in<00:04:41.710> the

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
well maybe I'll do that again in the

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.100 
well maybe I'll do that again in the
future<00:04:41.920> try<00:04:42.280> to<00:04:42.340> get<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.760> yeah<00:04:43.060> 3<00:04:43.660> star<00:04:43.930> I

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
future try to get a yeah 3 star I

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.570 
future try to get a yeah 3 star I
probably<00:04:44.440> should<00:04:44.770> have<00:04:44.830> hit<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.100> fourth<00:04:45.340> base

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580
