00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.899
 twitter el youm vacance I would be hours and hours 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.240
 to let myself be kissed by the sun 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 faced impeccably but tends to 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.019
 vanish in a few days if you don't 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.059
 intervenes correctly with some 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.400
 small trick is today I 'm here for 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.380
 body of a method the impeccable and healthy 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 natural to maintain as much as 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.619
 tan as long as possible 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.890
 let's see how to prepare a centrifuged 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.779
 rich in beta-carotene to prepare the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.050
 centrifuged to fix the tan 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.070
 we need about three carriages 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.870
 250 grams 100 g of peach pulp 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.710
 yellow 150 g of apricot pulp 100

 g of peeled melon 100 g of pulp of 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.239
 mango an organic lemon a clarification 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 before starting is not a case if I have 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.920
 chosen just this fruit and vegetables a 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.109
 orange pulp for the realization of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.090
 center tended to tanning 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.399
 in fact a pigment is hidden here 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.519
 vegetable beta carotene which is a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.200
 precursor of my life that has its own 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.020
 a color that varies from yellow 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 orange has antioxidant properties 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.760
 and then stimulus to the formation of 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.530
 melanin and also gives us a complexion 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.380
 darker contributing in the same 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 time the skin from radiation b 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.590
 in addition, beta carotene appears to go to 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.939
 stimulate the immune system ea 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 protect the cardiovascular one 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.490
 having said that we see how it is prepared 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.259
 indispensable tool for preparing 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.930
 the centrifuged is clearly the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.549
 centrifuge ok now we put all the 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.549
 ingredients inside 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.340
 a nice mix tina and ours 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.350
 centrifuged to fix the tan 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.229
 it is ready to be tasted like 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.229
 summer snack we can pour it into a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.840
 nice glass maybe adding some 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.940
 ice cube and if you want a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.769
 alternative centrifuged always for 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.799
 you can also set the tan 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:19.260
 pumpkin cac is also a roncola remember 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.209
 then to always drink a lot of water for 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.010
 replenish the fluids lost with the 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.579
