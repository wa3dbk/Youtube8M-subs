00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
combat has started we go into a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.859 
combat has started we go into a
turn-based<00:01:11.430> mode<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.860> ruleset<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.760> built<00:01:15.689> on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
turn-based mode the ruleset is built on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
turn-based mode the ruleset is built on
the<00:01:16.020> original<00:01:16.380> wasteland<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.100> mercenary

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the original wasteland and mercenary

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
the original wasteland and mercenary
spies<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.299> privatized<00:01:18.720> with<00:01:19.619> some<00:01:19.830> tweaks<00:01:20.100> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
spies and privatized with some tweaks to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.120 
spies and privatized with some tweaks to
it<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.990> use<00:01:22.110> things<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.530> distance-based

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it so we use things like distance-based

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.820 
it so we use things like distance-based
modifiers<00:01:23.820> for<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.330> chance<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> hit<00:01:24.990> including

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
modifiers for a chance to hit including

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.440 
modifiers for a chance to hit including
you<00:01:26.159> know<00:01:26.250> higher<00:01:26.490> percent<00:01:26.909> chance<00:01:27.090> as

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
you know higher percent chance as

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.830 
you know higher percent chance as
enemies<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.380> closer<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.119> enemy<00:01:30.119> size<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
enemies get closer to you enemy size and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.719 
enemies get closer to you enemy size and
speeds<00:01:31.350> also<00:01:31.740> affect<00:01:32.040> your<00:01:32.159> chance<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.549> hit

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
speeds also affect your chance to hit

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.460 
speeds also affect your chance to hit
larger<00:01:33.150> enemies<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.600> much<00:01:33.810> easier<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.229> hit

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
larger enemies are much easier to hit

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.530 
larger enemies are much easier to hit
than<00:01:34.740> smaller<00:01:35.430> guys<00:01:35.610> who<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.119> very<00:01:36.270> quick

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
than smaller guys who are very quick

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.350 
than smaller guys who are very quick
enemies<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.159> tuck<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.729> friendly<00:01:39.180> fire

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
enemies as well we tuck on friendly fire

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.030 
enemies as well we tuck on friendly fire
too<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.470> really<00:01:40.680> have<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.890> pay<00:01:41.009> attention

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
too so you really have to pay attention

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
too so you really have to pay attention
to<00:01:41.640> where<00:01:41.909> your<00:01:42.119> team<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.509> standing<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.960> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to where your team is standing with in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.020 
to where your team is standing with in
combat

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.609 

another<00:01:47.030> thing<00:01:47.210> we're<00:01:47.390> doing<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.720> making<00:01:48.259> sure

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
another thing we're doing is making sure

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.399 
another thing we're doing is making sure
that<00:01:48.649> sounds<00:01:49.189> are<00:01:49.640> also<00:01:49.970> alerting<00:01:50.630> enemies<00:01:51.110> so

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
that sounds are also alerting enemies so

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.670 
that sounds are also alerting enemies so
if<00:01:51.979> you<00:01:52.250> fire<00:01:52.520> a<00:01:52.909> shot<00:01:53.270> somewhere<00:01:53.659> outside<00:01:54.380> of

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
if you fire a shot somewhere outside of

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.530 
if you fire a shot somewhere outside of
the<00:01:54.740> range<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:55.130> enemies<00:01:55.460> they<00:01:55.820> don't<00:01:56.090> care<00:01:56.299> if

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
the range of enemies they don't care if

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.850 
the range of enemies they don't care if
you're<00:01:56.659> close<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:56.960> them<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.530> they<00:01:57.619> might

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
you're close to them and they might

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.179 
you're close to them and they might
actually<00:01:58.159> go<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:58.820> alert<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.780> sound<00:02:00.020> yes<00:02:00.649> they

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
actually go to alert the sound yes they

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.300 
actually go to alert the sound yes they
can<00:02:01.340> figure<00:02:01.490> out<00:02:01.610> who<00:02:01.820> shot<00:02:01.970> it<00:02:05.770> so<00:02:06.770> we<00:02:06.920> do<00:02:07.070> have

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
can figure out who shot it so we do have

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.910 
can figure out who shot it so we do have
a<00:02:07.549> hex<00:02:07.850> base<00:02:08.090> system<00:02:08.539> as<00:02:08.660> well<00:02:08.810> you<00:02:09.590> can<00:02:09.619> see

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
a hex base system as well you can see
