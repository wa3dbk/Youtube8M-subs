said that I'm actually wearing wigs that

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.619 
said that I'm actually wearing wigs that
are<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:52.399> curl<00:00:53.399> pad<00:00:53.730> would<00:00:53.879> actually<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.329> some

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
are a curl pad would actually have some

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.229 
are a curl pad would actually have some
type<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> curl<00:00:55.199> cabinet<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> them<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.579> this<00:00:56.879> one

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
type of curl cabinet in them so this one

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
type of curl cabinet in them so this one
that<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.170> little<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.620> kind<00:00:58.859> of

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100

that I have it's a little bit kind of
like<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.489> guess<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.850> would<00:00:59.940> consider<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.390> like

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
like I guess you would consider it like

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.560 
like I guess you would consider it like
a<00:01:00.570> braid<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> little<00:01:01.500> bit<00:01:01.760> here<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.329> or

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
a braid out a little bit here is the or

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
a braid out a little bit here is the or
if<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> guys<00:01:03.989> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> here<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.129> the

what<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.250> looks<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.759> back<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
what it looks like in the back and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
what it looks like in the back and
normally<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> probably<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:30.030> cut<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.479> wig<00:01:30.720> in

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.300 
normally I probably will cut this wig in
the<00:01:30.990> back<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.380> don't<00:01:31.619> think<00:01:31.740> I'm<00:01:31.860> gonna<00:01:32.009> cut

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the back but I don't think I'm gonna cut

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.560 
the back but I don't think I'm gonna cut
it<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:32.670> I'm<00:01:32.759> actually<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.180> gonna<00:01:33.329> leave

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it I think I'm actually just gonna leave

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.200 
it I think I'm actually just gonna leave
it<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.780> way<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.500> do<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> only

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it the way it is I do like it only

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.149 
it the way it is I do like it only
because<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.810> curl<00:01:37.049> pattern<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.619> way<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:38.040> it

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
because the curl pattern the way that it

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.220 
because the curl pattern the way that it
is<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.759> doesn't<00:01:39.180> show<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:39.630> as<00:01:39.840> shiny<00:01:40.350> as

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
is it doesn't show up as shiny as

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.040 
is it doesn't show up as shiny as
