two weeks or so but in the recent patch
to<00:00:22.470> isolate<00:00:22.890> brought<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.279> back<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> also

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to isolate brought it back and also

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.090 
to isolate brought it back and also
update<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.420> jungle<00:00:24.930> map<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.320> pretty<00:00:25.740> huge

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
update the jungle map in a pretty huge

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.070 
update the jungle map in a pretty huge
way<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.940> I<00:00:27.029> have<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.180> say<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.600> map<00:00:27.810> looks

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
way and I have to say the map looks

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.010 
way and I have to say the map looks
absolutely<00:00:28.740> amazing<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.910> very<00:00:30.360> rich<00:00:30.689> dense

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
absolutely amazing it's very rich dense

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.260 
absolutely amazing it's very rich dense
a<00:00:31.259> green<00:00:31.560> of<00:00:31.740> vegetation<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.580> the<00:00:32.640> slight

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
a green of vegetation and the slight

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.850 
a green of vegetation and the slight
mess<00:00:33.600> around<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> makes<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.620> feel<00:00:34.829> like

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
mess around and that makes you feel like

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
mess around and that makes you feel like
you're<00:00:35.220> actually<00:00:35.490> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.060> jungle<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> that's

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
you're actually in the jungle and that's

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
you're actually in the jungle and that's
exactly<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.950> all<00:00:38.040> wanted<00:00:38.490> while<00:00:38.790> most<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
exactly what we all wanted while most of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.780 
exactly what we all wanted while most of
us<00:00:39.660> anyway<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.320> know<00:00:40.770> some<00:00:41.160> people<00:00:41.190> include

us anyway I know some people include

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.790 
us anyway I know some people include
myself<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.480> concerned<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> map<00:00:43.230> would<00:00:43.500> turn

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
myself was concerned the map would turn

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.620 
myself was concerned the map would turn
out<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:43.950> look<00:00:44.220> very<00:00:44.460> similar<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.210> maps<00:00:45.480> in

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:45.630 
out to look very similar to the maps in

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.810 
out to look very similar to the maps in
China<00:00:45.930> rising<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.920> that's<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.340> case<00:00:47.550> at

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
China rising but that's not the case at

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.850 
China rising but that's not the case at
all<00:00:47.970> the<00:00:48.180> jungle<00:00:48.600> Matt<00:00:48.750> feels<00:00:49.050> very<00:00:49.470> unique

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
all the jungle Matt feels very unique

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
all the jungle Matt feels very unique
when<00:00:50.100> compared<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.580> every<00:00:50.880> other<00:00:50.910> map<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.480> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
when compared to every other map in the

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
when compared to every other map in the
game<00:00:51.810> one<00:00:52.560> thing<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.980> always<00:00:53.010> used<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.580> say<00:00:53.640> when

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
game one thing I always used to say when

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.820 
game one thing I always used to say when
the<00:00:54.150> same<00:00:54.360> p<00:00:54.510> project<00:00:54.780> first<00:00:55.170> started<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
the same p project first started was I

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.800 
the same p project first started was I
really<00:00:56.160> hope<00:00:56.370> died<00:00:56.580> so<00:00:56.820> they<00:00:56.940> fill<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> map<00:00:57.600> up

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
really hope died so they fill the map up

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.900 
really hope died so they fill the map up
with<00:00:58.260> as<00:00:58.440> much<00:00:58.650> vegetation<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.490> plant<00:00:59.760> life

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with as much vegetation and plant life

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.090 
with as much vegetation and plant life
as<00:01:00.300> possible<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:01.350> capture<00:01:01.560> that<00:01:01.710> jungle

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
as possible to capture that jungle

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
as possible to capture that jungle
feeling<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.700> create<00:01:02.880> some<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.180> those<00:01:03.270> tense

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
feeling and create some of those tense

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570 
feeling and create some of those tense
moments<00:01:04.290> where<00:01:04.500> you're<00:01:04.619> walking<00:01:05.009> through<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
moments where you're walking through the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
moments where you're walking through the
thick<00:01:05.790> vegetation<00:01:06.229> knowing<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.350> enemy<00:01:07.650> is

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
thick vegetation knowing that enemy is

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
thick vegetation knowing that enemy is
only<00:01:07.890> about<00:01:08.070> five<00:01:08.490> meters<00:01:08.909> away<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.330> any

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
only about five meters away in any

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.810 
only about five meters away in any
direction<00:01:09.780> which<00:01:10.740> actually<00:01:11.189> happened<00:01:11.729> in

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
direction which actually happened in

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.370 
direction which actually happened in
this<00:01:11.939> situation<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.780> knew<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.290> was

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
this situation here I knew there was

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
this situation here I knew there was
about<00:01:13.530> four<00:01:13.830> players<00:01:14.159> or<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.759> around<00:01:14.909> my

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
about four players or so around my

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.599 
about four players or so around my
position<00:01:15.810> but<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.469> a<00:01:16.499> thick<00:01:16.590> plant<00:01:17.159> life<00:01:17.429> I

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:17.609 
position but with a thick plant life I

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:19.489 
position but with a thick plant life I
could<00:01:17.789> barely<00:01:18.060> even<00:01:18.270> see<00:01:18.630> five<00:01:18.929> meters<00:01:19.350> ahead

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
could barely even see five meters ahead

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.289 
could barely even see five meters ahead
of<00:01:19.799> me<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:20.520> moments<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:20.969> this<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
of me and it's moments like this I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
of me and it's moments like this I
really<00:01:21.719> immerse<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.829> game<00:01:22.979> but

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
really immerse you into the game but

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.550 
really immerse you into the game but
also<00:01:23.280> make<00:01:23.789> me<00:01:23.820> think<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> jungle

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
also make me think what would the jungle

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.410 
also make me think what would the jungle
Matt<00:01:25.679> be<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.159> he<00:01:26.340> falls<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.609> nighttime<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
Matt be like he falls at nighttime that

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.899 
Matt be like he falls at nighttime that
could<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.719> pretty<00:01:28.140> interesting<00:01:28.890> with<00:01:29.340> dice<00:01:29.579> la

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
could be pretty interesting with dice la

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.789 
could be pretty interesting with dice la
converting<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.659> some<00:01:30.929> of<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.049> vanilla<00:01:31.499> maps

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
converting over some of the vanilla maps

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.889 
converting over some of the vanilla maps
to<00:01:31.979> make<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.159> nighttime<00:01:32.700> version<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.359> a<00:01:33.479> one

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
to make a nighttime version of it a one

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.389 
to make a nighttime version of it a one
Dave<00:01:34.109> maybe<00:01:34.439> in<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.679> future<00:01:34.829> they<00:01:35.130> could<00:01:35.280> do

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
Dave maybe in the future they could do

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.459 
Dave maybe in the future they could do
the<00:01:35.490> same<00:01:35.729> for<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.270> map<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:37.109> that's

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
the same for this map I know that's

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.529 
the same for this map I know that's
asking<00:01:37.649> for<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.369> but<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.789> think<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.359> could

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
asking for a lot but I do think it could

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.080 
asking for a lot but I do think it could
be<00:01:39.659> amazing<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:40.920> anyway<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.399> what<00:01:41.819> did<00:01:41.969> they

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
be amazing but anyway so what did they

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.969 
be amazing but anyway so what did they
exactly<00:01:42.539> add<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.109> map<00:01:43.289> there's<00:01:43.560> no<00:01:43.710> patch

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
exactly add to the map there's no patch

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.739

can actually kind of hiding it's really
cool<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.170> how<00:02:16.410> they<00:02:16.530> move<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:16.950> crawl

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
cool to see how they move as you crawl

locations of the map it possibly could

mean an enemy players nearby and then

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.259 
mean an enemy players nearby and then
details<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.430> evening<00:02:26.849> that<00:02:27.000> barely

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
covers your body it's still a great

covers your body it's still a great
addition<00:02:29.159> and<00:02:29.580> that's<00:02:30.209> probably<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.810> next

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
addition and that's probably the next

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.690 
addition and that's probably the next
biggest<00:02:31.379> concern<00:02:31.860> I've<00:02:32.010> read<00:02:32.190> from<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.430> player

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
biggest concern I've read from a player

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
biggest concern I've read from a player
base<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.150> how<00:02:33.330> much<00:02:33.510> cover<00:02:33.840> do<00:02:34.080> infantry<00:02:34.650> have

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
base is how much cover do infantry have

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.830 
base is how much cover do infantry have
died<00:02:35.549> so<00:02:35.610> they<00:02:35.879> still<00:02:36.150> happen<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.480> played<00:02:36.690> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
died so they still happen can played the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.020 
died so they still happen can played the
map<00:02:37.019> obviously<00:02:37.560> but<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.830> can<00:02:38.010> safely<00:02:38.280> say<00:02:38.519> cover

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
map obviously but I can safely say cover

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.970 
map obviously but I can safely say cover
wasn't<00:02:39.480> an<00:02:39.750> issue<00:02:39.930> when<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> was<00:02:40.409> attacking<00:02:40.860> or

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
wasn't an issue when I was attacking or

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.460 
wasn't an issue when I was attacking or
defending<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.580> flags<00:02:41.959> except<00:02:42.959> for<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.170> city

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.149 
flag ghost hand yes all the destruction
is<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.110> cool<00:02:46.290> but<00:02:46.470> once<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.950> houses

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:47.159 
is really cool but once of the houses

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.250 
is really cool but once of the houses
and<00:02:47.519> whatnot<00:02:47.909> are<00:02:48.000> all<00:02:48.120> gone<00:02:48.390> it<00:02:48.989> can<00:02:49.140> be

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and whatnot are all gone it can be

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.289 
and whatnot are all gone it can be
fairly<00:02:49.500> difficult<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:50.250> find<00:02:50.730> some<00:02:50.909> basic

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
cover while burning the flag what makes

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.130 
cover while burning the flag what makes
it<00:02:53.489> even<00:02:53.610> harder<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.360> radius<00:02:54.810> where<00:02:54.989> you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
it even harder is the radius where you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.750 
it even harder is the radius where you
can<00:02:55.260> actually<00:02:55.409> burn<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.069> flag<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.459> pretty

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
can actually burn the flag is pretty

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.390 
can actually burn the flag is pretty
small<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.810> there's<00:02:58.019> a<00:02:58.079> tank<00:02:58.440> or<00:02:58.650> lav<00:02:59.160> it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
small and if there's a tank or lav it's

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.910 
small and if there's a tank or lav it's
next<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.879> impossible<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.629> stay<00:03:00.840> alive<00:03:01.170> I'm<00:03:01.500> not

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
next to impossible to stay alive I'm not

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.470 
next to impossible to stay alive I'm not
entirely<00:03:02.250> sure<00:03:02.400> how<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.700> fix<00:03:03.030> this<00:03:03.150> problem

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
entirely sure how to fix this problem

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.089 
entirely sure how to fix this problem
but<00:03:03.720> for<00:03:03.900> starters<00:03:04.049> I<00:03:04.379> would<00:03:04.560> suggest<00:03:04.709> to

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
but for starters I would suggest to

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.220 
but for starters I would suggest to
expand<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.849> radius<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.390> can<00:03:06.690> cap<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.049> flag

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
expand the radius we can cap the flag

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.259 
expand the radius we can cap the flag
but<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.310> said<00:03:08.370> at<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.760> moment<00:03:09.120> still

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
but like I said at the moment still

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.940 
but like I said at the moment still
feels<00:03:09.540> like<00:03:09.660> dice<00:03:09.989> la<00:03:10.290> are<00:03:10.470> going<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.829> be

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
feels like dice la are going to be

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
feels like dice la are going to be
tweaking<00:03:11.430> them<00:03:11.549> up<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.790> lot<00:03:12.090> more<00:03:12.329> in<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.540> near

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
tweaking them up a lot more in the near

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.440

like<00:04:43.280> more<00:04:43.760> or<00:04:43.880> less<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.210> proof<00:04:44.690> of<00:04:44.870> concept

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
like more or less a proof of concept

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.990 
like more or less a proof of concept
that<00:04:45.889> could<00:04:46.070> have<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.220> kind<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.760> live

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
that could have a kind of live

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.180 
that could have a kind of live
environment<00:04:47.419> to<00:04:47.810> play<00:04:48.020> on<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:48.380> probably

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
environment to play on and probably

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:51.129 
environment to play on and probably
would<00:04:49.430> eventually<00:04:49.820> be<00:04:50.090> made<00:04:50.330> into<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.810> feature

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
would eventually be made into a feature

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.129 
would eventually be made into a feature
for<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.590> next<00:04:51.919> major<00:04:52.100> baffled<00:04:52.820> gang<00:04:53.030> well<00:04:53.900> it

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
for the next major baffled gang well it

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.080 
for the next major baffled gang well it
seems<00:04:54.440> like<00:04:54.530> my<00:04:54.830> assumption<00:04:55.370> was<00:04:55.520> totally

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
seems like my assumption was totally

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.460 
seems like my assumption was totally
wrong<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.630> turns<00:04:56.840> out<00:04:56.990> these<00:04:57.229> high-tech

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
wrong and it turns out these high-tech

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.890 
wrong and it turns out these high-tech
rates<00:04:57.979> will<00:04:58.190> in<00:04:58.340> fact<00:04:58.610> make<00:04:59.120> its<00:04:59.300> way<00:04:59.449> over<00:04:59.750> to

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900
