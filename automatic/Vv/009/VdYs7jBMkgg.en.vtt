00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.070
 and now it's already a few days 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.900
 passed and the whole thing is synonymous 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 already noticeable on the body of youtuber 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.540
 but the guys give the fuck on it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.409
