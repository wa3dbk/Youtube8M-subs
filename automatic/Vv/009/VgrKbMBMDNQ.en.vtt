00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
there are two modes the first one is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.600 
there are two modes the first one is
with<00:00:30.689> one<00:00:31.080> dog<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.769> second<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.189> is<00:00:32.399> with

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
with one dog and the second one is with

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.880 
with one dog and the second one is with
two<00:00:32.850> ducks<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.390> guess<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.350> start<00:00:34.590> we're<00:00:34.739> going

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
two ducks I guess for start we're going

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.729 
two ducks I guess for start we're going
to<00:00:35.010> choose<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:35.969> one<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> yeah<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.590> get

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
to choose the first one and yeah we get

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.639 
to choose the first one and yeah we get
three<00:00:38.160> tries<00:00:38.370> those<00:00:38.969> are<00:00:39.180> our<00:00:39.390> arrows<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.320> we

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
three tries those are our arrows if we

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.350 
three tries those are our arrows if we
manage<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.129> hit<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> duck<00:00:41.700> we're<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.210> to

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
manage to hit the duck we're going to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.139 
manage to hit the duck we're going to
get<00:00:42.480> points<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:43.110> if<00:00:43.800> we<00:00:44.129> don't<00:00:44.489> hit<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.820> dog

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
get points and if we don't hit the dog

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.160 
get points and if we don't hit the dog
that<00:00:45.570> we<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> get<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.860> Miss<00:00:48.020> so<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that we are going to get a Miss so the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
that we are going to get a Miss so the
game<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.559> be<00:00:49.590> challenging<00:00:50.489> at<00:00:50.700> some<00:00:51.210> times

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
game can be challenging at some times

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.229 
game can be challenging at some times
and<00:00:51.870> at<00:00:52.260> other<00:00:52.530> times<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.520> actually

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and at other times it can be actually

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.020 
and at other times it can be actually
very<00:00:54.270> easy<00:00:54.719> however<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:56.190> thing<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.789> is

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
very easy however one thing to know is

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.150 
very easy however one thing to know is
that<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> difficulty<00:00:57.930> increases<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.949> every

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
that the difficulty increases with every

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.790 
that the difficulty increases with every
round<00:00:59.520> so<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> longer<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.539> play<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.379> harder

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
round so the longer you play the harder

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880 
round so the longer you play the harder
it<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.010> going<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.229> also<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> other

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
it is going to get and also on the other

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
it is going to get and also on the other
hand<00:01:05.339> if<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.939> manage<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.600> miss<00:01:06.900> all<00:01:07.320> of<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
hand if you manage to miss all of the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.630 
hand if you manage to miss all of the
times<00:01:08.070> then<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.119> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.780> lose<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.369> watch

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
times then you're going to lose so watch

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.270 
times then you're going to lose so watch
out<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.390> bar<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.049> if<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.890> all

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
out for this bar and if you see all

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.480 
out for this bar and if you see all
black<00:01:14.880> then<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> lose<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.799> if

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
black then you're going to lose and if

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 
black then you're going to lose and if
it's<00:01:17.670> all<00:01:17.880> red<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.420> good<00:01:18.630> job<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.259> managed

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it's all red then good job you managed

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
it's all red then good job you managed
to<00:01:19.770> hit<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.189> duck<00:01:20.400> all<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.240> time<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.490> now<00:01:23.490> for

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
to hit the duck all the time and now for

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
to hit the duck all the time and now for
the<00:01:24.180> second<00:01:24.540> mode<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.560> actually<00:01:25.979> not

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the second mode it's actually not

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
the second mode it's actually not
different<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.210> amount<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.630> tries<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
different the amount of tries is the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.380 
different the amount of tries is the
same<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.310> actually<00:01:29.700> gets<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.060> little<00:01:30.150> bit

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
same so it actually gets a little bit

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
same so it actually gets a little bit
more<00:01:30.600> difficult<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:32.189> need<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.549> hit<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
more difficult and you need to hit the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.980 
more difficult and you need to hit the
two<00:01:33.570> dogs<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:35.009> two<00:01:35.369> arrows<00:01:35.790> if<00:01:36.090> you

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
two dogs and you have two arrows if you

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.050 
two dogs and you have two arrows if you
hit<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.710> miss<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.100> other<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.460> then<00:01:38.970> is

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
hit one and miss the other one then is

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.300 
hit one and miss the other one then is
going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> give<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.320> black<00:01:40.650> point<00:01:41.009> and

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.139 
going to give you one black point and
one<00:01:41.640> red<00:01:41.880> point<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.100> that's<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
one red point and that's about it the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
one red point and that's about it the
comment<00:01:45.450> box<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.840> right<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.530> there<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
comment box are right here there are a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.069 
comment box are right here there are a
lot<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.340> them<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> very<00:01:48.600> complicated

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
lot of them and it is very complicated

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.480 
lot of them and it is very complicated
and<00:01:50.360> yeah<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.630> guess<00:01:51.750> that's<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.460> I

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and yeah I guess that's about it so I

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
and yeah I guess that's about it so I
showed<00:01:53.820> everything<00:01:54.560> anyways<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.829> case<00:01:56.100> you

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
showed everything anyways in case you
