00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
just think we play great defense and

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.460 
just think we play great defense and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
fun I mean Kyle started off yet I don't

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.359 
fun I mean Kyle started off yet I don't
know<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.140> his<00:00:25.260> back<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.560> back<00:00:25.710> or<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.130> he

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
know for his back to back or maybe he

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.220 
know for his back to back or maybe he
hit<00:00:26.580> three<00:00:27.000> threes<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.630> stretch<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
hit three threes in that stretch and

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.290 
hit three threes in that stretch and
Gerald<00:00:28.859> was<00:00:28.980> hitting<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> figured<00:00:30.090> out<00:00:30.179> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
Gerald was hitting so I figured out to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.049 
Gerald was hitting so I figured out to
take<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.449> shot<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.650> um<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.369> know<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> was

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
take a shot at it but um you know it was

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.549 
take a shot at it but um you know it was
a<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.329> fun<00:00:33.540> stretch<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.290> think

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
a really fun stretch there and I think

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.229 
a really fun stretch there and I think
the<00:00:35.010> one<00:00:35.130> thing<00:00:35.190> we<00:00:35.399> can't<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.910> can't<00:00:36.090> fall

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the one thing we can't do we can't fall

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.639 
the one thing we can't do we can't fall
in<00:00:36.360> love<00:00:36.420> with<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> three<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.320> did<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.500> a

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
in love with the three and we did that a

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.080 
in love with the three and we did that a
little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:38.040> but<00:00:38.219> for<00:00:38.430> most<00:00:38.550> part<00:00:38.790> we<00:00:38.940> took

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
little bit but for most part we took

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.090 
little bit but for most part we took
really<00:00:39.270> good<00:00:39.360> shots<00:00:39.719> about<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.590> horse<00:00:40.829> shut

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.990 
feels for you guys yeah I mean it feels
really<00:01:30.360> good<00:01:30.600> obviously<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.829> i<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.909> is

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
really good obviously it's a i think is

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.340 
really good obviously it's a i think is
really<00:01:33.180> similar<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.750> NCAA<00:01:34.079> tournament

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
really similar to the NCAA tournament

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.499 
really similar to the NCAA tournament
way<00:01:34.710> worse<00:01:35.000> obviously<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.420> done

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
way worse obviously it's one and done

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.749 
way worse obviously it's one and done
and<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.710> know<00:01:37.799> there's<00:01:37.950> really<00:01:38.400> pressure

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and you know there's really pressure

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.450 
and you know there's really pressure
situations<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.140> for<00:01:40.710> three<00:01:40.950> games<00:01:41.130> we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
situations on you and for three games we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.219 
situations on you and for three games we
had<00:01:41.640> those<00:01:41.820> situations<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> thought<00:01:43.079> we

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
had those situations and I thought we

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
had those situations and I thought we
did<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.409> really<00:01:43.619> good<00:01:43.740> job<00:01:43.799> handling<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
did a really good job handling that and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.789 
did a really good job handling that and
obviously<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.200> big<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.710> with

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.130 
team so I think you know Gerald has an
MVP<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.130> one<00:02:24.340> thing<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:24.910> Kyle<00:02:25.090> does<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.690> it's

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
MVP you one thing and Kyle does so it's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.050 
MVP you one thing and Kyle does so it's
uh<00:02:26.380> between<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:26.980> three<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.250> us<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.760> doesn't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
uh between the three of us it doesn't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.150
