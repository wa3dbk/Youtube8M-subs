00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.630 
down but it was about at least a solid
five<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.720> ten<00:01:45.960> times<00:01:46.170> somewhere<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.009> so

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
five to ten times somewhere in there so

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.920 
five to ten times somewhere in there so
you<00:01:47.729> could<00:01:47.909> tell<00:01:48.090> Matt<00:01:48.270> McGloin<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.689> getting

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930

you could tell Matt McGloin was getting
frustrated<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.710> mean<00:01:50.009> he<00:01:50.100> 61<00:01:50.759> he's<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.360> that

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
frustrated I mean he 61 he's not that

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990

short<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.439> know<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:53.100> think<00:01:53.159> Russell<00:01:53.640> Wilson

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
short you know I think Russell Wilson

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
short you know I think Russell Wilson
smaller<00:01:54.420> than<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.689> makes<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.320> happen<00:01:55.710> but

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
smaller than that makes you happen but

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.649 
smaller than that makes you happen but
Russell<00:01:56.610> Wilson<00:01:56.880> he<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.090> runs<00:01:57.360> out<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
Russell Wilson he also runs out of a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
Russell Wilson he also runs out of a
popular<00:01:58.020> lies<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> pocket<00:01:58.799> passer<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
popular lies on a pocket passer so you

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.429 
popular lies on a pocket passer so you
got<00:02:00.119> defensive<00:02:00.390> linemen<00:02:00.899> right<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.140> your<00:02:01.200> face
