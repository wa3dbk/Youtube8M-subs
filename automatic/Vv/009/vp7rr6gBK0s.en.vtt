right down here on the the corner there

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
right down here on the the corner there
that<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:40.950> took<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.309> nice<00:00:41.460> little

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
that it really took a nice little

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.610 
that it really took a nice little
beating<00:00:42.090> you<00:00:42.899> know<00:00:43.020> on<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.820> top<00:00:44.820> side<00:00:45.090> here

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
beating you know on the top side here

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.110 
beating you know on the top side here
from<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.920> second<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.730> know<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> little

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
from it's a second you know a little

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
from it's a second you know a little
tumble<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.350> bet<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> could<00:00:49.710> probably<00:00:49.890> take

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
tumble and I bet I could probably take

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.529 
tumble and I bet I could probably take
like<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> Sharpie<00:00:50.760> or<00:00:50.789> something<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.239> colored

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
like a Sharpie or something in colored

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.569 
like a Sharpie or something in colored
in<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> was<00:00:52.260> really<00:00:52.500> bothering<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:53.010> but<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
in if it was really bothering me but a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
in if it was really bothering me but a
lot<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.210> damage<00:00:54.600> on<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> frame<00:00:55.289> than<00:00:55.500> I

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
lot more damage on the frame than I

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.660 
lot more damage on the frame than I
would<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.770> thought<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.129> would<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.309> so

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
