the right back spot very good stats the
only<00:01:14.220> downside<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.700> he's<00:01:15.240> not<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.930> going

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
only downside is he's not really going

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.440 
only downside is he's not really going
to<00:01:16.380> keep<00:01:16.680> up<00:01:16.860> with<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.070> very<00:01:17.400> Pacey<00:01:17.820> winger<00:01:18.240> but

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
