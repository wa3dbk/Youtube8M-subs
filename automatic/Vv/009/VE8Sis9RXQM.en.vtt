00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.570
 hello today, another recipe 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 smoking my guys gave me power 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.119
 here is a piece of a big two 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.970
 kilogram this goes me neck 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 I will try to smoke it and smoke it 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 one way but pickle two 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.789
 ways that I was no longer 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 questions in the comments and so on that 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 where do we get lard meat in Ukraine 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.579
 that from somewhere in Portugal carries more 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 there from Poland and so on 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.960
 I personally buy all this from us in the village 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.700
 there we have guys who 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.739
 engaged in meat who's scored 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.590
 pig brought us svezhatina 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.320
 and we eat it maybe somewhere 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.879
 some meat from abroad but I personally 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.250
 this is not heard that is near us 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 as if but everywhere sat around then 5 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.570
 kilometers hilarious everywhere in all and pigs 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.219
 there are cows and so on 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:01.320
 immediately now the marinade recipe 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.400
 Means that we do probably take 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.229
 a piece of this meat is halved he was 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.990
 such a big picture would spin but 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:14.400
 the more I want to make two recipes 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.549
 means one piece I will just 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.130
 will this summer salt pepper red 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.990
 pepper and all that is here and so my 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.520
 marinated and until tomorrow for us lie down 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 second piece 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.759
 I will salt pepper black pepper 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.979
 red onion finely cut you 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.560
 made it like a barbecue from a neighbor's case 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.360
 and nashpiguyu still a little garlic 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 garlic I forgot to bring garlic now 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.630
 here he is now garlic and now add as 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.490
 I'll clean it once and then tomorrow 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.290
 captcha and check which one will be 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.780
 tastes better than diarrhea seems to me why nobody 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.119
 when smoking makes meat not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.670
 add look at luxe so softens 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.900
 the meat here just tried to question me 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.850
 so interested 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.710
 I'll probably be the pioneer 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.630
 at least for yourself that is whether it is possible 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.600
 Marinate also meat as for a shish kebab 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.700
 or it is impossible but we proceed like this 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.119
 garlic thought that's not enough 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.240
 it means it has already shown once 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:19.390
 showed how easy to clean garlic so 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.080
 take here our head of garlic 1 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 crushed 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.680
 natural just like that with a knife 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.220
 suppressed everything can not be a knife can all 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.550
 anything heavy then everything here it is 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.770
 she already peels off from here skolko 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.630
 will take this time weakly pressed on 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.900
 other all 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.690
 she herself already departs 1 time by hand 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.550
 practically I can already disassemble so 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:55.030
 Immediately, I cut emil in garlic hour 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.090
 some platelets see this 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.620
 Now I got Schork garlic 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.190
 Well, we start to give from what was with 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.970
 garlic 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.950
 right away the department what small cuts 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 so as there now garlic garlic 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:17.050
 shove salt with pepper to 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.280
 he was passing like he was let's 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:24.580
 try now take a little 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:31.470
 a plate of spices means up to first person 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.470
 she's brighter than red pepper black salt 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:53.209
 we are ready to go we are rubbing 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:56.959
 well our meat and immediately see 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.939
 there we put holes in there garlic can 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.810
 even make such holidays like water 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:19.789
 small our straight garlic with spices 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:25.990
 there we will do so it will be necessary to weigh 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:25.990
 salt pepper garlic 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.560
 So 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:49.280
 nadrezik yes garlic is just not interested 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:55.220
 very taste I saw how the meat is fried 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:57.470
 how does the meat grow in the oven 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.210
 guys honestly interesting to try 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.490
 differently then for myself I will be 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.850
 know need to do so unnecessarily bad 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.540
 will be 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:09.460
 or good at all on the complex meat goes 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:09.460
 salt and spices in garlic 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.080
 let her pick up all her taste soap 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:18.020
 we put already 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:25.310
 enameled ware and powdered 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:39.910
 top of garlic all the holes in 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:42.830
 cut ki can see there is this is our first 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.160
 marinade recipe here from a little bit will remove 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:47.290
 and so we continue our 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.150
 second piece of meat 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:53.900
 take to start chop onions onions 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.670
 chop finely that is the hall to me 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.730
 try to keep the tail well when 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.790
 I'm his cuts this cheat can not 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:05.140
 while it may be easier to understand at the end 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:07.340
 Apples, chop the onions like on skewers 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:11.780
 principle came to life chop it up whatever you like 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:16.810
 well, let's try hello it's a ponytail 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:23.560
 as though you might as well say yes 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:25.760
 then it is probably still not present 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.180
 a plate for onions could of course 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:35.070
 you more well, honestly 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:35.070
 1 if stirring 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:50.050
 but everything was a kilo of meat in these spices in 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:55.330
 bows a little bit of our meat put into it 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:59.699
 and here and so we rub our piece with onions 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:59.699
 meat with spices 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.729
 that is, it will be about this juice 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:16.539
 he already went color gets us 

00:07:06.729 --> 00:07:24.180
 Now we put the meat on the fallen girlfriend 

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:24.180
 on this and fall asleep on top of onions too 

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:33.449
 now quietly flowed spices experience 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.449
 meat it will turn out with us as a kebab 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:45.999
 so that's it 

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:48.939
 one is just salt pepper red pepper 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:50.830
