00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
little better in the social media front

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.189 
little better in the social media front
and<00:05:52.009> the<00:05:52.129> web<00:05:52.279> front<00:05:52.669> and<00:05:53.539> in<00:05:53.779> media<00:05:53.960> in

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
and the web front and in media in

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.499 
and the web front and in media in
general<00:05:54.229> let's<00:05:55.069> pick<00:05:55.250> up<00:05:55.339> the<00:05:55.490> torch<00:05:55.789> you<00:05:56.089> know

00:05:56.499 --> 00:05:56.509 
general let's pick up the torch you know

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:57.670 
general let's pick up the torch you know
so<00:05:56.629> I<00:05:56.689> think<00:05:56.779> it's<00:05:57.020> good<00:05:57.169> enough<00:05:57.199> on<00:05:57.500> that

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
so I think it's good enough on that

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.350 
so I think it's good enough on that
front<00:05:58.039> but<00:05:58.610> then<00:05:58.759> I<00:05:58.819> look<00:05:59.029> at<00:05:59.089> it<00:05:59.180> from<00:05:59.270> the

00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 
front but then I look at it from the

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.519 
front but then I look at it from the
perspective<00:05:59.449> of<00:05:59.870> somebody<00:06:00.020> that's<00:06:00.259> had<00:06:00.439> an

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
perspective of somebody that's had an

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:02.170 
perspective of somebody that's had an
iPhone<00:06:00.650> for<00:06:01.099> two<00:06:01.250> years<00:06:01.490> somebody<00:06:01.729> is<00:06:01.969> that<00:06:02.060> an

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
iPhone for two years somebody is that an

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.629 
iPhone for two years somebody is that an
Android<00:06:02.509> device<00:06:02.719> for<00:06:02.960> two<00:06:03.080> years<00:06:03.289> it<00:06:04.250> may<00:06:04.490> not

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
Android device for two years it may not

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.850 
Android device for two years it may not
be<00:06:04.789> that<00:06:04.819> exciting<00:06:05.539> to<00:06:05.689> them<00:06:05.839> but<00:06:06.650> I<00:06:06.710> think
