00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.180 
I call them Australian cousins because
they're<00:02:13.390> down<00:02:13.540> under<00:02:13.960> and<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.680> between<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
they're down under and in between the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.580 
they're down under and in between the
original<00:02:15.610> direction<00:02:15.760> stitches<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.230> I<00:02:17.260> can

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
original direction stitches so I can

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.950 
original direction stitches so I can
keep<00:02:17.800> going<00:02:17.830> along<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.550> edge<00:02:18.820> without<00:02:19.450> even

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
keep going along this edge without even

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
keep going along this edge without even
removing<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.560> provisional<00:02:21.040> edge<00:02:21.220> it's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
removing the provisional edge it's

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.490 
removing the provisional edge it's
always<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.420> good<00:02:22.600> idea<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:23.110> remove<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
always a good idea to remove the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.290 
always a good idea to remove the
provisional<00:02:23.710> edge<00:02:24.190> immediately<00:02:24.790> afterwards

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
provisional edge immediately afterwards

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.420 
provisional edge immediately afterwards
just<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.050> be<00:02:26.200> sure<00:02:26.230> you're<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.770> right<00:02:26.890> spot

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
just to be sure you're in the right spot

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.480 
just to be sure you're in the right spot
but<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.440> also<00:02:31.470> undo<00:02:32.470> this<00:02:32.650> edge<00:02:32.920> as<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.250> go

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
but I can also undo this edge as I go

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.060 
but I can also undo this edge as I go
and<00:02:33.700> pop<00:02:34.510> out<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:35.050> cousins<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.770> I<00:02:35.890> can

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
and pop out the cousins so that I can

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.530 
and pop out the cousins so that I can
knit<00:02:36.280> them<00:02:36.459> up<00:02:36.580> just<00:02:36.850> like<00:02:36.970> ordinary<00:02:37.390> stitches

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
knit them up just like ordinary stitches

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.310 
knit them up just like ordinary stitches
this<00:02:40.540> initial<00:02:41.050> end<00:02:42.390> will<00:02:43.390> be<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:43.900> little

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
this initial end will be a little little

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.260 
this initial end will be a little little
bit<00:02:44.470> of<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.650> twist<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.310> I<00:02:45.489> will<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.970> tease

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
bit of a twist and I will have to tease

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:56.860 
bit of a twist and I will have to tease
the<00:02:46.630> yarn<00:02:46.840> out<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.380> it

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.990 

at<00:02:57.410> this<00:02:57.650> end<00:02:57.920> I'm<00:02:58.160> going<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.519> have<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.790> just

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
at this end I'm going to have to just

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.199 
at this end I'm going to have to just
untangle<00:02:59.500> the<00:03:00.500> yarn<00:03:00.709> from<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.489> twist<00:03:01.849> at<00:03:02.090> the

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
untangle the yarn from that twist at the

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.070 
untangle the yarn from that twist at the
