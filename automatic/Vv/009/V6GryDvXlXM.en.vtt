00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
wanted then what's the next process well

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.560 
wanted then what's the next process well
we<00:02:28.780> put<00:02:28.960> it<00:02:29.050> in<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.260> bowl<00:02:30.090> put<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.360> pan

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
so while it sounds like it might be

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.540 
so while it sounds like it might be
something<00:02:38.260> harder<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:38.860> really<00:02:39.190> not<00:02:39.280> a<00:02:39.340> hard

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
something harder it's really not a hard

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.430 
something harder it's really not a hard

location within the batter we want to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.760 
location within the batter we want to
put<00:02:54.790> them<00:02:54.940> all<00:02:55.270> the<00:02:55.390> way<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.080> within<00:02:56.560> one

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
put them all the way to the within one

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.440 
put them all the way to the within one
inch<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.310> edge<00:02:57.460> of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> battery<00:02:58.060> okay

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
inch of the edge of the battery okay

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:05.520 
inch of the edge of the battery okay
spread<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:59.020> kind<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.260> evenly<00:02:59.970> across<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.810> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
spread it kind of evenly across and the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.080 
spread it kind of evenly across and the
deal<00:03:05.680> is<00:03:05.830> it's<00:03:06.220> actually<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.730> guess<00:03:06.880> a<00:03:06.910> little

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
deal is it's actually I guess a little

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.449
