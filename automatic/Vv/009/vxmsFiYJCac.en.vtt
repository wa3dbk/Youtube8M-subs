I<00:01:36.560> found<00:01:37.100> that<00:01:37.250> adjusting<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.060> tones<00:01:38.360> what<00:01:38.810> I

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
I found that adjusting the tones what I

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.660 
I found that adjusting the tones what I
did<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.140> I<00:01:39.200> turned<00:01:39.259> both<00:01:39.890> bass<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.549> treble

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
did is I turned both bass and treble

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.850 
did is I turned both bass and treble
down<00:01:40.970> there's<00:01:41.180> no<00:01:41.330> mid<00:01:41.570> by<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.869> way<00:01:42.080> turn<00:01:42.649> both

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
down there's no mid by the way turn both

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.740 
down there's no mid by the way turn both
the<00:01:43.039> bass<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.549> treble<00:01:43.580> down<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.330> then

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
the bass and the treble down and then

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.999 
the bass and the treble down and then
just<00:01:44.830> gradually<00:01:45.830> bring<00:01:46.580> them<00:01:46.820> up<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.509> taste<00:01:48.009> so

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
just gradually bring them up to taste so

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.260 
just gradually bring them up to taste so
let's<00:01:49.189> spend<00:01:49.369> a<00:01:49.490> little<00:01:49.580> bit<00:01:49.789> of<00:01:49.850> time<00:01:50.060> with

notice how it doesn't grunge all up or

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.080 
notice how it doesn't grunge all up or
become<00:02:23.380> all<00:02:23.560> mushy<00:02:23.890> with<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.340> upper<00:02:24.520> partials

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
of the chord which is something I always

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.920 
of the chord which is something I always
look<00:02:30.520> for<00:02:30.760> because<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> like<00:02:31.300> to<00:02:31.390> hit<00:02:31.480> chords

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
look for because I like to hit chords

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.510 
look for because I like to hit chords
that<00:02:32.110> are<00:02:32.140> not<00:02:32.410> necessarily<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.250> norm

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
that are not necessarily of the norm

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.750 
that are not necessarily of the norm
like<00:02:33.790> get<00:02:33.970> your<00:02:34.120> major<00:02:34.300> third<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.810> there<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
like get your major third in there and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.430 
like get your major third in there and
this<00:02:39.760> amp<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.300> do<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.990> it<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.230> not

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
this amp will do that and it will not

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.270 
this amp will do that and it will not
mush<00:02:41.740> out<00:02:42.600> again<00:02:43.600> it's<00:02:43.840> its<00:02:44.080> own<00:02:44.290> sound<00:02:44.890> though

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
mush out again it's its own sound though

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.430 
mush out again it's its own sound though
which<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.850> really<00:02:46.270> appreciate<00:02:46.870> because<00:02:46.900> there

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
which I really appreciate because there
