00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.559
 and good morning to all what to do 35 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.060
 today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.320
 last video from the nash series of 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.910
 time and on the occasion of this 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.590
 last video I took advantage of my 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.029
 partnership with generation actually makes them 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.450
 to save you a little step 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.460
 gates 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.289
 today I present you the trouble 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.660
 maker version art work 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.330
 it's a small white notch floating it 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.000
 makes 4 cm for 4.1 g and it draws the 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:39.500
 ultra light fishing makes it all 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.420
 it's just the classic version of 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.559
 trouble maker diving that I had you 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.210
 presented in another video 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.780
 it's a less plunging version that goes 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.129
 dive only 50 cm deep 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.750
 it is equipped with a mass transfer 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.430
 so a ball that moves in the 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.440
 lure so as to actually change his 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.600
 center of gravity and allow 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.730
 more precise throws and longer you 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.379
 also have a lame ball in the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.510
 head actually who will move when 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.009
 it makes them taste bling I remember 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.750
 that lou bing actually is the fact that 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:10.250
 theirs moves from right to left 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.680
 here it is available so in version 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.659
 art works in seven colors and after 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.630
 you have about 6 more colors 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.950
 classic trout style and ayew at 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 guts level so it's guts 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.659
 who are strong to make very hot 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.400
 it's black triples so already that 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.170
 not call carnivores and at 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.500
 level of finishes find the eye 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.750
 the detail of opera as on dating 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.310
 and at the level of painting so that's 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.930
 a peeling paint pack is very 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.430
 solid in fact it is as inlaid 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.720
 in the plastic I will not be too much 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.640
 describe it but here we have the impression 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.579
 that in fact that plastic and colorful 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.100
 and unpainted so no problem the 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.630
 hooks does not damage the color of their 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 for the fish look with this 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.600
 lure simply makes it low 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.890
 trout 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.939
 I wish you to see a video for at 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.290
 trout so it's a lure that works 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.170
 for trout but you can also 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.549
 to take horse does not perch then 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.350
 pay attention to the level of loss 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.000
 really aim near the posts because 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.619
 as it does not dive deep if you 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.790
 fish in the great outdoors with this 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.649
 lure you may not take any 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.049
 perches but otherwise chub in the 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.090
 fallen from the trout fishing as I 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.350
 the say you can also take the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.790
 black-bass I took a little black 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.860
 bass by the way I would put you up the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.700
 video in which I take black bass 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.310
 with 1 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.650
 classic maker all white and here at 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.080
 level of swimming so I could not you 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.280
 make video in the wild just 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.530
 just because I did not have the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 time I'm unfair to receive them at 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.260
 level of swimming it's a swim that's 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.670
 very tight that will be very dynamic 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.040
 so this is a lure that addresses itself in 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.360
 made pretty active fish does it 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.550
 they make noise and who is ugly 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.750
 that he has this dynamic swim does that 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.980
 well here it is a lure we go 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.599
 use when the fish is in 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.430
 hunting when the fish is active 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.480
 often close to the surface as 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.519
 it's a lure that does not go down too much 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 you can also use it for the 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.190
 chub preventing it from falling as I 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.900
 wanted to explain ie you 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.489
 throw them in front of the horse the chub 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 he hears the club and he comes to swallow the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.750
 their and you can also everything 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.579
 just use it when you 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.510
 fish in small streams that has 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.069
 not a lot of depth 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.569
 that's it for the contest 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.370
 so just the idea is to 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.260
 benefit the subscribers those intended 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.299
 to subscribers so as conditions 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.799
 classic as on all others 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.750
 youtube channels be subscribed to the channel 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.420
 put a little like on the video 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.040
 and then well if you have facebook a 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.640
 live on the aquablue facebook page 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.079
 35 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.810
 of course if you do not have facebook 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.120
 you specify in comment compared 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.799
 to the answer to the question already the 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.810
 question it's going to be guessing actually 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.250
 of which exotic animal was made the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.180
 color of soleure here it is from that one 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.709
 guess what exotic animal all 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.859
 just that will be the most 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.889
 precise and that arrived first on 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.030
 the youtube channel that was told for 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.829
 your answer simply by 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.870
 comment you put I participate 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.030
 tell you if you have not facebook 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.500
 and after you put your answer in 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.150
 knowing that when I speak the answer 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.889
 is the most accurate if we give the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.590
 scientific name of the animal mamba it's 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.000
 perfect at worst if you find the photo 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.230
 or the common mount you have on the team 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.920
 and dia and you will find the name 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.660
 scientist 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.340
 gold here I take the most response 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:08.840
 accurate because yeah I can not no 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.269
 plus make everyone win from 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.220
 from the moment the person found out 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.049
 by what does it correspond to in the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.239
 worst case if no one really does 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.349
 find I'll use this little their 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.660
 there to do a staffing 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.880
 extra for the 9000 contest 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.010
 subscribers and then bah otherwise I tell you 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.740
 good luck everyone was looking 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.090
 well it's not obvious it's exotic and 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.090
 then there you go ciao
