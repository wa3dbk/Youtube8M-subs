okay<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:39.870> let's<00:00:40.230> go<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.530> what<00:00:40.680> do<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.770> do

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
okay so let's go to it what do you do

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.290 
okay so let's go to it what do you do
first<00:00:41.070> well<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.550> place<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> start<00:00:42.090> is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
first well the first place to start is

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
first well the first place to start is
to<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:43.290> drape<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> tie<00:00:44.070> around<00:00:44.219> your

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
to just get drape the tie around your

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.860 
to just get drape the tie around your
neck<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.940> then<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.480> get<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> right

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
neck and then you want to get the right

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.180 
neck and then you want to get the right
size<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.520> wider<00:00:47.730> end<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.210> about<00:00:48.450> halfway

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
size so the wider end is about halfway

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.830 
size so the wider end is about halfway
further<00:00:50.190> past<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.879> narrowing<00:00:51.239> okay<00:00:51.510> okay<00:00:51.780> so

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
further past the narrowing okay okay so

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.939 
further past the narrowing okay okay so
that's<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> place<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.500> start<00:00:52.590> don't<00:00:52.770> have

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that's the place to start don't have

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.080 
that's the place to start don't have
like<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> mini<00:00:53.340> time<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> would<00:00:53.820> have<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> little

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
like a mini time I would have a little

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.630 
like a mini time I would have a little
mini<00:00:54.300> tie<00:00:54.539> exactly<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.219> might<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.550> to

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
mini tie exactly and you might have to

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.889 
mini tie exactly and you might have to
try<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.940> few<00:00:57.090> different<00:00:57.180> times<00:00:57.480> because

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
try it a few different times because

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.389 
try it a few different times because
different<00:00:58.289> ties<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.800> different<00:00:59.129> lengths

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
different ties have different lengths

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.650 
different ties have different lengths
okay<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.030> never<00:01:00.120> going<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.359> get<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> on

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
okay so you're never going to get it on

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
okay so you're never going to get it on
the<00:01:00.750> first<00:01:00.870> try<00:01:01.109> normally<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:02.070> step<00:01:02.340> in

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the first try normally the first step in

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
the first try normally the first step in
tying<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.760> foreign<00:01:03.059> hand<00:01:03.239> knot<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.570> simply<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
tying a foreign hand knot is simply to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
tying a foreign hand knot is simply to
put<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.199> tie<00:01:04.379> around<00:01:04.500> your<00:01:04.739> neck<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
put the tie around your neck and to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
put the tie around your neck and to
figure<00:01:05.820> out<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.210> length<00:01:06.510> about

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
figure out the right length about

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
figure out the right length about
halfway<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:08.040> possibly<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.549> little<00:01:08.700> less<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
halfway or possibly a little less for

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.060 
halfway or possibly a little less for
the<00:01:09.570> narrow<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:10.049> compared<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.770> longer

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
the narrow end compared to the longer

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
the narrow end compared to the longer
end<00:01:11.450> you<00:01:12.450> take<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> wide<00:01:12.930> end<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> tie<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
end you take the wide end of the tie and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.859 
end you take the wide end of the tie and
the<00:01:13.920> first<00:01:14.159> step<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:15.540> bring<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> around

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
the first step is to bring it around

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.190 
the first step is to bring it around
like<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:17.360> then<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> simply<00:01:18.869> bring<00:01:19.049> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
like that then you simply bring it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.840 
like that then you simply bring it
towards<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> front<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:21.299> wrap<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.630> around<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
towards the front you wrap it around and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.160 
towards the front you wrap it around and
now<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.119> see<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> four-in-hand

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
now you can see that the four-in-hand

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.630 
now you can see that the four-in-hand
knot<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.590> starting<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> take<00:01:26.100> shape

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
knot is starting to take shape

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.420 
knot is starting to take shape
the<00:01:27.119> final<00:01:27.450> step<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.560> bring<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.189> wide<00:01:29.400> end

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the final step is to bring the wide end

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
the final step is to bring the wide end
up<00:01:29.850> through<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.420> loop<00:01:30.509> created<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.590> neck

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
up through the loop created in your neck
