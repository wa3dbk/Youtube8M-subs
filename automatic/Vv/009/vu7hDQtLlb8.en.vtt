00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 and we want to offer you an eye look 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 Inspired by strong girls with a 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 inner fire like the black widow in 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.880
 the avengers or meats in the games of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.199
 hunger we have is your hairstyle in 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.939
 this video we wanted to take all that fire 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.400
 internal those girls so strong and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.400
 transform it into a totally look 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.400
 explosive 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.010
 used in crazy and we're going to take this 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:41.050
 color that is here that is like red 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.000
 brick and I already took it here in a 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.039
 little prince who was wet I want 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.409
 concentrate enough for me to stay 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.110
 towards something well red it was very 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:52.239
 striking on the eyelids so what 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.519
 I'm going to do is concentrate on all my 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.809
 eyelid except the inner part is 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.940
 part is for now I will leave it free 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.260
 but I really want it to be red like that 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.360
 that I'm going to put several layers of this 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.860
 Same color when I have the brush 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.860
 wet looks pretty red 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.190
 remember to do world champions for 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.190
 Concentrate well well well 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.410
 be happy with this red color 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.930
 start blurring those edges so that 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.010
 go away as well as orange that is 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.790
 A) Yes 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.790
 super fire 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.880
 I installed to take him to see if I'm very much 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.299
 in soft black and I'm going to align all my 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.740
 eye on the inside and outside both 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.350
 then lower 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 for I think as well as strong everything 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.950
 Crazy 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.979
 great once we have delineated we are going to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.959
 make a slightly more angled shape 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.959
 with the same eyeliner 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.150
 and I'm going to go up you took the fold 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.730
 for 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 it's more like a kind of guide and I give 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.760
 also a little bit of depth 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.120
 now everything goes to which they are loose 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.520
 cloud in ladies night and take the color 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.320
 black and it 's playing to review everything 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.810
 that is accounting black with shadow 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.220
 black to fix what lasts longer and that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.230
 be more finished because they continue these 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.520
 edges are like bones so I 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.520
 use a brush the angle 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.630
 is doing a thick line in the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.630
 imperial part 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.500
 and of course I'm also going to review 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.260
 this line that I did and they do it a little 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.030
 more but there is a day with makeup 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.349
 to have black then to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.360
 convert as makeup that is going to be 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.360
 black blurred towards red 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.200
 now I'm going to take this same law from there 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.420
 the color gold and with a pincelito 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.630
 small can you know a cotton bud something 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.860
 that is small and I will apply it just 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.860
 here in the lacrimal 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.010
 and then unite like the rest 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.860
 You could leave this in the house and 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.510
 it feels possibly super flashy but 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.390
 I want to add more so to use 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.879
 this money to the club this golden chest and 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.400
 then apply on the inside 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.190
 good integration low attached to 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.540
 lacrimal and I can make several capitals 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.540
 so that it is very striking 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.640
 and in the rest of click in fuchsia 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.799
 and to finish or use the low each 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.829
 flight mania in black mania because it is 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.360
 red and goes with fire and uses it students 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.840
 the upper lashes as in the 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.840
 lower 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.659
 too much color to the lips but if 

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:38.169
 something so use the most txikis in 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.169
 enormous 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.129
 although girls so that 's all for 

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:51.989
 our what inspired in the fire of 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.429
 those guys people with a lot of passion and 

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:55.409
 then transmit this in your makeup 

00:04:53.429 --> 00:04:57.989
 so I hope you'll like that this 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.719
 encourage me to try it please with a shine 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:02.609
 and pretty dark eye is a look like 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:05.999
 very rocker too so they can 

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:07.709
 use them and they go for that wave and I hope that 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:09.929
 they will like memories the products that 

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:12.179
 we use we use two pallets of 

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:14.579
 shadows we all use the crisis 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:16.799
 day and the divine law and we use the and the 

00:05:14.579 --> 00:05:18.929
 our are in soft black the mask 

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:20.699
 volume already on set nor to the frost 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.189
 are the three we use click on 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:24.779
 golden arches and the fuchsia stage is 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.839
 a little bit of color just with the 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.369
 maxi 15 names that is red but what 

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:31.259
 we blink the finger a bit so it does not 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:34.969
 is so red because we do not have the same 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:37.969
 red eyes so that's all the 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.969
 video
