00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
actually going to be built in here so i

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.040 
actually going to be built in here so i
wanted<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.699> actually<00:00:23.850> build<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.240> cathedral<00:00:24.570> but

enough<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.010> because<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> be

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
for the tables with a torch underneath

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.090 
for the tables with a torch underneath
themselves<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.620> show<00:02:47.739> you<00:02:47.799> actually

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
quickly okay so you place a torch and

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.660 
quickly okay so you place a torch and
then<00:02:53.709> way<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:54.100> get<00:02:54.310> my<00:02:54.430> camera<00:02:56.310> so<00:02:57.310> you<00:02:57.370> place<00:02:57.640> a

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
then way to get my camera so you place a

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.000 
then way to get my camera so you place a
torch<00:02:57.970> first<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:58.660> then<00:02:59.230> on<00:02:59.470> top<00:02:59.709> of<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.950> you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
torch first and then on top of it you

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.280 
torch first and then on top of it you
place<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.459> piston<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:02.140> would<00:03:02.260> just

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
place the piston and it would just

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.509 
place the piston and it would just
extend<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:04.049> it<00:03:05.049> looks<00:03:05.230> like<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.380> table<00:03:05.860> that's

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
this is like a huge table in here as

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.250 
this is like a huge table in here as
well<00:03:15.340> thing<00:03:16.299> to<00:03:16.330> say<00:03:16.510> it's<00:03:16.690> waffle<00:03:17.049> it's<00:03:17.140> like
