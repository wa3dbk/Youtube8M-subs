introduction to a log i'm running for
fourth<00:00:06.540> factor<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:07.140> is<00:00:07.379> all<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.429> force

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
one is green tea leaf extra this is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
one is green tea leaf extra this is
their<00:01:18.509> men's<00:01:18.810> multivitamin<00:01:22.040> it's<00:01:23.040> actually

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
their men's multivitamin it's actually

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.640 
their men's multivitamin it's actually
really<00:01:23.700> good<00:01:23.930> ingredient<00:01:24.930> wise<00:01:25.110> i<00:01:25.500> was

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
really good ingredient wise i was

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.969 
really good ingredient wise i was
comparing<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.049> another<00:01:28.049> multivitamin

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
comparing it to another multivitamin

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.870 
comparing it to another multivitamin
just<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.939> sport<00:01:30.420> former<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.880> it

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
just like it sport former be and it

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.819 
just like it sport former be and it
would<00:01:33.060> add<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.930> nice<00:01:34.079> amount<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
would add really nice amount of

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.510 
would add really nice amount of
ingredients<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> glutamine

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:49.510 

this<00:01:43.520> is<00:01:43.670> there<00:01:43.960> omega-3s<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:48.010> then<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.250> is

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
this is there omega-3s and then this is

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.920 
this is there omega-3s and then this is
their<00:01:49.700> pre<00:01:50.000> workout<00:01:50.510> supplement<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:53.630> called

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
their pre workout supplement is called

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.980 
their pre workout supplement is called
body<00:01:54.200> rush<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.920> it<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.850> course<00:01:56.120> stacks<00:01:56.479> with

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
body rush and it of course stacks with

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.859 
body rush and it of course stacks with
the<00:01:57.170> force<00:01:57.500> factor<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.910> create<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.360> nitric

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
the force factor to create a nitric

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.710 
the force factor to create a nitric
oxide<00:02:00.350> stack<00:02:00.710> with<00:02:01.130> l-arginine<00:02:01.570> being<00:02:02.570> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
oxide stack with l-arginine being the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.350 
oxide stack with l-arginine being the
main<00:02:02.869> ingredient<00:02:03.820> I'm<00:02:04.820> going<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.090> tell<00:02:05.270> you

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
main ingredient I'm going to tell you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.500 
main ingredient I'm going to tell you
right<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:08.170> with<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:09.320> stack<00:02:09.619> I've<00:02:10.250> tried<00:02:11.150> our

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
right now with this stack I've tried our

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.780 
right now with this stack I've tried our
nitric<00:02:11.900> oxide<00:02:12.350> booster<00:02:12.740> before<00:02:13.160> a<00:02:13.400> year<00:02:13.700> ago

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
nitric oxide booster before a year ago

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.830 
nitric oxide booster before a year ago
and<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:16.430> was<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> pre-workout<00:02:17.690> it

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and it was just the pre-workout it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.320 
and it was just the pre-workout it
didn't<00:02:18.080> have<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.320> whole<00:02:18.470> stack<00:02:19.000> thing<00:02:20.000> to<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
didn't have the whole stack thing to it

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.810 
didn't have the whole stack thing to it
I'm<00:02:20.720> sorry<00:02:21.020> those<00:02:21.680> with<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.920> force<00:02:22.160> factor<00:02:22.400> in

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
I'm sorry those with the force factor in

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.520 
I'm sorry those with the force factor in
this<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:26.270> did<00:02:26.540> give<00:02:26.780> me<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.989> really<00:02:27.230> nice

this and it did give me a really nice

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.430 
this and it did give me a really nice
pump<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.489> actually<00:02:28.690> liked<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.900> product

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
pump and I actually liked that product

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.680 
pump and I actually liked that product
and<00:02:30.590> I'm<00:02:31.100> very<00:02:31.310> interested<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.910> see<00:02:32.239> what<00:02:32.540> this

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
product is going to do the past the pre

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.360 
product is going to do the past the pre
workouts<00:02:37.340> I've<00:02:37.489> had<00:02:37.640> it<00:02:37.850> had<00:02:38.030> a<00:02:38.950> 13<00:02:39.950> in<00:02:40.130> them

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
workouts I've had it had a 13 in them

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.690 
workouts I've had it had a 13 in them
and<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:44.050> couple<00:02:45.050> different<00:02:45.200> substances<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.430> I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
kind of band right now like in Australia

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.979 
kind of band right now like in Australia
but<00:02:50.870> these<00:02:51.170> are<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:53.180> part<00:02:53.450> doesn't<00:02:53.720> have
