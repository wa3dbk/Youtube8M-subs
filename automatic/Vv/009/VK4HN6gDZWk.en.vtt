00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
first day didn't end very well and so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.990 
first day didn't end very well and so
we're<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> take<00:00:14.099> out<00:00:14.250> here<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.580> test<00:00:14.790> it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
we're going to take out here and test it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.750 
we're going to take out here and test it
and<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.210> if<00:00:15.900> it's<00:00:16.710> still<00:00:16.920> flying<00:00:17.130> all<00:00:17.369> right<00:00:17.580> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and see if it's still flying all right I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
and see if it's still flying all right I
put<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> little<00:00:18.539> bit<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.779> glue<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.560> some

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
put a little bit of glue in and some

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.390 
put a little bit of glue in and some
tape<00:00:20.220> along<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> tail<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.949> to<00:00:22.949> hold<00:00:23.160> some

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
tape along the tail and to hold some

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.660 
tape along the tail and to hold some
pieces<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.900> place<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:25.619> already<00:00:25.920> warped<00:00:26.369> so

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
pieces in place it was already warped so

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.250 
pieces in place it was already warped so
I've<00:00:27.000> got<00:00:27.150> another<00:00:27.300> one<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:27.810> I've<00:00:27.930> ordered

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.110 

all<00:00:57.660> right<00:00:57.870> coast<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.949> clear

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.510 

oh<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.640> into<00:01:03.969> the<00:01:04.089> dirt

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
oh and into the dirt

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:16.859 
oh and into the dirt
someone's<00:01:06.520> weird<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:16.060> I<00:01:16.090> probably<00:01:16.420> should

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
someone's weird well I probably should

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.450 
someone's weird well I probably should
have<00:01:16.900> stopped<00:01:17.320> after<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.770> couple<00:01:18.009> failed

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
have stopped after a couple failed

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.850 
have stopped after a couple failed
takeoff<00:01:18.940> attempts<00:01:19.479> something<00:01:20.320> was<00:01:20.440> happening

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
takeoff attempts something was happening

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.680 
takeoff attempts something was happening
with<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.159> rudder<00:01:21.430> or<00:01:21.729> I<00:01:21.759> don't<00:01:22.149> know<00:01:22.270> what<00:01:22.509> but

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
with the rudder or I don't know what but

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.780 
with the rudder or I don't know what but
it<00:01:22.780> was<00:01:22.869> making<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.350> plane<00:01:23.619> turn<00:01:23.979> I<00:01:24.250> thought

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
it was making the plane turn I thought

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.190 
it was making the plane turn I thought
if<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:24.970> could<00:01:25.090> get<00:01:25.270> it<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.479> the<00:01:25.630> air<00:01:25.780> I'd<00:01:25.930> be<00:01:26.050> able

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
if I could get it in the air I'd be able

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.859 
if I could get it in the air I'd be able
to<00:01:26.290> control<00:01:26.740> it<00:01:27.009> but<00:01:27.909> as<00:01:28.030> soon<00:01:28.240> as<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.509> took<00:01:28.659> off

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
to control it but as soon as it took off

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:30.510 
to control it but as soon as it took off
it<00:01:29.140> was<00:01:29.170> major<00:01:29.590> problems

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
it was major problems

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120 
it was major problems
I<00:01:30.549> couldn't<00:01:31.330> bank<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.930> right<00:01:32.049> at<00:01:32.380> all<00:01:32.590> so

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
I couldn't bank to the right at all so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.770 
I couldn't bank to the right at all so
once<00:01:33.340> I<00:01:33.460> was<00:01:33.490> in<00:01:33.700> the<00:01:33.789> air<00:01:33.880> actually<00:01:34.210> used<00:01:34.570> the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
once I was in the air actually used the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.300 
once I was in the air actually used the
rudder<00:01:34.990> to<00:01:35.229> be<00:01:35.380> able<00:01:35.500> to<00:01:35.590> turn<00:01:35.800> it<00:01:35.979> and<00:01:36.100> bring

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
rudder to be able to turn it and bring

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.190 
rudder to be able to turn it and bring
it<00:01:36.399> around<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:37.000> at<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.630> point<00:01:37.929> I<00:01:37.990> knew<00:01:38.020> that

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
it around and at that point I knew that

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.740 
it around and at that point I knew that
I<00:01:38.500> was<00:01:39.100> basically<00:01:39.550> trying<00:01:40.000> not<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.179> crash<00:01:40.509> it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
I was basically trying not to crash it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.450 
I was basically trying not to crash it
into<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:40.990> trees<00:01:41.380> or<00:01:41.710> do<00:01:42.070> something

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
into the trees or do something

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.460 
into the trees or do something
completely<00:01:42.670> horrible<00:01:43.390> so<00:01:43.929> I<00:01:43.960> decided<00:01:44.350> to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
completely horrible so I decided to

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.800 
completely horrible so I decided to
bring<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.920> down<00:01:45.100> into<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.460> bean<00:01:45.640> fields<00:01:46.149> but

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
bring it down into the bean fields but

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.200 
bring it down into the bean fields but
as<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:47.050> can<00:01:47.170> see<00:01:47.369> even<00:01:48.369> that<00:01:48.580> didn't<00:01:49.030> turn<00:01:49.179> out

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
as you can see even that didn't turn out

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.480 
as you can see even that didn't turn out
so<00:01:49.330> well<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:56.229> problem<00:01:56.560> with<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.890> firewall

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
so well this problem with the firewall

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.050 
so well this problem with the firewall
is<00:01:57.729> probably<00:01:58.270> going<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.659> be<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.869> big<00:01:59.229> deal<00:02:00.060> so

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
is probably going to be a big deal so

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.850 
is probably going to be a big deal so
I'm<00:02:01.149> not<00:02:01.330> sure<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.630> it's<00:02:01.929> repairable<00:02:02.289> and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
I'm not sure that it's repairable and

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.279 
I'm not sure that it's repairable and
I'll<00:02:03.550> have<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.850> replace<00:02:04.119> with<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.720> model<00:02:05.140> the

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
I'll have to replace with this model the

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.130 
I'll have to replace with this model the
whole<00:02:05.440> fuselage<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.340> order<00:02:06.580> to<00:02:06.729> reconnect<00:02:07.479> the

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
whole fuselage in order to reconnect the

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.410 
whole fuselage in order to reconnect the
nose<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.649> the<00:02:08.770> plane<00:02:08.880> so<00:02:09.880> I'm<00:02:10.030> going<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.179> see<00:02:10.330> if

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
nose of the plane so I'm going to see if

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.839 
nose of the plane so I'm going to see if
it<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:10.539> repairable<00:02:11.230> but<00:02:11.410> it's<00:02:12.310> not<00:02:12.520> looking

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.260 
it is repairable but it's not looking
good

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
good

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.380 
good
that<00:02:13.690> did<00:02:13.870> not<00:02:13.989> end<00:02:14.200> well
