 Zoo daily is about 10 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.100
 horses and ponies 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.140
 these four-footed roll on central 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.460
 the streets and all the inhabitants of the city from such 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 neighborhood delighted 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.770
 a horse can kick someone or there 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.780
 something else is not clear what to do because 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.880
 that it is like an animal 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.770
 unpredictable this is firstly second 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.070
 the fact that not everyone is far from watching 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.100
 so that i am sorry under the tail of a horse 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
 I lay a special cape where he is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.440
 everything is doing and therefore the city 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.810
 polluted 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.090
 I am against horses being taken out 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.600
 the city since they scare the children of some kind 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.310
 degrees go messing up the street against 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.200
 to let the horses walk in the middle 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 most of the townspeople are survey data 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.950
 who conducted on the administration site 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 under the central streets of the animals 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.670
 agreed about sixty 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.590
 percent however as it turned out horses 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.860
 asked to leave the city for a long time 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.420
 9 years bow as far as I know already 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.020

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.970
 Yekaterinburg prohibiting movement 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.299
 the area of ​​the city unfortunately 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.040
 inexplicably bodies for us 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.409
 the police have not paid due 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.179
 attention to this problem which children 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.950
 on horseback is possible only on holidays with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.989
 permission of the administration and after 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.610
 animal surveys however no one 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.590

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.760

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.859
 camel to the city is 500 rubles 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.719
