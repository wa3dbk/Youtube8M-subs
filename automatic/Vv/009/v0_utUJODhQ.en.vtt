00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 can hematogen be eaten 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.879
 composition of which contains fresh ingredients 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.130
 of blood 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.440
 what does the mound say about this 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.100
 do you see mohamad when it says 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:20.570
 component of the component is this to me 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.090
 hard it is a moment to understand let's say 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:27.720
 when something contains some elements 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.650
 Yes, here are the elements of what happens in the blood 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.619
 or somewhere will 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.050
 it does not mean that it is for an hour 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.530
 the fact that this is nadya himself was there what 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.230
 we call nadya himself must interfere 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.980
 must account there are things that for example 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 cleansing 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.610
 impossible to clean it impossible 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610
 to clear 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.989
 for example match a call and clean it up 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 impossible to clean about eat things 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.840
 which are not cleaned and if 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.870
 which cleaned for example water even 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:05.850
 no matter what water for an hour 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 topped up there for example this is what we 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 call there this time she she here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 cities here are the colors smells caught up disappears 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.890
 this time this water is purified but 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.049
 others here this liquid you not 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.720
 are cleared so if this thing is there on 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.049
 real circle 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.570
 for example shifted there i may be there 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.400
 some winds her something in the blood 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 must be this vitamin taken from 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.170
 plants from here from here at the meeting 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.630
 so it does not mean that it is nadya 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.299
 and if this crow is really there 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.360
 mixed it did hope then it is nadya 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.970
 and began to consume there remain still 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.250
 another moment about here there are things 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.100
 once which is such a rule from 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.119
 sharia when there is a need when 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.619
 man of a difficult situation they 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.520
 prohibition on doing the same 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.329
 Allaruad 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.240
 city ​​from and if this person is exactly in 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.369
 this situation got where for example it 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.149
 health depends on it here on this 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.780
 of this 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.390
 product replace for example graduate students 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.599
 After all, it is no longer in this case the thickness 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.400
 protect used it so have and a 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.409
 we have for example if u pelt 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 man needs surrounds there is permission 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:30.659
 2 blood is the liver and spleen and 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.579
 and you need to make a liver with this card 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.730
 of course she notices it usually 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.269
 hematogen it is used for people ut 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.389
 who suffer from anemia disease 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.639
 called gave when they have low 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:46.099
 hemoglobin for this is just such 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.170
 format 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.909
 if you are n’t just a good evening 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.670
 grape moranal 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:57.659
 beets and for housing or for example here 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.939
 such things here and if there is for example y 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.250
 opportunity for example dow so replace it 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.049
 must replace them 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.389
 only extreme measures drawn to such 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.040
 things we're talking about as if 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:10.319
 man starves to death from hiv he 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.209

 man dies and it is his life 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.449
 depends on u suppressed just this 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.440
 product 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:21.239
 These are the moments if for example a person 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.970
 eats and something is stuck in his throat 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.340
 there yes here he is choking he will not get
