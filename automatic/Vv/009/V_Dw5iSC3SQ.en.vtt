00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.810
 Hello and welcome to youtube 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.179
 channel of news.de his smart home blog 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.759
 Today we want to see the comet flowers 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.230
 the brand euro tronic introduce 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.230
 it is a radiator 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.720
 Thermostat with bluetooth connection and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.710
 this should be programmer per app 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.710
 we look at times 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.809
 before we combine it only on our 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.610
 install heater and later per 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.739
 connect bluetooth to the smartphone 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.589
 Can the small part as electricity 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.510
 that gets it from two double batteries 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.750
 unfortunately not included 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.879
 are 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.800
 Note from the manufacturer here should 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.750
 Batteries no batteries are used 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.790
 the batteries had to be inserted 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.620
 we first date the date and year 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.180
 set time without much anticipation 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.229
 but you do not have to 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.820
 make the second accurate 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.170
 because who after the bluetooth 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.180
 thermostat a connection to the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.040
 smartphone has the system time that 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.259
 smartphone automatically to the communes 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.640
 transfer 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.310
 what exactly is so great about the soko 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.619
 blood now the heating control is one 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.289
 the areas motto or fastest 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.090
 energy and thus save money 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.770
 the cheaper the components are 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.869
 the faster the amortized itself 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.630
 Use of the comic blue costs us 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.789
 currently about 35 to 40 euros on Amazon 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.530
 and get the comfort we are as 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.569
 We would have to carry a motor 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.460
 can here by app the heating profiles on 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.860
 transmit the thermostat and also 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.390
 Just in time to adjust our temperature 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.680
 depending on your needs 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.180
 as soon as we get the date and the time 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.780
 could have set this up with ok 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.090
 to confirm 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.290
 Thereafter, the valve pin automatically 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.000
 completely retracted 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 This simplifies the assembly on 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.360
 radiator 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 for the assembly of the comet now must 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.930
 first down the conventional thermostat 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.820
 for the best the clammy state 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.220
 completely turn on so that too 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 pen is completely retracted this is 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.660
 it does not simplify disassembly afterwards 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.989
 adapter ring to be screwed in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.310
 the rest of the three adapters support the rv 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.530
 and ra vl 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.360
 so the comedian finally fits all 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.150
 against radiator valves it was from 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.790
 heimeier danfoss honeywell brauckmann 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.380
 or on trial if you ring the adapter 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.269
 Stuck on the radiator valve 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.130
 you screwed the comic blue 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.130
 simply plug it in with a click 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.610
 before installation has the radiator 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.010
 thermostats pin gap rain screwed 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.810
 now the block moves back this pin 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.610
 completely off so that radiator valves 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.560
 is closed on this so-called 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.420
 adapter drive up the thermostat to the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.130
 route must be covered if the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.840
 to completely close the valve 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.270
 open after that is complete 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.190
 ready for use with the wheel you can 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.600
 now on the radiator thermostats themselves 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.190
 Temperature vary as you wish 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.190
 also without a smartphone 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.640
 but we come to the interesting part 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.230
 manually adjust the temperature 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.900
 we can with each radiator must have 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.760
 the combo blue cap can be controlled 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.860
 for that we need the app eur first 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.180
 prog you will find it in itunes as well 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.180
 also in googleplex drum 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.020
 after losing the app loaded 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.790
 you see even more open 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.800
 Components from the portfolio of eur 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.870
 tronic all these components can be 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.730
 control the same app in the first 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.890
 step by step we put it on 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.530
 We will decorate this room later 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.610
 with blue zone in this step can 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.270
 we are already using the computer 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.520
 connect 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.530
 Of course this is important with one 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.959
 smartphone is activated click on 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 add and also connect that 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.880
 Thermostat will come off after a short 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.489
 time to report 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.170
 This time can vary quite a bit 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.209
 is because the bluetooth function 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.250
 not permanently activated on the thermostat 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:05.600
 so that the batteries are spared it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.380
 So there are so -called open intervals 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.760
 So that you are with the thermostat 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.410
 can connect you need another 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.549
 pin in the delivery state he is 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.549
 just six times zero 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.560
 the smartphone features the comet 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.610
 has spend will only times that 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.500
 read data 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.450
 also the system time is now from 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.410
 smartphone if the problems are still you 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.270
 can you do that one more? 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.800
 individual name gives this all 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:44.720
 useful if you have the radiator in 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:46.370
 a room is at this point it can 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.320
 already 2 temperatures define with 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.060
 once the temperature drops to 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.750
 others the temperature at the heating 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.520
 should pay before 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.350
 with a click on the top right 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.000
 if the data from the smartphone now 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.000
 the substrate itself be 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
 Of course, the last will be the 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:08.280
 creates time control in the band 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.500
 At this time, plans can be defined 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.690
 because the temperature should lower or 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.879
 to be raised go to above 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.460
 right on edit and then choose with 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.680
 We know the blood of this water 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.330
 already here you can lower next to the 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.970
 temperatures of heating comfort 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.650
 temperature set that offset this 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.780
 number of degrees would always be 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.030
 if important 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.520
 radiator a bit more colorful or even over 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.990
 Demenzielle between you can he up to 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.879
 define four switching times per day 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.259
 So in four times in which the 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.699
 temperature on the loser 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.310
 set value at comfort 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:43.199
 Temperature arranged with a click 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.969
 top right and the profile is finished 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:47.870
 via bluetooth on the radiator 

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:47.870
 thermostats amount 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.270
 in the app you see now in one 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.130
 graphical overview was the reduction 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.139
 a comfort temperature is set 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.910
 apsec temperature here is dark green 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.540
 marked and the comfort temperature 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.540
 light green 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.680
 if you use the thermostat again 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.690
 you have to dismantle completely 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.900
 Just press down on the club or 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.100
 pull off start to the front 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.200
 that was our video tutorial to the 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.850
 myth thermostat comes from eur tronic 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.160
 the next few days will be more 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.020
 thermostats for the smartphone so test 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.820
 subscribe to the best our channel will stay tuned 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.320
 he liked the video so we are happy
