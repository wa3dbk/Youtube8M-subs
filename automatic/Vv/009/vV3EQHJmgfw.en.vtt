00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello everyone in this video I will talk about 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.390
 how to make one yourself 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 here 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.679
 protective layer for concrete and at the end of the video 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 I'll tell you about why you need it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.560
 protective reinforcement layer and what should 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.140
 be the value of the protective layer in 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 depending on one type or another 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.119
 designs and so look 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.310
 First of all, I grease the pallet with the usual 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.310
 engine oil to solution 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.510
 the depth of the pan did not stick 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 corresponds to the size of the protective layer 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.899
 which you manufacture further i take 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.660
 solution and fill the solution pallet 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.149
 should not be very mobile but also 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.890
 the same time is not very thick important 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:49.170
 catch the desired condition further spatula 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.789
 I smear the solution to form 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:56.190
 perfectly flat top surface 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:58.280
 then take small first 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.620
 spatula and make the separation 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.189
 the resulting reservoir in the transverse 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.229
 I try to make cubes in direction 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 side around three four 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:13.229
 centimeters then take a big 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.330
 spatula and produce separation already in 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.280
 the longitudinal direction is now the most 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.619
 interesting hole prepared in advance 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 wire with an eyelet on the end and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.360
 starting to leave her marked up 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.299
 cubes process pretty routine and 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.729
 may not be so smooth at first 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.540
 how do you want it and experience over time 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.210
 comes a day I get the received 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.950
 the blank as you see the solution is nowhere 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.979
 sticks and 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.070
 well i produce and and division large 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.880
 pieces i refuse about google pallet with 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.000
 using small punch pieces 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.009
 clearly separated by the lines that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.740
 were scheduled trowel not worth 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.079
 worry that there will be a split somewhere 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.680
 in another place this will not happen already 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.110
 smaller pieces I divide handles 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.380
 here I got about 100 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.869
 cubes as you can see everything went very 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710
 quickly very smooth and cubes all 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.630
 more or less 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.330
 on kawai form and last 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 the final step cubes i fill 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.410
 water in order not to dial 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.020
 strength confirmed as it should if 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.790
 same put them under the armature in the first 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.850
 the day that they are likely to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.140
 crumble and aged water at least 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.990
 two or three days cubes 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.870
 will have much more strength 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.220
 where it calmly maintains the weight of one 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.410
 adult man left to put 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.690
 protective layer under the armature and bind to 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.790
 her using wire releases like 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.860
 you see there is nothing difficult to 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.010
 make yourself such here 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.600
 cubes I have nothing against 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.700
 plastic retainers want to buy 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.550
 but they are much more convenient for me to do here 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.010
 such cubes to spend 15 20 minutes 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.130
 time to mold a hundred or two than 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.890
 go somewhere to the store for plastic 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.160
 then from the store to go to their warehouse 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.270
 receive then all this lead home 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.220
 some special materials for 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.890
 no knitting wire 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.720
 anyway she is if this job 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.090
 with fittings 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.910
 cement dipper 3 sand dipper 1 3 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.810
 the solution is prepared kneaded and 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.460
 all nothing more is needed now about 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.650
 why do we need a protective layer 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.290
 fixture and how it should be 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.200
 judging by the name he is protecting something 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.170
 protects reinforcement first protects it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.380
 against corrosion secondly protects against fire 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.100
 besides, a protective layer is needed to 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.490
 to ensure joint 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.620
 joint work of reinforcement and concrete 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:55.020
 protective layer requirements set forth 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.090
 in the bottom reinforced concrete structures there 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.030
 straight there is such a separate chapter where everything 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.560
 detailed four in total 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.910
 Values well 5 behind the scenes if the construction 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.740
 inside the building is normal 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.100
 moisture regime protective layer should 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.320
 be at least 20 millimeters inside 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.680
 buildings but increased humidity then not 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.870
 less than 25 millimeters if design 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.760
 operated at least 30 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.889
 millimeters if this is the foundation when 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.249
 presence of concrete 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:27.590
 preparing at least 40 millimeters but 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:29.810
 that's about the designs which 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.499
 directly in contact with the ground 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.900
 so is not spelled out but on the Internet 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:38.360
 often a figure like 70 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.560
 millimeters that's just possible 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.620
 to navigate furthermore in foreign 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.819
 I met various norms there 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.120
 Here it seems to increase 75 millimeters there 

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:55.370
 55-60 and so on further on protective 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.550
 layer if designs are made on 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.159
 In the factory, the protective layer is reduced by 5 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.680
 millimeters also if the armature 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:05.930
 constructive for example collars in colonies 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.419
 yes i am not constructive 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:12.740
 reinforcement is also a protective layer for them 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:15.680
 can be reduced by 5 millimeters and in 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:18.680
 any case the quantity of the protective layer is 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.639
 should not be less than diameter 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.240
 fittings 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.060
 again from the terms of provision 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.199
 compatibility of reinforcement and concrete 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.389
 childhood from such a small trick if 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:36.349
 let's say the structure is reinforced here 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:40.279
 so here is a bunch in this case here 6 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:43.729
 rods of 8 diameters then protective layer 

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:47.180
 must not be compared with the diameter of 1 rod 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.550
 with a given beam diameter as 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.449
 calculate the reduced diameter must be taken 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:57.289
 square root of the sum of the diameter of all 

00:05:53.449 --> 00:06:00.169
 rods with gear 8 diameter under 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:06.860
 root will be 6 multiplied by 64 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:08.779
 it will be the root of 3 184 in the region of 20 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.479
 millimeters i.e. reduced diameter 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:16.599
 Here is such a beam of 20 millimeters and 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.599
 that's it if we talk about 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.909
 that minimum value which 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.459
 necessary to ensure adhesion 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.559
 This bundle is what you need 

00:06:23.459 --> 00:06:28.739
 consider given diameter and 

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:32.029
 by the way about beam length assignments 

00:06:28.739 --> 00:06:35.459
 anchoring and overlapping length assignments 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:38.699
 for reinforcement bundles but also 

00:06:35.459 --> 00:06:41.189
 not calculated by the diameter of one 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.999
 rod diameter of the total 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:46.979
 beam und this is very important here on 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.439
 I hope this is all given 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:53.099
 method of making a protective layer he 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:55.499
 you will come in handy to save time, we have 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:58.669
 can save money on factories like 

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:02.550
 since you are my only way and 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:04.619
 doing for some reason that's weird what's in 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.740
 Internet and I have not found one at all 

00:07:04.619 --> 00:07:10.110
 video where how to make 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.499
 there is such a protective layer of photography 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:17.239
 about keeping on this I thank you all 

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:17.239
 for your attention for now
