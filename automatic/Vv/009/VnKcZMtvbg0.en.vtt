00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
compression technology the two different

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.870 
compression technology the two different
densities<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> TPU<00:01:53.159> cushioning

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
densities of TPU cushioning

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.630 
densities of TPU cushioning
this<00:01:54.630> isn't<00:01:54.960> they<00:01:55.229> don't<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.369> gray

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this isn't they don't have the the gray

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.700 
this isn't they don't have the the gray
or<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.149> clear<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.570> that<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.930> believe<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.469> said

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
or the clear as that I believe it said

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.179 
or the clear as that I believe it said
in<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.939> but<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.890> blue

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
in here but it is there it's just blue

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.039 
in here but it is there it's just blue
they<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:02.909> made<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.240> all<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.570> color<00:02:03.600> this

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
they just made it all one color this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.410 
they just made it all one color this
this<00:02:04.619> density<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:06.030> softer

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
this density here is a little softer

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
this density here is a little softer
than<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.659> one<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:06.899> I<00:02:07.310> know<00:02:08.310> that's

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
than this one here I know that's

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.369 
than this one here I know that's
probably<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.239> little<00:02:09.629> weird<00:02:09.899> because<00:02:10.140> they

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
probably a little weird because they

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.370 
probably a little weird because they
said<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> has<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.000> clear<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.629> but<00:02:13.170> it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
said it has the clear in it but it

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.180 
said it has the clear in it but it
different<00:02:14.030> densities<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.500> don't<00:02:16.500> think<00:02:17.040> that

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
different densities so don't think that

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.880 
different densities so don't think that
they<00:02:17.610> just<00:02:17.760> gave<00:02:17.850> you<00:02:17.970> TPU<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:19.500> don't<00:02:19.710> come

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
they just gave you TPU it don't come

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.720 
they just gave you TPU it don't come
stands<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.460> TPU<00:02:20.760> gel<00:02:20.970> pads<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.840> lot<00:02:22.320> of

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
stands with the TPU gel pads a lot of

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.950 
stands with the TPU gel pads a lot of
air<00:02:23.730> compression<00:02:24.180> here<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:24.780> I'm

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
air compression here you can see I'm

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.720 
air compression here you can see I'm
just<00:02:25.410> pressing<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.740> with<00:02:25.830> my<00:02:25.890> finger<00:02:26.190> and<00:02:26.220> very

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
just pressing it with my finger and very

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.510 
just pressing it with my finger and very
easy<00:02:27.350> squish<00:02:28.350> down<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.800> air<00:02:28.950> ventilation

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
easy squish down so the air ventilation

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610 
easy squish down so the air ventilation
here<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.880> great<00:02:30.180> I<00:02:30.390> mean<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.290> SureFit

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
here is great I mean the SureFit

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.230 
here is great I mean the SureFit
airliner<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.340> same<00:02:32.520> setup<00:02:32.760> that<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.060> have

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
airliner is the same setup that you have

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.650 
airliner is the same setup that you have
the<00:02:33.420> two<00:02:33.690> vent<00:02:33.900> holes<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.230> back<00:02:34.350> here<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
the two vent holes in the back here and

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.880 
the two vent holes in the back here and
this<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.810> they<00:02:37.020> definitely<00:02:37.260> made<00:02:37.500> this<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> lot

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
this is they definitely made this a lot

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.950 
this is they definitely made this a lot
more<00:02:38.040> comfortable<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.610> got<00:02:39.030> it's<00:02:39.210> very<00:02:39.630> very

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
more comfortable I got it's very very

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.470 
more comfortable I got it's very very
comfortable<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.820> can<00:02:41.970> see<00:02:42.090> they<00:02:42.210> kind<00:02:42.360> of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
comfortable you can see they kind of

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.750 
comfortable you can see they kind of
have<00:02:42.660> like<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.960> triangle<00:02:43.530> hex<00:02:44.100> setup<00:02:44.460> going

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
have like this triangle hex setup going

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.740 
have like this triangle hex setup going
on<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:46.820> it's<00:02:47.820> very<00:02:48.120> comfortable<00:02:48.510> the<00:02:48.660> way

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
on and it's very comfortable the way

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.050 
on and it's very comfortable the way
they<00:02:48.900> positioned<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.640> triangles<00:02:50.640> or<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.850> hex

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
they positioned the triangles or the hex

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.270 
they positioned the triangles or the hex
however<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.660> say<00:02:51.860> they<00:02:52.860> did<00:02:52.980> a<00:02:53.040> great

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
however you want to say they did a great

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.800 
however you want to say they did a great
job<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.670> make<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:53.820> very<00:02:54.150> comfortable<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
job and make it very comfortable the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.510 
job and make it very comfortable the
crown<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.200> a<00:02:55.230> lot<00:02:55.380> more<00:02:55.500> protection<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.100> put<00:02:56.490> a

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
crown is a lot more protection you put a

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.140 
crown is a lot more protection you put a
lot<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.000> more<00:02:57.300> in<00:02:57.930> there<00:02:58.680> but<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.580> has<00:02:59.790> great

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
lot of more in there but it has great

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.750 
lot of more in there but it has great
ventilation<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.230> heat<00:03:01.440> flow<00:03:01.710> they<00:03:02.580> put

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
ventilation like the heat flow they put

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.980 
ventilation like the heat flow they put
more<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.030> there<00:03:03.150> but<00:03:03.300> there's<00:03:03.480> still<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.690> lot<00:03:03.960> of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
more in there but there's still a lot of

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.140 
more in there but there's still a lot of
room<00:03:04.290> in<00:03:04.470> here<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:05.250> can<00:03:05.400> see<00:03:05.520> they<00:03:05.970> have

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
room in here you can see they have

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.090 
room in here you can see they have
there's<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> hole<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:06.810> here<00:03:07.110> prevent<00:03:07.650> for<00:03:08.070> a

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
there's a hole right here prevent for a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.980 
there's a hole right here prevent for a
screw<00:03:08.400> for<00:03:08.550> the<00:03:08.640> whole<00:03:08.730> TPU<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.270> there's<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
screw for the whole TPU in there's a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.790 
screw for the whole TPU in there's a
space<00:03:10.800> all<00:03:11.070> around<00:03:11.520> here<00:03:12.230> for<00:03:13.230> heat<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.680> flow

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
space all around here for heat to flow

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.370 
space all around here for heat to flow
and<00:03:17.060> what's<00:03:18.060> great<00:03:18.270> about<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:19.050> kind<00:03:19.290> of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
and what's great about the kind of

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.260 
and what's great about the kind of
advanced<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.310> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.580> is<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> back<00:03:21.030> here

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
advanced a little bit is the back here

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.500 
advanced a little bit is the back here
the<00:03:21.540> TPU<00:03:22.170> of<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.440> dct<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.150> actually<00:03:24.150> very<00:03:24.270> it's

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
the TPU of the dct is actually very it's

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.140 
the TPU of the dct is actually very it's
longer<00:03:24.780> which<00:03:25.650> it<00:03:26.250> brings<00:03:26.550> it<00:03:26.670> closer<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
longer which it brings it closer to the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.780 
longer which it brings it closer to the
back<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.540> your<00:03:27.660> neck<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.710> the<00:03:28.860> ion<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.370> ion

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
back of your neck I have the ion the ion

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.840 
back of your neck I have the ion the ion
it's<00:03:30.360> very<00:03:30.720> comfortable<00:03:31.020> too<00:03:31.170> great<00:03:31.320> helmet

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
it's very comfortable too great helmet

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.330 
it's very comfortable too great helmet
but<00:03:32.850> um<00:03:33.060> I'd<00:03:33.840> have<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.170> pump<00:03:34.470> up<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.890> reach<00:03:35.160> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
but um I'd have to pump up to reach the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.430 
but um I'd have to pump up to reach the
back<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.670> my<00:03:35.760> neck<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.660> back<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.930> my<00:03:36.990> head<00:03:37.200> and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
back of my neck the back of my head and

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.200 
back of my neck the back of my head and
the<00:03:37.800> sides<00:03:38.070> would<00:03:38.340> squeeze<00:03:38.670> my<00:03:38.850> head<00:03:39.030> really
