00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the last generation of mini so we do

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.099 
the last generation of mini so we do
have<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.460> little<00:00:20.640> bit<00:00:20.820> more<00:00:21.090> passenger<00:00:21.689> room<00:00:21.840> in

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
have a little bit more passenger room in

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
have a little bit more passenger room in
the<00:00:22.470> rear<00:00:22.650> compartment<00:00:22.800> however<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.119> still

a<00:00:24.359> four<00:00:24.750> seat<00:00:25.019> vehicle<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.560> that's<00:00:25.619> why<00:00:25.800> we're

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
a four seat vehicle so that's why we're

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.080 
a four seat vehicle so that's why we're
not<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.160> see<00:00:26.310> how<00:00:26.460> well<00:00:26.640> three<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:27.000> these

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
not going to see how well three of these

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.000 
not going to see how well three of these
fit<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> car<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.410> even<00:00:28.680> though<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> Mini

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
fit in the car now even though the Mini

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.890 
fit in the car now even though the Mini

vehicles<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.329> still<00:00:33.750> relatively<00:00:34.290> small

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
vehicles this is still relatively small

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.709 
vehicles this is still relatively small
as<00:00:34.920> such<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.610> have<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.940> seat<00:00:36.149> moved<00:00:36.329> all<00:00:36.510> the

as such I have this seat moved all the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.180 
as such I have this seat moved all the
way<00:00:36.750> forward<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.559> actually<00:00:37.710> fit<00:00:38.040> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
way forward so that I can actually fit a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.619 
way forward so that I can actually fit a
rearward-facing<00:00:38.550> convertible<00:00:39.329> seat<00:00:39.480> behind

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
me as you can see my knees are very

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.490 
me as you can see my knees are very
close<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> dashboard<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.930> could<00:00:43.290> probably

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
close to the dashboard I could probably

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.650 
close to the dashboard I could probably
do<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.950> if<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> had<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:44.969> smaller<00:00:45.360> people

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
do this if I had to and smaller people

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.450 
do this if I had to and smaller people
will<00:00:46.200> definitely<00:00:46.379> have<00:00:46.710> an<00:00:46.829> easier<00:00:47.219> time<00:00:47.399> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
will definitely have an easier time of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
will definitely have an easier time of
sitting<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.059> passenger<00:00:48.480> seat<00:00:48.719> but<00:00:48.899> this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
that fits very easily back here I didn't
have<00:01:19.560> any<00:01:19.710> problem<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> headrests<00:01:20.850> or

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
have any problem with the headrests or

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.850 
have any problem with the headrests or
with<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> top<00:01:21.689> tether<00:01:21.900> anchor<00:01:22.229> installation

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
with the top tether anchor installation

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.350 
with the top tether anchor installation
in<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.009> Mini<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.759> as<00:01:23.880> far<00:01:24.030> as<00:01:24.090> three

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
in the Mini now as far as three

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.240 
in the Mini now as far as three
passengers<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> child<00:01:25.409> seat<00:01:25.650> go<00:01:25.799> that's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
passengers and a child seat go that's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.740 
passengers and a child seat go that's
really<00:01:26.520> no<00:01:26.640> problem<00:01:27.060> in<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.299> mini<00:01:27.479> either

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
really no problem in the mini either

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.420 
really no problem in the mini either
because<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.439> very<00:01:28.650> upright<00:01:28.950> profile

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
because we have a very upright profile

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.550 
because we have a very upright profile
so<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.880> 6<00:01:30.090> feet<00:01:30.270> tall<00:01:30.450> my<00:01:30.630> hair<00:01:30.869> isn't<00:01:31.049> even

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
so at 6 feet tall my hair isn't even

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.899 
so at 6 feet tall my hair isn't even
brushing<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> ceiling<00:01:32.369> even<00:01:32.490> though<00:01:32.880> our

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
brushing the ceiling even though our

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
brushing the ceiling even though our
model<00:01:33.390> does<00:01:33.600> have<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> optional<00:01:34.409> moon<00:01:34.619> roof

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
if you were a little bit taller you may

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
if you were a little bit taller you may

find this a little bit too compact back
here<00:01:38.430> but<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> real<00:01:39.030> problem<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.600> more<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
here but the real problem is more in the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.020 
here but the real problem is more in the

shape of child seats they're a little

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.690 
shape of child seats they're a little
bit<00:02:43.110> awkward<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.650> terms<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:44.070> general<00:02:44.430> shapes
