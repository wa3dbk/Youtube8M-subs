00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 hello girls welcome to a new 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.770
 series that I'm starting on Wednesdays 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.650
 which is called Wednesday from america and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.230
 many of you are listening to that 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.180
 they want tutorials with mary products 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.490
 Kate because they are the ones who have more in their 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.920
 makeup collection already because they are 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.590
 consultants or buyer skins of the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.079
 mark so what I'm going to do is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.300
 now more every Wednesday for a while 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 obviously I will be lowering the 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.040
 wednesday mary kate where i'm going to 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 download a tutorial a full review or 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 something related to the brand so that 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 you can come back every Wednesday and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.700
 see suddenly some ideas of how 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.949
 use those products that they already have in 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.020
 her makeup collection and that of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.699
 soon they want to give it a little more use 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.260
 I feel that at this time of year it is 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.329
 as we approach spring 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.370
 It's like I want to use 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 more vivid colors is to say then 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.880
 use many neutrals or colors 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.850
 calm in him 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.079
 suddenly with more smoky looks is like 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 in these times I feel like 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:15.060
 use color and in a fun way 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.759
 today incorporate the peak color 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.890
 Bloody Mary Kate on the outside corner 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.829
 of the eye and even line me with this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.079
 color and I feel that it gave a touch 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.299
 different is to say it has color that is 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.369
 blue and maybe not all of us are 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740
 used to using that color in the 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.720
 eyelid however use it from a 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880
 so subtle way in the outer corner 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.710
 of the eye at least subtle to my sight 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.259
 obviously depends on each one's taste 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 but like he manages to make a look 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.599
 funny smoked but maybe not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.970
 extremely dramatic to have everything 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.709
 the eyelid in blue so I hope that 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.289
 like this look I hope you like it 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.049
 this idea of ​​tutorials with products 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:56.549
 doctor or definitely dedicate a 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.649
 day a week to medicaid products 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.450
 I hope you like this idea if so 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.890
 do not forget to give them a little finger up 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.049
 for other people who are 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 looking for mary kate tutorials or that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.500
 are looking for medicaid reviews 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.660
 You may suddenly run into these 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.340
 videos every Wednesday and you can 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.060
 give ideas on how to use those things 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.190
 that you 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.349
 in your collection so girls if they are 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:21.200
 interested in knowing how I achieved the 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.200
 look I have keep watching this video 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.569
 The first thing I'm going to do is apply the 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.520
 Checker in yellow color of Mary Kate 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.209
 around the eyelid with a brush 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.209
 synthetic 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.510
 then I'm going to take the first of eyes and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.790
 with the same brush I will blur it 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.480
 above for the shadow to last us 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.480
 all day 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.730
 before starting with the shadows I want 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.040
 give shape to my eyebrows and for that I am 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.220
 using the pencil in brunet color 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.980
 of medicaid and how can you see the line 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.190
 from the bottom part above and then 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.320
 I'm going to fill in the direction they're going 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.270
 my hair I will leave the part of 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.190
 inside the eyebrows without any color 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.100
 because now I'm going to take this little 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.500
 brush and I'm going to make that area 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.440
 see more clearly to give us a 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.420
 eyebrows look more natural then 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.610
 I'm going to apply this eyebrow fixer 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.040
 also from mary kate and this what is going to 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.340
 help is to stay in place 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.530
 all day now take our brushes 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.540
 I'm going to leave the soy brand 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.850
 all the names of the brushes in the 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.280
 information box in order I will 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.810
 take the color heinzelmann that is a 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.600
 Transition color at least 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.300
 special for my skin tone and I'm going to 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.370
 apply in layers to create that tone that 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.480
 will help us blur the others 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.849
 colors 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.120
 Now I'm going to take a piece of tape 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.760
 adhesive I will remove the heavier glue 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.849
 and I'm going to start applying the color 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.090
 I express on the outer corner of 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.650
 eye this is going to be our base color is 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.319
 to say is what will help us 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.750
 blur that blue color so I'm going 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.060
 to apply in layers and I'll go 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.599
 blurring little by little with the same 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.750
 loose brush of the sojo brand then I'm going 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:16.180
 to take the peak club color and that's the 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.970
 star color of the day makeup 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.100
 today but when applied above 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.800
 that grayish color changes its hue 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.350
 makes it not look so suddenly so 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.900
 dark and so dramatic in the blue color 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.330
 and at least I love him what he 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.669
 it gives me just like the gray color I'm going to 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.220
 blur between each applied I'll 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.620
 apply a little bit more and then I'll 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.380
 blur and that way I'm going to create 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.580
 that smoky look but do not look 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.590
 too dramatic 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:48.740
 I'm not going to take the color this look and 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.020
 kern although it is matte and as is the color 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 almost from my skin tone or maybe a little 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.610
 more clearly that will help me 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.530
 blemish all the edges of the 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.530
 Shade colors that we already apply 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.769
 to give a little more intensity to the 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:08.349
 golden color that I'm going to apply in the 

00:05:05.769 --> 00:05:11.349
 Eyelid first apply this shadow 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.719
 in cream in the color of blonde then by 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.479
 over I will apply the color gulf coast 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:18.969
 which is a very beautiful bright color and 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.849
 which is with the same its tonality of 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.999
 maybe a little peach and I'll go re 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:27.429
 blurring between each application then 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:30.610
 I'm going to take the peak color plus and with a 

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:33.369
 little mary's makeup fixer 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:39.360
 kay I'm going to delineate me with a little tail 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:39.360
 cat without following the line of the tape 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:57.359
 Now I'll apply my mask 

00:05:54.359 --> 00:05:59.909

00:05:57.359 --> 00:06:02.609

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:05.449
 My favourites 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.130
 to give a little more definition to 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.860
 this logo I will use the eyeliner 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.199
 dark of nem that is like a blue color and 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.389
 apply the same shadow club peak for 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.669
 I lost that little clip 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.680
 but anyway I wanted to tell you 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:31.020
 that if they do you get a little bit with that 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.780
 shadow then add a little mask 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.310

 eyeliner in chocolate color and the 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:44.460

 I hope you liked this 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.639
 combination of shadows that at least 

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:55.919
 I especially love this 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.590

00:06:55.919 --> 00:07:00.600
