00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.890 
I see the types of systems that they
have<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.740> place<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.310> feel<00:02:00.520> like<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:01.810> know

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900

where<00:02:02.050> as<00:02:02.170> prepared<00:02:02.590> as<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:02.770> can<00:02:03.070> be<00:02:03.280> if

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
where as prepared as we can be if

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.340 
where as prepared as we can be if
something<00:02:03.700> does<00:02:03.880> happen<00:02:03.990> snow<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
something does happen snow is a

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.249 
something does happen snow is a
different<00:02:05.770> matter<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.670> if<00:02:07.540> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:07.990> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
different matter but if this is the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.410 
different matter but if this is the
worst<00:02:08.440> disaster<00:02:08.979> we<00:02:09.099> get<00:02:09.280> then<00:02:09.519> it's<00:02:10.179> fine

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
worst disaster we get then it's fine

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:17.130 
worst disaster we get then it's fine
making<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.349> most<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.220> mass

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.930 

so<00:02:17.770> you<00:02:17.860> know<00:02:17.980> Deena<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.310> think<00:02:18.580> it's<00:02:18.700> just<00:02:18.850> a

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
so you know Deena I think it's just a

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.760 
so you know Deena I think it's just a
matter<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.270> perspective<00:02:19.540> where<00:02:20.319> you<00:02:20.500> come

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
matter of perspective where you come

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.410 
matter of perspective where you come
from<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:21.069> know<00:02:21.190> for<00:02:21.550> me<00:02:21.730> someone<00:02:22.120> who<00:02:22.270> was

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
from you know for me someone who was

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.900 
from you know for me someone who was
born<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.050> raised<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.440> Boston<00:02:23.740> 30<00:02:24.430> inches<00:02:24.730> of

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
born and raised in Boston 30 inches of

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.699 
born and raised in Boston 30 inches of
snow<00:02:25.090> would<00:02:25.270> still<00:02:25.569> be<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> big<00:02:25.990> deal<00:02:26.200> but<00:02:26.470> there

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
snow would still be a big deal but there

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.470
