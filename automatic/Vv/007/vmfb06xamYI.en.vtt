lamps off an army think man what was the

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:07.839 
lamps off an army think man what was the
password<00:04:06.530> for<00:04:06.859> this<00:04:06.950> okay<00:04:07.280> now<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.459> see<00:04:07.730> this

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
password for this okay now you see this

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.400 
password for this okay now you see this
is<00:04:07.970> a<00:04:08.000> loop<00:04:08.269> I<00:04:08.450> can't<00:04:08.690> remember<00:04:08.900> my<00:04:09.200> password

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
is a loop I can't remember my password

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.690 
is a loop I can't remember my password
to<00:04:10.340> stop<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:11.269> so<00:04:11.599> you<00:04:11.660> go<00:04:11.900> ctrl<00:04:12.349> T<00:04:12.620> it<00:04:12.829> sets

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
to stop this so you go ctrl T it sets

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.699 
to stop this so you go ctrl T it sets
terminated<00:04:14.389> and<00:04:14.569> you<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:15.019> access<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.470> again

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
terminated and you can access it again

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.229 
terminated and you can access it again
so<00:04:15.889> let's<00:04:15.980> check<00:04:16.430> lamps<00:04:18.070> programs<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.700> is

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
so let's check lamps programs it is

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.009 
so let's check lamps programs it is
called

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
called

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.700 
called
this<00:04:22.830> one's<00:04:23.039> into<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.400> start<00:04:23.849> up<00:04:24.590> like<00:04:25.590> you

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
this one's into the start up like you

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.890 
this one's into the start up like you
can<00:04:25.860> see<00:04:26.039> so<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.460> moment<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:27.000> computers<00:04:27.599> shut

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
can see so the moment the computers shut

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.529 
can see so the moment the computers shut
when<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.650> shut<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.009> down<00:04:29.190> and<00:04:29.460> you<00:04:29.490> start<00:04:30.449> it

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:30.539 
when you shut it down and you start it

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:31.909 
when you shut it down and you start it
up<00:04:30.599> again<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.960> will<00:04:31.020> automatically<00:04:31.590> start

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
up again it will automatically start

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.770 
up again it will automatically start
this<00:04:32.069> program<00:04:32.430> so<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.610> have<00:04:32.909> to<00:04:33.060> go<00:04:33.180> I<00:04:33.539> think

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
this program so we have to go I think

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.290 
this program so we have to go I think
it's<00:04:33.919> stopped<00:04:34.919> you<00:04:35.069> have<00:04:35.190> to<00:04:35.280> enter<00:04:35.460> password

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
it's stopped you have to enter password

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.830 
it's stopped you have to enter password
minecraft<00:04:37.250> starting<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.370> OS<00:04:38.729> and<00:04:38.970> it'll<00:04:39.539> give

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
minecraft starting the OS and it'll give

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.350 
minecraft starting the OS and it'll give
