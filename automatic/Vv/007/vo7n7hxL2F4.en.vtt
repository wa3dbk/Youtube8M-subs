pick some of those loose ends and loop
them<00:02:09.630> as<00:02:09.780> well<00:02:10.020> when<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:10.740> comes<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.130> center

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
them as well when it comes to the center

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.860 
them as well when it comes to the center
loops<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.850> can<00:02:12.000> direct<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.480> any<00:02:12.630> way<00:02:12.840> you

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
loops you can direct them any way you

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.990 
loops you can direct them any way you
want<00:02:12.990> one<00:02:13.650> case<00:02:13.890> of<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.160> outer<00:02:14.280> loops<00:02:14.700> they

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
want one case of the outer loops they

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.730 
want one case of the outer loops they
should<00:02:15.150> always<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.720> or<00:02:15.930> read<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.200> center

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
should always go to or read the center

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830 
should always go to or read the center
so<00:02:17.190> I'll<00:02:17.280> go<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.850> create<00:02:18.120> several<00:02:18.630> more

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so I'll go on and create several more

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.260 
so I'll go on and create several more
loops<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:22.500> take<00:02:22.680> care<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> minor<00:02:23.250> flyaways<00:02:23.940> you

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
loops to take care of minor flyaways you

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.880 
loops to take care of minor flyaways you
can<00:02:24.420> use<00:02:24.540> some<00:02:24.750> hairspray<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.500> smooth<00:02:25.800> out

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
can use some hairspray and smooth out

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.900
