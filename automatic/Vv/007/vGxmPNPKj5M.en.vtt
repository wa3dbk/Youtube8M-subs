00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
it's generally all I need four walls get

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.259 
it's generally all I need four walls get
enough<00:03:06.150> paint<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.540> there<00:03:08.150> incidentally<00:03:09.150> you

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
paint on the wall but really you just

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.210 
paint on the wall but really you just
need<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> put<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:19.830> on<00:03:21.650> with<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> comfortable

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
need to put it on with a comfortable

need to put it on with a comfortable
balance<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:25.290> might<00:03:25.410> have<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> pole<00:03:25.920> extended

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
balance you might have a pole extended

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.550 
balance you might have a pole extended
something<00:03:27.030> like<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.350> rather

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
something like this this is a rather

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.940 
something like this this is a rather
short<00:03:28.860> wall<00:03:30.049> but<00:03:31.049> I'm<00:03:31.170> putting<00:03:32.239> enough<00:03:33.239> paint

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
short wall but I'm putting enough paint

in<00:03:34.950> a<00:03:35.220> small<00:03:35.519> area<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.590> start<00:03:37.590> with<00:03:37.769> and<00:03:38.930> then

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
in a small area to start with and then

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.410 
in a small area to start with and then
I'm<00:03:41.010> pushing<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.640> up<00:03:43.640> into<00:03:44.640> my<00:03:44.760> cut<00:03:45.000> line<00:03:45.030> up

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I'm pushing it up into my cut line up

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.789 
I'm pushing it up into my cut line up
there<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:46.290> taking<00:03:46.620> it<00:03:46.709> very<00:03:46.769> easy<00:03:47.250> very<00:03:47.489> slow

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
there and taking it very easy very slow

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.830 
there and taking it very easy very slow
until<00:03:49.799> I'm<00:03:49.920> comfortable<00:03:50.310> with<00:03:50.489> it<00:03:50.690> it's<00:03:51.690> all

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
until I'm comfortable with it it's all

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.280 
until I'm comfortable with it it's all
about<00:03:52.019> balance<00:03:53.630> once<00:03:54.630> you've<00:03:54.750> painted<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:55.109> few

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
about balance once you've painted a few

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.750 
about balance once you've painted a few
rooms<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.920> really<00:03:56.160> get<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> feel<00:03:56.609> of<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
rooms you really get the feel of the

rooms you really get the feel of the
tools<00:03:57.030> no<00:03:57.269> problem<00:03:58.280> just<00:03:59.280> got<00:03:59.400> to<00:03:59.549> be<00:03:59.609> careful

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
tools no problem just got to be careful

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:09.050

your rhythm I'm going to cut in close to
this<00:04:23.580> electrical<00:04:24.090> outlet<00:04:24.450> just<00:04:24.860> using<00:04:25.860> this

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
this electrical outlet just using this

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:37.440 
this electrical outlet just using this

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.870 

now<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:37.990> few<00:04:38.290> minutes<00:04:38.410> have<00:04:38.620> gone<00:04:38.680> by<00:04:38.860> I'm<00:04:39.640> going

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
now a few minutes have gone by I'm going

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.730 
now a few minutes have gone by I'm going

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
to go right back over to where it was

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:54.250 
to go right back over to where it was
and<00:04:42.160> do<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:44.350> back<00:04:44.590> roll<00:04:46.500> nice<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.980> smooth

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.810 

yeah

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820

pays<00:05:03.760> off<00:05:04.000> in<00:05:04.180> the<00:05:04.210> end<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.940> is<00:05:07.120> where<00:05:07.300> it

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
pays off in the end this is where it

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.520 
pays off in the end this is where it
gets<00:05:07.510> really<00:05:07.810> fun<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.470> all<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.520> way<00:05:09.610> down<00:05:10.530> and

gets really fun and all the way down and

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.140 
gets really fun and all the way down and
I'm<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:11.920> going<00:05:12.130> in<00:05:12.340> one<00:05:12.520> direction

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
I'm just going in one direction

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.080 
I'm just going in one direction
I'm<00:05:13.510> not<00:05:13.750> going<00:05:14.050> up<00:05:14.230> and<00:05:14.440> down<00:05:14.940> rapidly<00:05:15.940> with<00:05:16.060> a

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
I'm not going up and down rapidly with a

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.630 
I'm not going up and down rapidly with a
lot<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> force<00:05:16.750> when<00:05:17.170> I<00:05:17.200> do<00:05:17.320> the<00:05:17.530> back<00:05:17.710> roll<00:05:17.980> I'm

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
lot of force when I do the back roll I'm

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:26.900 
lot of force when I do the back roll I'm
just<00:05:19.290> going<00:05:20.290> down<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:25.570> can<00:05:25.720> look<00:05:25.750> on<00:05:26.020> an<00:05:26.110> angle

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
just going down you can look on an angle

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.670 
just going down you can look on an angle
and<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.000> light<00:05:28.240> see<00:05:29.170> if<00:05:29.260> there's<00:05:29.440> anything

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
and the light see if there's anything

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:35.280 
and the light see if there's anything
additional<00:05:32.400> really<00:05:33.720> depending<00:05:34.720> on<00:05:34.810> how<00:05:34.990> warm

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
additional really depending on how warm

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.320 
additional really depending on how warm
it<00:05:35.380> is<00:05:35.440> in<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.710> room<00:05:35.890> I<00:05:36.160> still<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:37.030> time<00:05:37.270> I

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
it is in the room I still have time I

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.980 
it is in the room I still have time I
could<00:05:37.720> do<00:05:37.920> another<00:05:38.920> back<00:05:39.190> roll<00:05:39.460> here<00:05:39.990> before

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
could do another back roll here before

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.740 
could do another back roll here before
it's<00:05:41.110> dry<00:05:41.380> and<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.940> blends<00:05:43.270> it<00:05:43.450> all<00:05:43.540> in

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
it's dry and that blends it all in

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.160 
it's dry and that blends it all in
nicely<00:05:43.990> so<00:05:44.530> rolling<00:05:45.160> your<00:05:45.310> wall<00:05:45.550> is<00:05:46.170> your

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
nicely so rolling your wall is your

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.400 
nicely so rolling your wall is your
final<00:05:47.560> reward<00:05:47.760> but<00:05:48.760> take<00:05:49.000> it<00:05:49.150> slow<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.750> be

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
final reward but take it slow and be

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.870 
final reward but take it slow and be
careful<00:05:50.800> when<00:05:50.920> you're<00:05:51.040> going<00:05:51.070> up<00:05:51.370> to<00:05:51.520> your<00:05:51.640> cut

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
careful when you're going up to your cut

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.590 
careful when you're going up to your cut
