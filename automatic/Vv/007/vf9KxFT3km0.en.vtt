these<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.020> real<00:00:55.559> answers

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.850 

I<00:01:02.990> could<00:01:03.680> go<00:01:03.860> in<00:01:03.980> detail<00:01:04.370> into<00:01:04.580> this<00:01:04.880> book<00:01:05.239> I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
I could go in detail into this book I

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.290 
I could go in detail into this book I
don't<00:01:06.860> think<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.370> point<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:07.760> this<00:01:07.820> moment

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
don't think is the point of this moment

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.910 
don't think is the point of this moment
well<00:01:08.600> what<00:01:09.110> we<00:01:09.320> found<00:01:09.560> is<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:11.680> that<00:01:12.680> was

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
well what we found is that that was

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.340 
well what we found is that that was
exactly<00:01:12.950> the<00:01:13.610> figure<00:01:14.000> that<00:01:14.180> we<00:01:14.240> saw<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:15.080> year

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
exactly the figure that we saw the year

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.320 
exactly the figure that we saw the year
before<00:01:15.700> it<00:01:16.700> means<00:01:17.180> that<00:01:21.070> they<00:01:22.070> sent<00:01:22.430> first<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
before it means that they sent first the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.010 
before it means that they sent first the
instrument<00:01:23.990> that<00:01:24.230> we<00:01:24.890> are<00:01:24.950> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.310> use

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
instrument that we are going to use

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.840 
instrument that we are going to use
second<00:01:27.020> day<00:01:27.200> they<00:01:27.590> present<00:01:28.070> themselves<00:01:28.280> and

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
second day they present themselves and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.100 
second day they present themselves and
thursday<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:30.100> next<00:01:31.100> year<00:01:31.310> also<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.360> out<00:01:32.840> of

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
thursday and next year also on out of

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:42.270 
thursday and next year also on out of
the<00:01:33.260> 16<00:01:33.830> I<00:01:34.510> was<00:01:35.510> there<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:38.030> investigate<00:01:38.150> this

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.180 

this<00:01:43.280> 120<00:01:44.240> meters<00:01:44.540> large

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.140 

80<00:01:48.730> meters<00:01:49.210> wide<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:50.790> hazardous<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.430> binary

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
80 meters wide I hazardous with a binary

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.820 
80 meters wide I hazardous with a binary
code<00:01:55.540> on<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:57.790> you<00:01:57.970> really<00:01:58.150> think<00:01:58.830> this

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
code on it do you really think this

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.060 
code on it do you really think this
could<00:02:00.100> be<00:02:00.130> in<00:02:00.730> the<00:02:00.880> night

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
could be in the night

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.020 
could be in the night
just<00:02:04.070> think<00:02:04.579> about<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:06.759> how<00:02:07.759> difficult

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
just think about this how difficult

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.009 
just think about this how difficult
would<00:02:08.450> this<00:02:08.630> be<00:02:08.840> to<00:02:09.110> be<00:02:09.259> made<00:02:09.500> in<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:10.099> knife<00:02:10.310> I

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
would this be to be made in a knife I

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.920 
would this be to be made in a knife I
don't<00:02:12.019> boy<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.830> this<00:02:13.069> is<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> hoax<00:02:13.930> nobody

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
don't boy that this is a hoax nobody

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.610 
don't boy that this is a hoax nobody
really<00:02:15.530> has<00:02:15.860> proved<00:02:16.220> this<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:17.269> be<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.450> host<00:02:17.720> yeah

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
really has proved this to be a host yeah

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.089 
really has proved this to be a host yeah
many<00:02:18.920> people<00:02:19.280> consider<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.970> too<00:02:20.390> much<00:02:21.069> but<00:02:22.069> I

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
many people consider is too much but I

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.270 
many people consider is too much but I
think<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.760> message<00:02:22.940> there<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:24.349> very

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
think the message there is very

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.550 
think the message there is very
important<00:02:28.360> at<00:02:29.360> least<00:02:29.780> three<00:02:30.290> different

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
important at least three different

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
important at least three different
experts<00:02:31.250> came<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> same<00:02:32.330> conclusion<00:02:33.019> I<00:02:33.170> am

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
experts came to the same conclusion I am

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.570 
experts came to the same conclusion I am
Soros<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:33.980> Spanish<00:02:34.660> we<00:02:35.660> were<00:02:36.130> with<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.220> Bears

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
Soros in Spanish we were with the Bears

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.160 
Soros in Spanish we were with the Bears
of<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.920> false<00:02:39.920> presence<00:02:40.819> and<00:02:41.450> broken

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
of the false presence and broken

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.920 
of the false presence and broken
promises

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.940 

much<00:02:47.650> pain<00:02:48.129> but<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.760> still<00:02:48.939> time<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.650> this<00:02:50.829> is

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
much pain but is still time and this is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.490 
much pain but is still time and this is
very<00:02:51.099> important<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:52.000> will<00:02:52.150> see<00:02:52.299> what<00:02:52.500> believe

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
very important you will see what believe

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.330 
very important you will see what believe
there<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.920> still<00:02:54.340> good<00:02:54.640> out<00:02:54.909> there<00:02:54.969> I<00:02:56.219> think<00:02:57.219> is

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
there is still good out there I think is

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.530 
there is still good out there I think is
the<00:02:57.459> most<00:02:57.579> important<00:02:58.650> in<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.129> the<00:03:00.159> message

we oppose deceive and the conduit is

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.619 
we oppose deceive and the conduit is
closing<00:03:13.329> that's<00:03:13.780> what<00:03:14.079> this<00:03:14.349> message<00:03:14.859> says<00:03:15.670> I

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.140
