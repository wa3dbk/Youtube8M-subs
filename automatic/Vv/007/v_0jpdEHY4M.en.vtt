00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.840

 I'm really cool both 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.909
 A little pedestal is both golden 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:48.409
 Kedomo it's made to this specification that is not out of sister 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.310
 First of all, here is one who uses the Finish Strike Wizard Wizard . 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.409
 If you look closely 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.770
 All the motifs of this style are included 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:01.659
 Well All Dragon is all right though 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.890
 Well I did not see it and next one is here 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.020
 Final Strike Wizard Ring This is the way the camera is used by Sorsa et al. 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.380
 This red is nice 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.590
 The legal administration in the middle is 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.430
 I'm so crazy 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.430
 This is good 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.950
 Then I think that I would like to confirm the voice First of all the deluxe wizard driver 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.870
 I would like to use these two rings to hold 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.870
 First from the Finish Strike Wizard in 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:51.360
 You say you I ring the finish stripe was also light properly 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.360
 Next is this final strike misery 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:12.790
 This is georidine and it's a false voice. 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.110
 Let's continue holding the two rings using the deluxe white wizard driver 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.330
 I would like to 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.330
 At first from this finish strike wizard ring 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 Yeah yeah 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.680
 The Finish Striker Wizard is different from the Wizard Driver. 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.610
 I read the ring 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.610
 Next I would like to make this final strike wizard ring Okada 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.880
 The 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.750
 I hope fine voice parentheses 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:17.290
 The ring also glows red, so this belt contrasts with the color of the ring 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:21.430
 This is a very good balance and very cool 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:26.880
 Then, to reproduce the final battle of the theater version 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.880
 Well then I would like to be together 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.650
 Voice of Nao is is the last in together 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.460
 The explosion sound like Bokan was perfectly matched 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.990
 This is incredible interesting 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.190
 re 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.190
 Oops 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.730
 How was your thank you for watching 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.320
 Here is what I introduced this Deluxe Wizard Ring 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.560
 Car that was super magical battle snow 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:18.220
 Once general sale 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.720
 I think this was the last Wizard Ring Set 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:24.969
 The price is also 1050 yen 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:30.620
 Because it is the same price as the previous wizard ring set 

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:32.569
 Do not and I think whether it not it be better to take in hand to one that does not become sold out 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.009
 So er The next time 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:38.229
 It's early 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:38.229
 Type 2 do 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:48.860
 This is a package Now in the front of the salt of Kamen Rider Wizard's salt 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:54.070
 There is a bt style and a Masked Rider Sorcer here . 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.070
 Here is the 8 final fire appi 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:05.900
 Catcher is the wizard ring two Hey here is not a final strike 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:13.120
 Two Wizard Rings are Two Here are 8 Fees for Art 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.120
 I said that it was a drag, so that's not the end of it.
