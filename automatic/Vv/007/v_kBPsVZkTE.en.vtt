00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.339
 in River City Anniversary Day 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.529
 carioca suffered with the strike of 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.780
 drivers and bus collectors 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.340
 the paralysis left a million and a half 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.900
 people until despair 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.859
 It was worth everything to try to get to 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 job 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.550
 the hair looks hard is it hard is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.460
 disrespect is a piling up of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.490
 people waiting for the first transport 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.489
 relentlessly day and I will be late the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.920
 that was missing on the streets was in the garages 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.530
 the workers crossed their arms to 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 stoppage was decided at dawn 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 some demonstrators took to the streets and 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.510
 forced other drivers to stop the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.090
 bus 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.930
 who challenged the strikers suffered 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.960
 vandalism 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.809
 the reason for the strike salary adjustment of 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.440
 15% and end of double working day 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.890
 without the bus Rio sought alternatives 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.829
 on subway super crowded platforms 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.940
 In the three queues started outside the 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 seasons 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.860
 the vans drivers took advantage of the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.600
 situation up to three times more 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.340
 than normal value 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.189
 so I'm one button and five reais and 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 unreal josÃ© 2 50 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.130
 even paying dearly had people who did not 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.200
 got to travel at lunchtime to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.040
 bus movement in the center has improved 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.930

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.549
 are nearly three o'clock in the afternoon the situation 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.259
 It's still very bad. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.750
 terminal on the side of the 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.119
 passengers are waiting for more than 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
 one hour by the arrival of a bus already 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.380

 guard in the day of commemoration of 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.970
 the river's birthday that the people 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.100
 January I remember your stoppage has 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.100
 expected to end 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.820
 Good night, it looks like the 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.369
 road trade union 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.320
 this shutdown must continue until the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.020
 less next Monday when 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.000
 a new assembly is scheduled for 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.730
 discuss the future of the strike we are now 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.140
 in the terminal in central Brazil and looks 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.930
 only it usually gets full of 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.120
 passengers 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.010
 the bus but at the moment the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.849
 is much smaller than it is 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.709
 habitual 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.109
 altogether a million and a half people 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.530
 are being hampered by the 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:29.769
 76 public network schools 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.989
 also without classes because of this 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:34.060
 strike now little out of a sentence 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.489
 regional labor court which obliges 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.280

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.590
