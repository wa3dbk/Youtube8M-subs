about<00:00:13.360> how<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:15.490> put<00:00:16.490> the<00:00:17.210> Mobius<00:00:17.630> on<00:00:18.369> GoPro<00:00:19.369> two

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
about how to put the Mobius on GoPro two

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.580 
about how to put the Mobius on GoPro two
or<00:00:20.150> three<00:00:21.009> gimble<00:00:22.480> in<00:00:23.480> the<00:00:23.689> sense<00:00:23.930> of<00:00:24.110> giving

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
or three gimble in the sense of giving

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.749 
or three gimble in the sense of giving
you<00:00:24.890> and<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:26.050> position<00:00:27.050> of<00:00:27.200> the<00:00:27.410> of<00:00:28.160> the

you and the position of the of the

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.179 
you and the position of the of the
Mobius<00:00:29.149> so<00:00:29.360> that<00:00:29.480> gimbal<00:00:30.320> is<00:00:30.410> balanced<00:00:30.980> and

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
Mobius so that gimbal is balanced and

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.360 
Mobius so that gimbal is balanced and
hoorah<00:00:32.140> this<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:33.320> what<00:00:33.800> I<00:00:33.829> have<00:00:34.100> been<00:00:34.130> doing

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
hoorah this is what I have been doing

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.490 
hoorah this is what I have been doing
while<00:00:35.300> I'm<00:00:35.450> waiting<00:00:35.570> for<00:00:35.750> my<00:00:35.899> GoPro<00:00:36.860> I<00:00:37.180> will

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
while I'm waiting for my GoPro I will

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.540 
while I'm waiting for my GoPro I will
use<00:00:39.500> them<00:00:39.680> or<00:00:39.800> using<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.190> gimbal<00:00:40.460> I<00:00:40.610> just<00:00:40.880> got

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
use them or using a gimbal I just got

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.910 
use them or using a gimbal I just got
this<00:00:43.550> is<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:43.880> one<00:00:44.059> I<00:00:44.090> got

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
this is the one I got

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.050 
this is the one I got
anyway<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:47.470> looked<00:00:48.470> quite<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.740> lot<00:00:48.980> and<00:00:49.250> I'm<00:00:49.640> very

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.060 
anyway I looked quite a lot and I'm very

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.640 
anyway I looked quite a lot and I'm very
satisfied<00:00:50.240> on<00:00:52.090> this<00:00:53.090> gimbal<00:00:53.420> I<00:00:53.900> got<00:00:54.170> I<00:00:54.500> could

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
satisfied on this gimbal I got I could

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.810 
satisfied on this gimbal I got I could
put<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.980> link<00:00:55.250> in<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.610> in<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.840> description

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
put the link in the in the description

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.110 
put the link in the in the description
it<00:00:58.820> comes<00:00:59.650> completely<00:01:00.650> assembled<00:01:01.090> with<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
it comes completely assembled with the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.490 
it comes completely assembled with the
motors<00:01:02.960> and<00:01:03.369> the<00:01:04.369> control<00:01:04.699> board

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
motors and the control board

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.870 
motors and the control board
so<00:01:06.500> it's<00:01:06.770> essentially<00:01:07.189> plug-and-play<00:01:07.400> I

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
so it's essentially plug-and-play I

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.440 
so it's essentially plug-and-play I
didn't<00:01:08.450> want<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:08.780> mess<00:01:09.049> up<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.970> price<00:01:11.149> I

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
didn't want to mess up and the price I

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.030 
didn't want to mess up and the price I
think<00:01:11.689> it's<00:01:11.840> it's<00:01:12.770> pretty<00:01:12.950> acceptable<00:01:13.570> so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
think it's it's pretty acceptable so

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.170 
think it's it's pretty acceptable so
basically<00:01:16.750> what<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.780> had<00:01:18.380> to<00:01:18.530> do<00:01:18.650> is<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:18.979> put<00:01:19.190> the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
basically what I had to do is to put the

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
basically what I had to do is to put the
modules<00:01:21.080> in<00:01:21.860> a<00:01:22.040> position<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:25.030> is<00:01:26.200> imbalance

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
modules in a position that is imbalance

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.980 
modules in a position that is imbalance
in<00:01:27.799> both<00:01:27.979> axes<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:29.870> came<00:01:30.620> out<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:31.990> taking

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
in both axes and I came out that taking

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.990 
in both axes and I came out that taking
the<00:01:34.570> role<00:01:35.570> axis<00:01:36.380> of<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:36.979> gimbal<00:01:37.310> as<00:01:37.940> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
the role axis of the gimbal as a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.200 
the role axis of the gimbal as a
reference<00:01:38.630> in<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.500> direction<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:41.030> center

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
reference in this direction the center

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.600 
reference in this direction the center
of<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.570> GIMP<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:42.380> Mobius<00:01:42.680> is<00:01:42.920> 35<00:01:43.610> millimetres

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
of the GIMP the Mobius is 35 millimetres

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.380 
of the GIMP the Mobius is 35 millimetres
from<00:01:46.610> as<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.000> said<00:01:47.240> this<00:01:47.420> is<00:01:47.900> axis<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.850> from

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
from as I said this is axis then from

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.140 
from as I said this is axis then from
the<00:01:50.630> top<00:01:53.680> if<00:01:54.680> you<00:01:54.830> take<00:01:55.040> as<00:01:55.159> a<00:01:55.189> reference<00:01:55.369> the

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
the top if you take as a reference the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.870 
the top if you take as a reference the
support<00:01:56.570> of<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.530> Mobius<00:01:57.860> which<00:01:58.580> I<00:01:58.729> use

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
support of the Mobius which I use

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.240 
support of the Mobius which I use
because<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.270> have<00:01:59.540> another<00:01:59.780> quad<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.890> want<00:02:01.189> to

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
because I have another quad so I want to

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.429 
because I have another quad so I want to
be<00:02:01.520> able<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.909> remove<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.390> Mobius<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:02.930> I<00:02:02.960> use

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
be able to remove the Mobius so I use

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.859 
be able to remove the Mobius so I use
the<00:02:03.650> support<00:02:04.070> here<00:02:04.250> if<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.760> take<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.119> rim<00:02:05.780> of

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
the support here if you take the rim of

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.309 
the support here if you take the rim of
the<00:02:06.049> support<00:02:06.380> here<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.899> is<00:02:09.200> 30<00:02:10.159> millimeter

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
the support here this is 30 millimeter

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.039 
the support here this is 30 millimeter
with<00:02:12.319> respect<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.269> centre<00:02:14.569> of<00:02:14.599> this<00:02:14.870> beam

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
with respect to the centre of this beam

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.650 
with respect to the centre of this beam
which<00:02:15.409> is<00:02:15.439> 10<00:02:16.189> by<00:02:16.310> 10

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.270 

and<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:19.650> beam<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.070> centered<00:02:20.580> in<00:02:20.910> the

and this beam is centered in the

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.430 
and this beam is centered in the
platform<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.000> he<00:02:24.120> centered<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:25.020> respect<00:02:25.320> to

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
platform so he centered with respect to

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.110 
platform so he centered with respect to
the<00:02:25.590> axis<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.060> pitch<00:02:28.610> in<00:02:29.610> Biloxi's

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
the axis of the of the pitch in Biloxi's

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.640 
the axis of the of the pitch in Biloxi's
as<00:02:30.270> well<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.770> then<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.220> third<00:02:32.490> dimension<00:02:33.120> to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
as well and then the third dimension to

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.210 
as well and then the third dimension to
get<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.770> balanced<00:02:35.540> balanced<00:02:36.540> configuration

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
get the balanced balanced configuration

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.590 
get the balanced balanced configuration
is<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.430> head<00:02:39.320> as<00:02:40.320> I<00:02:40.380> said<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.710> use<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> 10<00:02:41.340> by<00:02:41.460> 10

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
is the head as I said I use a 10 by 10

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.920 
is the head as I said I use a 10 by 10
millimeter<00:02:42.600> wooden<00:02:43.590> beam<00:02:44.270> but<00:02:45.270> I<00:02:45.300> use<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.900> I

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
millimeter wooden beam but I use it I

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.370 
millimeter wooden beam but I use it I
used<00:02:46.410> also<00:02:47.690> double<00:02:48.690> side<00:02:48.900> tape<00:02:48.930> which<00:02:49.260> is

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
used also double side tape which is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.340 
used also double side tape which is
around<00:02:49.530> one<00:02:49.920> millimeter<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.600> see<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:52.200> and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
around one millimeter so you see up and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.160 
around one millimeter so you see up and
down<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:54.140> the<00:02:56.000> mobile<00:02:57.000> support<00:02:57.240> should<00:02:58.110> be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
down so the mobile support should be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.850 
down so the mobile support should be
around<00:02:59.070> 12<00:02:59.430> between<00:02:59.940> 11<00:03:00.270> and<00:03:00.330> 12<00:03:00.540> millimeters

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
around 12 between 11 and 12 millimeters

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.780 
around 12 between 11 and 12 millimeters
from<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:04.220> platform<00:03:06.050> with<00:03:07.050> these<00:03:07.200> dimensions

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
from the platform with these dimensions

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.060 
from the platform with these dimensions
you<00:03:08.790> get<00:03:10.820> pretty<00:03:11.820> balanced<00:03:12.440> of<00:03:13.440> course<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.830> not

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
you get pretty balanced of course is not

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.010 
you get pretty balanced of course is not
this<00:03:14.820> is<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:16.290> pitch<00:03:16.710> motor<00:03:17.750> has<00:03:18.750> some

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
this is the pitch motor has some

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.380 
this is the pitch motor has some
magnetic<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.980> magnet<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.460> the<00:03:23.580> motor<00:03:23.760> keeps

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
magnetic the magnet of the motor keeps

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.490 
magnetic the magnet of the motor keeps
it<00:03:24.590> from<00:03:25.590> really<00:03:26.840> coming<00:03:27.840> back<00:03:27.870> completely

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
it from really coming back completely

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.610 
it from really coming back completely
but<00:03:28.740> this<00:03:28.920> is<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.150> quite<00:03:30.150> balanced<00:03:30.570> actually<00:03:30.930> so

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
but this is a quite balanced actually so

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.360 
but this is a quite balanced actually so
if<00:03:31.710> you<00:03:31.830> move<00:03:32.040> around<00:03:33.710> then<00:03:34.710> another<00:03:35.040> thing

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
if you move around then another thing

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.840 
if you move around then another thing
that<00:03:35.630> might<00:03:36.630> be<00:03:36.750> interesting<00:03:37.290> for<00:03:37.730> some<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that might be interesting for some of

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.270 
that might be interesting for some of
you<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.150> happen<00:03:39.780> obvious<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.710> the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.310 

cable<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.610> get<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> video<00:03:45.210> out<00:03:45.270> of<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.170> my

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
cable to get the video out of the my

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.320 
cable to get the video out of the my
views<00:03:46.560> on<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.800> power<00:03:46.980> something<00:03:47.940> like<00:03:48.150> that

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
views on the power something like that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.190 
views on the power something like that
meanie<00:03:49.020> husband<00:03:51.080> yeah<00:03:52.670> he's<00:03:53.670> pretty<00:03:54.000> bulky<00:03:54.330> so

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
meanie husband yeah he's pretty bulky so

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.850 
meanie husband yeah he's pretty bulky so
sometimes<00:03:55.650> yeah<00:03:56.640> I<00:03:56.880> was<00:03:57.270> forced<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.690> bend<00:03:58.620> it

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
sometimes yeah I was forced to bend it

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.200 
sometimes yeah I was forced to bend it
and<00:03:59.100> so<00:03:59.340> on<00:03:59.520> so<00:03:59.700> that<00:03:59.820> I<00:03:59.940> can<00:04:00.180> put<00:04:00.990> it<00:04:01.140> where<00:04:02.130> I

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
and so on so that I can put it where I

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.740 
and so on so that I can put it where I
what<00:04:03.210> I<00:04:03.240> want

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
what I want

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.340 
what I want
so<00:04:04.850> for<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.900> quad<00:04:07.290> with<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.800> Kimbo<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:09.350> decided

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
so for this quad with a Kimbo I decided

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.170 
so for this quad with a Kimbo I decided
to<00:04:10.620> open<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:12.200> get<00:04:13.200> one<00:04:13.440> of<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:16.310> movies<00:04:17.310> and<00:04:17.970> if

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
to open to get one of the movies and if

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.010 
to open to get one of the movies and if
you<00:04:18.420> take<00:04:18.870> for<00:04:19.109> example

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.170 

one<00:04:23.970> purple<00:04:24.970> quarter<00:04:25.240> like<00:04:25.449> that<00:04:27.150> not<00:04:28.150> very

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
one purple quarter like that not very

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.129 
one purple quarter like that not very
big<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:30.160> not<00:04:30.310> actually<00:04:30.820> that<00:04:30.940> difficult<00:04:31.139> to

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
big it's not actually that difficult to

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.510 
big it's not actually that difficult to
cut<00:04:33.240> the<00:04:34.590> with<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.620> bit<00:04:35.860> of<00:04:36.009> care<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.729> cut<00:04:37.289> the

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
cut the with a bit of care to cut the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.640 
cut the with a bit of care to cut the
plastic<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:41.380> is<00:04:42.300> is<00:04:43.300> around<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:44.350> original

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
plastic that is is around the original

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.990 
plastic that is is around the original
USB<00:04:44.949> this<00:04:45.580> was<00:04:45.870> like<00:04:46.870> this<00:04:47.020> one<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.580> if<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:48.699> can

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
USB this was like this one so if you can

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.980 
USB this was like this one so if you can
start<00:04:49.389> cutting<00:04:50.310> with<00:04:51.310> care<00:04:52.229> you<00:04:53.229> end<00:04:53.440> up<00:04:54.990> with

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
start cutting with care you end up with

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.390 
start cutting with care you end up with
all<00:04:56.139> the<00:04:56.260> cables<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:57.010> soldering

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
all the cables and the soldering

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.140 
all the cables and the soldering
actually<00:04:57.880> invisible<00:04:58.660> and<00:04:59.050> then<00:04:59.229> I<00:04:59.260> put<00:04:59.560> some

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
actually invisible and then I put some

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:10.610 
actually invisible and then I put some
epoxy<00:05:01.560> so<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.740> it<00:05:03.430> was<00:05:06.210> protected<00:05:08.310> this<00:05:09.310> also

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
epoxy so that it was protected this also

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.820 
epoxy so that it was protected this also
makes<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.770> much<00:05:12.599> nicer<00:05:13.599> and<00:05:14.970> comfortable<00:05:15.970> to

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
makes it much nicer and comfortable to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.430 
makes it much nicer and comfortable to
to<00:05:17.830> pass<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.610> cables<00:05:18.970> through<00:05:19.930> different

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
to pass the cables through different

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.730 
to pass the cables through different
positions<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:24.210> check<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.389> videos<00:05:25.750> I've<00:05:26.500> made

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
positions so check the videos I've made

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.279 
positions so check the videos I've made
with<00:05:26.919> the<00:05:27.130> first<00:05:27.460> test<00:05:28.449> of<00:05:28.780> these<00:05:29.680> people<00:05:30.099> and

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
with the first test of these people and

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:36.090 
with the first test of these people and
yeah<00:05:32.639> thanks<00:05:33.639> for<00:05:33.760> watching
