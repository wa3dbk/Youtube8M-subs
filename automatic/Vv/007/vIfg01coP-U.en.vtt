00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.050
 we saw in the statistics in the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.940
 second time even also decreases 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.980
 the possession that had shown chili in 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.949
 the first quickly before the 10 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.350
 minutes the goal of chile arrives through 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.900
 from his goal-scorer the castle number 18 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.609
 after an error in the barrier that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.900
 opens passes through that space the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.449
 ball and ends up beating the goalkeeper 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.969
 Paraguayan then Paraguayan recovering 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.820
 counter balls that went wrong 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.100
 Chile had the clearest is in the 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.899
 feet of the gómez defense that would end 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.600
 then expelled with the good center 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.420
 again of red of 18 the figure of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.840
 this Paraguayan team here is not when 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.660
 the game starts to turn abrupt to 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.739
 become physically violent 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.080
 Here is the red captain of gomez 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.440
 that goes wildly very hard on the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:03.120
 Chilean player and here a play this 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.550
 lisnovsky number 5 that had been 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.510
 won already a penalty a yellow for 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.700
 claim 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 in this second for a much more lack 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 slight that his the Paraguayan captain ends 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.110
 also watching the fights and then 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.479
 the tie would come here the best player 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 from paraguay this red leaving offers the 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.820
 always changing pace with 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.470
 determination and opening space for 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.720
 that Gonzalez appears on the right 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.060
 after a good center and this 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 that very calmly is a man 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.369
 the ball to the Chilean goalkeeper here is 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.320
 as it comes out of the red pressure leaving 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.789
 men the road always with the brand 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 recorded the change of pace he 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.899
 owns and generates the space by right 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.460
 that is arriving gonzález arrives 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.590
 precisely the ball on him and with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.530
 Much tranquility is man to the ball 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.550
 above the Chilean goalkeeper this is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.440
 one of the auctions he has had 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.910
 Valbuena of stopped ball that has 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.140
 proved that you can hit the two 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.940
 forms either strong or 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.030
 trying with the inside of the foot 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.970
 with n as in the latter and the 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.770
 Paraguayan would appear again Pérez 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.319
 as he did in the game against 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.869
 bolivia in which he scored two goals one 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.810
 of them also head here too 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.970
 attacks well the ball wins over and 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.140
 decrees well the two to one and this is the 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 last the third goal 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.610

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.530
 accumulating men around you and you 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.500
 give the ball to the number be number 8 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.810

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.910
 spiders to it said and maybe it does not hit 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.110
 very well with lots of power with 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.090

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.239
 men on the road accumulating men 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.110
 and so in that way giving space to 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.200
 cardoso that in first with 16 paraguay 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.600
