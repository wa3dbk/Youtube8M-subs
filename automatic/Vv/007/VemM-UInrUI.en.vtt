and it's not with the toe it's the side
of<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.670> foot<00:01:03.910> but<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.960> will<00:01:05.170> be<00:01:05.289> an

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
of the foot but this will be an

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.370 
of the foot but this will be an
interesting<00:01:05.590> one<00:01:05.800> for<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.750> guys<00:01:07.899> in<00:01:08.110> Toronto

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
before Anderson even hits it so he's not
