00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.750
 the risk 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.720
 some even follow the crocodile to 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.720
 do not lose sight of it 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.490
 is looking for the perfect place to 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.490
 attend a trap 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.760
 and even if he finds an appropriate pond 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 the guard impalas give the voice of 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.940
 alarm 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.309
 resound to warn others that 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.309
 stay away from the drinker 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.900
 but with the incessant flow of animals 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.030
 who come to drink soon arrives a 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.030
 copy that has not received the message 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.780
 even if impala perceives something 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.780
 feels tempted by the water 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:51.430
 thirst overcomes fear 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.430
 but it does come prepared for danger 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.710
 He has all tense muscles ready 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.710
 to escape 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.890
 a perfect attack 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.670
 but it will resist the eye of a crocodile 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.670
 for a moment it seems that the impala is going 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.690
 to escape but one leg is dislocated and 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.690
 everything ends 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.480
 the timing of the ambush of 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.879
 ghost was a bit misguided 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.269
 he only managed to grab the impala of a 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.220
 horn and had to give him another bite 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.830
 but in the fight the impala became entangled 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.099
 paw with his own horn and that was his 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.099
 final 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.900
 his death will not be quick the crocodile what 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.830
 will drag to the deepest part of the river 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.830
 to drown him 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.490
 but the crocodile also committed a 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.740
 error 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.250
 he tended the ambush at the sight of his 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.250
 gang 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.870
 and now he has to fight to keep 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.870
 its prey 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.900
 and the boss has also witnessed the 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.900
 operation 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.000
 now the food is yours 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.170
 the young crocodile has no right to 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.170
 oppose the boss 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.060
 but will not voluntarily agree 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.190
 is hungry and stubbornly resists 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.730
 However, it does not have the strength to 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.730
 to compete 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.690
 the rest of the gang fight over 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.690
 take a bite of impala 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:57.270
 they try to hold on to it before the 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.270
 boss start the deadly bearing 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:04.400
 the giant starts spinning and tears the 

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:06.740
 Impala in pieces 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.500
 the members of the gang that endure 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.740
 grabbed may rise with a piece of 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.930
 meat the impala has gone from live animal 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.910
 a piece of meat in a matter of 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.040
 seconds 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.900
 some members of the gang achieve 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.220
 get a bite but the 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.220
 suitor not 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:31.000
 in the lands of the gang hunt a 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.000
 Dam does not guarantee that you eat it
