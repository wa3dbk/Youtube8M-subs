too<00:03:02.090> I<00:03:03.670> think<00:03:04.670> when<00:03:04.790> you<00:03:04.880> look<00:03:04.910> at<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.180> game<00:03:05.360> on

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
too I think when you look at the game on

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.900 
too I think when you look at the game on
the<00:03:05.510> way<00:03:05.690> we<00:03:05.840> played<00:03:06.140> and<00:03:06.410> bring<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.489> nil<00:03:07.640> ahead

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
the way we played and bring to nil ahead

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.400 
the way we played and bring to nil ahead
and<00:03:08.209> they<00:03:08.630> would<00:03:08.780> play<00:03:08.870> some<00:03:09.080> really<00:03:09.320> good

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and they would play some really good

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.640 
and they would play some really good
football<00:03:09.590> today<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:11.410> inducing<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.500> game

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
football today and inducing the game

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.090 
football today and inducing the game
street<00:03:12.920> through<00:03:13.190> is<00:03:13.370> really<00:03:14.000> frustrated<00:03:14.480> and

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
street through is really frustrated and

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.240 
street through is really frustrated and
but<00:03:16.100> that's<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.370> way<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.730> i<00:03:17.000> think<00:03:18.250> we

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
but that's the way it is i think we

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.070 
but that's the way it is i think we
create<00:03:19.519> so<00:03:19.640> many<00:03:19.730> chances<00:03:20.000> again<00:03:20.450> tonight<00:03:20.780> and

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
create so many chances again tonight and

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.320 
create so many chances again tonight and
we<00:03:21.620> only<00:03:21.739> Scott<00:03:22.040> true<00:03:22.280> overall<00:03:23.060> if<00:03:23.239> you
