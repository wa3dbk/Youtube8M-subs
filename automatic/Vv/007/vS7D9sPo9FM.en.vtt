00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:20.510
 event of this level each of 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.910
 the main brands decide to take a 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.949
 complete collection that identifies you 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.060
 because it can be seen clearly by 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.859
 TV 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.660

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.059
 collection of boots and for your gloves 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.160
 some very striking colors blue and 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.269
 orange so that whatever the player 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.579
 that the boot arrives easily 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.329
 visible at any point of the stadium or 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.010
 directly from your televisions 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.480
 as you can check each of the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.909
 three lines of brand boots both 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.039
 the line f 50 the vip line and the new one 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.989
 predator line is represented with two 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.329
 or three models as may be the case 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.940
 to efe fifty two models because 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.500
 presents the blue boot model with the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.350
 small details in orange in the case 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.980
 of the predator with sole sg 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.080
 and with sole fg 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.180
 if we go to the line of the line more 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.010
 classic we can verify that also the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.990
 blue color is the color that predominates with 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.030
 details in orange both in the area of 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 heel as in the reinforced area for 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.680
 minimize the erosion of the boot the sole 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.560
 It is also presented with two modalities 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.840
 talco fg o advise you and if we go to 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.800
 1350 the great novelty is that the color 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 orange 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.910
 earn a little more power with 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.950
 regarding the blue color that I know 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.590
 predominates in the rest of boots and 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.289
 manufactures in two possibilities the 50 s 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.789
 skin or the synthetic f 57 as all 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:38.680
 you know, this guarantees us a little bit more 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.030
 of touch while it is light to 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.220
 minimum weight of the boot 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.420
 also within 50 of us skin 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.570
 we will find two possibilities 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.750
 of sole a sole fg and a sole sg 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.010
 for when the field is softer 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.020
 one of the most important novelties 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.190
 added for this eurocopa is the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.110
 presentation of a new model of 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.880
 glove as you all know the glove 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.320
 response has been a glove that accompanied 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.080
 Most adidas goalkeepers 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.660
 since you have specialized in 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.160
 gloves with his jersey end collection was 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:12.420
 with different cuts 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.920
 since predators the boot that fits the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.020
 Most representative goalkeeper of the brand 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.630
 iker boxes have decided to rename the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.740
 glove responds as endurance predator is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.180
 a glove that keeps all the 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.320
 characteristics of the previous response 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.320
 such as his wristband 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 that we spin around the wrist 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.080
 and it has important new features like 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.800
 example the inclusion of the body of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.750
 neoprene we can see in the wristband 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.480
 and in the part that is below 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.070
 of the back latex the latex continues 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.020
 being latex of maximum adherence of the 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.640
 brand adidas around riding a cut 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.500
 negative that as you all know the glove 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.110
 that the Real Madrid goalkeeper prefers 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.940
 iker boxes for that during this 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.950
 Summer during the 2012 Euro Cup 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.510
 you can see all the players in the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.100
 adidas brand dressed with a material 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.590
 both orange and blue except one player 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.210
 the goalkeeper reference of the mark of the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.500
 adidas brand and practically having 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.630
 worldwide reference is iker 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 that 's why he 's going to have a 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.110
 exclusive color scheme for him 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.490
 and in value to the red the selection that 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.280
 she is currently the champion of europe 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.470
 as you can all see is this boot 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.240
 combines the color red with black and be 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 identifiable because iker boxes are 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.600
 only European player that will fit 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.600
 to launch this combination
