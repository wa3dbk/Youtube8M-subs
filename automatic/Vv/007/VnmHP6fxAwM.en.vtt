00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:11.610
 hi, I promised to talk briefly about 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:13.620
 your book call well see all 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.049
 we know and famous flash new veins 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 advise books we pledge to read them 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.330
 so here's a book challenge this is peculiar 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 flash mob but only for yourself where 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 no one will fit you with a stick 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 says reads consider you like that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.330
 short terms only if your conscience 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.000
 this is a personal matter you choose 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.309
 for yourself topics you choose books yourself and 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.950
 only on your conscience you read 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.160
 All this in time or not the basic rule 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 adding books for book call this 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.600
 what is one topic one book second topic 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.180
 2 books there is nonsense 12 topic 12 books that is 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.370
 by increasing whichever 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
 theme numbering so much you will have to 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.079
 her first time I heard a book call 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 one shot I looked to and on the page on 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.879
 Phoebe saw that there she made her 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.799
 book call where she painted her 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.270
 Topics time writing books that she will 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.420
 I decided to take what is also worth 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.979
 try it because it 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 if the game doesn't motivate me 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.659
 read books too myself I am for sure 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.439
 I must motivate the first topic for me 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 Is called and she I very long wanted 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.400
 read Anna Karenina and did not know which 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.890
 category attributed to this book so 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.270
 decided that let it be alone 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.119
 the only book with a single 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.700
 theme accordingly anna karenina entered 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.520
 I have the first theme in the second theme I 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.560
 decided to bring books that are in my 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 the look seems very similar I once 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.729
 long said that these two books 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.009
 really for me than it is similar 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.970
 random vacancy joan rouling and 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.470
 good mayor andrew nikkola i don't know what 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.119
 these books are exactly the same for me 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.540
 I want to check it so I 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.270
 stuffed them into one such category 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:02:00.329
 called a random vacancy against 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.850
 Good mayor should be interesting 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.890
 The third topic was for me Jane Austen 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
 in fact, here I am cheating a little 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.599
 but because of jane austin's books i have three 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.289
 but in each book there are two 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.910
 the novel 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.630
 and cheated and I did not 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.400
 your side but rather the side against 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.770
 yourself because not educate twice 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.050
 more books but they don't stop me 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.090
 because I have long wanted to take 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.520
 all jane austin novels are primary first 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.910
 two which I read my favorite exactly 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.150
 so I decided to make jane austin not in 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:36.600
 category 6 books and in category three books 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.250
 4 I chose Spain in the first place 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.940
 because I am very interested in this topic 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.190
 I like to read in books 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.810
 spanish books spanish literature i 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.570
 I don't know where I got this love for 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.240
 Spain, after probably with teenage 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.850
 literature books sappho on which he wrote 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.760
 his mist trilogy I decided 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.820
 re-read it the first two books and how 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.720
 time soon comes out 3 book prisoner heaven and 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:06.060
 here I have three books entered 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.720
 the fourth topic is spain and another book 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.790
 I added to somehow pamper yourself 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.450
 a little bit of this topic 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.790
 I had 4 book 5 topics for a very long time 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.190
 I thought like the same five books I choose a 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.360
 then I thought I'd go ask for advice 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.360
 friends and so Ali ulyana aishat 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.610
 Nastya Nyura advised me each 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.730
 book and that I have five books 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.360
 tips and friends 6 topics I chose agatha 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.090
 Christie 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.180
 I could have read much more agate books 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.100
 christie but decided to start 6 not to 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.320
 make it much easier for yourself because 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.330
 that the books of agatha christie are very small 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.610
 easy and would read there very quickly 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.620
 Your book challenge would not have suffered so much 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.410
 although really want to suffer me 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.680
 want some this is such a rush that a 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.540
 I do not have time to read the end of the year but not 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.020
 took about 100 books 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.940
 7 I chose the theme nila geymana because 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.700
 that I have seven on my shelves 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.160
 books which I did not read and which I 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.200
 I don’t want to read anytime soon 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.030
 therefore, well, why is it written down to describe 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.610
 nila geymana in some separate topics 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.109
 when you can put everything together 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.150
 read all his books 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.070
 8 topics 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.169
 and I also thought about it for a long time 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.180
 because it's hard to stuff that already 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.610
 a large number of topics under some narrowly 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.650
 directed the topic I wandered for a long time 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.419
 their shelves and decided that it would be 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.720
 interesting to re-read books which i 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.229
 I love very much that I have not read for a long time and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.190
 so I decided that the 8th theme would be books 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.820
 who I love this genre is gone 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.919
 by the wind 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.680
 these are red black that is all these books 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.690
 which I have long read but my soul 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.870
 requires me to come back to them 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.240
 Soon 9 topic I have it 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.440
 It turned out as a hodgepodge almost 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.770
 hodgepodge 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:01.190
 I again combined the two authors 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.860
 this is my favorite sophie kinsella in sesili 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.410
 Ahern I did not have any books to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.630
 shove all nine at once because 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.510
 of all kinzell shopaholic I definitely don’t 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.110
 wanted i decided to take four ken books 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.620
 whole five books of sesile ahern and to accommodate 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:21.370
 them in this ninth topic too 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.349
 relax in the summer read their fun book 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:28.039
 rest from those difficult books that I 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:32.240
 scored in 8 10 6 ti 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:34.310
 7 topic probably this 10 topic received from 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.110
 me title random books 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.150
 I originally thought that I would read 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.460
 only those who stand by me on 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.650
 shelves reread some this very 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.599
 long time ago but then I decided what was coming out 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.000
 so many new products I just can not stand if 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.430
 I will not read them and therefore I decided 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.260
 cram random books almost half 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.020
 news that came out in the next six months 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:58.039
 to read not only old books but also 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.990
 look to the future so to speak 11 theme i 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.270
 decided to take books and teenage 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.099
 literature and on cold because me 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.139
 a lot of books worth which i bought 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:07.760
 to which I still can’t walk like that 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.729
 as a very large number of them I decided 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.120
 that let 11 of them be in my book 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:15.500
 Of course I’m calling there a little bit too 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.530
 cheated not in my direction example i 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.780
 I took the trilogy house for three end I 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.289
 took all the books of the twilight hunters i 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.570
 took 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.400
 trilogy divergent I took the trilogy 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.300
 delirium that is by itself there 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.139
 fail 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:32.090
 and book 11 is much bigger but i think that 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.159
 they are so light that I quickly them 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.729
 I will read I will not even notice what I read 

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:40.460
 one book and there are 3 or 5 and 12 topics I 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.860
 I decided to make a flash mob because I don’t 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.710
 I wanted to deny myself a flash mob 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.870
 and decided that I would take 12 books for myself 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.460
 one book for a month and bring it in 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.740
 book call so as to combine 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.810
 pleasant with helpful hope i don't 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.569
 I made the right decision with the opportunity to gain 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.490
 a little messy and somehow compressed but i don't 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:00.530
 I know exactly how to tell you more 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.409
 about topics you chose and why 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.840
 I chose them all happened can be said 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:07.550
 according to my book order by order 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.830
 books that are on my shelves 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.080
 because maybe next year I 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:14.120
 choose other topics not even possible 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.729
 exactly what I'll be looking at 

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.840
 any other topics for me to be 

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:22.340
 more fun to play 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.409
 from year to year by itself if you have 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.969
 there are some questions then write to 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:30.340
 comments with pleasure you all 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:30.340
 I will answer all 7 books
