00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.649
 soul is decorating the hotel where 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.620
 works with vases full of 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.980
 still life she needs to fill 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.620
 each vase with a fifth with a fifth 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.580
 from a bag full of still life 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.070
 if soul has four bags four 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.529
 still life bags how many 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.679
 hotel rooms are going to have vases 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.509
 full of still life ok 

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.929
 essentially what we have 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.870
 they are four whole bags of nature 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.060
 dead and each of those four bags 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.220
 that I'm going to put right here we have them 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:42.040
 to divide we have to divide 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.470
 between the total amount that we're going to 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.800
 occupy for a vase that is a fifth 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.380
 for every fifth of the bag we're going to 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.380
 fill the vase then to four what 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.390
 I'm going to divide by a fifth so 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.150
 imagine that here I have one of these 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.100
 bags we are going to take it and here I have a 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.980
 of these bags I'm going to put you right by 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:05.379
 here this bag if you realize it is already 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 divided into five parts let's 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.310
 count them 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.900
 and one part one here two parts three 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.940
 parts four parts and five parts is 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 say that if we want to fill 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.520
 the vases with a fifth of the bag 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.399
 we can fill five vases with this 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.680
 bag full of still life because 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.670
 each vase would have a fifth 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.409
 of the contents of this bag ok this is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.600
 what happens if we look at one of the 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:43.159
 bags but if we have two 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.360
 and this I have another plus three and this 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:49.490
 I have another one to four bags then 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.390
 note that for each of them 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.049
 for each of them five will come out 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.539
 five vases of this five of this 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.479
 five of this and five of this is to say 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.890
 which in total we will be the same as 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:09.229
 four bags that four bags 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.470
 multiplied multiplied by the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:15.440
 reciprocal of a fifth that is five 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.200
 about a good we know that 5 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.100
 about 1 is exactly the same this is 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.330
 the same as having 4 this 4x we have 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.700
 four bags multiplied by 5 by 5 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.160
 that is going to be the amount of vases 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.319
 totals that will come out of each of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.230
 the bags and we also know 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.690
 that 4 times 5 is the same as 20 so 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.670
 we can say that 20 are the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.799
 vases that we will fill in total or 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.480
 in other words 20 will be the 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.819
 hotel rooms that are going to have vase 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.580
 full of still life because of 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.250
 each bag will come out 5 vases now 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.620
 this is a review of a video review of 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:56.870
 division of fractions because if you give yourself 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.510
 account in that video we said that when 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.510
 we have a whole number and what 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.160
 we divide between a fraction is the same 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.890
 to have that whole number and 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.019
 multiply it by the reciprocal of this 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.870
 fraction and remember that the reciprocal of 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.849
 a fifth is to pass the 5 up the 1 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.590
 down and then we saw that 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.390
 divide between a fraction is 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.730
 exactly the same as multiplying by 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.280
 its reciprocal and good in this case 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.560
 we can conclude that we have 20 rooms 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.340
 of hotel with vases full of 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 still life
