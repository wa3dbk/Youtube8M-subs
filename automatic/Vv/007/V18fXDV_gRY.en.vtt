million<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> fifa<00:02:04.049> if<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.619> was

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
million is that fifa if it was

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.609 
million is that fifa if it was
implemented<00:02:05.460> then<00:02:06.000> at<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> start<00:02:06.719> messy<00:02:07.320> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
implemented then at the start messy you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.080 
implemented then at the start messy you
could<00:02:07.799> only<00:02:07.950> list<00:02:08.340> him<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.580> for<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.789> percentage

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
could only list him up for a percentage

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.630 
could only list him up for a percentage
more<00:02:09.569> than<00:02:09.959> his<00:02:10.080> value<00:02:10.470> or<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.739> little<00:02:11.250> bit<00:02:11.370> less

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
more than his value or a little bit less

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.040 
more than his value or a little bit less
so<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.090> could<00:02:12.239> get<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> lowest

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
so you could get the lowest

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.160 
so you could get the lowest
bin<00:02:13.350> so<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.270> causes<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> bit<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.600> problems<00:02:15.990> not

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
bin so this causes a bit of problems not

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.200 
bin so this causes a bit of problems not
only<00:02:16.230> just<00:02:17.070> with<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> traders<00:02:17.850> trying<00:02:18.120> to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
trouble and problems that have been

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.870 
trouble and problems that have been
getting<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.620> background<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.520> server

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
getting in the background so the server

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.540 
getting in the background so the server
and<00:03:21.440> opiates<00:03:22.440> basically<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.310> why<00:03:23.489> it's

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
and opiates basically this is why it's

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.590 
and opiates basically this is why it's
going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.790> be<00:03:23.850> caught<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.209> this<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.420> where<00:03:24.570> I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
going to be caught and this is where I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.479 
going to be caught and this is where I
think<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.989> will<00:03:25.080> be<00:03:25.140> massive<00:03:25.470> problems<00:03:26.160> with

think this will be massive problems with
it<00:03:26.640> it's<00:03:27.000> going<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.360> be<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.840> regulated<00:03:28.680> transfer

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
it it's going to be a regulated transfer

the future therefore affecting traders

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.510 
the future therefore affecting traders
on<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.240> game<00:05:11.450> but<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.410> think<00:05:13.010> it's<00:05:13.220> a<00:05:13.310> positive

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
on the game but I think it's a positive

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.510 
on the game but I think it's a positive
step<00:05:14.060> forward<00:05:14.420> towards<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.530> rare<00:05:16.040> players

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
step forward towards the rare players

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.880 
step forward towards the rare players
keeping<00:05:17.360> their<00:05:17.510> value<00:05:17.960> but<00:05:18.380> obviously<00:05:18.770> not

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
keeping their value but obviously not

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.190 
keeping their value but obviously not
keeping<00:05:19.280> their<00:05:19.490> rarity<00:05:19.940> so<00:05:20.270> say<00:05:20.510> like<00:05:20.780> 15<00:05:21.170> of

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:21.200 
keeping their rarity so say like 15 of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.960 
keeping their rarity so say like 15 of
you<00:05:21.350> have<00:05:21.440> an<00:05:21.500> elder<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:21.950> can't<00:05:22.370> see<00:05:22.580> it<00:05:22.610> sought

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970
