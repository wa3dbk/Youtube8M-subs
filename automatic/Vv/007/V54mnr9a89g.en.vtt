was perusing the minecraft forums which

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.600 
was perusing the minecraft forums which
Jesus<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.370> thought<00:00:38.640> I'd<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.879> a<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.300> so

what is added in this mod there's a good

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
what is added in this mod there's a good
bit<00:00:45.270> added<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.530> don't<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.370> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
bit added in I don't know how to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.979 
bit added in I don't know how to
construct<00:00:47.640> most<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:48.450> things<00:00:48.510> because

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
construct most of these things because

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.910 
construct most of these things because
the<00:00:51.989> forum<00:00:52.949> page<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:54.149> found<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:55.050> didn't<00:00:55.530> have

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
the forum page I found it on didn't have

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.040 
the forum page I found it on didn't have
much<00:00:57.320> like<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> make<00:00:58.680> some<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> these

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
much like how to make some of these

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.399 
much like how to make some of these
things<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.609> put<00:01:03.329> crafting<00:01:03.960> recipes

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
things here but a put crafting recipes

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
things here but a put crafting recipes
in<00:01:05.750> over<00:01:07.790> something<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:09.030> guess

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
in over something I guess

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.240 
in over something I guess
so<00:01:10.430> here's<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.580> sided<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.320> bunch<00:01:13.320> of<00:01:13.409> new<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.070> is

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
so here's one sided a bunch of new or is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
so here's one sided a bunch of new or is
titanium<00:01:14.670> silicon<00:01:15.390> black<00:01:15.659> iron<00:01:15.900> aluminium

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
titanium silicon black iron aluminium

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
titanium silicon black iron aluminium
and<00:01:17.040> titanium

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and titanium

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.700 
and titanium
did<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.630> say<00:01:19.040> okay<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:21.259> these<00:01:22.259> are<00:01:22.380> new<00:01:22.530> ores

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
did I say okay and these are new ores

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.160 
did I say okay and these are new ores
that<00:01:22.830> could<00:01:23.040> be<00:01:23.210> crushed<00:01:24.210> down<00:01:24.390> into<00:01:24.720> silicone

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that could be crushed down into silicone

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.149 
that could be crushed down into silicone
compressed<00:01:25.920> silicon<00:01:26.509> black<00:01:27.509> iron<00:01:28.159> aluminum

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
compressed silicon black iron aluminum

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.230 
compressed silicon black iron aluminum
titanium<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:30.119> goths<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.680> platinum<00:01:31.680> ingots

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
titanium in goths and platinum ingots

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.399 
titanium in goths and platinum ingots
then<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.900> this<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:35.070> GEF<00:01:35.549> workbench

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
then there is this the GEF workbench

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.130 
then there is this the GEF workbench
which<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.740> like<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:39.150> makes<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.509> sound

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
which I like because it makes that sound

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.649 
which I like because it makes that sound
and<00:01:41.720> what<00:01:42.720> else<00:01:43.640> here's<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.729> bunch<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.060> cells

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and what else here's a bunch of cells

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.830 
and what else here's a bunch of cells
g-cells<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.799> little<00:01:47.070> bones<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:48.390> Godzilla

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
g-cells got little bones the Godzilla

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.920 
g-cells got little bones the Godzilla
skull<00:01:51.500> looks<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:53.159> holding<00:01:53.310> this

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930

then<00:01:57.860> who<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.130> curio<00:02:00.049> construction<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.500> build

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
then who is curio construction to build

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.950 
then who is curio construction to build
your<00:02:03.360> own<00:02:03.890> Mechagodzilla<00:02:04.890> pretty<00:02:05.460> much<00:02:05.960> which

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
your own Mechagodzilla pretty much which

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.940 
your own Mechagodzilla pretty much which
I'll<00:02:07.140> take<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.560> for<00:02:08.099> later<00:02:09.319> some<00:02:10.319> plates

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
I'll take one of for later some plates

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.150 
I'll take one of for later some plates
