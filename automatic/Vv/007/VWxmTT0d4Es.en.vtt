00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.240
 what did a flight competition compete with? 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.790
 do automotive 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:26.380
 At the second glance, not so little 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:30.330
 The automotive industry connects surprisingly 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 a lot with the flying colleagues 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.630
 as soon as this motor glider from one 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.180
 converted volkswagen engine driven 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.680
 Mercedes Benz also has a big one 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.680
 tradition in the production of 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.360
 aircraft engines this former 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.490
 Bundeswehr coach was from the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:57.280
 Italian two wheeler manufacturer Piaggio 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:00.020
 developed under the hood a bmw engine 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.239
 the german motorsport championship 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.790
 not here in FÃ¼rstenfeldbruck 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.560
 limited to old aircraft but would 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
 the average age of the participants 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.400
 planes of many automobiles 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.880
 youngtimer events to honor 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.880
 redound 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.900
 the planes are checked the luggage 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.440
 it could be stowed right away 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.440
 start 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.170
 on the 8th 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:34.920
 wind northeast start 03 I hear here 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.920
 I use the motors 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.380
 above the clouds 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.990
 Freedom must be limitless, after all 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.299
 in this case , the limitless 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.799
 Freedom fiction, after all , is that 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.729
 Here is a competition with tricky ones 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.530
 tasks 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.750
 similar to classic cars 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
 uniformity drive , there is a 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.490
 predetermined way in a certain time too 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.140
 fly through problem while there is 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.030
 Of course no roads where you 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.100
 The routes the pilots have to go 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
 first construct on the map 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.409
 technical tools are not 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.750
 allowed 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.920
 gps receivers are sealed and the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 Mobile phones collected 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:21.150
 exactly 30 minutes before each 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.469
 departure the teams receive the evaluation 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.780
 documents handed out 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.799
 and then it's called as soon as possible 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.590
 big to determine 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.659
 This piper has around 50 years on the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.819
 hump the navigator of the team 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:34.500
 full-time tornado flies here 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.920
 martin schifferer faces up to a whole 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.560
 other challenges that appeal 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.090
 Competitions of this kind one only has 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.750
 Half an hour to get the exercises done 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.670
 to solve 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.500
 that means you are already in the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.169
 there is somebody going around giving the plane 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.269
 Tasks from the problem is 30 minutes 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.430
 are a bit too short that is 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.810
 probably one is drawing the 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.280
 card not finished before you 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.459
 ever flown over to the starting point 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.459
 Has 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.660
 the start time is exactly determined who 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 not within these ten seconds 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.770
 anrollt conceded his first ready 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.990
 penalty points and who the route is still 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.830
 did not create it during the flight 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.830
 to calculate 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.200
 as with classic car events, there are 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.700
 also check here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.200
 They are out of the air by big ones 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.570
 letters recognizable 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.140
 we aim the punches the exact ones 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.140
 overflight 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.750
 it is difficult to get the checkpoint up 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.190
 the second to pass exactly 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.000
 after all, you can not be in the air 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.220
 stop 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.370
 and who gets circles instead flies 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.900
 punitive points 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.090
 if the last of around 15 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.290
 Overflowed checkpoints is follows 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.050
 conclusion of the evaluation 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.850
 the exact landing of the times in the 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.680
 you may want to go to one 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.370
 or on our website 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.150
 Information on the topic of air ticket 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.670
 recall 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.280
 Flying is not a cheap pleasure though 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.109
 the participation fee for a competition 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.150
 in the air is often cheaper than that 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.960
 start money comparable oldtimer 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.960
