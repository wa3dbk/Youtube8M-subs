00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.040
 the sports union the palms are 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.950
 qualified for the third round of the 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 The king's cup after eliminating the mallorca 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.210
 match that was played in the book star 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.910
 study and that in fact it was not resolved 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.980
 well into the second half without 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
 goals in the first match period very 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.320
 even with few occasions and with greater 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.960
 ball control box for balear 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.660
 although the arrivals of the union 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.100
 sports of the palms were maybe 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.990
 more dangerous 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.510
 the teams that had already seen 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.450
 they did very few days in a game of 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.660
 the league forward to the end the success of 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.210
 the canaries ended up decanting the balance 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.660
 for the visiting team and what he had 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:50.739
 this first great occasion the set of 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 valeri karpin in the 21st minute and the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.600
 company 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.399
 I just sent the ball out after 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.920
 of a great penetration bringing together 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.790
 four players and getting 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.050
 practically to the kitchen to 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.650
 top high 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.540
 party with new faces regarding the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.450
 last league matches with players 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.450
 not usual here another attempt 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.950
 by the local team with this 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.940
 ball hung by Serbian milan that 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.040
 ends up catching the chaste goalkeeper 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.780
 some opportunities for example in the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.170
 first period for the table 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.799
 grancanario like this shot 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.180
 of Cristian Gómez that ends up marching 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.320
 to the left of the goatherd's goal 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.960
 we are already in the second half that 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.500
 would start with this great action of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.720
 young joseph artiles one of the players 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.960
 most active of the party and that in fact 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.810
 ended up being the warning of what would end 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.450
 occurring seven minutes later in the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.810
 first minute jose artiles and in that 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.780
 opportunity for 0 to 1 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 and in this collective move in which 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.640
 many players touch 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.910
 valerón artiles finishes finishing with 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.210
 left leg to guzmán for 0 to 1 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.950
 it was the goal 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.930
 that put ahead in the score to 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.640
 the sports union the palms were left 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.620
 much party still 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.930
 but the paco herrera set had 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.310
 found the success in a beautiful 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.090
 move 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.340
 where it ends up leaving it practically 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.920
 with interior and assistance benja 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.230
 in fact on top of the union mallorca 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.300
 sport of the palms 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.700
 to try to tie the match and of 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.040
 done ended up scoring two goals but in 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.409
 out of play this is the one that removes the 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.140
 referee for actively in Ecuador 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.530
 of the second period 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.240
 incomprehensible error of the rear 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.730
 mallorquinista that allows artiles to have 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.160
 a new opportunity to put the 0 to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.200
 2 at the end the shot is very soft 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.200
 ends up catching the goatherd goalkeeper 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.430
 michael pereira entered the second beta 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.430
 for the Mallorquinist group too 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.950
 he did saborit and abdón and here a good 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.320
 opportunity for marcovich that hooks 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.070
 the ball sends it out and already in the 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.360
 the final straight of the match would be another young 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.830
 footballer who would also enter 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.950
 refreshment in the second period I read 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.960
 Rodríguez who would write the definitive 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.800
 0 to 2 in the added time of the second 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.870
 half 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.270
 excellent the execution stays stuck 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.830
 the goatherd goalkeeper and the union 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.150
 sports the palms that ends 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.610
 leading the victory with this second 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:52.090
 goal at the end passes the Gran Canaria table 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:55.290
 to the third round mallorca 0 union 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.290
 sports palms 2
