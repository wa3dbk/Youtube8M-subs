00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.500
 Hi, guys, how about I bring you another? 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.340
 episode of the reducer and we go there with 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 episode 7 and we are already completing the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 silver template what is going to be 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.530
 our silver team is still missing 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 a player but well there you see that 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 we sign the great joke 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.090
 this will undoubtedly be a reference in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.789
 my team and you see the statistics of 93 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.320
 shots 70 I think a little more there is that 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.119
 comment on this player that I think I 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.410
 will give a good good performance 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.420
 he also touched me in a so that this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.309
 player script of a Korean information 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.550
 4 new 12 and good 20 enter sell 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.739
 books that brought out about 2000 coins like that 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.699
 and today is going to be a sad day because 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.930
 let's leave behind the bronze team 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.950
 this team that has so many joys 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.830
 dice 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.930
 and well let's finish with a tribute 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.110
 a final tribute for this team 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.080
 let's take the last game and good 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.930
 we have to be seen and against a team of 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.930
 Germans who open me upstairs does not have 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.260
 connect by luck 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.170
 you see in minute 4 terrible shoe 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.840
 of the gabás that great player that good 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.000
 performance has given me 200 coins three 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.440
 Dodge stars an incredible shot of 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 61 that 's a good goal of his in the 16th 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.479
 buying an earwig and pretty cool 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.450
 and good talking about the galaxy of this other 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.780
 player for an entry of another crack 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.119
 huge day to 500 coins with 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.710
 80 rhythm player and one shot 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.770
 spectacular there you see how it defines with 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 quality in the 36th minute the truth that 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.320
 no doubt the two great players of my 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.110
 team have been these two the gavá yes and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
 bruno andrade to make a team of 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.910
 Belgian bronze that the truth is not much 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.259
 where to choose those two players have 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.110
 that being in thousands of teams are 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.780
 essential in my opinion 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.270
 and well without any more we are going to leave this 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.520
 team back with another victory like no 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.160
 the streak is 23 I think and 2301 a match 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.840
 lost and good really good already 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.300
 you know he plays some with the tournament 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.040
 of the e-mail tournament is in this in this 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.400
 account but good would be four parties 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.340
 least I do not care about the streak yet it is 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.490
 pretty good and you can see how I start 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.730
 and put all my 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.650
 I sign the two midfielders 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.840
 that I have I need one for concrete as 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.739
 to complete for the moment I will leave there 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.330
 in the middle of this and that is not bad 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.820
 these two thousand centers are blondel and you 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.350
 point I think it is then in defense 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:44.390
 I have the right side to stop with 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.620
 90 rhythm 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:52.430
 central dong with rhythms 78 I think it's 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.170
 pretty good defense the other side 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.290
 left that you have not seen me 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.959
 to sign him file for about 2000 coins is 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.940
 safari also rhythm 90 I think it has and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.360
 then up Suarez that you have already seen 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.650
 play with the center forward joke 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.829
 Y 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.989
 for the gabás look that I feel sorry 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.450
 replace him I would almost like to leave them 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.000
 playing on this team but good the 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.130
 true that he found another signing that 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.790
 is the ghanassy who is a player 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.550
 of 4 star dribble rhythm 86 I know 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.040
 that as much of the ends equal 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.680
 they are not the fastest because the extreme 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.500
 left could you put to your delicacy or 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.570
 something like that has rhythm 92 73 a 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.010
 What is happening is that I prefer 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.250
 moment to play with the desire and apart from 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.930
 because it's cheaper because 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.870
 I want to take advantage of the four days of 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.000
 irrigators I do not have players with that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.130
 dribble in this team and good I want 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.950
 take advantage of some and the far right 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.390
 it could also be the other one that is fast 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.600
 which I think is called rudy which is 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.130
 Portuguese cousin 90 but hey I think 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.590
 Suarez has better shot and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.600
 let's see how it goes if I see that I do not 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.670
 they are going well or whatever, because I'll try 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.010
 sign those others 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.850
 and well let's find some moral 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.010
 for the team that you already know when 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.740
 there are signings and you put them in staff 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.100
 for the first time all the players 

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:22.230
 they are like now to 80 and good to me 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.860
 I always like to play with maximum 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.650
 moral so I buy there are two letters of 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.920
 of moral plus 10 for all the team of 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.660
 bronze that the truth that they are quite 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.160
 cheap so I advise that 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.320
 complete before because 150 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.260
 two hundred coins 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.520
 and you can have so the team will 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.710
 you have complete by sharon like 99 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.230
 for four hundred coins it's worth it 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.810
 As you can see, I'm missing the midfielder 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.000
 goalkeeper and another central defender although he's going 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.490
 the truth that can be quite 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.620
 well because with rhythms 76 for central 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:03.000
 bronze is not bad at all so good 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:04.440
 I already know what immediately next 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.440
 buy surely be the goalkeeper of 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.630
 silver that I think will be soon 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.310
 call I think it's pretty good with 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.500
 the statistics that look what happens 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.930
 that we're going to do a few more of 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.560
 coins to see yes 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:22.310
 so we can have some margin for 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:26.610
 to sign several already and then it is us to try 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.960
 sign with substitutes or shoot with angles 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.120
 of bronze we will see how the 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.130
 thing depends mostly on the coins 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.750
 what are you doing 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.310
 well you have between another party already 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.080
 first match with this silver team 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.930
 It's my turn against a team like that 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.060
 mixed players of bronze gold and such and 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:46.120
 I make a silver and there I saw the first 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:50.199
 goal with tchité a good shoe and here 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.789
 a penalty from these fifa strangers 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.919
 these that you stay there you give a little 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:57.190
 I think I had it on the butt 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.800
 I was with the quick penalty because I 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.479
 got and good the minute 14 Suarez a goal 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.289
 it's very easy defining with the left 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.749
 with power 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.180
 here if you also defining with the 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:10.699
 left in 32 31 and the truth that this 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.979
 uncle is going to drop a sack of goals is a 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.389
 little unfair sometimes good look once look 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:18.770
 does this do this to me because there comes 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:20.930
 the goal with the midfielder's blog and 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.789
 I had seen that this good guy 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.479
 specifically the youtuber carl freese 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.819
 I was pretty good at feeling the 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:31.159
 far shots in the eleven but good that 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:32.539
 until you try it, you do not give 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.529
 but the truth is that the first shot 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.659
 with him and that shoe with his left 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:39.669
 Well, I think it's going to give 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:41.889
 understand that good player you see 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.809
 560 I have already put 61 with several goals 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.789
 of tchité and others here in desire and a 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:48.339
 good move with some dribbles be 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.349
 taking advantage of its 464 stars and 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:54.009
 ends in a penalty that I will throw as 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.449
 not with my blondel man since he has 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.940
 stuck that zapatazo I think the 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:02.030
 penalty will not take much effort 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.010
 and I'm already 71 minutes 66 going to fall 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.840
 another goal from tchité there defining very 

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.000
 good if you the truth I like 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:10.070
 sometimes unfair to play with him against 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:14.780
 these players why 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:17.510
 the truth three or four goals already and good 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.010
 guys this is today's episode I hope 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.170
 that you like it and you will see some 

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:23.000
 how many matches with the silver team 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:25.490
 when it was complete I will try to get myself 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.140
 to some tournament and nothing else we see in 

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:29.140
 next episodes see you later
