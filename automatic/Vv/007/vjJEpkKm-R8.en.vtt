one of my very favorite places to tinker
around<00:00:17.320> you<00:00:18.310> know<00:00:18.460> get<00:00:18.790> into<00:00:19.029> my<00:00:19.150> little

creative<00:00:20.259> place<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.890> my<00:00:21.400> mantle

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
creative place is my mantle

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.029 
creative place is my mantle
I<00:00:22.060> have<00:00:22.660> several<00:00:22.930> Mantle's<00:00:23.350> in<00:00:23.470> our<00:00:23.560> house<00:00:23.740> and

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039 
I have several Mantle's in our house and

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.390 
I have several Mantle's in our house and
I<00:00:24.550> love<00:00:25.590> displaying<00:00:26.590> stuff<00:00:26.830> on<00:00:27.010> them<00:00:27.189> and

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
I love displaying stuff on them and

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.490 
I love displaying stuff on them and
changing<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:27.970> and<00:00:28.449> change<00:00:28.689> it<00:00:28.810> up<00:00:28.929> again<00:00:29.199> I

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
changing it and change it up again I

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.090 
changing it and change it up again I
think<00:00:29.949> it<00:00:30.039> might<00:00:30.189> be<00:00:30.220> quite<00:00:31.060> possibly<00:00:32.100> because

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
think it might be quite possibly because

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.840 
think it might be quite possibly because
it's<00:00:33.370> a<00:00:33.519> little<00:00:34.239> tiny<00:00:34.480> space<00:00:34.840> and<00:00:35.850> little

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
it's a little tiny space and little

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.360 
it's a little tiny space and little
changes<00:00:37.120> go<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.690> really<00:00:37.930> long<00:00:38.050> way<00:00:38.230> so<00:00:38.829> it's<00:00:39.160> fun

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
changes go a really long way so it's fun

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.190 
changes go a really long way so it's fun
for<00:00:39.399> me<00:00:39.640> to<00:00:39.790> just<00:00:40.000> drag<00:00:40.390> everything<00:00:40.719> off<00:00:40.960> but

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
for me to just drag everything off but

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.350 
for me to just drag everything off but
