just<00:02:20.689> can't<00:02:20.930> beat<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.439> terms<00:02:21.620> of

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
just can't beat it in terms of

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.089 
just can't beat it in terms of
legibility<00:02:22.519> i<00:02:22.760> also<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.959> there<00:02:24.200> that<00:02:24.799> on<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
legibility i also like there that on the

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.509 
legibility i also like there that on the
day<00:02:25.370> date<00:02:26.500> maurice<00:02:27.500> de<00:02:27.680> Moura<00:02:27.859> accused<00:02:28.310> a

day date maurice de Moura accused a

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.220 
day date maurice de Moura accused a
black<00:02:29.269> disk<00:02:30.109> as<00:02:30.819> opposed<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> white<00:02:32.870> disc

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
black disk as opposed to a white disc

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.050 
black disk as opposed to a white disc
which<00:02:33.620> is<00:02:33.769> probably<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.189> obvious<00:02:34.609> choice<00:02:34.819> but

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
which is probably the obvious choice but

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.210 
which is probably the obvious choice but
that<00:02:35.180> black<00:02:35.540> disk<00:02:35.900> just<00:02:36.530> gives<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.920> great

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
that black disk just gives it a great

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.420 
that black disk just gives it a great
designer<00:02:37.700> look<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.780> I'm<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.560> fan<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.950> this<00:02:40.159> thing

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
designer look so I'm a fan of this thing

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.000 
designer look so I'm a fan of this thing
I<00:02:40.609> think<00:02:40.909> it's<00:02:41.030> cool<00:02:41.319> again<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:42.590> comes<00:02:42.890> in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
I think it's cool again this comes in

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.679 
I think it's cool again this comes in
all<00:02:43.129> sorts<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.519> different<00:02:43.579> varieties<00:02:43.909> I<00:02:44.329> think

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
all sorts of different varieties I think

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.259 
all sorts of different varieties I think
it<00:02:44.780> goes<00:02:44.900> down<00:02:45.170> to<00:02:45.400> thirty<00:02:46.400> nine<00:02:46.639> millimeters

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
it goes down to thirty nine millimeters

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.209 
it goes down to thirty nine millimeters
goes<00:02:47.480> up<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.810> 45<00:02:48.349> and<00:02:48.680> there's<00:02:48.799> all<00:02:48.920> sorts<00:02:49.189> of

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 
goes up to 45 and there's all sorts of

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.000 
goes up to 45 and there's all sorts of
different<00:02:49.310> styles<00:02:49.730> hands<00:02:50.329> etc<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:51.500> watch

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
different styles hands etc a watch

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.890 
different styles hands etc a watch
configured<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.120> would<00:02:53.329> probably<00:02:53.569> be

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
configured like this would probably be

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.379 
configured like this would probably be
in<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.379> 1600<00:02:55.280> dollar<00:02:55.489> to<00:02:55.760> eighteen<00:02:56.090> hundred

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
in the 1600 dollar to eighteen hundred

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:58.629 
in the 1600 dollar to eighteen hundred
dollar<00:02:56.540> range<00:02:56.870> so<00:02:57.500> definitely<00:02:58.250> not<00:02:58.430> too

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
dollar range so definitely not too

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.879 
dollar range so definitely not too
