00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.880
 at 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:26.250
 hey you hi everyone welcome 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.990
 on this video 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.610
 I hope you're doing well 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.930
 find for a second video tonight 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.460
 here I am explaining to you why everything 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.540
 simply because I actually 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.010
 realized that there was a lot of 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.690
 people especially on twitter who was 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.970
 fell on the same source as me so 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 they did not do it necessarily but 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.530
 they managed to find the same source 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 than me for exotic equipment 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.609
 of the next dlc so here I have him 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.590
 just my precedes take out the videos 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.449
 tonight so just the three 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.699
 videos on the program tonight that are going 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.649
 arrive in the coming hours there 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 will be the exotic equipment of 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.089
 the organist the exotic equipment the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.550
 hunter and exotic equipment the 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.019
 titan for the next dlc home of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 wolves so on a music that will come out 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.659
 March 10, 2015 so in two months 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.610
 so here I am able to give you 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.290
 my source also also so my sister 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.800
 was simply destiny tracker 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 point com here and in this video I 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.000
 so let's start with the first 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.260
 character so the arcane east then these 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.810
 equipment as usual will be 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.980
 added either in black or with a small 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.200
 Hopefully in an angle g 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.990
 or even in multi or at the end 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.010
 a lasso so that's the nice bow 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.720
 thomas just like simply 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.100
 started with the helmet so really a 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.840
 very pretty headphone that looks like 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.090
 last dlc helmet I forgot his 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.920
 name I'm really sorry the headphones 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170
 his last dlc was in black and the one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.250
 so it's going to be white 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.580
 graphically it's exactly the same 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 so that's the big peculiarity of this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.790
 helmet that's going to allow to 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.230
 to disorient enemies when 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.330
 uses radiance and when one is 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.530
 near death so here it is with 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.360
 something that will allow us to 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.690
 survive here frankly it's a 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.790
 very good ability I find the second 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.070
 of equipment for the bow to nice tsetse 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.020
 gauntlet so and looks great and 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.009
 solar it's called here it is I'm going 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.119
 not tell you the name you see it at 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.129
 the screen I really speak very badly 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.220
 English so I have not told you that but 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.260
 this is the main capacity of these 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.610
 gloves is actually they will grant 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.550
 a shield 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.200
 when light flight is activated then the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.370
 flight is I'm sorry I have not found 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.330
 what did it mean so he a 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.250
 relationship with light 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.860
 so maybe with solar doctrine 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.640
 I think here is if you ever 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.990
 know what that means 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.060
 do not hesitate handcuffed into 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.350
 comments people see there is the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.660
 third and last equipment 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.130
 so it's a chest here is really very 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.110
 pretty suggest they are called corey 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.450
 perry firewalls here is excuse me for 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.220
 my english really disgusting you 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.870
 see really pretty white me 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.490
 I find it super beautiful hyper class 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.030
 but frankly that I can not wait 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.460
 disgust 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.750
 you know I think since the time that 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.520
 I am really a fan of the arcane east 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.020
 it's one of my favorite characters and 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.500
 I think this europe is really 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.940
 very pretty 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.520
 so that's the 2.7 main capacity 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.320
 this torso is that enemies killed with 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.030
 fire effects and so explodes again 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.130
 a relationship with solar doctrine 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.720
 so I do not know if it's still 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.490
 to activate the radiance or kill with 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.570
 a grenade or a punch but 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.120
 always is it always a 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.790
 relationship with with solar doctrine 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.459
 here we can see that there 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.050
 will still have no exotic boots 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.520
 for the arcane east there was none on 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.990
 the last dlc he will not have either 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.190
 on the next one here I find it 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.660
 pity I would have liked to have a 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.010
 small a little pair of boots 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.030
 exotic but hey it's like that I 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.400
 think it will take a little longer 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.900
 late and the end of this video I hope 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.670
 I liked you I find you 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.709
 as I tell you very quickly for the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.050
 videos about the organist on the hunter 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.830
 forgiveness and on the titan was not hesitating to me 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.360
 tell what you think of these 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.410
 equipment in the comments as to 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.220
 to me I leave you I wish you to 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.850
 all a good evening 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.850
 ciao people
