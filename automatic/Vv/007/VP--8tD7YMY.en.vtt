00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
little bit of mean excitement would see

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.930 
little bit of mean excitement would see
how<00:03:23.810> of<00:03:23.959> course<00:03:24.140> in<00:03:24.560> the<00:03:24.770> industry<00:03:25.190> in<00:03:25.730> Japan

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
how of course in the industry in Japan

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.180 
how of course in the industry in Japan
and<00:03:26.450> then<00:03:26.570> chilly<00:03:26.810> weather<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:27.800> the<00:03:27.860> factory

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
and then chilly weather in the factory

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.640 
and then chilly weather in the factory
situation<00:03:28.730> they<00:03:28.820> use<00:03:28.940> this<00:03:29.120> time<00:03:29.330> and<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.170> goes

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
situation they use this time and it goes

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.400 
situation they use this time and it goes
into<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.040> animal<00:03:31.400> you<00:03:31.730> squeeze<00:03:32.030> it<00:03:32.239> out<00:03:32.900> pops

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
into the animal you squeeze it out pops

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.310 
into the animal you squeeze it out pops
open<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:33.950> they<00:03:34.489> were<00:03:34.520> going<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.270> occur<00:03:36.020> on<00:03:36.170> an

assembly line and this end

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.350 
assembly line and this end
faster<00:03:39.090> under-confident<00:03:40.560> they<00:03:41.560> use<00:03:41.680> this<00:03:41.890> one

faster under-confident they use this one

faster under-confident they use this one
some<00:03:43.360> people<00:03:43.390> refer<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:43.870> it<00:03:44.110> as<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.319> polished

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
some people refer to it as a polished

some people refer to it as a polished
another<00:03:45.550> way<00:03:45.900> you<00:03:46.900> just<00:03:47.080> put<00:03:47.290> it<00:03:47.410> in<00:03:47.530> there<00:03:48.360> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
another way you just put it in there and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.960 
another way you just put it in there and
you<00:03:49.600> squeeze<00:03:49.900> see<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.500> don't<00:03:51.430> know<00:03:51.490> you<00:03:51.760> want<00:03:51.940> to

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
you squeeze see I don't know you want to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.490 
you squeeze see I don't know you want to
be<00:03:52.060> very<00:03:52.240> strong<00:03:52.569> for<00:03:52.600> this<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:53.020> my<00:03:53.140> opinion

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
be very strong for this in my opinion

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.350 
be very strong for this in my opinion
and<00:03:54.190> I'm<00:03:54.310> probably<00:03:54.520> not<00:03:54.730> strong<00:03:54.880> enough<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.150> do

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
and I'm probably not strong enough to do

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.760 
and I'm probably not strong enough to do
it<00:03:55.480> so<00:03:56.069> it<00:03:57.069> takes<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.370> top<00:03:57.550> off<00:03:58.170> and<00:03:59.170> expose<00:03:59.560> ya

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
it so it takes the top off and expose ya

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:00.960 
it so it takes the top off and expose ya
know<00:03:59.830> if<00:04:00.040> you<00:04:00.130> try<00:04:00.280> to<00:04:00.340> open<00:04:00.550> this<00:04:00.640> know<00:04:00.819> where

know if you try to open this know where

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.559 
know if you try to open this know where
the<00:04:01.060> scissors<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.760> just<00:04:06.970> like<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.239> open

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
the scissors and it's just like to open

watch it with weird on the shore you see

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.819 
watch it with weird on the shore you see
the<00:04:19.239> way<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.480> is<00:04:19.600> all<00:04:19.989> these<00:04:20.109> got<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.380> piece<00:04:20.650> of

the way it is all these got a piece of

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.560 
the way it is all these got a piece of
residue<00:04:21.280> or<00:04:21.430> actually<00:04:21.730> seaweed<00:04:22.120> compressed

seaweed where the animal is chewed is
various<00:04:25.150> food<00:04:25.390> and<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:25.810> that's<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:27.160> going

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
various food and just that's it's going

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.740 
various food and just that's it's going
through<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.730> system<00:04:27.940> that<00:04:28.270> comes<00:04:28.450> out<00:04:28.570> like

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
through the system that comes out like

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.170 
through the system that comes out like
that<00:04:28.900> in<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.200> end<00:04:29.550> almost<00:04:30.550> don't<00:04:30.669> touch<00:04:30.910> but

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
that in the end almost don't touch but

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.670 
that in the end almost don't touch but
just<00:04:31.330> takes<00:04:31.540> it<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.720> necessary<00:04:32.200> nutrients

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
just takes it to necessary nutrients

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.950 
just takes it to necessary nutrients
from<00:04:32.740> a<00:04:32.860> dirty<00:04:33.070> once<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.300> what's<00:04:34.479> left<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.870> is

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
from a dirty once and what's left and is

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.210 
from a dirty once and what's left and is
good<00:04:35.140> for<00:04:35.169> all<00:04:35.380> the<00:04:35.470> other<00:04:35.590> creatures<00:04:35.800> are<00:04:36.100> on

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
good for all the other creatures are on

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.879 
good for all the other creatures are on
them<00:04:36.370> that<00:04:36.490> they<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.760> be<00:04:36.930> it<00:04:37.930> is<00:04:38.169> working<00:04:38.590> it

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
them that they can be it is working it

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.670 
them that they can be it is working it
is<00:04:39.070> working<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.700> very<00:04:40.150> very<00:04:40.389> slowly<00:04:40.720> it'll

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
is working and very very slowly it'll

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.770 
is working and very very slowly it'll
get<00:04:41.919> back<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.280> stage<00:04:42.520> hopefully<00:04:43.210> there<00:04:43.690> it

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
get back to the stage hopefully there it

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.570 
get back to the stage hopefully there it
was<00:04:43.900> one<00:04:44.140> time<00:04:44.320> but<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.950> took<00:04:45.100> millions<00:04:45.280> of

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
was one time but it took millions of

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.190 
was one time but it took millions of
years<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:46.000> put<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.300> at<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.540> stage<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.110> it

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
years to put it at the stage but but it

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.380 
years to put it at the stage but but it
was<00:04:47.320> at<00:04:47.470> one<00:04:47.650> time<00:04:47.680> it<00:04:48.340> took<00:04:48.490> man<00:04:48.729> ten<00:04:49.000> years<00:04:49.270> to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
was at one time it took man ten years to

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:51.990 
was at one time it took man ten years to
way<00:04:49.479> below<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.470> maybe<00:04:51.280> that<00:04:51.490> means<00:04:51.610> man<00:04:51.850> is

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
way below so maybe that means man is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.130 
way below so maybe that means man is
quicker<00:04:52.240> than<00:04:52.330> nature<00:04:54.479> and<00:04:55.479> hopefully<00:04:55.900> we<00:04:56.050> get

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
quicker than nature and hopefully we get

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:04.940 
quicker than nature and hopefully we get
it<00:04:56.289> back

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.010 

you
