00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:11.450
 set up the microphone of a pc 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.730
 It is usually pink or it brings a 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.310
 icon that distinguishes it 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.680
 you have to identify where the 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.619
 microphone once connected we get a 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.380
 notice the type of window will vary in 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.400
 function to the computer model in 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.640
 all case only point accept 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.040
 restart the computer 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.040
 in the toolbar I click on the 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.050
 loudspeaker or speaker icon then the 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.960
 mixer and from there I address the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.170
 system sounds in the window 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.180
 sound pulse on the record tab and there 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.830
 selected the microphone 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.110
 if the microphone connection has been 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 correct then even if I do not listen to the 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.519
 sound should move in the bar 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.159
 state of the microphone pulse in 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.829
 properties from there I go to the tab 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.320
 to listen 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.199
 there I will activate a sound of 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.509
 microphone by clicking on the box 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.439
 listen to this device so that the 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.090
 change take effect pulse apply this 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:15.850
 It helps me to hear the sound of 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.590
 microphone and be able to calibrate it although to the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.350
 time to work with the microphone in 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.909
 any application or program is better than 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.630
 select it so you do not hear 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:28.299
 double sound in the levels tab there are 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:33.280
 a slide bar to amplify the 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:36.369
 microphone at decibels of 0 10 20 30 y 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.250
 another slide bar to adjust with 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.500
 greater precision the volume in what 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.399
 staff adjusted the microphone to 20 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.530
 decibels pulse to apply on the tab 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.250
 of improvements I can apply some effects 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.229
 to the sound of the microphone as are the 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.319
 noise suppression and cancellation of 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.450
 lag and finally the options 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.549
 advanced allow me to select the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.140
 recording quality which will be 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.690
 function 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.720
 and power equipment since the higher 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.869
 quality greater consumption of resources 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.459
 the requirements of 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:17.069
 the applications or programs with the 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:20.340
 which I will edit the sound 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:22.969
 that's all a gala above shares and
