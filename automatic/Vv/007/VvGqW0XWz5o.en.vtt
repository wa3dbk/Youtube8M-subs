basically<00:00:40.110> um<00:00:41.600> well<00:00:42.600> why<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> start<00:00:43.110> by

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
basically um well why don't I start by

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.540 
basically um well why don't I start by
giving<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.649> diminished<00:00:44.010> chord<00:00:44.250> that

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
giving you the diminished chord that

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.400 
giving you the diminished chord that
we're<00:00:44.910> starting<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.390> here<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:46.170> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
we're starting on here so it's it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
we're starting on here so it's it's
actually<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> group<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.280> diminished<00:00:47.700> chords

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
actually a group of diminished chords

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
actually a group of diminished chords
that<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:49.649> start<00:00:49.890> with<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.190> diminished<00:00:50.520> chord

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
that you start with one diminished chord

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.639 
that you start with one diminished chord
and<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> play<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.110> diminished<00:00:52.469> chord

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and then you play the diminished chord

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.110 
and then you play the diminished chord
that's<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.890> minor<00:00:53.070> third<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.489> from<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
that's a minor third up from that and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.819 
that's a minor third up from that and
you<00:00:54.210> just<00:00:54.300> keep<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.020> there<00:00:55.079> so

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you just keep going up from there so

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.830 
you just keep going up from there so
that's<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.910> ascending<00:00:57.300> pattern<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.690> we're

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that's the ascending pattern that we're

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's the ascending pattern that we're
doing<00:00:57.930> each<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.530> moves<00:00:58.680> up<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.010> minor

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
doing each time it moves up a minor

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.200 
doing each time it moves up a minor
third<00:00:59.609> or<00:00:59.850> three<00:01:00.840> frets<00:01:01.050> on<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.350> guitar<00:01:02.210> so

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
third or three frets on the guitar so

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.160 
third or three frets on the guitar so
why<00:01:04.110> don't<00:01:04.409> we<00:01:04.530> begin<00:01:05.040> with<00:01:05.610> doing<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.540> will

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
why don't we begin with doing one will

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
why don't we begin with doing one will
start<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.650> D<00:01:07.950> diminished<00:01:08.369> chord<00:01:08.670> so

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
start on that D diminished chord so

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.760 
start on that D diminished chord so
we're<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:10.200> g<00:01:10.409> string<00:01:12.350> seventh<00:01:13.350> fret<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
we're on the g string seventh fret and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.250 
we're on the g string seventh fret and
the<00:01:14.640> chord<00:01:14.850> sounds<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.360> this

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.470 

that's<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.010> cord<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:22.210> that's<00:01:23.210> going<00:01:23.330> to<00:01:23.390> be

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
that's the cord so that's going to be

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.950 
that's the cord so that's going to be
fretted<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.970> g-string<00:01:25.970> 7<00:01:26.570> B<00:01:27.230> string<00:01:27.650> 6<00:01:28.930> high<00:01:29.930> E

Nelly move this down a little for

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.230 
Nelly move this down a little for
starters<00:01:38.900> just<00:01:39.650> try<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.920> sweep<00:01:40.610> picking<00:01:40.850> just

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
starters just try a sweep picking just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.630 
starters just try a sweep picking just
those<00:01:41.450> three<00:01:41.810> notes<00:01:42.050> so<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:42.830> down<00:01:43.130> down<00:01:43.370> down

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
those three notes so just down down down

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.910 
those three notes so just down down down
that's<00:01:43.880> all<00:01:44.000> we're<00:01:44.120> doing<00:01:45.130> down<00:01:46.130> down<00:01:46.460> down

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
that's all we're doing down down down

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.110 
that's all we're doing down down down
look<00:01:48.920> further<00:01:49.210> there<00:01:50.210> we<00:01:50.300> go

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.580 

so<00:01:59.120> and<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.840> course<00:01:59.870> we're<00:02:00.170> not<00:02:00.200> letting<00:02:00.530> it

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
so and of course we're not letting it

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.100 
so and of course we're not letting it
ring<00:02:00.830> we're<00:02:01.010> not<00:02:01.100> doing<00:02:01.340> this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
ring we're not doing this

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.620 
ring we're not doing this
right<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:03.950> each<00:02:04.160> each<00:02:04.490> note<00:02:04.850> after<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.360> Fred

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
right so each each note after you Fred

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.880 
right so each each note after you Fred
it<00:02:05.780> you<00:02:05.930> have<00:02:06.050> to<00:02:06.140> lift<00:02:06.350> your<00:02:06.500> finger<00:02:06.680> a<00:02:06.860> little

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
it you have to lift your finger a little

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.440 
it you have to lift your finger a little
bit<00:02:09.070> so<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.130> kind<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.369> exaggerated<00:02:10.880> it

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.720 

so<00:02:17.120> that's<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.750> motion<00:02:19.319> there<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.400> then<00:02:20.550> after

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
so that's the motion there so then after

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
so that's the motion there so then after
you<00:02:20.790> play<00:02:20.970> those<00:02:21.150> three<00:02:21.450> notes<00:02:23.120> don't<00:02:24.120> pick<00:02:25.020> up

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.699 

um<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:46.200> let's<00:02:47.200> practice<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.680> a

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
um so that's that let's practice that a

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:48.869 
um so that's that let's practice that a
few<00:02:47.769> times<00:02:47.890> did<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:48.340> now<00:02:48.489> we're<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.790> add

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
few times did but now we're going to add

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:56.429 
few times did but now we're going to add
a<00:02:48.970> pull-off<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:52.060> pull<00:02:52.450> off<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:55.319> then<00:02:56.319> do

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:56.439 
a pull-off so and pull off and then do

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.929 
a pull-off so and pull off and then do
an<00:02:56.530> upstroke<00:02:56.859> on<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.579> B<00:02:57.849> string<00:02:59.939> but

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
an upstroke on the on the B string but

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.729 
an upstroke on the on the B string but
then<00:03:01.090> instead<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.510> continuing<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.290> upward

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
then instead of continuing that upward

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.789 
then instead of continuing that upward
motion<00:03:03.159> towards<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.939> g<00:03:04.540> string<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:07.299> want<00:03:07.329> to

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
motion towards the g string you want to

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.220 
motion towards the g string you want to
bypass<00:03:08.799> the<00:03:09.189> G<00:03:09.400> but<00:03:09.760> then<00:03:09.909> come<00:03:10.299> back<00:03:10.329> down<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
bypass the G but then come back down and

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.259 
bypass the G but then come back down and
hit<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> Down<00:03:11.799> stroke<00:03:12.010> because<00:03:13.000> then

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
hit it with a Down stroke because then

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:14.789 
hit it with a Down stroke because then
that<00:03:13.299> starts<00:03:13.720> our<00:03:13.840> pattern<00:03:14.170> over<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.590> for

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
that starts our pattern over that for

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.430 
that starts our pattern over that for
the<00:03:14.859> downward<00:03:15.280> motion<00:03:15.459> so<00:03:16.680> down<00:03:17.680> down<00:03:18.220> down<00:03:18.790> up

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
the downward motion so down down down up

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.629 
the downward motion so down down down up
pull<00:03:20.440> off<00:03:20.709> up<00:03:21.159> on<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.819> B<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:22.680> then<00:03:23.680> down<00:03:24.430> on

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
pull off up on the B and then down on

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.539 
pull off up on the B and then down on
the<00:03:24.730> G<00:03:24.909> again<00:03:25.290> so<00:03:26.290> I'll<00:03:26.680> do<00:03:26.920> it<00:03:27.010> real<00:03:27.280> slow<00:03:27.310> a

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
the G again so I'll do it real slow a

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:46.830 
the G again so I'll do it real slow a
couple<00:03:27.879> times

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.170 

um<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.680> kind<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.099> few<00:03:49.430> variations<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:50.060> there

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
um so kind of few variations in there

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:55.360 
um so kind of few variations in there
rhythmically<00:03:50.540> um<00:03:54.010> so<00:03:55.010> that's<00:03:55.129> what<00:03:55.250> we're

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
rhythmically um so that's what we're

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.539 
rhythmically um so that's what we're
doing<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.510> um<00:03:56.930> but<00:03:57.620> now<00:03:57.709> to<00:03:57.769> do<00:03:58.010> the<00:03:58.190> the

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
doing so um but now to do the the

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.009 
doing so um but now to do the the
ascending<00:03:59.330> lick<00:04:00.489> its<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:02.480> starts<00:04:02.810> out<00:04:02.900> the

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:03.019 
ascending lick its it starts out the

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:09.670 
ascending lick its it starts out the
same<00:04:03.049> as<00:04:03.319> the<00:04:03.379> first<00:04:03.560> one<00:04:06.129> but<00:04:07.129> now<00:04:08.409> let<00:04:09.409> play<00:04:09.590> a

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
same as the first one but now let play a

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.649 
same as the first one but now let play a
Down<00:04:10.010> pick<00:04:10.280> note<00:04:10.519> on<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.849> high<00:04:11.000> E<00:04:11.030> string<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
Down pick note on the high E string and

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.479 
Down pick note on the high E string and
slide<00:04:12.110> up<00:04:12.319> three<00:04:13.129> friends<00:04:15.190> but<00:04:16.190> then<00:04:16.340> play

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
slide up three friends but then play

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:26.860 
slide up three friends but then play
that<00:04:16.669> same<00:04:16.880> shape<00:04:17.239> so<00:04:25.479> so<00:04:26.479> you<00:04:26.570> got<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.690> first

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
that same shape so so you got a first

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.350 
that same shape so so you got a first
practice<00:04:27.289> this<00:04:27.410> one

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.250 

then<00:04:32.360> once<00:04:32.540> you've<00:04:32.660> got<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:32.960> one<00:04:33.110> pretty

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
then once you've got that one pretty

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.200 
then once you've got that one pretty
smooth<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:33.830> try<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.070> move<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.520> so<00:04:34.730> I'll<00:04:35.090> go

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
smooth then try to move it so I'll go

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:52.240 
smooth then try to move it so I'll go
slow<00:04:35.480> again

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.800 

and<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.670> course<00:04:53.700> you<00:04:53.940> don't<00:04:54.030> have<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.300> start<00:04:54.630> it

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
and of course you don't have to start it

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.210 
and of course you don't have to start it
like<00:04:54.960> there<00:04:55.410> I<00:04:55.440> started<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:55.980> the<00:04:56.070> high<00:04:56.190> E

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
like there I started on the high E

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.650 
like there I started on the high E
string<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.760> was<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:56.910> same<00:04:57.090> pattern<00:04:57.540> in<00:04:57.600> the

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
string it was the same pattern in the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.380 
string it was the same pattern in the
same<00:04:57.840> shape<00:04:58.640> so<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.700> don't<00:04:59.850> have<00:04:59.970> to<00:05:00.150> start

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
same shape so you don't have to start

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.230 
same shape so you don't have to start
down<00:05:00.540> here<00:05:00.570> every<00:05:00.900> time<00:05:01.790> you<00:05:02.790> can<00:05:02.940> start<00:05:03.120> up

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
down here every time you can start up

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.090 
down here every time you can start up
here<00:05:04.640> so<00:05:05.930> few<00:05:06.930> variations<00:05:07.200> you<00:05:07.590> can<00:05:07.620> do<00:05:07.890> on

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
here so few variations you can do on

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.880 
here so few variations you can do on
that<00:05:08.900> okay<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:09.930> think<00:05:10.140> it's<00:05:10.230> really<00:05:10.440> fun<00:05:10.680> like

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
that okay I think it's really fun like

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.650 
that okay I think it's really fun like
to<00:05:11.040> play<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.610> definitely<00:05:12.090> good<00:05:12.270> one<00:05:12.420> to<00:05:12.540> have

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
to play and definitely good one to have

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.290 
to play and definitely good one to have
in<00:05:12.960> your<00:05:12.990> bag<00:05:13.290> of<00:05:13.440> tricks<00:05:13.710> so<00:05:14.490> hopefully<00:05:15.210> this

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
in your bag of tricks so hopefully this

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.330 
in your bag of tricks so hopefully this
is<00:05:15.480> pretty<00:05:15.720> clear<00:05:15.990> if<00:05:16.110> not<00:05:16.320> leave<00:05:17.190> some

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
is pretty clear if not leave some

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.800 
is pretty clear if not leave some
