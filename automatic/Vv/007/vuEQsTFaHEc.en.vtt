g's they have these two are both pirates
so<00:00:51.829> they<00:00:51.980> both<00:00:52.190> get<00:00:52.429> 50<00:00:53.000> G's<00:00:53.620> theory<00:00:54.620> /<00:00:54.800> has<00:00:54.920> 380

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
so they both get 50 G's theory / has 380

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.069 
so they both get 50 G's theory / has 380
GS<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.120> gorham<00:00:56.570> has<00:00:57.219> 330<00:00:58.219> geez<00:00:58.519> so<00:00:59.420> few<00:00:59.780> Ripper

GS and gorham has 330 geez so few Ripper

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.030 
GS and gorham has 330 geez so few Ripper
will<00:01:00.350> win<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:02.170> gorham<00:01:03.170> can<00:01:03.409> no<00:01:03.530> longer<00:01:03.769> be
