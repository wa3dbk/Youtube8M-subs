00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.980
 hello youtube friends welcome to a 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.900
 new chapter here in this world U-17 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.550
 in today as you can see the 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.290
 title what we are going to do is going to be a 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.720
 boxing high case with keyboard 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.270
 included of the brand blues for tablet 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.369
 of 10 inches so let's start 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.110
 with the video but before that we're going to 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.660
 take a little look at what is 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 its wrapping by the sides we go 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.070
 to find the manufacturer's brand 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.290
 of product in this case blue three 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.570
 operating icons basically with 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.270
 two-in- one bluetooth that includes the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.800
 sheath and the keyboard integrally and 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.230
 It also tells us that it is a cover 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.870
 totally choose and a keyboard for 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.880
 bluetooth tablet 10.0 on the right side 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 of your screen as the back 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.830
 we are going to find three images 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.080
 basically how it works 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.059
 This case with the door Tablet 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.670
 technical specifications that incorporates 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.369
 a lithium-ion battery charge 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.920
 Between four to five hours usb charger 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.530
 and it works with other products that 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.090
 have the bluetooth option good 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.149
 basically those have about the 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 buttons now we are going to concentrate 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.869
 basically and essentially 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.970
 what is the unboxing raising what 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.729
 it is this tab we are going to find 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.909
 with what is the case itself the product 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.070
 itself is a pretty simple wrapper 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.710
 does not include many accessories only 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.930
 what is the case the mini usb charger 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.119
 that I mentioned earlier and what is 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.100
 a kind of manual later what 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.390
 let's see for now let's extract what 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.760
 what is the cover like this 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.040
 we leave it aside and we go to 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.720
 find with the last two accessories 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.060
 so to speak I told him 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.490
 previously here we find what 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.940
 which is the mini-usb charger which is 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.640
 with which I mentioned earlier 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.619
 works based on a usb 2.0 that is 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 connect either a computer or a 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.850
 charger and what is the usb child that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.890
 connects to what the keyboard is for 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.950
 load what is the keyboard 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.830
 worth the redundancy between 4 to 5 hours 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.580
 what is your full career and here 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.320
 we find what is a manual 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.180
 so to speak of quick use how 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.459
 configure what is our trachea 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.320
 our keyboard with our tablet 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.130
 using bluetooth and things like that 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.440
 it comes in the language of English not well 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.160
 in Spanish so that's a point in 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.170
 against for this product but good not 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.880
 we care a lot about the rest we are going to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.550
 concentrate basically on what is 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.250
 the sleeve so let's analyze from 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.650
 immediate good here we have what is the 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 founding itself let's take it out of 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.340
 what is a button me from this little bag 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.310
 that covers it 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.959
 and in itself the first feeling that I 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.480
 I had with this case it was quite 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.580
 nice is a case can be silos 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.580
 very very soft leather feels very 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.050
 well in the hands is pretty good 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.360
 built in terms of what their 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.940
 edges have no imperfections nor 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.650
 nothing what is a little thick and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.470
 how much 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.299
 the side angle so to speak you are 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.069
 a little thick but that's basically 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.069
 because it includes what is the keyboard 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.459
 inside so also because of them 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.590
 two magnets that when closing it 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.299
 automatically the one that is saved is saved 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.280
 our tablet with what is the keyboard 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.079
 but prime cells we're going to 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.730
 find with the keyboard itself and by the 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.159
 top part so it's the 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.200
 hole to enter our tablet in 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:41.349
 this case works with what is the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.480
 galaxy tab 10.1 because because in the 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.720
 top later we 're going to 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.340
 see has the holes for the 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.200
 camera so for the sensor as can 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.209
 see arribita there you see two holes 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.659
 both with the camera and the sensor 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.670
 proximity of the tablet Galaxy 10.1 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.590
 keyboard feels pretty good 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.840
 at the time to be writing very very 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.000
 comfortable very soft buttons on a 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.430
 kind of rubber which makes it 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.680
 adhere very very well to what is in 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.760
 other fingers so it 's very very good 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.290
 achieved the construction of this keyboard 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.479
 if we focus on the top 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.190
 left of your screen we're going to 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.380
 find with buttons 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.370
 works with android for example the 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.890
 Application menu start button 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.820
 open is blocking up and down 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.920
 volume change what the song is 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.650
 the brightness increase or decrease what is 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:38.680
 he lost so that's basically in 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.570
 Android tablets function for this 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.010
 sector we are going to meet with the 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.870
 hole can continue centuries to 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.910
 enter it in block of our tablet 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.250
 if you enter in that way in the forum 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.440
 review let's see all that what has 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.750
 what to do with how they work 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.300
 our tablet and thing for the guy owns 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.170
 a velcro from which it adheres to the base 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.360
 to be able to stop the tablet so that 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.730
 so do not fall down below and here 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.130
 let's see the tablet completely 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.990
 is ready to be used with the keyboard 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.270
 that we're going to do that in soccer 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.250
