00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.720 
together so we can get all of these out
of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.380> way<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.340> want<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.550> take<00:02:32.700> a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
of the way and then you want to take a

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.780 
of the way and then you want to take a
ruler<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.950> you'll<00:02:34.950> need<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.190> piece<00:02:35.490> of<00:02:35.550> fabric

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
ruler and you'll need a piece of fabric

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.500 
ruler and you'll need a piece of fabric
that's<00:02:37.340> twice<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.700> diameter<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:40.380> button

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
that's twice the diameter of your button

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.750 
that's twice the diameter of your button
so<00:02:42.510> we're<00:02:42.780> using<00:02:42.990> a<00:02:43.230> button<00:02:43.440> today<00:02:43.860> that's<00:02:44.340> one

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
so we're using a button today that's one

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.390 
so we're using a button today that's one
inch<00:02:45.030> wide<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.320> need<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> two<00:02:47.010> inch<00:02:47.250> wide

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
inch wide so we need a two inch wide

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.160 
inch wide so we need a two inch wide
piece<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.210> fabric<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:51.420> doesn't<00:02:51.810> have<00:02:51.990> to

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
piece of fabric and it doesn't have to

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.060 
piece of fabric and it doesn't have to
be<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.560> perfect<00:02:53.280> circle<00:02:54.620> I'm<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.710> going<00:02:56.040> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
be a perfect circle I'm just going to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.940 
be a perfect circle I'm just going to
trim<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.580> excess<00:02:57.060> off<00:02:57.330> here<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:58.440> doesn't<00:02:58.800> have

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
trim the excess off here it doesn't have

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.540 
trim the excess off here it doesn't have
to<00:02:59.100> be<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> perfect<00:02:59.790> circle<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:02.010> can<00:03:02.160> move<00:03:02.310> that

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
to be a perfect circle we can move that

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.290 
to be a perfect circle we can move that
aside<00:03:02.700> let's<00:03:03.530> measure<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:05.460> we<00:03:05.580> just<00:03:05.790> need<00:03:05.970> two

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
aside let's measure so we just need two

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.180 
aside let's measure so we just need two
inches<00:03:06.840> so<00:03:07.020> we<00:03:07.050> can<00:03:07.290> just<00:03:07.440> kind<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.770> take<00:03:07.980> this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
inches so we can just kind of take this

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.300 
inches so we can just kind of take this
off<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.720> fabric<00:03:10.020> edges<00:03:10.680> are<00:03:10.830> going<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.190> get

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
off the fabric edges are going to get

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.710 
off the fabric edges are going to get
tucked<00:03:11.640> into<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.570> back<00:03:12.780> of<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.620> button<00:03:14.720> and

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
tucked into the back of the button and

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.840 
tucked into the back of the button and
we'll<00:03:16.140> make<00:03:16.260> sure<00:03:16.470> we<00:03:16.800> have<00:03:16.830> two<00:03:17.280> inches<00:03:17.670> this

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
we'll make sure we have two inches this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.840 
we'll make sure we have two inches this
way<00:03:18.530> so<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.650> really<00:03:19.830> easy<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.520> cut<00:03:20.820> a

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
way so it's really easy just to cut a

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.030 
way so it's really easy just to cut a
square<00:03:22.400> I've<00:03:23.400> seen<00:03:23.700> some<00:03:23.940> people<00:03:24.090> use

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
square I've seen some people use

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.590 
square I've seen some people use
templates<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.310> things<00:03:26.520> like<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.790> but<00:03:27.450> what

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
templates and things like that but what

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.080 
templates and things like that but what
I<00:03:27.630> usually<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.440> just<00:03:28.470> cut<00:03:28.950> a<00:03:29.190> square<00:03:29.610> the

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
I usually do is just cut a square the

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.820 
I usually do is just cut a square the
size<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:30.540> need<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.020> then<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.260> can<00:03:31.440> just<00:03:31.590> kind

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
size you need and then you can just kind

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.390 
size you need and then you can just kind
of<00:03:31.950> snip<00:03:32.400> off<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:33.410> corners<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:35.580> makes<00:03:36.380> an

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
of snip off the corners that makes an

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.090 
of snip off the corners that makes an
easy<00:03:38.400> little<00:03:38.790> circle<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.690> that's<00:03:40.680> fine

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
easy little circle and that's fine

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.390 
easy little circle and that's fine
that's<00:03:41.520> all<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.880> need<00:03:42.090> nothing<00:03:42.780> fancy<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.740> you
