00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:11.820
 In this video, we will explain step by step how 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.130
 Create a photo collage 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.539
 As mentioned in the previous video, this is a simple and fun project. 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.490
 Can let you familiarize yourself with how to use layers with hands-on exercises 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.640
 In this example, I want to print normal paper, so set the size to 8 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 1/2 x 11 inches and set the resolution to 300 DPI 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.260
 Next, click on the sample next to the color and select the color you want to use as the background. 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.510
 To select a background 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.030
 In the Media Management panel, select all the images you want to use and drag them to 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 In the layer panel 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.040
 Each image will be added as a different layer 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.670
 To move an image, select the Pick tool from the Tools toolbar and click on the layer. 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.710
 Select an image and move it to a new location 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.659
 After pressing again, the corners and center of the image will appear as nodes. 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.689
 You can drag the corners of the nodes to resize the image, or drag the center's rotation handles. 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.450
 Rotating image 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.759
 After the collage is complete, remember to save it as a PaintShop Pro version of the image. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:21.759
 File 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.159
 As a result, your layer will remain the same 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.479
 In the "Files" menu, select "Save as new" and select PSP image as the file type. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.049
 Then, if you want to be able to print or share the version online, please return to the "File", "Save as new file" 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.310
 And choose jpg 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.399
 When you save a multi-layer project as a jpg file, a warning message will appear 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.179
 This is because the jpg file can only contain one layer. 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.770
 You just need to click "Yes" to continue and the image will be saved smoothly. 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.549
 In the next episode, we will demonstrate how to create a motion image using layers. 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.429
 This video will explain more about how to use the copy function to manipulate various elements in a single image. 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.130
 And how to blend these layers together 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.849
