00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.840 

so<00:00:01.350> I<00:00:01.380> just<00:00:01.530> have<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.800> bit<00:00:01.949> of<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.129> muck<00:00:02.700> about

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
so I just have a bit of a muck about

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.589 
so I just have a bit of a muck about
with<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:04.069> gu10<00:00:05.069> LED<00:00:06.020> bulb<00:00:08.150> this<00:00:09.150> one's<00:00:09.360> not

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
with a gu10 LED bulb this one's not

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.930 
with a gu10 LED bulb this one's not
working<00:00:09.660> so<00:00:10.170> I've<00:00:10.290> cut<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.650> wires<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.670> go<00:00:11.880> to

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
working so I've cut the wires the go to

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.500 
working so I've cut the wires the go to
the<00:00:12.300> mains<00:00:15.020> constant<00:00:16.020> current<00:00:16.350> supply<00:00:17.510> now

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the mains constant current supply now

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.769 
the mains constant current supply now
inside<00:00:19.020> this<00:00:19.910> light<00:00:21.230> there<00:00:22.230> are<00:00:22.260> five<00:00:23.779> LEDs

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
inside this light there are five LEDs

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.529 
inside this light there are five LEDs
and<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.260> bulb<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.310> described<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> six<00:00:27.300> watt

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and this bulb is described as a six watt

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.179 
and this bulb is described as a six watt
so<00:00:27.810> I'm<00:00:27.900> assuming<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:28.529> these<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:28.980> watt

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
so I'm assuming that these are one watt

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.980 
so I'm assuming that these are one watt
LEDs<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:30.240> also<00:00:30.420> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> assume<00:00:30.810> that

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
LEDs I'm also going to assume that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.500 
LEDs I'm also going to assume that
they're<00:00:31.230> all<00:00:31.349> in<00:00:31.529> series<00:00:32.149> so<00:00:33.149> I'm<00:00:33.239> just<00:00:33.360> going

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
they're all in series so I'm just going

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.610 
they're all in series so I'm just going
to<00:00:33.540> hook<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:34.280> array<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.750> LEDs<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to hook this array of LEDs up to this

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.569 
to hook this array of LEDs up to this
power<00:00:38.010> supply<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:39.320> see<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.379> we<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:40.739> drive<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
power supply and see if we can drive it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.660 
power supply and see if we can drive it
and<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> LEDs<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.840> come<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:44.489> power

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
and get the LEDs to come on the power

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.170 
and get the LEDs to come on the power
supply<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:45.739> it's<00:00:46.739> kind<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.520> bit<00:00:47.789> over<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
supply is it's kind of a bit over the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.549 
supply is it's kind of a bit over the
top<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.690> purpose<00:00:49.050> really<00:00:49.260> but<00:00:49.410> it's

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
top for this purpose really but it's

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.970 
top for this purpose really but it's
nice<00:00:50.250> because<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.700> got<00:00:51.320> constant<00:00:52.320> voltage

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
nice because it's got constant voltage

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.010 
nice because it's got constant voltage
and<00:00:53.340> constant<00:00:53.430> current<00:00:54.390> options<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> then

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
and constant current options and then

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.060 
and constant current options and then
use<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> constant<00:00:55.829> constant<00:00:56.190> current<00:00:56.969> option

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
use the constant constant current option

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.029 
use the constant constant current option
on<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.370> video<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> I've<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.170> checked<00:01:01.379> on

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
on this video so I've just checked on

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.600 
on this video so I've just checked on
some<00:01:02.370> eBay<00:01:02.670> listings<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.680> I've<00:01:04.680> found<00:01:05.430> out

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
some eBay listings and I've found out

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.130 
some eBay listings and I've found out
that<00:01:05.990> one<00:01:06.990> watt<00:01:07.200> LEDs<00:01:08.060> take<00:01:09.060> about<00:01:09.510> 300

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
that one watt LEDs take about 300

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.250 
that one watt LEDs take about 300
milliamps<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.890> let's<00:01:11.700> switch<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.479> power

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
milliamps so let's switch on this power

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.590 
milliamps so let's switch on this power
unit<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:15.890> so<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:16.950> set<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.400> current<00:01:18.299> limit

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
unit and so I've set the current limit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.370 
unit and so I've set the current limit
to<00:01:19.409> 250<00:01:20.310> milliamps<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.180> we're<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to 250 milliamps so that we're this is

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.960 
to 250 milliamps so that we're this is
this<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> heatsink<00:01:23.280> so<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.790> up<00:01:23.850> to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
this is heatsink so we could go up to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.050 
this is heatsink so we could go up to
the<00:01:24.060> full<00:01:24.210> 300<00:01:24.689> milliamps<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.790> I've<00:01:26.790> set<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
the full 300 milliamps and I've set the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.190 
the full 300 milliamps and I've set the
voltage<00:01:27.180> currently<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
voltage currently it

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
voltage currently it
well<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> 9.6<00:01:29.250> volts<00:01:29.579> now<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.210> shouldn't

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
well it's 9.6 volts now that shouldn't

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.929 
well it's 9.6 volts now that shouldn't
be<00:01:30.659> enough<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.470> trigger<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.159> LEDs<00:01:32.640> because

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
be enough to trigger the LEDs because

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.440 
be enough to trigger the LEDs because
we've<00:01:33.119> got<00:01:33.299> five<00:01:33.990> lots<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.939> 3.3<00:01:35.939> volts<00:01:36.299> they

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
we've got five lots of 3.3 volts they

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.160 
we've got five lots of 3.3 volts they
might<00:01:36.600> come<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.810> dimly<00:01:38.479> but<00:01:39.479> we'll<00:01:39.659> see<00:01:39.960> what

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
might come on dimly but we'll see what

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.749 
might come on dimly but we'll see what
happens<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> switch<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> on<00:01:41.280> so<00:01:41.579> let's

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
happens when we switch it on so let's

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.800 
happens when we switch it on so let's
switch<00:01:41.850> on<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> output

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
switch on the output

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.289 
switch on the output
okay<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:43.829> nothing<00:01:44.009> there<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.119> let's

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
okay so there's nothing there so let's

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
okay so there's nothing there so let's
now<00:01:45.479> start<00:01:45.750> adjusting<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.680> voltage<00:01:48.470> and<00:01:49.470> see

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
now start adjusting the voltage and see

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.490 
now start adjusting the voltage and see
if<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.100> can<00:01:50.280> get<00:01:50.899> come<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:53.000> yes<00:01:54.079> right<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.350> now

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
if we can get come on yes right so now

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.719 
if we can get come on yes right so now
they're<00:01:55.649> coming<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.040> that's<00:01:56.189> twelve<00:01:56.520> point

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
they're coming on that's twelve point

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.030 
they're coming on that's twelve point
seven<00:01:56.880> volts<00:01:57.350> they're<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.590> starting<00:01:58.799> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
seven volts they're just starting to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.850 
seven volts they're just starting to
come<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.340> as<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.670> see<00:02:00.170> so<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.320> carry

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
come on as you can see so that's carry

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.700 
come on as you can see so that's carry
on<00:02:02.009> up<00:02:02.159> now<00:02:03.000> pretty<00:02:03.270> bright

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
on up now pretty bright

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.540 
on up now pretty bright
that's<00:02:04.980> 13<00:02:05.490> volts<00:02:08.030> 1415<00:02:09.890> it's<00:02:10.890> extremely

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
that's 13 volts 1415 it's extremely

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.230 
that's 13 volts 1415 it's extremely
bright<00:02:11.670> now<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.140> constant<00:02:13.740> current

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
bright now and the constant current

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.940 
bright now and the constant current
indicator<00:02:15.240> has<00:02:15.450> come<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:16.100> so<00:02:17.990> we're<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.140> 250

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
indicator has come on so we're at 250

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
indicator has come on so we're at 250
milliamps<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.610> if<00:02:21.210> I<00:02:21.240> look<00:02:21.360> at<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> watt<00:02:21.840> meter

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
milliamps so if I look at the watt meter

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.710 
milliamps so if I look at the watt meter
reading<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.340> display<00:02:23.940> I'll<00:02:24.300> just<00:02:24.480> turn<00:02:24.600> it

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
reading on the display I'll just turn it

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.450 
reading on the display I'll just turn it
off<00:02:24.780> again<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> I<00:02:25.680> can't<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.400> I

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
off again and I can't do that and then I

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.080 
off again and I can't do that and then I
can't<00:02:26.640> read<00:02:26.790> it

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
can't read it

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.840 
can't read it
it's<00:02:28.460> 4.3<00:02:29.460> watts<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.460> we're<00:02:32.460> just<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.820> little

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
it's 4.3 watts so we're just a little

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.890 
it's 4.3 watts so we're just a little
under<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.300> maximum<00:02:33.810> rating<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:35.090> LEDs<00:02:36.090> but

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
under the maximum rating of the LEDs but

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.780 
under the maximum rating of the LEDs but
the<00:02:36.990> important<00:02:37.320> thing<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.709> know<00:02:38.280> when<00:02:38.520> driving

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
the important thing to know when driving

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.970 
the important thing to know when driving
LEDs<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> must<00:02:40.530> have<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.770> current

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
LEDs is that you must have a current

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.880 
LEDs is that you must have a current
limit<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.810> be<00:02:43.320> driven<00:02:43.650> at

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
limit because they can be driven at

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.500 
limit because they can be driven at
extremely<00:02:44.430> high<00:02:44.580> currents<00:02:45.270> they're<00:02:45.390> not

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
extremely high currents they're not

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.350 
extremely high currents they're not
inherently<00:02:46.020> limiting<00:02:46.500> light<00:02:46.680> bulbs<00:02:47.130> are<00:02:47.360> so

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
inherently limiting light bulbs are so

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.970 
inherently limiting light bulbs are so
you<00:02:48.420> must<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.840> current<00:02:49.050> limit<00:02:49.500> set<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
you must have a current limit set that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.070 
you must have a current limit set that
first<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.720> pour<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.050> much

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
first and then you can pour as much

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.320 
first and then you can pour as much
voltage<00:02:52.590> through<00:02:52.830> them<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.160> as<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.880> want<00:02:54.090> and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
voltage through them as as you want and

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.890 
voltage through them as as you want and
get<00:02:55.260> them<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.500> light<00:02:55.680> up
