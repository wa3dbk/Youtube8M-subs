take<00:03:16.030> down<00:03:16.300> this<00:03:16.510> base<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.900> see<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.200> new

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
take down this base you see the new

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.010 
take down this base you see the new
artillery<00:03:17.709> over<00:03:18.220> here<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.670> is<00:03:19.330> actually<00:03:19.540> blew

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
artillery over here it is actually blew

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.500 
artillery over here it is actually blew
it<00:03:20.350> is<00:03:20.740> really<00:03:21.190> awesome<00:03:21.340> looking<00:03:21.880> but<00:03:22.360> not

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
it is really awesome looking but not

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.449 
it is really awesome looking but not
only<00:03:22.720> that<00:03:22.840> if<00:03:23.230> we<00:03:23.350> actually<00:03:23.500> drop<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.070> units

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
only that if we actually drop the units

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.610 
only that if we actually drop the units
and<00:03:24.640> we<00:03:24.850> start<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.150> shark<00:03:25.570> bomb<00:03:25.810> several

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and we start to shark bomb several

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.380 
and we start to shark bomb several
buildings<00:03:26.830> you<00:03:27.070> actually<00:03:27.400> see<00:03:27.640> a<00:03:27.670> time<00:03:28.150> or

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
buildings you actually see a time or

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.020 
buildings you actually see a time or
appearing<00:03:28.930> that<00:03:29.500> shows<00:03:29.769> how<00:03:30.010> long<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.550> effect

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
appearing that shows how long the effect

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.330 
appearing that shows how long the effect
is<00:03:31.239> effect<00:03:32.200> is<00:03:32.290> still<00:03:32.500> there<00:03:32.739> that<00:03:32.769> also

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
is effect is still there that also

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.520 
is effect is still there that also
includes<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.060> smoke<00:03:34.360> smoke<00:03:34.900> screens<00:03:35.290> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
includes for smoke smoke screens and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.130 
includes for smoke smoke screens and
also<00:03:36.310> met<00:03:36.550> kits<00:03:36.820> which<00:03:37.120> is<00:03:37.300> really<00:03:37.570> helpful<00:03:37.840> so

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
also met kits which is really helpful so

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.320 
also met kits which is really helpful so
for<00:03:38.260> example<00:03:38.320> over<00:03:38.860> here<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.550> mat<00:03:39.760> gets<00:03:39.940> over

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
for example over here the mat gets over

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.300 
for example over here the mat gets over
here<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.840> actually<00:03:41.080> shows<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.530> timer's<00:03:42.070> well

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
here it actually shows the timer's well

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.310 
here it actually shows the timer's well
and<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.730> smoke<00:03:43.030> over<00:03:43.300> here<00:03:43.570> as<00:03:43.660> well<00:03:43.870> also

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
and the smoke over here as well also

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.229 
and the smoke over here as well also
shows<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:44.950> timer<00:03:45.430> which<00:03:45.730> is<00:03:45.940> really<00:03:46.150> awesome

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
shows the timer which is really awesome

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.720 
shows the timer which is really awesome
and<00:03:46.600> just<00:03:46.840> go<00:03:46.930> to<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.170> fast<00:03:47.920> finish<00:03:48.340> this<00:03:48.489> one

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
and just go to a fast finish this one

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.460 
and just go to a fast finish this one
right<00:03:48.910> now<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.630> that<00:03:49.780> way<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.080> get<00:03:50.230> to<00:03:50.380> the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
right now it's that way we get to the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:04:03.100 
right now it's that way we get to the
next<00:03:50.650> part

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.010 

and<00:04:04.110> three<00:04:04.710> two<00:04:05.280> one<00:04:05.730> boom<00:04:06.120> there<00:04:06.420> you<00:04:06.540> go<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
and three two one boom there you go the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.320 
and three two one boom there you go the
base<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.320> down<00:04:07.770> and<00:04:08.040> when<00:04:08.490> we<00:04:08.640> down<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.120> base

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
base is down and when we down the base

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:10.670 
base is down and when we down the base
you're<00:04:09.600> going<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.900> be<00:04:10.020> see<00:04:10.200> something<00:04:10.560> awesome

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
you're going to be see something awesome

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.790 
you're going to be see something awesome
first<00:04:11.250> of<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:11.520> this<00:04:11.760> Intel<00:04:12.420> but<00:04:13.170> also<00:04:13.440> new

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
first of all this Intel but also new

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.950 
first of all this Intel but also new
victory<00:04:14.250> screen<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:15.060> is<00:04:15.300> just<00:04:15.630> really

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:15.960 
victory screen that is just really

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.050 
victory screen that is just really
awesome<00:04:16.260> looking<00:04:16.530> but<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.799> got<00:04:16.950> some<00:04:17.130> Intel<00:04:17.610> if

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
awesome looking but we got some Intel if

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.610 
awesome looking but we got some Intel if
you<00:04:18.180> defeat<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.540> base<00:04:18.810> you<00:04:19.019> got<00:04:19.049> a<00:04:19.170> chance<00:04:19.410> of

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
you defeat a base you got a chance of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.710 
you defeat a base you got a chance of
getting<00:04:19.890> Intel<00:04:20.310> which<00:04:20.790> is<00:04:20.970> using<00:04:21.390> your<00:04:21.510> task

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
getting Intel which is using your task

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.450 
getting Intel which is using your task
force<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.230> do<00:04:22.350> the<00:04:22.470> operations<00:04:23.160> which<00:04:23.430> is

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
force to do the operations which is

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.250 
force to do the operations which is
really<00:04:23.940> awesome<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:24.480> it's<00:04:24.660> all<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.870> bunch<00:04:25.110> of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
really awesome so it's all a bunch of

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.260 
really awesome so it's all a bunch of
stuff<00:04:25.530> down<00:04:25.710> there<00:04:25.920> in<00:04:26.100> terms<00:04:26.550> of<00:04:26.790> interface

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
stuff down there in terms of interface

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.480 
stuff down there in terms of interface
changes<00:04:27.540> and<00:04:27.900> timers<00:04:28.590> not<00:04:28.740> that<00:04:28.950> good<00:04:29.130> stuff<00:04:29.250> I

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
changes and timers not that good stuff I

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.190 
changes and timers not that good stuff I
really<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.300> timer's<00:04:30.720> it<00:04:30.870> makes<00:04:31.050> it

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
really like the timer's it makes it

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.340 
really like the timer's it makes it
easier<00:04:31.590> for<00:04:31.800> me<00:04:31.920> to<00:04:31.950> actually<00:04:32.250> like<00:04:33.350> calculate

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
easier for me to actually like calculate

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.500 
easier for me to actually like calculate
whenever<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.010> need<00:04:35.310> to<00:04:35.460> like<00:04:35.790> throw<00:04:36.120> in<00:04:36.330> the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
whenever I need to like throw in the

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.420 
whenever I need to like throw in the
next<00:04:36.840> one<00:04:37.050> and<00:04:37.230> stuff<00:04:37.440> like<00:04:37.620> that<00:04:37.680> you<00:04:38.070> know<00:04:38.100> it

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
next one and stuff like that you know it

next one and stuff like that you know it
will<00:04:38.790> all<00:04:38.910> make<00:04:38.940> sense<00:04:39.120> in<00:04:39.480> the<00:04:39.600> end<00:04:39.630> anyway

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
will all make sense in the end anyway

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.650 
will all make sense in the end anyway
and<00:04:40.410> yeah<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:41.430> guys<00:04:41.700> will<00:04:41.910> be<00:04:41.940> liking<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.510> as

talking about is the rank once now if
you<00:04:47.040> were<00:04:47.190> ranked<00:04:47.430> one<00:04:47.640> you<00:04:47.790> used<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.210> see

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
you were ranked one you used to see

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.090 
you were ranked one you used to see
golden<00:04:49.020> batches<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.470> right<00:04:49.770> now<00:04:49.800> they

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
golden batches so right now they

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.610 
golden batches so right now they
actually<00:04:50.400> changed<00:04:50.610> that<00:04:50.850> as<00:04:50.970> well<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:52.170> longer

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
actually changed that as well the longer

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.830 
actually changed that as well the longer
you<00:04:52.650> are<00:04:52.980> ranked<00:04:53.370> one<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:54.300> more<00:04:54.540> impressive

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
you are ranked one the more impressive

also if your map is empty of bases it

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.790 
also if your map is empty of bases it
means<00:06:10.729> you<00:06:11.030> attack<00:06:11.419> everyone<00:06:11.840> you<00:06:12.319> go<00:06:12.499> to<00:06:12.560> be
