 those malvinas islands that are not mixed 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.500

 t he is the skin 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.070
 we see that the scheme changes 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.940
 and also to prepare 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.380
 for so-called parking booksellers in the afternoon 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.610
 to the customer 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.610
 during his stay 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.750
 for 100 th 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.310
 we thalys and different categories vilaceca different 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.540
 categories of dollars the question is who and who

 little last of abbé-deschamps 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.300
 the institute 3,615 meters the bridge of the former roommate and the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.110
 possible 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.150
 and among chambered stars 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.900
 which overlooks the sea 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.460
 all went there 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.350
 for that but they still have the same fabrics elsewhere are 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.680
 served 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 very distinct 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.460
 the TV the minimum 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.349
 and to finish Corsican 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.449
 In every room 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.269
 very independent 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:16.559
 and each time I sing his 525 morning 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.559
 the difference is that there is a third chamber 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.299
 and a classic shandong room 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.239
 and per cent even if the Franche-Comté they have a larger share of dinars 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:37.839
 for 115 activities can one practice a comfort but vivian for the euro villa 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:40.330
 bellemare activities which are they 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.419
 it is interesting it is for example a car in the village 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.169
 expedia and it's a concept 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.349
 super nice we preserve the day before 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.509
 énarque 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.739
 all things done to prepare 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.429
 a buffet 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:53.499
 the entrees 

00:02:53.499 --> 00:02:55.929
 and then the little rug next to the pool 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.239
 and he is the chief who come 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.239
 what you chose 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.689
 and you spend the evening sitting next 

00:03:04.689 --> 00:03:07.639
 always what happens is a good point 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.949
 what is called m 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.519
 so that's the same field of activities 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.539
 you can also do 

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:15.599
 Stretchy tense massage of the blues 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.589
 not sure 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.589
 a reservation but the massage exactly 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.069
 and if not all the activities of the hotel but ban ki-moon that puts us 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.069
 not 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.860
 diving 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.119
 all is done

 in annex with the club 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.489
 in three words what distinguishes an alibi the beautiful mare coupet the others 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.969
 hotel villas 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:45.219
 the department assures him that what distinguishes them and the havana 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.219
 she 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.069
 in three days 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.069
 it's a bit discussed in three months when he was born in germany 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.900
 but I would say that percent what distinguishes us with a huge hole in the 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:03:59.479
 secu 

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:02.479
 exclusive 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:07.929
 uniting them world 

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:10.929
