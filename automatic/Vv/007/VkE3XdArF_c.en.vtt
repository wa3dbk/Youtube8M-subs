00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 you today in the video exact details 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 to the first curve the ghosts 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.439
 multiplayer of being able to bring you 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.119
 Of course I have pictures for you me 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.949
 have the release date for you i have 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.109
 Pictures of the exchange mode of the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.820
 multiplayer maps and of course from the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.929
 new weapon we will get and 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.939
 is very cool 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.039
 We will come to that later for a short time 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 The release date is 28 yen 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.279
 had namely when subscribed out 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.690
 you know that in any case have that 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.760
 I already mentioned in some videos 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.250
 Of course , only for the 3 6 3 and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 the xbox monrose unfortunately that is always the case 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.970
 and that's really annoying extreme but if 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.830
 you on another platform like that 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.050
 pc or the playstation 4 or the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.280
 playstation 3 you can play on each one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.350
 case with my channel 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.730
 drop by when that comes out or 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.560
 Just subscribe now 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.420
 and then you will get a lot of videos 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.250
 find news tips and tricks gameplays 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.960
 and if that then on your platform 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.790
 you will come out top 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.380
 be informed and definitely have 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.289
 a big advantage over 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.600
 the other players and before we go now 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:07.829
 I want to come first multiplayer map 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.479
 you still can be me the pictures 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.640
 unfortunately not show because I otherwise 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.649
 problems with activision and infinity 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.210
 I got it but I got it 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.920
 posted on my facebook page 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.359
 ie you can you now to a 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.369
 press link in the description and 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:22.109
 then the pictures if you have the video now 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.359
 As for the iphone but that is not 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.069
 no problem the first map success that 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.719
 is your swamp web we see too 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:29.399
 small huts and what I like right away 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.289
 Sting eye is the fog 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:33.090
 I can well imagine that in the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.439
 melee all opponents can see quite well 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.179
 but far off 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.520
 that the opponents are already right with the 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.170
 environment is blurring and this is there 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.450
 sight with which one sees the opponent that 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.429
 normal to be very very very useful 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.810
 and we also see that on the ground 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.520
 from this dull a swamp is so 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.200
 water and when you lie down there 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.539
 it may well be that one 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.920
 drinks like on the map suffers and that 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.229
 You may be slower in the marsh 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.479
 but is mainly on small 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.340
 Huts and bridges continue to move 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.899
 we also in the picture now we come to 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.389
 next markets as a preview 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.639
 it all looks a bit Chinese and 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:07.409
 In any case it is one more a harbor 

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:09.440
 We can see that once and for all 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.910
 on the name of the map in any case 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.560
 I can do much more with this measure 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.820
 do not say if you notice something 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.110
 or you can of course give me a field 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.160
 your opinion below in the comments 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.350
 leave 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.090
 I would be very happy 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.070
 Now we come to the third map and the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.840
 is called containment and that looks like 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.640
 it would be just his small slums map 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.110
 We already know that a lot 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.270
 similar I can imagine that 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.860
 this is a real toilet quarters map 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.330
 But we also see in the background 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.950
 a big building maybe you can 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 go in there and maybe even this 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.320
 go up the tower 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.000
 But we do not know that 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320
 that somebody backgroundes me 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.850
 I can remember one operator 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.900
 it looked like that and could 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.640
 you do not even get in 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.770
 I am very curious and come now 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.900
 we four map the aesthetic and 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.000
 this looks like it would be very big 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.600
 lines aside that give very big 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.290
 distance so good for marx one more mature and 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.630
 of course storm rifles and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.640
 Sniper rifle and design 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.420
 comes to me almost as if that could happen 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.310
 remake his 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.990
 and we have the tip 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.150
 get that with every one of them 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.770
 Remake will be there so write 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.420
 let's all in the comments what you 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.960
 says that a web remake his 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.030
 could 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.100
 I would say either ethnic this 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.090
 looks like a mp3 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.590
 web or containment that looks so 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.880
 how efficient I'm not there 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.780
 not sure but you can if you are in 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.489
 to write the comments 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.800
 What he says I think goes on 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.120
 every case new and b but also me 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.739
 Mix and containment could be there 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.420
 what a remix 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.100
 Now we come to you, they are the weapon 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.980
 In any case very very cool and that 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.989
 what is the extreme half left over and 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.840
 It is an assault rifle and sniper 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:41.600
 rifle and I mean no man now 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.640
 wore a mix between assault rifle 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.830
 and sniper rifle but one 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.620
 assault rifle and sniper rifles 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.000
 I could imagine that that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.709
 a storm rifle and then you can 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.739
 as if from a shot at 3 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.480
 Shots therefore change from assault rifle 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.880
 Snipers switch to say that you 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.709
 cool itself can shoot well 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.540
 can shoot bullets bullets because 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.970
 They can just look at the market 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.380
 because a brand mature is so to speak 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.510
 A storm rifle around the sniper 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.340
 gun but i think with that you 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.900
 really the other thing and I'm glad 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.470
 in any case very on this the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.420
 weapon 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.060
 Of course it will be the first day 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.130
 if that comes out a lot of gameplay 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.870
 from the whole we give that now 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.820
 everything for the multiplayer come now 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.550
 we go to extension and of course 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.800
 come out full episodes and if you 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.200
 do not know what episodes community 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.420
 There will be four episodes for all 4 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.640
 tsi it will be such a right extreme 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.840
 give short story and I have that 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.130
 Start that made me one 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.300
 livestream I do you know you 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.340
 maybe then i messed with it 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.630
 city the zombie maps live streamed 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.520
 and there we had a lot 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.290
 spectator that has you right 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.210
 I like it and I have the video too 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.340
 make this stupid is only in east ii's 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.500
 at the federal army but on the weekend is 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.790
 I always believe that at home and me 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 Hope in any case that we can 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.300
 somehow we managed that 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.220
 right on this weekend do that 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.450
 Tuesday is the whole thing out and 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.370
 I just thought that we would be like that 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.960
 directly on the weekend a livestream 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.790
 make that really cool 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.440
 and if you want to see then we go 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.550
 a thumbs up or leave it 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.590
 somehow know me in the comments 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.840
 will definitely be happy and how 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.490
 said if your gameplay and tips and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.500
 tricks and the whole of the whole 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.970
 you want to see directly on the release date then 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.710
 give me a thumb in any case 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.000
 go up and subscribe to everyone 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.470
 case i go with a lot of effort and 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.600
 when the outs come out 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.380
 with me always so three videos a day that 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.850
 is really blatant 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.980
 I always raise myself this way and that 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.960
 I've always looked important 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.060
 this time that gave me to the mountain house 2 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.920
 really fun too 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.870
 And he will definitely be quite whole 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.760
 give a lot of content on my channel 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.200
 that's it now but first of the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.880
 video if you are always up to date 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.890
 stand in matters call of duty ghost 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.570
 then stay subscribed to each one 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.280
 fall off my channel and if your friend 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.410
 that's what interests me too 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.060
 Let's see if you mean them 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.560
 maybe channel shows you can yes 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.980
 of course on my facebook page 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.200
 watch 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.090
 that are synonymous as I said all pictures of 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.340
 I just talked but that's 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.600
 posters that you see in the gamestop 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.400
 all images to a multiplayer maps 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.680
 so definitely have a look over and 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.300
 if you been there you can indeed times a 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.130
 I like it there leave that you no 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.450
