00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.180
 and now it's going to be a very radical way 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.830
 to get visits but we're going to be 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.120
 most watched video that we are definitely going to 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.420
 give it a little bit and where it comes from 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.420
 public 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.180
 very many lately I wake up 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:24.950
 imagining a tiny little hand of my 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.570
 son here telling me to caress him good 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.790
 your son has a sad beaver's voice 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.710
 world already speaks 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.119
 ok I'm telling you because if the child gives you 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.070
 he runs his hand down his face says good 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.300
 mommy days I love you so much the phrase 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.110
 next next is give me money 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.110
 points 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.560
 nothing is happening, there is already the problem 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.180
 the problem that people like you have 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.040
 who wants children is that they 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.600
 imagine yourself as little puppies of 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.130
 pandas bears and they are not like that the children 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.170
 they grow up and when they are ten they steal 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.760
 cars and when it's for the police they say 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.500
 not if he left me at home too 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.620
 to drive is that I'm dwarf they do it 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.270
 like that and 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.210
 that is, the child wanted to see his grandparents 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.210
 with her little sister in size when 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.530
 he dictated to him the heart that was angel this 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.150
 this is how grandparents have to see them 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.890
 when I interview the heart that lines 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.240
 milk the uncle who is 10 years he says takes 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.670
 the car to see his grandparents but that 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.200
 it's not normal that he kidnapped his sister 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.509
 you put her in the car and drove during 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.090
 10 kilometers stopped him the uncle of 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.619
 snowplow 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.420
 that is, the child not only leads but 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.250
 that the snow does not stop you that you have 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.780
 left thrown by four raindrops 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.369
 four drops it was not raining enough and it's 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.750
 dangerous to know the children of 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.580
 10 years do not think the same we see them 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.679
 because those children of his time have to 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.869
 evolve you are in the past have 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:38.090
 generate a year 2014 we are already in the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.080
 21st century the child is giving you 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.580
 tranquility 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.080
 petite of a heart attack tomorrow and take the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.060
 Car takes you to the hospital and saves you 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.170
 life that you get up on Sunday with 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.399
 Root mode is your fault 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.350
 you just put in the same bag the one 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.759
 the possibility to drive because it gives you a 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.170
 heart attack and the one that goes by the 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.729
 newspaper you do not want a child you want 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.380
 a very short slave that because he 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.140
 entertains makes you funny no no no yes 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.429
 I want that child I want that child that 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.900
 goes the next day to school and that his 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.160
 friends are there from 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.160
 a plasticine doll 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.330
 I think the voice is very faint 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.920
 exposed to the rest of the children the times very 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.240
 fake that you put that little voice and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.210
 that suddenly your son has a voice 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.860
 adult juárez was very lacking and second no 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.210
 it's normal or I do not want to go to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.710
 my girlfriend's house that sum of mikati has 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.210
 counted from when he stole the car not 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.770
 because the next thing is he has told you 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
 also when I steal the bank 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.640
 not because it's not normal because you start 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.220
 to stealing cars and they keep stealing 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.560
 banks and killing people is not first that 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.209
 giving things of restrictions 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.470
 has already got the seed of the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.940
 comparison in the rest of the children what 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.290
 happens if at 10 years your child is a dull 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.080
 if at 10 years old his son is not a ramón 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:50.330
 car has not done anything 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.740
 I do not know I do not want like 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.120
 they admire extras to record you are 30 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.120
 turns but you want 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.030
 but you want
