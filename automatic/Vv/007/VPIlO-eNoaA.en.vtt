00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
painting is extraordinarily complex and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:53.539 
painting is extraordinarily complex and
it's<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> painting<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.220> never<00:01:53.369> really

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
it's a painting that I never really

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.940 
it's a painting that I never really
fully<00:01:53.880> appreciated<00:01:54.450> until<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.899> began<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.680> look

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
fully appreciated until I began to look

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.350 
fully appreciated until I began to look
more<00:01:56.009> specifically<00:01:56.640> at<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.180> of<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
more specifically at a lot of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
more specifically at a lot of the
details<00:01:57.750> in<00:01:57.960> fact<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.040> probably<00:01:59.189> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
details in fact this is probably the

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.690 
details in fact this is probably the
most<00:01:59.610> widely<00:02:00.180> analyzed<00:02:00.810> paintings<00:02:01.579> with<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
most widely analyzed paintings with the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.609 
most widely analyzed paintings with the
exception<00:02:03.180> maybe<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.630> Diego<00:02:04.020> Velazquez<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
exception maybe of Diego Velazquez is

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
exception maybe of Diego Velazquez is
Las<00:02:04.799> Meninas<00:02:05.009> which<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.060> don't<00:02:06.390> believe<00:02:06.689> we've

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
Las Meninas which I don't believe we've

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
Las Meninas which I don't believe we've
looked<00:02:07.079> at<00:02:07.229> yet<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.619> we'll<00:02:07.770> probably<00:02:07.950> get<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
looked at yet and we'll probably get to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.059 
looked at yet and we'll probably get to
that<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.330> coming<00:02:09.629> weeks<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.110> this

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
that in the coming weeks and this

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.339 
that in the coming weeks and this
painting<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.489> specifically<00:02:11.970> apropos<00:02:12.450> for

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
painting is specifically apropos for

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.679 
painting is specifically apropos for
analyses<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.189> pertain<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.689> gender

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
analyses that pertain to gender

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.869 
analyses that pertain to gender
conventions<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.469> also<00:02:17.069> commodification<00:02:17.489> and

conventions and also commodification and

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.099 
conventions and also commodification and
I'm<00:02:18.060> not<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.299> to<00:02:18.359> get<00:02:18.480> into<00:02:18.689> that<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.840> lot

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
I'm not going to get into that a lot

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.640 
I'm not going to get into that a lot
because<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.859> kind<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.159> annoyed<00:02:20.430> when<00:02:21.650> our

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
because I get kind of annoyed when our

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.250 
because I get kind of annoyed when our
textbooks<00:02:23.310> go<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:23.909> kind<00:02:24.299> of<00:02:24.329> ad<00:02:24.480> nauseam<00:02:25.019> about

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
textbooks go on kind of ad nauseam about

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.009 
textbooks go on kind of ad nauseam about
you<00:02:25.889> know<00:02:26.010> analyzing<00:02:26.879> paintings<00:02:27.599> in<00:02:27.900> the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
you know analyzing paintings in the

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.899 
you know analyzing paintings in the
context<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> communism<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.430> commodification

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
context of communism and commodification

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.789 
context of communism and commodification
and<00:02:30.389> gender<00:02:30.750> rules<00:02:30.900> because<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.439> stuff<00:02:31.680> is

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
and gender rules because that stuff is

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:33.740 
and gender rules because that stuff is
just<00:02:32.010> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.310> done<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.670> death<00:02:32.879> so<00:02:33.569> I'm<00:02:33.629> going

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
just kind of done to death so I'm going

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.030 
just kind of done to death so I'm going
to<00:02:33.810> try<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:33.930> shy<00:02:34.200> away<00:02:34.319> from<00:02:34.439> that<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.739> little

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
to try to shy away from that a little

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.379 
to try to shy away from that a little
and<00:02:35.189> look<00:02:35.340> more<00:02:35.549> at<00:02:35.819> just<00:02:36.030> sort<00:02:36.239> of<00:02:36.299> a

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
and look more at just sort of a

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:37.910 
and look more at just sort of a
descriptive<00:02:36.870> analysis<00:02:37.319> of<00:02:37.439> this<00:02:37.530> painting

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
descriptive analysis of this painting

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.330 
descriptive analysis of this painting
rather<00:02:38.519> than<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:38.819> critical<00:02:39.030> analysis<00:02:40.189> and<00:02:41.189> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
rather than a critical analysis and the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.250 
rather than a critical analysis and the
big<00:02:41.489> thing<00:02:41.700> of<00:02:41.790> course<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.269> this<00:02:42.450> mirror<00:02:42.810> this

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
big thing of course is this mirror this

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.809 
big thing of course is this mirror this
woman<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.859> standing<00:02:44.099> in<00:02:44.340> front<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.639> very

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
woman is standing in front of a very

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.819 
woman is standing in front of a very
large<00:02:45.090> mirror<00:02:45.689> and<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.900> majority<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.379> what<00:02:46.709> we

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
large mirror and the majority of what we

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.649 
large mirror and the majority of what we
see<00:02:47.099> in<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.549> canvas<00:02:47.819> is<00:02:48.030> actually<00:02:48.419> just<00:02:48.540> a

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
see in this canvas is actually just a

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.920 
see in this canvas is actually just a
reflection<00:02:49.639> the<00:02:50.639> the<00:02:50.879> mirror<00:02:51.180> ends<00:02:51.719> if<00:02:51.840> you

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
reflection the the mirror ends if you

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.500 
reflection the the mirror ends if you
look<00:02:52.109> kind<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.769> right<00:02:53.069> above<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
look kind of right above the the

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.809 
look kind of right above the the
barmaids<00:02:55.019> right<00:02:55.500> arm<00:02:55.829> kind<00:02:56.459> of<00:02:56.549> where<00:02:56.669> that

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
barmaids right arm kind of where that

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:58.369 
barmaids right arm kind of where that
gold<00:02:57.090> band<00:02:57.359> is<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.750> goes<00:02:57.870> around<00:02:58.019> her

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
gold band is that goes around her

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:00.619 
gold band is that goes around her
forearm<00:02:59.189> just<00:02:59.370> below<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.299> can<00:03:00.419> kind<00:03:00.569> of

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
forearm just below that you can kind of

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.589 
forearm just below that you can kind of
see<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.930> gold<00:03:01.230> trim<00:03:02.129> that<00:03:02.699> denotes<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.449> edge

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
see the gold trim that denotes the edge

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.330 
see the gold trim that denotes the edge
of<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.959> mirror<00:03:04.199> and<00:03:04.349> everything<00:03:04.530> above<00:03:05.280> that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
of the mirror and everything above that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.629 
of the mirror and everything above that
is<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.599> reflection<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.340> have<00:03:08.459> this

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
is just a reflection so we have this

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.289 
is just a reflection so we have this
giant<00:03:09.030> mirror<00:03:10.340> behind<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.639> bar<00:03:11.879> and<00:03:12.090> we<00:03:12.180> can

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
giant mirror behind this bar and we can

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.869 
giant mirror behind this bar and we can
kind<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.540> imagine<00:03:12.659> us<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.469> the<00:03:14.189> viewer<00:03:14.430> walking

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
kind of imagine us as the viewer walking

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:17.899 
kind of imagine us as the viewer walking
up<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.260> bar<00:03:16.409> maybe<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.949> order<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.519> glass

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
up to to the bar maybe to order a glass

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:22.550 
up to to the bar maybe to order a glass
of<00:03:18.090> wine<00:03:18.329> or<00:03:18.629> or<00:03:19.229> some<00:03:19.699> sort<00:03:20.699> of<00:03:20.759> drink<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.689> if

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
you look at the placement specifically

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.819 
you look at the placement specifically
of<00:03:24.239> these<00:03:24.359> wine<00:03:24.599> bottles<00:03:25.019> that<00:03:25.229> the<00:03:25.409> champagne

in<00:03:36.900> reality<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.739> reflection<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.430> the

in reality and the reflection in the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.219 
in reality and the reflection in the
mirror<00:03:38.549> leads<00:03:38.939> us<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> believe<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:40.079> this

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
mirror leads us to believe that this

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:43.460 
mirror leads us to believe that this
mirror<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.620> just<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.949> flat<00:03:41.659> mirror<00:03:42.659> that<00:03:43.109> runs

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
mirror is just a flat mirror that runs

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.619 
mirror is just a flat mirror that runs
behind<00:03:43.919> the<00:03:44.669> bar<00:03:44.849> but<00:03:45.060> there's<00:03:45.299> something

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
behind the bar but there's something

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.809 
behind the bar but there's something
interesting<00:03:45.810> about<00:03:46.319> these<00:03:46.470> bottles<00:03:46.919> notice

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
interesting about these bottles notice

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.210 
interesting about these bottles notice
when<00:03:48.269> we<00:03:48.389> look<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.659> these<00:03:48.810> bottles<00:03:49.259> in<00:03:49.620> reality

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
when we look at these bottles in reality

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.069 
when we look at these bottles in reality
and<00:03:50.310> by<00:03:50.400> reality<00:03:50.819> I<00:03:50.879> mean<00:03:51.120> not<00:03:51.389> the<00:03:51.540> reflection

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
and by reality I mean not the reflection

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.740 
and by reality I mean not the reflection
I<00:03:52.139> mean<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.409> actual<00:03:52.790> physical<00:03:53.790> bottles<00:03:54.209> the

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
I mean the actual physical bottles the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.719 
I mean the actual physical bottles the
right<00:03:55.079> on<00:03:55.349> kind<00:03:55.620> of<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> inner<00:03:56.040> edge<00:03:56.310> of<00:03:56.579> the

right on kind of the inner edge of the

right on kind of the inner edge of the

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
bar right by the bar maids hand so we

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:00.770 
bar right by the bar maids hand so we
would<00:03:59.099> expect<00:03:59.159> that<00:03:59.579> in<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.150> reflection<00:04:00.750> the

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
would expect that in the reflection the

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.469 
would expect that in the reflection the
bottles<00:04:01.319> would<00:04:01.560> be<00:04:01.849> very<00:04:02.849> close<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> edge

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
bottles would be very close to the edge

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.629 
bottles would be very close to the edge
of<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.750> bar<00:04:03.959> on<00:04:04.259> the<00:04:04.769> edge<00:04:04.889> closest<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.619

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.019

reflection they appear to be far away
from<00:04:26.960> them<00:04:27.080> here<00:04:27.260> so<00:04:28.100> there's<00:04:28.280> something

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
from them here so there's something

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.020 
from them here so there's something
weird<00:04:29.420> going<00:04:29.660> on<00:04:30.440> here<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.889> also<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.610> barmaid

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
weird going on here and also the barmaid

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.270 
weird going on here and also the barmaid
her<00:04:32.330> reflection<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:32.900> completely<00:04:33.380> wrong<00:04:33.560> if

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
her reflection is completely wrong if

her reflection is completely wrong if
this<00:04:34.460> is<00:04:34.580> a<00:04:34.610> flat<00:04:34.850> mirror<00:04:35.150> we<00:04:35.270> should<00:04:35.630> see<00:04:35.780> her

this is a flat mirror we should see her

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.480 
this is a flat mirror we should see her
reflection<00:04:36.080> should<00:04:36.560> be<00:04:36.620> directly<00:04:37.040> behind<00:04:37.190> her

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010
