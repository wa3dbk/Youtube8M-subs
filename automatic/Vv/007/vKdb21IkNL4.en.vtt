00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.180
 we are really in the concrete 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.379
 that is to say that everyone was waiting 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.240
 this moment with impatience 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.570
 we went as fast as possible Mt. 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.660
 born on August 25 and since last night the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.699
 drilling began May 20 triary they 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.070
 have to reach I think the cavity 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 in the afternoon of today for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.740
 then start to emerge the pump and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.740
 to pump 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.040
 twenty holes in this glacier 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.570
 each time we measured the pressure 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.120
 water when there was water 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.660
 when cavities on the bottom have been detected 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.850
 glacier 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.850
 this water pressure we noticed 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.290
 that it was identical on each of 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.750
 drilling so we know perfectly 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.580
 the altitude of the water column so the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.220
 water pressure on some boreholes 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.680
 we even saw that the water repressed so a 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.960
 little more in laval we have water that 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.699
 pushes back to the surface that is to say that the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.030
 water pressure is greater than 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.559
 the thickness of the glacier and that's it 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.330
 by the way who told us that there 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.909
 had a risk with this pocket of water 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.229
 that it was absolutely necessary to drain more 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.229
 quickly possible is the post 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.410
 damn it's said 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.770
 the certainty of having a pocket 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.479
 of liquid water in the glacier we 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.060
 have it from the beginning since the middle 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.310
 of the month of July twelve days after 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.080
 we completely informed the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.680
 population during meetings 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.680
 public 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.960
 we are now barely a month 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.710
 after confirmation of this 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.740
 discovery 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.649
 the site is launched you see it 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.340
 the population safeguarding plan 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.670
 is set up 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.460
 I tend to think that the services 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.640
 of state and municipal authority have 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.799
 reacted in the fastest way and I 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.799
 think in a fairly efficient way 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 I have my
