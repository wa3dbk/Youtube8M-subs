which<00:04:19.430> is<00:04:19.609> hilarious<00:04:19.850> but<00:04:20.690> all<00:04:20.840> around<00:04:21.019> I

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
which is hilarious but all around I

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.800 
which is hilarious but all around I
think<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.220> book<00:04:22.430> is<00:04:22.700> better<00:04:22.940> than<00:04:23.270> the<00:04:23.390> movie

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
think the book is better than the movie

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.050 
think the book is better than the movie
because<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:25.390> all<00:04:26.390> of<00:04:27.080> these<00:04:27.350> story<00:04:28.220> lines<00:04:28.340> come

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
because of all of these story lines come

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.210 
because of all of these story lines come
together<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.810> are<00:04:30.230> not<00:04:30.470> left<00:04:30.770> with<00:04:30.920> these

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
together and are not left with these

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.390 
together and are not left with these
questions<00:04:31.850> and<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.570> really<00:04:33.560> just<00:04:33.590> had<00:04:33.980> maybe

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
questions and I really just had maybe

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.760 
questions and I really just had maybe
it's<00:04:34.700> because<00:04:34.910> I'm<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.240> bookworm<00:04:35.810> I'm<00:04:36.230> not<00:04:36.440> sure

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
it's because I'm a bookworm I'm not sure

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.460 
it's because I'm a bookworm I'm not sure
but<00:04:37.430> it<00:04:37.760> is<00:04:38.030> much<00:04:38.360> more<00:04:38.630> enjoyable<00:04:38.930> than<00:04:39.230> the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
but it is much more enjoyable than the

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.760 
but it is much more enjoyable than the
movie<00:04:39.800> I<00:04:40.040> still<00:04:40.730> love<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.630> movie<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.200> give<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:42.710> a

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.300 
movie I still love the movie I give it a
10<00:04:43.040> out<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.190> 10<00:04:43.310> but<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.630> think<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.290> book<00:04:45.530> just

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.960 
10 out of 10 but I think the book just
is<00:04:47.080> fuller<00:04:48.080> it<00:04:48.800> is<00:04:49.010> drama<00:04:49.430> comedy<00:04:50.330> adventure

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
is fuller it is drama comedy adventure

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.180 
is fuller it is drama comedy adventure
