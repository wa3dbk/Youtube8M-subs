I'm<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.070> trying<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> confuse<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.880> by<00:01:09.000> using

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
I'm not trying to confuse you by using

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'm not trying to confuse you by using
two<00:01:09.479> different<00:01:09.630> terms<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.830> last<00:01:11.040> lesson<00:01:11.460> I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
two different terms in the last lesson I

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.530 
two different terms in the last lesson I
talked<00:01:11.909> about<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.210> difference<00:01:12.479> between

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
talked about the difference between

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.870 
talked about the difference between
dependent<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.530> independent<00:01:14.070> clauses<00:01:14.520> and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
dependent and independent clauses and

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.749 
dependent and independent clauses and
those<00:01:15.330> terms<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:16.140> clear<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.040> helpfully

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
those terms are clear and helpfully

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.630 
those terms are clear and helpfully
contrasts<00:01:18.180> with<00:01:18.390> one<00:01:18.540> another<00:01:18.799> in<00:01:19.799> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
contrasts with one another in this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.890 
contrasts with one another in this
lesson<00:01:20.850> I'll<00:01:21.060> call<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.390> subordinate

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
lesson I'll call them subordinate

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
lesson I'll call them subordinate
clauses<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> word<00:01:23.070> captures<00:01:23.580> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
clauses because that word captures the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.310 
clauses because that word captures the
relationship<00:01:24.240> between<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.600> main<00:01:24.750> clause<00:01:24.990> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
relationship between the main clause and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
relationship between the main clause and
the<00:01:25.439> baby<00:01:25.650> clause<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> much<00:01:26.280> better<00:01:26.750> let's

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
the baby clause is much better let's

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.390 
the baby clause is much better let's
look<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> subordinating<00:01:28.770> conjunctions

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
look at the subordinating conjunctions

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
look at the subordinating conjunctions
these<00:01:30.090> are<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> words<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.750> make<00:01:30.900> clauses

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
these are the words that make clauses

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.490 
these are the words that make clauses
into<00:01:31.590> servants<00:01:33.049> subordinating<00:01:34.049> conjunctions

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
into servants subordinating conjunctions

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.080 
into servants subordinating conjunctions
always<00:01:34.950> go<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> beginning<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.970> a

we<00:03:44.030> worked<00:03:44.209> hard<00:03:44.330> for<00:03:44.599> our<00:03:44.660> candidates<00:03:45.080> even

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
we worked hard for our candidates even

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.229 
we worked hard for our candidates even
though<00:03:45.560> we<00:03:45.680> suspected<00:03:46.220> they<00:03:46.610> didn't<00:03:46.910> stand<00:03:47.120> a

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
though we suspected they didn't stand a

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.960 
though we suspected they didn't stand a
chance<00:03:48.370> I've<00:03:49.370> highlighted<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
chance I've highlighted the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.720 
chance I've highlighted the
subordinating<00:03:50.599> conjunctions<00:03:51.140> here<00:03:51.730> notice

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
subordinating conjunctions here notice

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.580 
subordinating conjunctions here notice
first<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.360> can<00:03:53.510> subordinate<00:03:54.019> either<00:03:54.230> of

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
first that you can subordinate either of

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.289 
first that you can subordinate either of
the<00:03:54.799> two<00:03:54.950> clauses<00:03:55.250> depending<00:03:55.970> on<00:03:56.060> what<00:03:56.209> you

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
the two clauses depending on what you

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.110 
the two clauses depending on what you
want<00:03:56.480> to<00:03:56.510> say<00:03:56.829> notice<00:03:57.829> also<00:03:58.069> that<00:03:58.489> only<00:03:58.880> the

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
want to say notice also that only the

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.520 
want to say notice also that only the
last<00:03:59.269> one<00:03:59.450> of<00:03:59.690> these<00:03:59.810> really<00:04:00.110> makes<00:04:00.290> sense

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
last one of these really makes sense

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.620 
last one of these really makes sense
we'll<00:04:01.370> talk<00:04:01.519> about<00:04:01.670> how<00:04:01.849> subordination<00:04:02.360> can

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
we'll talk about how subordination can

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.569 
we'll talk about how subordination can
go<00:04:02.780> wrong<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.170> a<00:04:03.230> minute<00:04:03.530> but<00:04:03.980> take<00:04:04.130> a<00:04:04.160> second

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
go wrong in a minute but take a second

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.640 
go wrong in a minute but take a second
to<00:04:04.910> think<00:04:05.060> about<00:04:05.329> why<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.599> first<00:04:06.019> two<00:04:06.230> aren't

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
to think about why the first two aren't

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.150 
to think about why the first two aren't
self-explanatory<00:04:12.010> remember<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.130> a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
self-explanatory remember that a

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.500 
self-explanatory remember that a
subordinate<00:04:13.639> clause<00:04:13.790> that<00:04:14.090> opens<00:04:14.420> the

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
subordinate clause that opens the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.039 
subordinate clause that opens the
sentence<00:04:14.900> is<00:04:15.049> always<00:04:15.680> set<00:04:15.889> off<00:04:16.010> by<00:04:16.220> a<00:04:16.250> comma

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.180 

one<00:04:21.049> great<00:04:21.200> thing<00:04:21.229> about<00:04:21.380> subordination<00:04:21.979> is

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
one great thing about subordination is

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.529 
one great thing about subordination is
that<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:22.490> can<00:04:22.639> move<00:04:22.789> subordinate<00:04:23.360> clauses

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
that you can move subordinate clauses

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:25.659 
that you can move subordinate clauses
pretty<00:04:24.020> freely<00:04:24.229> around<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.250> sentence

pretty freely around as a sentence

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.640 
pretty freely around as a sentence

opener a subordinate clause supplies a

opener a subordinate clause supplies a

before we finish up let's think about

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.220 
before we finish up let's think about
how<00:05:28.500> subordination<00:05:29.100> can<00:05:29.430> go<00:05:29.550> wrong<00:05:30.230> mistake
