is all we need there are three types of

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.980 
is all we need there are three types of
compressors<00:02:45.950> centrifugal<00:02:46.950> screw<00:02:47.610> and

compressors<00:02:52.500> we<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:53.340> mount<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.760> sensor<00:02:54.270> on

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
compressors we would mount the sensor on

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.360 
compressors we would mount the sensor on
both<00:02:55.140> ends<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.740> compressor<00:02:56.550> shaft<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:58.370> the

screw compressor down the bottom right

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.190

we'd<00:03:01.920> mount<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.310> sensor<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:03.000> each<00:03:03.690> bearing

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
we'd mount the sensor on each bearing

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.330 
we'd mount the sensor on each bearing
location<00:03:04.860> again<00:03:05.520> on<00:03:05.870> each<00:03:06.870> end<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.470> shaft

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
blowers are either centrifugal type or

of the compressor or blower and the lobe
types<00:03:25.200> blower<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:26.340> would<00:03:26.520> measure<00:03:26.820> from<00:03:27.330> the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
types blower we would measure from the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.780

let's<00:03:32.970> talk<00:03:33.120> about<00:03:33.180> fans<00:03:33.980> the<00:03:34.980> picture<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
let's talk about fans the picture on the

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.360 
let's talk about fans the picture on the
left<00:03:35.580> shows<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.299> belt<00:03:36.660> driven<00:03:36.870> fan<00:03:37.380> we<00:03:38.190> would

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
left shows a belt driven fan we would

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.090 
left shows a belt driven fan we would
measure<00:03:38.989> bearing<00:03:39.989> number<00:03:40.110> two<00:03:40.530> on<00:03:40.709> the<00:03:40.860> motor

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
measure bearing number two on the motor

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.229 
measure bearing number two on the motor
bearing<00:03:42.000> number<00:03:42.239> three<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.930> four<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.650> fan

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
bearing number three and four on the fan

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.390 
bearing number three and four on the fan
the<00:03:45.239> picture<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.870> right<00:03:45.900> shows<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.830> coupled

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
the picture on the right shows a coupled

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.920 
the picture on the right shows a coupled
fan<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.330> large

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
fan it's large

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.470 
fan it's large
so<00:03:49.260> we'd<00:03:49.410> measure<00:03:49.680> bearings<00:03:50.250> from<00:03:51.000> all<00:03:51.209> four

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
so we'd measure bearings from all four

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.130 
so we'd measure bearings from all four
locations<00:03:52.940> from<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.000> two<00:03:54.329> motor<00:03:54.600> bearings

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
locations from the two motor bearings

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.100 
locations from the two motor bearings
and<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.980> two<00:03:56.220> fan<00:03:56.880> bearings<00:03:59.989> lastly<00:04:00.989> let's

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
and the two fan bearings lastly let's

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.039 
and the two fan bearings lastly let's
talk<00:04:01.290> about<00:04:01.470> gears<00:04:01.980> we<00:04:02.730> need<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.060> collect<00:04:03.810> data

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
talk about gears we need to collect data

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.009 
talk about gears we need to collect data
from<00:04:04.530> at<00:04:04.739> least<00:04:05.070> one<00:04:05.670> bearing<00:04:06.209> on<00:04:06.420> each<00:04:06.690> shaft

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
from at least one bearing on each shaft

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.340 
from at least one bearing on each shaft
so<00:04:08.010> in<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.340> case<00:04:08.610> we<00:04:09.360> would<00:04:09.510> take<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.780> reading

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
so in this case we would take a reading

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.990 
so in this case we would take a reading
from<00:04:11.239> location<00:04:12.239> 3<00:04:12.750> for<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.290> shaft<00:04:14.000> location

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
from location 3 for this shaft location

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.890 
from location 3 for this shaft location
4<00:04:15.329> for<00:04:15.720> this<00:04:15.930> shaft<00:04:16.229> and<00:04:16.640> location<00:04:17.640> 5<00:04:17.970> for<00:04:18.690> this

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
4 for this shaft and location 5 for this

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:31.480 
4 for this shaft and location 5 for this
shaft

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.550
