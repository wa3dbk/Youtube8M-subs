he's just like keep away from the cube
up<00:03:01.640> there<00:03:02.060> there<00:03:02.390> that<00:03:02.569> was<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.690> good<00:03:02.810> start<00:03:03.080> and

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
up there there that was a good start and

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400 
up there there that was a good start and
just<00:03:05.000> absolutely<00:03:05.330> flat<00:03:05.870> out<00:03:06.019> all<00:03:06.049> the<00:03:06.290> way

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
just absolutely flat out all the way

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.199 
just absolutely flat out all the way
it's<00:03:06.590> as<00:03:06.739> fast<00:03:07.280> as<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.549> could<00:03:07.670> go<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> Dane

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
as much and them just try and keep it a

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.400 
as much and them just try and keep it a
bit<00:04:54.770> more<00:04:55.420> give<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.510> a<00:04:56.600> bit<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.900> break<00:04:57.170> and

from<00:05:00.200> 10<00:05:00.410> to<00:05:00.650> 8<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.610> thought<00:05:01.970> I<00:05:02.000> best<00:05:02.270> go

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
from 10 to 8 so I thought I best go

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.120 
from 10 to 8 so I thought I best go
again<00:05:02.660> on<00:05:02.690> last<00:05:02.960> lap<00:05:03.170> and<00:05:03.380> had<00:05:03.680> another<00:05:03.950> little

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
again on last lap and had another little

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.160 
again on last lap and had another little
go<00:05:04.370> on<00:05:04.430> last<00:05:04.640> lap<00:05:04.910> but<00:05:05.090> I'm<00:05:05.210> just<00:05:05.450> loving<00:05:06.050> it

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
go on last lap but I'm just loving it

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.840 
go on last lap but I'm just loving it
and<00:05:06.260> just<00:05:06.440> enjoying<00:05:06.830> being<00:05:07.580> back

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
and just enjoying being back

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.760 
and just enjoying being back
well<00:05:08.690> you're<00:05:08.810> conscious<00:05:09.140> you'd<00:05:09.290> built<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.590> lead

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
well you're conscious you'd built a lead

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.650 
well you're conscious you'd built a lead
so<00:05:10.070> early<00:05:10.370> in<00:05:10.460> the<00:05:10.550> race<00:05:10.700> or<00:05:10.910> seven<00:05:11.240> seconds

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
so early in the race or seven seconds

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.120 
so early in the race or seven seconds
but<00:05:11.780> yeah<00:05:11.990> I<00:05:12.020> think<00:05:12.320> I'm<00:05:12.440> up<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.620> I've<00:05:12.950> seen

but yeah I think I'm up to I've seen
seven<00:05:13.490> seconds<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.090> thought<00:05:14.240> that's<00:05:14.570> all<00:05:14.750> add

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
seven seconds and thought that's all add

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.830 
seven seconds and thought that's all add
at<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.200> end<00:05:15.230> of<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.620> first<00:05:15.860> race<00:05:16.540> or<00:05:17.540> anything

at the end of the first race or anything

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.230 
at the end of the first race or anything
can<00:05:18.110> happen<00:05:18.200> around<00:05:18.440> in<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:19.040> the<00:05:19.280> Superstock
