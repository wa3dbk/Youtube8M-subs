00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 or do not die not all I bring you a 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.830
 new tutorial and the tutorial I will teach you 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.420
 to root your penco 45.7 and others 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.759
 devices of the brand and not of the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.590
 brand in a fairly simple way and 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.379
 well then in this video we will use 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.910
 an application that is called flama root and 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.580
 good you will find it in the description 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.199
 to download because it is downloaded from 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.960
 google play so good you have to 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.939
 download from the web then good 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.890
 As you can see, the interface is very simple, 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.470
 it has too much stereo and it's very easy 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.260
 to use and good first thing 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 we would have to do would be give it here 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 to give the option to install 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.290
 supersur then what we have to 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 to do is to try before the different 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.730
 options that come out as you see 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
 I'm testing on a moon and in the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.620
 first not in the second either and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.480
 then the third as you see me going to 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.160
 put your is then as you see that 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 it means that I no longer have a route where 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.270
 my device and good as you see has been 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.600
 very simple to what we had to do 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 would restart our betis 5.7 and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 others let's restart it and when 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.060
 this restarted and so on we will see that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.330
 we have a new application that is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.490
 super psuv and good that's the application 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.979
 to verify that we have the root and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.070
 others and there we can enjoy the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.530
 rut we can install the ex post and 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.050
 many functions that entails the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.330
 root then the truth has been is very 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.830
 simple as you can see already 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 better then I have three 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.060
 options but the best you get less 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.750
 they come out more and well that be and go testing 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.380
 and the one that comes out is that it's the one 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.780
 It is worth it if you see that none of them comes out 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.780
 it is simply because it serves us 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.030
 for your phone then well we 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.819
 It's for everyone, but the great 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.380
 majority yes then good now let's 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.360
 unlock the device so that 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.720
 you can see we have the super psuv 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.490
 let's give the box and let's see what 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.500
 yes we have super sub as you see what 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.289
 we have here we are going to open now the 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.330
 application so you can see why then 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.679
 yes it is and others as you see good 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.660
 now no application comes out because 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.910
 do not 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 only none with ruth but as you see 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.200
 we already have the root and you know 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.180
 see them like favorites and subscribe no 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.870
 you are and we'll see each other until the next 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.870
 goodbye
