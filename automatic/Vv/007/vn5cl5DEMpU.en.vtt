00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.950
 welcome everyone on my channel such 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:10.519
 small report of a small run on 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 gas than drove the first 100 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 120 km which I can do 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.730
 Conclusion Enumeration that the car I Volga 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.350
 it is supposed to be for gas 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:29.699
 gas is not her gas works very 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:34.380
 Well , I have a lot of impressions to me 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.120
 I like how it works such a principle 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.829
 question to switch to gas or not 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.989
 switch to gas definitely yes 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.360
 works very well but we'll see 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.320
 it will take time as she will herself 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.980
 carry on at least now I'm off 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.660
 ignition adjustment had to be steep in 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.469
 plus just a little bit barely 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.280
 as the head here is a little forced 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:04.129
 never repaired the engine 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.170
 no pledge and removed a very large layer with 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.950
 milled so the compression ratio here 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.400
 raised in principle both on gas and 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.830
 on gasoline up to 95 works on it 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.210
 very fine now arrived on gas 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.350
 on gasoline did not turn off decided to unscrew 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.649
 candle one to start to see how she 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:30.860
 behaves like a mixture 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.420
 transfer to or poor but general here 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.330
 candle 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.920
 now at the tomb show amid somewhere 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.920
 dark so she focused on 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.149
 candles visible brown nagar candle in 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.460
 perfect condition the most important thing is very 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:52.039
 clean not like gasoline 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.479
 after gasoline besides the fact that she is 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.450
 also was with me, he brown 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.360
 so but about the same at all 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.679
 four cylinders but due to the fact that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.899
 gasoline a lot of incomprehensible additives 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.929
 this is naturally all postponed 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:13.549
 on candles and in sight was visible besides 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:15.440
 brown nagara incomprehensible fraction on 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.540
 gas it is not all clean everything is fine 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.390
 also works on easy start up on 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.430
 gas in the morning now thank God on the street 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.070
 not so cold in the garage come me already 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.910
 10 degrees have a garage in the morning that is 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.100
 gas request very much again 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.200
 I can say that the impressions are very 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.170
 positive and go to gas costs 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.609
 with due regard for him naturally 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:46.060
 we want to inherit and do as it 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:49.310
 bye everyone thanks for your attention 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.760
 there are a lot of interesting things ahead 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.760
 see you all
