alright today we're going to be dealing

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.200 
alright today we're going to be dealing
with<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.480> slightly<00:00:07.200> more<00:00:07.410> advanced<00:00:07.859> concept<00:00:08.400> in

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
with a slightly more advanced concept in

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.820 
with a slightly more advanced concept in
that<00:00:09.420> one<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:09.929> be<00:00:10.050> counting<00:00:10.650> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that one we're going to be counting and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.129 
that one we're going to be counting and
two<00:00:11.519> we're<00:00:11.730> going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> be<00:00:12.000> dealing<00:00:12.509> with<00:00:12.719> more

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
two we're going to be dealing with more

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.609 
two we're going to be dealing with more
complex<00:00:13.920> combinations<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.759> voices<00:00:15.230> and<00:00:16.230> we're

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
complex combinations of voices and we're

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.790 
complex combinations of voices and we're
going<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.859> subdividing<00:00:17.580> longer<00:00:18.240> phrases

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
going to be subdividing longer phrases

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.910 
going to be subdividing longer phrases
so<00:00:19.800> we'll<00:00:20.550> just<00:00:20.580> get<00:00:20.910> right<00:00:21.060> into<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.920> let's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
so we'll just get right into it let's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
so we'll just get right into it let's
say<00:00:23.070> we're<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.340> going<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.490> deal<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.850> eight

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
say we're just going to deal with eight

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.080 
say we're just going to deal with eight
beats<00:00:24.960> that's<00:00:25.439> going<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.680> be<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.640> length<00:00:26.849> of

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
beats that's going to be the length of

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.210 
beats that's going to be the length of
phrase<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:27.840> we're<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> build<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:29.189> we

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
phrase that we're going to build so we

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.049 
phrase that we're going to build so we
would<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:30.210> two<00:00:30.750> three<00:00:31.560> four<00:00:32.099> five<00:00:32.730> six

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
would have one two three four five six

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.920 
would have one two three four five six
seven<00:00:33.750> eight<00:00:34.380> okay<00:00:35.340> from<00:00:36.149> there<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.690> could

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
seven eight okay from there we could

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.389 
seven eight okay from there we could
just<00:00:37.050> play<00:00:37.290> those<00:00:37.710> beats<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.250> would<00:00:38.370> just

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
just play those beats and we would just

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.069 
just play those beats and we would just
have<00:00:38.579> eight<00:00:39.030> notes<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.600> could<00:00:39.719> play<00:00:39.930> with

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
have eight notes that we could play with

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
have eight notes that we could play with
so<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.950> two<00:00:41.460> three<00:00:42.210> four<00:00:42.780> five<00:00:42.840> six<00:00:43.710> seven

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
so one two three four five six seven

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.910 
so one two three four five six seven
eight<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.289> make<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.559> little<00:00:46.649> bit<00:00:46.829> more

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
eight but to make it a little bit more

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.990 
eight but to make it a little bit more
interesting<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.340> give<00:00:47.430> us<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> little<00:00:47.730> bit<00:00:47.850> more

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
interesting to give us a little bit more

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
interesting to give us a little bit more
to<00:00:48.090> work<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.300> we're<00:00:48.690> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> use<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to work with we're going to use the the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.439 
to work with we're going to use the the
eighth<00:00:50.579> note<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> notes<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.420> are

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
eighth note so the notes that are

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.910 
eighth note so the notes that are
halfway<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.960> between<00:00:52.020> each<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.500> those<00:00:52.590> pulses

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
halfway in between each of those pulses

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
halfway in between each of those pulses
so<00:00:53.160> we'd<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> three<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
so we'd have one and two and three and

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.220 
so we'd have one and two and three and
four<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.129> five<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.699> six<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.480> seven<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
four and five and six and seven and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.520 
four and five and six and seven and
eight<00:00:58.789> ok<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.449> there<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:01.020> basically<00:01:01.379> gives

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
eight ok from there that basically gives

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.990 
eight ok from there that basically gives
us<00:01:01.739> 16<00:01:02.309> notes<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.789> we<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.030> use<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.290> build<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
us 16 notes that we can use to build a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.969 
us 16 notes that we can use to build a
rhythmic<00:01:06.000> phrase<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.619> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> choose

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
rhythmic phrase I'm just going to choose

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.020 
rhythmic phrase I'm just going to choose
arbitrarily<00:01:08.340> um<00:01:09.830> 5056<00:01:10.830> obviously<00:01:11.670> pulling

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
arbitrarily um 5056 obviously pulling

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
arbitrarily um 5056 obviously pulling
out<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.240> math<00:01:12.390> cap<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:13.290> have<00:01:13.500> five<00:01:13.740> plus<00:01:14.010> five

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
out the math cap we have five plus five

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.480 
out the math cap we have five plus five
equals<00:01:14.220> 10<00:01:14.670> 10<00:01:15.150> plus<00:01:15.390> six<00:01:15.659> equals<00:01:15.840> 16<00:01:16.500> first

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
equals 10 10 plus six equals 16 first

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.070 
equals 10 10 plus six equals 16 first
I'm<00:01:17.640> just<00:01:17.700> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.970> play<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.150> for<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.540> I'm

the<00:01:53.450> 13<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.689> 6<00:01:55.140> 1<00:01:55.799> 2<00:01:56.460> 3<00:01:56.579> 4<00:01:57.409> 10<00:01:58.409> 2

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
the 13 and 6 1 2 3 4 10 2

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.890 
the 13 and 6 1 2 3 4 10 2
four<00:01:59.650> five<00:01:59.950> six<00:02:00.190> one<00:02:00.400> three<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.700> five<00:02:00.850> of<00:02:01.330> that

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
four five six one three and five of that

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.730 
four five six one three and five of that
final<00:02:02.140> six<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:04.660> what<00:02:04.930> we<00:02:05.050> can<00:02:05.170> do<00:02:05.320> is<00:02:05.560> we

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
final six so now what we can do is we

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.310 
final six so now what we can do is we
can<00:02:05.770> change<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.790> voices<00:02:07.150> just<00:02:07.420> just

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
can change up the voices just just

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.630 
can change up the voices just just
changing<00:02:08.770> two<00:02:08.890> voices<00:02:09.100> out<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:09.399> are<00:02:09.610> a

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
changing two voices out there are a

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.250 
changing two voices out there are a
couple<00:02:09.759> voices<00:02:10.210> out<00:02:10.330> of<00:02:10.450> there<00:02:10.540> you're<00:02:11.020> going

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
couple voices out of there you're going

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.080 
couple voices out of there you're going
to<00:02:11.440> modify<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.100> way<00:02:12.340> that<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.880> pattern

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
to modify the way that that pattern

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.550 
to modify the way that that pattern
feels<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:13.960> we'll<00:02:14.170> go<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:15.700> two<00:02:16.300> three<00:02:17.020> four

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560

didn't<00:02:40.360> play<00:02:40.480> consistently<00:02:40.990> each<00:02:41.140> time<00:02:41.200> you

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
didn't play consistently each time you

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.380 
didn't play consistently each time you
get<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.830> picture<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.280> change<00:02:42.580> one<00:02:42.940> voice<00:02:43.150> out

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
get the picture you change one voice out

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.810 
get the picture you change one voice out
of<00:02:43.480> there<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.780> get<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:45.100> modify<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.610> way

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
of there you get a you modify the way

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.860 
of there you get a you modify the way
that<00:02:46.060> it<00:02:46.270> feels<00:02:47.130> now<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.970> add<00:02:49.330> a<00:02:49.360> little<00:02:49.570> bit<00:02:49.810> of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
that it feels now to add a little bit of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.840 
that it feels now to add a little bit of
density<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.440> that<00:02:50.620> pattern<00:02:51.040> we're<00:02:51.670> going<00:02:51.790> to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
density to that pattern we're going to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.640 
density to that pattern we're going to
play<00:02:52.030> all<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.510> notes<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.200> sixteenth

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
play all of the notes all the sixteenth

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.620 
play all of the notes all the sixteenth
notes<00:02:53.860> available<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.459> us<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:54.790> it'd<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.060> one<00:02:57.630> six

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
notes available to us so it'd be one six

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.270 
notes available to us so it'd be one six
seven<00:02:59.320> eight<00:02:59.520> notice<00:03:00.520> I'm<00:03:00.700> going

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.560 

alright<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.460> you've<00:03:08.580> got<00:03:08.610> all<00:03:08.850> those<00:03:09.090> notes<00:03:09.360> in

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
alright so you've got all those notes in

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:17.210 
alright so you've got all those notes in
between<00:03:09.600> there<00:03:14.510> eight<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.740> some<00:03:16.920> divided

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
between there eight so for some divided

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:34.550 
between there eight so for some divided
we'll<00:03:17.850> go<00:03:18.830> doing<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:22.070> five<00:03:23.070> six

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.760 

Oh

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.150 

two<00:03:40.770> three<00:03:41.130> four<00:03:41.460> five

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.730 

six<00:03:45.840> didn't<00:03:46.840> finish<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.140> phrase<00:03:47.350> there<00:03:47.560> but

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
six didn't finish the phrase there but

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.400 
six didn't finish the phrase there but
you<00:03:47.830> get<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:47.980> idea<00:03:48.330> now<00:03:49.330> with<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.690> playing

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
you get the idea now with the playing

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.750 
you get the idea now with the playing
all<00:03:50.560> those<00:03:50.680> sixteenth<00:03:51.100> notes<00:03:51.340> just<00:03:51.520> going

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
all those sixteenth notes just going

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.540 
all those sixteenth notes just going
back<00:03:51.910> before<00:03:52.270> what<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:52.840> call<00:03:53.080> the<00:03:53.200> flow<00:03:53.550> we

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
back before what I call the flow we

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.070 
back before what I call the flow we
actually<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:55.120> the<00:03:55.270> opportunity<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> really

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
actually have the opportunity to really

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.560 
actually have the opportunity to really
expand<00:03:56.620> out<00:03:56.800> within<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.940> within<00:03:58.300> that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
expand out within that within that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.080 
expand out within that within that
counting<00:03:59.080> structure<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.370> add<00:04:00.610> more<00:04:00.850> voices

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
counting structure and add more voices

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.660 
counting structure and add more voices
and<00:04:01.480> more<00:04:02.020> complexity<00:04:02.590> to<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.770> rhythm<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.400> we

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
and more complexity to the rhythm so we

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:29.410 
and more complexity to the rhythm so we
can<00:04:03.790> do<00:04:03.880> something<00:04:04.150> like<00:04:04.420> this

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:38.240 

two

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.050 

so<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:39.460> one<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.669> the<00:04:39.760> ways<00:04:39.820> that<00:04:40.000> I

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
so that's one of the ways that I

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.720 
so that's one of the ways that I
approach<00:04:40.360> constructing<00:04:41.260> more<00:04:41.730> complex

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
approach constructing more complex

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.969 
approach constructing more complex
rhythms<00:04:43.080> there's<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.169> video<00:04:44.410> where<00:04:44.650> I<00:04:44.680> kind<00:04:44.860> of

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
rhythms there's a video where I kind of

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:47.189 
rhythms there's a video where I kind of
play<00:04:45.160> that<00:04:45.190> basic<00:04:45.880> pattern<00:04:46.240> and<00:04:46.690> improvise

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
play that basic pattern and improvise

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.439 
play that basic pattern and improvise
off<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.590> if<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.340> want<00:04:48.520> to<00:04:48.610> sit<00:04:48.910> and<00:04:49.090> practice

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
off that if you want to sit and practice

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.600 
off that if you want to sit and practice
with<00:04:49.570> it
