00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
when you're 10 blocks away so you'll

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.649 
when you're 10 blocks away so you'll
just<00:03:04.950> have<00:03:05.099> to<00:03:05.250> look<00:03:05.370> at<00:03:05.489> how<00:03:05.579> he<00:03:06.000> rotates<00:03:06.569> his

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
armor and you have the invisibility bug

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.620 
armor and you have the invisibility bug
the<00:03:57.150> invisibility<00:03:57.540> effect<00:03:57.960> on<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:59.510> Bob<00:04:00.510> will

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
the invisibility effect on you Bob will

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.700 
the invisibility effect on you Bob will
be<00:04:00.750> able<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.990> see<00:04:01.110> you<00:04:02.720> at<00:04:03.720> most<00:04:03.990> 10<00:04:04.500> blocks

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
be able to see you at most 10 blocks

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.420 
be able to see you at most 10 blocks
away<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:06.140> you're<00:04:07.140> wearing<00:04:07.470> one<00:04:08.130> piece<00:04:08.310> of

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
away and you're wearing one piece of

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.660 
away and you're wearing one piece of
armor<00:04:09.650> they<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.800> only<00:04:10.860> see<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.310> when<00:04:11.490> there's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
armor they can only see you when there's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.490 
armor they can only see you when there's
a<00:04:11.730> maximum<00:04:12.210> of<00:04:12.680> one<00:04:13.680> block<00:04:13.890> gap<00:04:14.160> between<00:04:14.520> you

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
a maximum of one block gap between you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.460 
a maximum of one block gap between you
let<00:04:16.500> me<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:16.680> quickly<00:04:16.739> demonstrate<00:04:17.070> this<00:04:17.549> if

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
let me just quickly demonstrate this if

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.440 
let me just quickly demonstrate this if
you<00:04:19.470> want<00:04:19.650> to<00:04:19.739> see<00:04:19.860> this<00:04:19.980> kind<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.310> practice

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.390 

this<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.600> full<00:04:24.930> set<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.530> look<00:04:26.040> how<00:04:26.130> far<00:04:26.280> away

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
this is a full set and look how far away

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:35.050 
this is a full set and look how far away
that's<00:04:26.610> kept<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:27.210> spider<00:04:27.660> it's<00:04:28.440> pretty<00:04:28.620> far

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.750 

then<00:04:35.660> all<00:04:35.750> we<00:04:35.780> put<00:04:36.139> on<00:04:36.250> one<00:04:37.250> piece<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.550> armor

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
then all we put on one piece of armor

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.460 
then all we put on one piece of armor
right<00:04:37.880> now

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:49.860 

that<00:04:42.070> means<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.430> was<00:04:42.820> one<00:04:43.720> half<00:04:43.900> away<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:49.690> he'd

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
that means it was one half away now he'd

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.430 
that means it was one half away now he'd
seen<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.170> on<00:04:50.290> the<00:04:50.320> way<00:04:52.050> let's<00:04:53.050> see<00:04:53.170> if<00:04:53.230> we<00:04:53.320> can

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
seen you on the way let's see if we can

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.160 
seen you on the way let's see if we can
see<00:04:53.800> julie<00:04:54.640> simone<00:04:54.790> what<00:04:55.240> that<00:04:55.360> looks<00:04:55.540> like<00:04:58.170> so

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
see julie simone what that looks like so

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.190 
see julie simone what that looks like so
i<00:04:59.200> would<00:04:59.410> summer<00:04:59.560> about<00:04:59.830> the<00:05:00.070> edge<00:05:00.310> right<00:05:00.850> now

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
i would summer about the edge right now

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.840 
i would summer about the edge right now
walking<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.380> closer<00:05:02.590> in<00:05:02.980> and<00:05:03.160> yet<00:05:03.400> now<00:05:03.580> he<00:05:03.640> can

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
walking it closer in and yet now he can

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.990 
walking it closer in and yet now he can
see<00:05:03.970> me<00:05:08.070> so<00:05:09.070> that<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.370> the<00:05:09.550> invisibility

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
see me so that is the invisibility

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.950 
see me so that is the invisibility
potion<00:05:10.480> and<00:05:10.870> thanks<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.620> lot<00:05:11.650> for<00:05:11.740> watching
