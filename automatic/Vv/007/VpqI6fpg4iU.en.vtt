00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.070 
of dramatic sequences it was just kind
of<00:04:02.040> regular<00:04:02.400> widescreen<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:03.540> then<00:04:03.750> when<00:04:03.959> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
of regular widescreen but then when the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.570 
of regular widescreen but then when the
action<00:04:04.440> scenes<00:04:04.590> picked<00:04:04.860> up<00:04:05.010> it<00:04:05.160> was<00:04:05.310> like<00:04:05.340> you

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
action scenes picked up it was like you

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.920
