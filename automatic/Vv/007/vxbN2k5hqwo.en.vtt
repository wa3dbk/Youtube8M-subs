00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
game Starbound and here we're in the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.450 
game Starbound and here we're in the
main<00:00:32.219> area<00:00:32.930> so<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.230> Starbound<00:00:34.710> server

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
main area so this is a Starbound server

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.860 
main area so this is a Starbound server
so<00:00:35.940> he's<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> server<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.809> be

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
so he's not a server this will be

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.380 
so he's not a server this will be
created<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> world<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.329> if<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
created this is the world for it if you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.520 
created this is the world for it if you
want<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.540> make<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.780> new<00:00:39.899> world<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.260> delete

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
want to make it new world just delete

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.389 
want to make it new world just delete
this<00:00:41.030> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> world<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
this this is the world this is the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.880 
this this is the world this is the
configuration<00:00:44.760> file<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.809> if<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.020> edit<00:00:46.230> with

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
configuration file so if we edit with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.279 
configuration file so if we edit with
notepad<00:00:47.420> we<00:00:48.420> should<00:00:50.420> see<00:00:51.420> lots<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> random

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
notepad we should see lots of random

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.450 
notepad we should see lots of random
stuff<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:55.460> look

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
stuff so what you need to do is look

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.500 
stuff so what you need to do is look
through<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:56.940> these<00:00:58.670> until<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.940> find<00:01:02.510> part

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
through all these until you find part

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.149 
through all these until you find part
here's<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.110> password<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:04.979> where<00:01:05.100> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
here's the password so this is where you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.370 
here's the password so this is where you
can<00:01:05.250> set<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.460> passwords<00:01:06.090> server<00:01:06.780> passwords

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
can set the passwords server passwords

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.560 
can set the passwords server passwords
I've<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.670> automatically<00:01:09.090> duckies<00:01:09.540> and

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
I've got it's automatically duckies and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
I've got it's automatically duckies and
swordfish<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.350> nothing<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.460> type<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
swordfish and nothing so if you type in

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.429 
swordfish and nothing so if you type in
nothing<00:01:12.210> you'll<00:01:12.330> get<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:13.409> no

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
nothing you'll get in so there's no

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.870 
nothing you'll get in so there's no
password<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.159> type<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.400> duckies<00:01:14.729> we'll

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
password if you type in duckies we'll

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.999 
password if you type in duckies we'll
get<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.119> if<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.509> swordfish<00:01:15.810> again<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.860> just

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
get in if it is swordfish again you just

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.520 
get in if it is swordfish again you just
change<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:18.229> soup<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.770> something

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
change this to like soup or something

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.530 
change this to like soup or something
now<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> can<00:01:22.860> set<00:01:23.100> speech<00:01:23.400> bubbles<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.420> can

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
now you can set speech bubbles you can

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.050 
now you can set speech bubbles you can
search<00:01:24.960> that's<00:01:25.950> not<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.280> IP<00:01:26.490> don't<00:01:26.850> look<00:01:27.000> at

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
search that's not my IP don't look at

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.100 
search that's not my IP don't look at
that<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.049> need<00:01:28.140> that<00:01:28.350> then<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:30.110> UPnP

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
that you don't need that then this UPnP

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.429 
that you don't need that then this UPnP

needs to be set to false if your port
forwarding<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:39.270> expect<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> already<00:01:40.140> know

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
forwarding and I expect you already know

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.569 
forwarding and I expect you already know
how<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.409> pull<00:01:40.680> forward<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.130> need<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> puff

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
how to pull forward and you need to puff

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
how to pull forward and you need to puff
for<00:01:41.909> port<00:01:42.299> forward<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.590> port<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.369> 1<00:01:44.790> 0<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.689> 5

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
for port forward to the port to 1 0 to 5

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.539 
for port forward to the port to 1 0 to 5
and<00:01:48.049> then<00:01:49.049> that's<00:01:49.439> pretty<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.280> then<00:01:50.490> you

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
and then that's pretty much it then you

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.800 
and then that's pretty much it then you
just<00:01:50.579> find<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> server<00:01:51.360> file<00:01:53.689> there's<00:01:54.689> also

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just find the server file there's also

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.749 
just find the server file there's also
another<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.500> assets<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.490> server<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:58.110> I

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
another one in assets is a server here I

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.810 
another one in assets is a server here I
think<00:01:59.759> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.119> one<00:02:00.270> that's<00:02:00.630> just

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
think this is the one that's just

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.370 
think this is the one that's just
default<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.600> lots<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.840> defaults

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.120 

yeah<00:02:11.620> no<00:02:12.620> this<00:02:12.830> wasn't<00:02:13.900> okay<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:14.960> they<00:02:15.830> need<00:02:15.980> to

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
yeah no this wasn't okay so they need to

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.950 
yeah no this wasn't okay so they need to
find<00:02:16.430> so<00:02:16.730> if<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> go<00:02:17.000> to<00:02:17.060> back<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.810> the

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
find so if you go to back to here the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.390 
find so if you go to back to here the
main<00:02:18.140> area<00:02:18.710> go<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.610> win32<00:02:21.130> which<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
main area go to win32 which is the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.430 
main area go to win32 which is the
