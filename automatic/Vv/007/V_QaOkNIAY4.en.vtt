00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
really tough mission but like I said if

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.270 
really tough mission but like I said if
you<00:02:15.599> have<00:02:15.720> no<00:02:16.020> idea<00:02:16.260> where<00:02:16.470> you're<00:02:16.590> going<00:02:17.010> it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
you have no idea where you're going it

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.240 
you have no idea where you're going it
can<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.700> bit<00:02:17.940> annoying<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.950> once<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.069> find

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
can be a bit annoying but once you find

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.030 
can be a bit annoying but once you find
the<00:02:20.340> small<00:02:20.580> digger<00:02:20.819> then<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.890> think<00:02:22.890> in<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the small digger then I think in the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.590 
the small digger then I think in the
whole<00:02:23.220> lot<00:02:23.370> easier<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:24.000> don't<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.390> keep

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
whole lot easier you don't have to keep

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.640 
whole lot easier you don't have to keep
getting<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.410> out<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
getting in and out of you and the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
getting in and out of you and the
monstrous<00:02:29.130> here<00:02:29.430> they're<00:02:30.360> using<00:02:30.720> a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
monstrous here they're using a

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.259 
monstrous here they're using a
coordinating<00:02:31.489> coordinated<00:02:32.489> monster<00:02:32.940> attack

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
coordinating coordinated monster attack

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.570

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
crystals in order to get one hundred

00:05:50.369 --> 00:05:50.379 
going to be doing aerators until then

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.119

have<00:05:50.800> fun<00:05:50.830> playing<00:05:51.369> all<00:05:51.789> right
