Chimaera means yeast you know this is

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.170 
Chimaera means yeast you know this is
nothing<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:17.960> fermented<00:00:18.960> dough<00:00:19.250> roti<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.880> for

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
nothing but fermented dough roti so for

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.939 
nothing but fermented dough roti so for
this<00:00:21.359> first<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.410> going<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.650> make<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
this first we are going to make the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.070 
this first we are going to make the
starter<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.330> are<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.539> to<00:00:24.689> use<00:00:24.840> as<00:00:25.050> a

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
starter what we are going to use as a

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.200 
starter what we are going to use as a
fermentation<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.279> know<00:00:26.369> nowadays<00:00:26.550> everybody

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
fermentation you know nowadays everybody

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.779 
fermentation you know nowadays everybody
is<00:00:27.300> using<00:00:27.539> yeast<00:00:27.869> but<00:00:28.619> they<00:00:29.189> used<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.580> make

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
is using yeast but they used to make

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.970 
is using yeast but they used to make
this<00:00:30.060> method<00:00:30.300> for<00:00:31.019> many<00:00:31.230> generations

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
this method for many generations

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.040 
this method for many generations
so<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.790> take<00:00:33.630> some<00:00:33.870> buttermilk<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.000> add

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
so in this take some buttermilk and add

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.889 
so in this take some buttermilk and add
pinch<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> salt<00:00:38.360> some<00:00:39.360> sugar<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:40.879> add<00:00:41.899> flour

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
pinch of salt some sugar and add flour

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.569 
pinch of salt some sugar and add flour
in<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.430> okay

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
in this okay

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.119 
in this okay
I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.180> add<00:00:45.329> more<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.809> buttermilk<00:00:46.129> now

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I think I can add more of buttermilk now

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.430 
I think I can add more of buttermilk now
you<00:00:47.820> know<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.210> make<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.690> into<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.050> thin

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you know just make this into a thin

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
you know just make this into a thin
batter<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:50.670> know<00:00:50.789> for<00:00:51.090> jalebi<00:00:51.510> also<00:00:51.809> we<00:00:51.960> do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
batter you know for jalebi also we do

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.100 
batter you know for jalebi also we do
commit<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.280> same<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> into

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
commit the same way just make this into

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.069 
commit the same way just make this into
a<00:00:55.140> batter<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.770> then<00:00:56.520> pour<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.030> into<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.420> bowl

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a batter and then pour this into a bowl

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.090 
a batter and then pour this into a bowl
and<00:00:58.609> we're<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.820> leave<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.270> overnight

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
and we're going to leave this overnight

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.280 
and we're going to leave this overnight
look<00:01:02.100> at<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.460> batter<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
look at this batter because the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.990 
look at this batter because the
buttermilk<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.920> there<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> flour<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.760> there

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
buttermilk is there the flour is there

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.870 
buttermilk is there the flour is there
and<00:01:06.240> more<00:01:07.200> fermentation<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.010> happening<00:01:08.400> with

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and more fermentation is happening with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.710 
and more fermentation is happening with
the<00:01:09.000> flour<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.950> by<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> next<00:01:11.610> day<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.600> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
the flour and by the next day when it is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.230 
the flour and by the next day when it is
fermented<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.979> know<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.549> looks<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
fermented you know it looks like this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.370 
fermented you know it looks like this
can<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.900> see<00:01:15.990> lot<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.759> know<00:01:17.909> air<00:01:18.380> bubbles

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
can you see lot of you know air bubbles

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
can you see lot of you know air bubbles
in<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.670> what<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.150> used<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.659> make<00:01:21.810> our

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
in this this is what is used to make our

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.710 
in this this is what is used to make our
committee<00:01:22.830> roti<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.790> is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> nice<00:01:24.119> fermented

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.510 
roti but nowadays if you want you can
also<00:01:27.180> skip<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.750> method<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.259> add<00:01:28.829> yeast<00:01:29.280> to

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
also skip this method and add yeast to

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.630 
also skip this method and add yeast to
it<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.630> still<00:01:30.869> make<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.110> similar<00:01:32.070> kind

it and you can still make a similar kind
of<00:01:32.729> roti<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.630> yeast<00:01:33.840> will<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.259> a

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
of roti but the yeast will have a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.580 
of roti but the yeast will have a
different<00:01:35.460> flavor<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:36.060> aroma<00:01:36.450> whereas<00:01:37.200> this

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
different flavor and aroma whereas this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.980 
different flavor and aroma whereas this
Chimaera<00:01:38.159> team<00:01:38.369> made<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.119> buttermilk

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
Chimaera team made with the buttermilk

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.370 
Chimaera team made with the buttermilk
and<00:01:40.340> flour<00:01:41.340> batter<00:01:41.610> makes<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.810> taste<00:01:43.140> even

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and flour batter makes it taste even

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.219 
and flour batter makes it taste even
more<00:01:43.649> better<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.759> take<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.299> come<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.720> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
more better now take this come here that

more better now take this come here that
is<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> fermented<00:01:46.770> dough<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.460> this<00:01:47.899> we<00:01:48.899> are

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
is a fermented dough in this we are

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
is a fermented dough in this we are
going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> add<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.670> milk<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:52.439> add<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.799> liquid<00:01:53.189> to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.980 
going to add a milk we add the liquid to
the<00:01:53.430> flour<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.180> today<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> am<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the flour but today I am just going to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.450 
the flour but today I am just going to
do<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.200> by<00:01:55.979> adding<00:01:56.369> this<00:01:56.729> way<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.570> okay<00:01:57.840> and
