00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:16.930
it's finally here the 2016 nissan titan
XD we've waited almost ten years for

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.770
this vehicle and thankfully it looks
like Nissan has done their homework they

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.230
brought out a half-ton pickup truck

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.529
well we'll get to that later but a
half-ton pickup truck that's going to go

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.090
head-to-head with some vicious
competition the design you're going to

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.190
have to decide on whether it looks great

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.329
whether you're not so sure but for right
now let's take a closer look by going

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.300
inside inside the improvements nissan is
made with this new pickup truck

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.300
lightyears ahead of where they were
before

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.290
thank goodness we love the gauge cluster
the center console looks very very

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.660
modern five different trim packages were
inside the pro-4x right now looks like

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.250
it's going to be a great off-roader one
of the features we especially like all

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.500
powertrain combinations column shifter
frees up a ton of room here for the

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.689
center console one of the most
interesting features to this truck that

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.100
must have caused a tremendous amount of
debate within nissan when this was in

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.549
the planning stages is that they've
essentially decided to create two

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:24.310
different pickup trucks here one light
duty tighten and hear what we see here a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.149
stripped titan XD the XD stands for a
heavier Duty tighten and that's

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.049
essentially what we have here a
completely unique stronger frame fully

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.719
welded fully-boxed and the vehicle is
only going to be offered with a 5-liter

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:48.279
v8 twin turbo comments 310 horsepower
550 foot-pounds of torque makes it much

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:54.429
stronger than Rams ecodiesel and a lot
less powerful than the duramax the ram

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.679
cummins in the heavy duties or the
powerstroke nissan is trying to hit this

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:04.659
sweet spot between a light duty diesel
and a half done and the heavy-duty big

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.060
powerful diesels that are in the heavy
duties behind the commons is a six-speed

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.340
automatic transmission from icin and the
suspension strategy is essentially

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.760
similar to other half time pickup trucks
double a-arm

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.140
coil spring setup in front live axle
leaf springs in the back one of the cool

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.340
features that we can see from this
exposed chassis is exactly what kind of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.980
technology is necessary to create the
first half ton gooseneck trailer hitch

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.350
looks incredibly cool from this angle
but it also looks pretty smooth and very

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.380
integrated from the bit we especially
like the Nissan a stepped outside their

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.690
comfort zone and installed an option
like an integrated gooseneck trailer

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.640
hitch that essentially just bolts right
to the frame underneath the pickup it

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.910
but that begs the question is this a
heavy-duty light or is this a light-duty

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.590
plus pickup truck from Nissan's point of
view they're saying there's a lot of

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.510
people that are playing in that area so
many that it could be as maybe a hundred

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.410
and fifty thousand new customers that
are going to be interested in this

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.910
pickup truck whether that happens or not
we're going to have to wait and see but

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.570
for right now it looks like this truck
is going to shake things up and a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.850
half-ton pickup truck world and we can't
wait to get one into our hands and do

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:31.989
some real-world testing
