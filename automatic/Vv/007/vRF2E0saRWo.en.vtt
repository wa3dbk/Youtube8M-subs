00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
side if you will so I'm going to be

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.820 
side if you will so I'm going to be
starting<00:02:16.099> over<00:02:16.550> here<00:02:17.239> if<00:02:17.510> yours<00:02:18.200> ended<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.709> the

starting over here if yours ended on the
other<00:02:18.950> side<00:02:19.250> your<00:02:19.819> fabric<00:02:20.300> is<00:02:20.390> going<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:20.599> look

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
other side your fabric is going to look

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.110 
other side your fabric is going to look
like<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.140> when<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.620> crochet<00:02:22.190> it<00:02:22.519> either<00:02:22.879> way

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
like that when you crochet it either way

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.729 
like that when you crochet it either way
I<00:02:23.420> don't<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.110> why<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.410> would<00:02:24.560> make<00:02:24.709> a

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
I don't see why it would make a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:30.940 
I don't see why it would make a
difference<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:27.340> I'm<00:02:28.340> going<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.180> do<00:02:29.950> single

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
difference so I'm going to do single

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.400 
difference so I'm going to do single
crochets<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.849> between<00:02:32.720> each<00:02:32.840> stitch<00:02:33.230> I'm

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
crochets and between each stitch I'm

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.930 
crochets and between each stitch I'm
going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.620> do<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.739> chain<00:02:34.010> one<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.730> make

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
going to do a chain one just to make

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.690 
going to do a chain one just to make
sure<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:36.260> doesn't<00:02:36.709> get<00:02:36.830> tighter<00:02:37.220> at<00:02:37.549> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
sure that it doesn't get tighter at the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.170 
sure that it doesn't get tighter at the
top<00:02:37.910> than<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.330> was<00:02:38.540> when<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:38.810> cast<00:02:39.110> on<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.880> I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
top than it was when I cast on so I

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.900 
top than it was when I cast on so I
pulled<00:02:41.510> up<00:02:41.599> one<00:02:41.840> loop<00:02:42.430> I'm<00:02:43.430> gonna<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.849> ahead
