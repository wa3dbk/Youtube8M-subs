your condition of your timing belt is
it's<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:19.050> pretty<00:00:19.500> simplest<00:00:20.189> process<00:00:20.990> it's<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
it's a pretty simplest process it's a

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's a pretty simplest process it's a
matter<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.560> removing<00:00:23.520> four<00:00:24.060> screws<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.039> pull

first thing we want to do is always
remove<00:00:35.879> your<00:00:37.070> negative<00:00:38.070> battery<00:00:38.400> cable<00:00:38.640> first

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
remove your negative battery cable first

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.160 
remove your negative battery cable first
that<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.799> don't<00:00:41.070> enter<00:00:41.280> vertically

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
that way you don't enter vertically

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.469 
that way you don't enter vertically
short<00:00:43.170> something<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.830> by<00:00:44.699> grounding<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:45.479 
short something out by grounding the

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.070 
short something out by grounding the
system<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.110> will<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.799> first<00:00:48.049> make<00:00:49.049> sure

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
system I will do that first make sure

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.829 
system I will do that first make sure
you<00:00:49.409> don't<00:00:49.850> main<00:00:50.850> reason<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.210> want<00:00:51.330> to<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.690> the

you don't main reason you want to do the

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.570 
you don't main reason you want to do the
negative<00:00:52.199> first<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.769> if<00:00:53.040> you're<00:00:53.190> doing<00:00:53.369> the

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
negative first is if you're doing the

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.090 
negative first is if you're doing the
positive<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.049> inadvertently<00:00:55.769> hit

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
positive and you inadvertently hit

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.590 
positive and you inadvertently hit
something<00:00:56.670> metal<00:00:56.909> you<00:00:57.900> short<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.470> out<00:00:59.600> so

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
something metal you short it out so

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.820 
something metal you short it out so
we're<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:00.960> take<00:01:01.110> the<00:01:01.260> negative<00:01:01.470> off

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:01.830 
we're going to take the negative off

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:02.770 
we're going to take the negative off
first

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
first

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.859 
first
and<00:01:03.780> play<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.199> batteries<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.769> grounded<00:01:05.869> then

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
and play the batteries not grounded then

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.840 
and play the batteries not grounded then
we<00:01:07.080> can<00:01:07.290> take<00:01:07.439> off<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> positive<00:01:08.340> side<00:01:08.580> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
we can take off the positive side this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.420 
we can take off the positive side this
one's<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.330> corroded<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:11.130> always<00:01:11.370> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
one's a little corroded it's always a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.180 
one's a little corroded it's always a
good<00:01:11.640> idea<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:16.250> flip<00:01:17.250> some<00:01:17.720> oil

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
good idea to flip some oil

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:24.740 
good idea to flip some oil
rather<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.850> bit<00:01:21.120> of<00:01:22.070> vaseline<00:01:23.690> or<00:01:24.690> a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
rather a little bit of vaseline or a

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.910 
rather a little bit of vaseline or a
little<00:01:25.820> grease<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.080> your<00:01:28.080> battery<00:01:28.290> terminals

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
little grease on your battery terminals

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
little grease on your battery terminals
to<00:01:29.880> eliminate<00:01:30.600> corrosion

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
to eliminate corrosion

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.920 
to eliminate corrosion
this<00:01:32.250> one's<00:01:32.490> been<00:01:32.730> on<00:01:32.760> for<00:01:33.150> quite<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.420> while<00:01:33.659> so

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
this one's been on for quite a while so

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.190 
this one's been on for quite a while so
that's<00:01:34.080> not<00:01:34.380> too<00:01:34.920> terribly<00:01:35.430> bad<00:01:35.900> I'm<00:01:36.900> going<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that's not too terribly bad I'm going to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.730 
that's not too terribly bad I'm going to
take<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> positive<00:01:37.800> loose<00:01:38.310> just<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:39.740> safety

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
take the positive loose just for safety

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.810 
take the positive loose just for safety
sake

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
sake

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.640 
sake
right<00:01:43.820> long<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:44.960> have<00:01:45.050> the<00:01:45.140> negative<00:01:45.500> we

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
right long as you have the negative we

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.050 
right long as you have the negative we
should<00:01:45.860> be<00:01:46.010> all<00:01:46.070> right<00:01:46.190> that's<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.820> pretty

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
should be all right that's a pretty

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.580 
should be all right that's a pretty
clean<00:01:47.420> terminal<00:01:49.720> considering<00:01:50.720> if<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.380> have<00:01:51.560> a

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
clean terminal considering if you have a

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.680 
clean terminal considering if you have a
lot<00:01:52.010> of<00:01:52.040> corrosion<00:01:52.460> or<00:01:52.850> loose<00:01:53.120> terminal

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
lot of corrosion or loose terminal

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.200 
lot of corrosion or loose terminal
because<00:01:54.260> your<00:01:54.710> battery<00:01:54.950> not<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.460> charge<00:01:55.790> what

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
because your battery not to charge what

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.109 
because your battery not to charge what
a<00:01:56.240> car<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.510> running<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.680> eventually<00:01:58.400> your<00:01:58.850> car

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
a car is running and eventually your car

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.960 
a car is running and eventually your car
start<00:01:59.990> turning<00:02:00.470> over<00:02:00.619> really<00:02:01.010> slow<00:02:01.310> or<00:02:01.910> it

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
start turning over really slow or it

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
start turning over really slow or it
won't<00:02:02.300> start<00:02:02.660> at<00:02:02.780> all<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.540> it's<00:02:05.630> a<00:02:05.690> good<00:02:05.869> idea

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
won't start at all so it's a good idea

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.990 
won't start at all so it's a good idea
to<00:02:06.260> make<00:02:06.590> sure<00:02:06.619> your<00:02:06.920> battery<00:02:07.280> terminals<00:02:07.790> are

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
to make sure your battery terminals are

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.270 
to make sure your battery terminals are
clean<00:02:08.360> like<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:09.470> said<00:02:09.649> you<00:02:09.740> can<00:02:09.890> feel<00:02:10.070> a<00:02:10.100> little

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
clean like I said you can feel a little

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.490 
clean like I said you can feel a little
bit<00:02:10.550> of<00:02:10.700> either<00:02:11.110> petroleum<00:02:12.110> jelly<00:02:12.380> or

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
bit of either petroleum jelly or

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.650 
bit of either petroleum jelly or
Vaseline<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.660> very<00:02:15.290> very<00:02:15.739> fine<00:02:16.130> film<00:02:16.790> not

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
Vaseline just a very very fine film not

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.390 
Vaseline just a very very fine film not
even<00:02:17.959> enough<00:02:18.260> that<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.709> really<00:02:18.920> see<00:02:19.220> it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
even enough that you can really see it

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.300 
even enough that you can really see it
once<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.820> wipe<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.239> off<00:02:20.410> or<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.470> little<00:02:22.040> bit<00:02:22.160> of

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
once you wipe it off or a little bit of

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.260 
once you wipe it off or a little bit of
bearing<00:02:22.820> grease<00:02:23.110> okay<00:02:24.550> come<00:02:25.550> over<00:02:25.670> here

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
bearing grease okay come over here

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.190

I've<00:02:27.170> already<00:02:27.410> loosened<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:28.040> screws<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.959> this

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
I've already loosened the screws on this

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
running but it was making a little

00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.089 
I figured it was time to check it so

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.850

don't<00:06:18.089> let<00:06:18.389> this<00:06:18.569> happen<00:06:18.629> to<00:06:19.050> you<00:06:19.139> you<00:06:19.560> want<00:06:19.800> to

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
get it done before it fails because

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.499 
get it done before it fails because
you'll<00:06:24.419> end<00:06:24.599> up<00:06:24.779> bending<00:06:25.289> valves<00:06:26.099> and<00:06:26.509> having

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:27.509 
you'll end up bending valves and having

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.350 
you'll end up bending valves and having
they<00:06:27.569> had<00:06:27.750> to<00:06:27.930> have<00:06:28.379> the<00:06:28.500> head<00:06:28.740> rebuilt<00:06:29.520> or

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360
