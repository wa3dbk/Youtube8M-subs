 hi my name is rogelio lara and in this 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.990
 occasion we are going to prepare a delicious 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:13.670
 fish fillet in chipotle cream 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.820
 with mushrooms 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:19.119
 let's start our preparation and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:23.330
 we already have all our ingredients 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.420
 we're going to go by naming 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:28.040
 let's go using it and in the same way 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.570
 will be the amounts of the 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.329
 ingredients are I boxes of the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.460
 description of him 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.350
 what we are going to do here first 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.690
 we have a pan enough 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 great for what we're going to do that 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:47.430
 we have a one kilo or two pounds of 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.830
 fish fillet in this case is catfish 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.380
 and we are going to put it, we are going to flour it 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.739
 here as it shows these are in flour 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:58.860
 two we learned at medium heat the pan 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.050
 what is heated and we are going to flour 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.120
 our fish the steak 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.100
 here we have one ximena vilar already 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.840
 we put salt 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.729
 after that after we're going to adjust 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.950
 more salt we are going to analyze it well of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.840
 both sides this is going to help a lot 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.840
 that does not leave us 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.380
 to break 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.110
 the steak 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:31.350
 we remove the excess 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.210
 and what we put in the pan 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.810
 we start to warm up and we're going to 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.610
 put 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.090
 3 to 4 tablespoons of oil in this case 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.340
 it's olive oil 2 use vegetable if 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.189
 he also prefers 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.369
 we are going to wait for the oil to 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.619
 Hot is already hot I repeat to fire 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.330
 we will have it and we will put 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:01.210
 2 butter spoons 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:06.030
 or margaritas waste prefers and the 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.030
 let's put to melt 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.300
 that butter melts well 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.940
 let's put our fish client 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.050
 we ask a little for the excess 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.920
 of flour fall 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.400
 and we're going to put it face down first 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.860
 and so we are going to be putting all and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 we are going to leave them to cover and leave 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.610
 about 5 minutes 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.610
 5 minutes we uncover it 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.200
 half a minute to caramelize 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.709
 down on him 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.380
 you can see before flipping the already 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.870
 You can see how it is caramelized 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.590
 crusting what is going to 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:02.990
 take out the flavor and so on with everyone else 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.570
 we're going to flip 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.250
 and we are going to do the same thing for another 5 minutes 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.819
 so that the ine 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.069
 and take them out 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.940
 we turn them over as you can see 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.580
 they paralyzed 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.980
 above and the last and another means 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:23.230
 minute so clearly below we cover them 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:28.660
 so that it is finished cooking about 4 to 5 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.970
 minutes and we are preparing the cream here 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.140
 in a blender in the glass of the 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 blender we are going to put 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.670
 the cream 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.670
 a cup of cream 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 we have a rate of marinating the 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:59.250
 chipotle chiles already with three chilies 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.580
 chipotles I can put more if 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:07.680
 he wants more spicy we have a piece of 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:12.020
 onion and a garlic clove medium layer 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.020
 whole milk cup 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.520
 one teaspoon of 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.690
 powdered chicken soup if you have 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.750
 consume the fish powder as better 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.870
 but if you do not consume chicken powder one 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.760
 teaspoon gives a lot of flavor this 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.070
 has salt so is that the room we are going to 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.949
 adjust to the last good let's liquefy 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.190
 this but let's skip the noise of the 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:41.820
 squad because it's annoying 45 minutes and 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.360
 we are going to lower the fire to 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.360
 slow 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.970
 or as low as possible and we will try 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:55.080
 carefully the clients and we are going to 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:57.750
 put on a plate 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.409
 to the customers and in our pan 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.770
 we put back to medium heat and go 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:06.889
 to put a little wine wine 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.889
 White 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.970
 clean our paper a little 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.960
 and take off 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:27.370
 all that caramelization that has everything 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:32.310
 the flavor there and join with the rest of 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.310
 oil and butter and wine 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.770
 once we are already the poster 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.640
 let's put the mushrooms that 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.009
 We have two cups of mushrooms 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.909
 discounted 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.909
 in the middle 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.789
 this is so fast 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.580
 let's put a little bit of salt 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.409
 to stay in a little 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.620
 millions and we're going to skip them a little bit 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:08.620
 so that they do not pass those do not need 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.620
 much 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:17.840
 more or less a minute and we're going to empty 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:17.840
 the cream that we have here 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.220
 Here we already have it on the list cream and 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:28.020
 the liquefied with the type of bull 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.360
 and we are going to empty them here 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:35.629
 in the pan and let's leave it a couple of 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.629
 minutes 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:45.619
 over medium heat to incorporate it 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.619
 incorporate all flavors 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:52.920
 and ready already after about three minutes 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.860
 that the cream is already incorporated here 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.040
 as you can see we already serve on a plate 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.320
 we will accompany it with white rice what 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.550
 can accompany with pasta or something else 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.870
 your preference 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:08.790
 here in we put a couple of steaks and you 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.590
 we put the cream on top 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.460
 mushrooms the chipotle cream with 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.800
 mushrooms and this is to cut a
