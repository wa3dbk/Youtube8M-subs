00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
previously we had done the static view

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:31.489 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.910 

so<00:00:32.489> this<00:00:34.579> little<00:00:35.579> yep<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.710> quad

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
so this little yep so this is a quad

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.630 
so this little yep so this is a quad
shot<00:00:39.410> airframe<00:00:40.410> built<00:00:40.829> by<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.100> company<00:00:41.550> called

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
shot airframe built by a company called

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
shot airframe built by a company called
transition<00:00:42.510> robotics<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.379> santa<00:00:43.680> cruz

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
transition robotics down in santa cruz

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.190 
transition robotics down in santa cruz
and<00:00:45.110> basically<00:00:46.110> it's<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.559> flying<00:00:46.980> wing<00:00:47.219> design

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
and basically it's a flying wing design

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.369 
and basically it's a flying wing design
so<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.350> flies<00:00:49.590> vertically<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.399> quadrotor

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
so it flies vertically like a quadrotor

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.979 
so it flies vertically like a quadrotor
but<00:00:52.379> then<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.980> can<00:00:53.399> transition<00:00:54.149> into<00:00:54.449> Ford

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
but then it can transition into Ford

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.560 
but then it can transition into Ford
flight<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.559> generate<00:00:56.129> lift<00:00:56.460> from<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.360> wing

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
flight and generate lift from the wing

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.250 
flight and generate lift from the wing
itself<00:01:00.320> we<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.609> telemetry<00:01:02.719> going<00:01:03.719> down<00:01:03.960> it's

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
itself we have telemetry going down it's

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.960 
itself we have telemetry going down it's
built<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.339> paparazzi

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
built on top of the paparazzi

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.760 
built on top of the paparazzi
open-source<00:01:06.780> autopilot<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.869> we<00:01:09.869> will<00:01:10.140> we<00:01:10.590> can

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
open-source autopilot and we will we can

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.539 
open-source autopilot and we will we can
show<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:12.530> go<00:01:13.530> ahead<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.860> move<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.130> airframe

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
show that go ahead and move the airframe

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.230 
show that go ahead and move the airframe
so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.299> can<00:01:15.479> see<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> model<00:01:16.970> here<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
so we can see the model here we have a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.690 
so we can see the model here we have a
model<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> airframe<00:01:19.259> moving<00:01:19.979> as<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> IMU

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
model of the airframe moving as the IMU

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.690 
model of the airframe moving as the IMU
senses<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> movement<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> aircraft<00:01:22.700> okay

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
senses the movement of the aircraft okay

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
and fly and I think it's just pilots

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:22.189 
and fly and I think it's just pilots
choice<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:13.459> what

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:22.199 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.830 

so<00:04:23.199> yeah<00:04:23.409> he's<00:04:23.650> demonstrating<00:04:24.430> how<00:04:24.840> it's

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
so yeah he's demonstrating how it's

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.570 
so yeah he's demonstrating how it's
tough<00:04:26.110> in<00:04:26.289> here<00:04:26.560> but<00:04:26.740> transitioning<00:04:27.129> into

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
tough in here but transitioning into

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.570 
tough in here but transitioning into
Ford<00:04:28.060> flight<00:04:28.770> when<00:04:29.770> he<00:04:29.860> tips<00:04:30.129> it<00:04:30.279> all<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.520> way

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
Ford flight when he tips it all the way

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.969 
Ford flight when he tips it all the way
over<00:04:30.939> that's<00:04:31.719> when<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:32.050> start<00:04:32.379> to<00:04:32.590> generate

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
over that's when we start to generate

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.339 
over that's when we start to generate
lift<00:04:33.370> from<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:33.759> wing<00:04:36.509> ok<00:04:37.509> and<00:04:37.719> then<00:04:37.870> flying

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
lift from the wing ok and then flying

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:39.989 
lift from the wing ok and then flying
back<00:04:38.590> and<00:04:38.620> forth<00:04:38.830> on<00:04:39.159> the<00:04:39.249> edge<00:04:39.400> that's<00:04:39.789> how<00:04:39.939> we

00:04:39.989 --> 00:04:39.999 
back and forth on the edge that's how we

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:42.839 
back and forth on the edge that's how we
maneuver<00:04:40.599> if<00:04:41.050> there's<00:04:41.439> a<00:04:41.499> strong<00:04:41.620> wind<00:04:41.889> and<00:04:42.550> in

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
maneuver if there's a strong wind and in

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:45.480 
maneuver if there's a strong wind and in
hover<00:04:43.120> we<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.289> know<00:04:44.409> point<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:44.889> wing<00:04:45.099> along

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
hover we you know point the wing along

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.029 
hover we you know point the wing along
so<00:04:46.330> then<00:04:46.539> the<00:04:46.779> full<00:04:47.020> wing<00:04:47.229> is<00:04:47.409> not<00:04:47.590> receiving

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
so then the full wing is not receiving

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:56.939 
so then the full wing is not receiving
the<00:04:48.279> wind<00:04:54.779> yeah<00:04:55.779> if<00:04:55.840> you<00:04:55.960> can't<00:04:56.229> miss<00:04:56.529> Justin

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
the wind yeah if you can't miss Justin

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.659 
the wind yeah if you can't miss Justin
spit<00:04:57.129> out<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.669> sens<00:04:57.969> yep<00:04:59.129> so<00:05:00.129> once<00:05:00.550> again

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
spit out the sens yep so once again

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:05.189 
spit out the sens yep so once again
stuff<00:05:01.029> in<00:05:01.180> here<00:05:01.360> but<00:05:02.639> understand<00:05:03.639> anyway<00:05:04.569> it

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
stuff in here but understand anyway it

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.589 
stuff in here but understand anyway it
can<00:05:05.529> descend<00:05:06.099> with<00:05:06.370> under<00:05:06.939> almost<00:05:07.210> no<00:05:07.389> power

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:07.599 
can descend with under almost no power

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.510 
can descend with under almost no power
and<00:05:07.900> can<00:05:08.080> be<00:05:08.199> very<00:05:08.409> quiet<00:05:10.830> during<00:05:11.830> the<00:05:12.129> descent

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
and can be very quiet during the descent

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.379 
and can be very quiet during the descent
when<00:05:12.909> it's<00:05:13.089> fully<00:05:13.650> tipped<00:05:14.650> over<00:05:14.800> and<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:16.150> wing

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:16.389 
when it's fully tipped over and the wing

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.850 
when it's fully tipped over and the wing
is<00:05:16.629> it's<00:05:17.080> catching<00:05:17.349> air<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:17.830> the<00:05:17.949> descent<00:05:19.860> very

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
is it's catching air on the descent very

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.879 
is it's catching air on the descent very
name<00:05:21.069> burning

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.079 

if<00:05:28.889> you<00:05:28.979> want<00:05:29.129> to<00:05:29.219> go<00:05:29.309> ahead<00:05:29.429> and<00:05:29.520> pay<00:05:29.729> into<00:05:29.969> the

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:30.089 
if you want to go ahead and pay into the

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:35.089 
if you want to go ahead and pay into the
telemetry<00:05:30.389> that<00:05:33.020> perfect<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.919> this<00:05:35.069> is

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
telemetry that perfect so this is

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.309 
telemetry that perfect so this is
telemetry<00:05:35.610> at<00:05:35.969> the<00:05:36.089> end<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.719> can<00:05:36.869> see<00:05:37.110> we're

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
telemetry at the end you can see we're

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:38.989 
telemetry at the end you can see we're
getting<00:05:37.409> a<00:05:37.649> bunch<00:05:37.830> of<00:05:37.949> data<00:05:38.159> about<00:05:38.490> both<00:05:38.789> the

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
getting a bunch of data about both the

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.179 
getting a bunch of data about both the
IMU<00:05:39.389> status<00:05:39.929> if<00:05:40.139> we're<00:05:40.289> outside<00:05:40.709> we'd<00:05:41.009> have

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
IMU status if we're outside we'd have

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.079 
IMU status if we're outside we'd have
