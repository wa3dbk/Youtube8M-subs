want to avoid the radar so we're going
to<00:02:14.350> go<00:02:14.410> ahead<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.000> select<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.590> silencer<00:02:17.590> let

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
to go ahead and select the silencer let

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.500 
to go ahead and select the silencer let
others<00:02:18.550> come<00:02:19.120> on<00:02:19.270> type<00:02:19.600> 25<00:02:19.900> but<00:02:20.140> I<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.350> lousy

or you can do stats mass as an
alternative<00:02:31.100> thats<00:02:31.880> not<00:02:32.060> is<00:02:32.210> really<00:02:32.450> up<00:02:32.540> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
alternative thats not is really up to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.760 
alternative thats not is really up to
you<00:02:33.460> next<00:02:34.460> up<00:02:34.550> are<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.730> parts<00:02:35.410> I'm<00:02:36.410> running

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
you next up are the parts I'm running

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.280 
you next up are the parts I'm running
ghost<00:02:37.010> I<00:02:37.280> pretty<00:02:37.880> much<00:02:38.000> run<00:02:38.300> ghost<00:02:38.600> all<00:02:38.960> the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
ghost I pretty much run ghost all the

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.990 
ghost I pretty much run ghost all the
time<00:02:39.500> every<00:02:39.710> class<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.250> have<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.430> run<00:02:40.760> goals

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
time every class that I have a run goals

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.110 
time every class that I have a run goals
have<00:02:41.690> to<00:02:41.840> stay<00:02:41.990> up<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.230> matter<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.760> second

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
have to stay up that matter the second

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.790 
have to stay up that matter the second
one<00:02:44.240> is<00:02:44.270> toughness<00:02:44.600> I<00:02:44.990> think<00:02:45.380> it's<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.590> very

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
one is toughness I think it's a very

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.310 
one is toughness I think it's a very
valuable<00:02:46.250> part<00:02:46.640> try<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.240> most<00:02:47.630> valuable<00:02:47.990> part

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
valuable part try the most valuable part

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.090 
valuable part try the most valuable part
of<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> Ring<00:02:48.950> scavenger<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.930> /<00:02:50.930> to<00:02:51.170> slot<00:02:51.530> so

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
of the Ring scavenger and / to slot so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.170 
of the Ring scavenger and / to slot so
you<00:02:52.130> can<00:02:52.340> switch<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:52.670> out<00:02:52.820> with<00:02:53.000> toughness

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
you can switch this out with toughness

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.460 
you can switch this out with toughness
or<00:02:53.540> scavenger<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.650> doesn't<00:02:54.950> really<00:02:55.010> matter<00:02:55.220> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
or scavenger it doesn't really matter I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.400 
or scavenger it doesn't really matter I
have<00:02:57.470> no<00:02:57.710> perk<00:02:58.010> 3<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.580> think<00:02:59.270> perk<00:02:59.510> 3<00:02:59.840> for<00:03:00.290> this

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
have no perk 3 I think perk 3 for this

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.950 
have no perk 3 I think perk 3 for this
load<00:03:00.680> out<00:03:00.710> you<00:03:01.640> know<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.820> sacrifice<00:03:02.510> for<00:03:02.840> that

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960 
load out you know you sacrifice for that

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.540 
load out you know you sacrifice for that
primary<00:03:03.440> weapon<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.250> you're<00:03:04.370> not<00:03:04.490> really

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
primary weapon so you're not really
