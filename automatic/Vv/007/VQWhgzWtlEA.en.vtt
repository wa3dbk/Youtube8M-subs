00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it on their line and so basically the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.490 
it on their line and so basically the
dealership<00:00:48.090> would<00:00:48.329> recondition<00:00:49.320> their

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
dealership would recondition their

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.200 
dealership would recondition their
vehicle<00:00:49.950> by<00:00:50.129> calling<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.879> having<00:00:51.180> you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.310 
vehicle by calling you and having you
repair<00:00:52.050> instead<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.559> replace<00:00:53.180> components

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
repair instead of replace components

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.350 
repair instead of replace components
most<00:00:55.320> definitely<00:00:55.850> dealers<00:00:56.850> are<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.120> budget

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
most definitely dealers are on a budget

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.380 
most definitely dealers are on a budget
and<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.829> cost<00:00:59.129> effective<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.850> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
and this is a very cost effective way to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.930 
and this is a very cost effective way to
do<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.840> repair<00:01:01.559> instead<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.219> replacing<00:01:02.550> so

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
do a repair instead of replacing so

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.509 
do a repair instead of replacing so

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
seat should probably be replaced a lot

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.150

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
of it and then I can see if it's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.380 
of it and then I can see if it's
something<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:13.830> repair<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.550> so<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:15.120> we
