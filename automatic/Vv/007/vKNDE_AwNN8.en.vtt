00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.780 
things with it now I've been getting
them<00:01:21.320> I've<00:01:21.650> been<00:01:21.920> getting<00:01:22.190> it<00:01:22.280> shaped<00:01:22.580> up

them I've been getting it shaped up

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.030 
them I've been getting it shaped up
though<00:01:23.050> that's<00:01:24.050> why<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.380> looks<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.710> little<00:01:24.830> bit

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
though that's why it looks a little bit

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.550 
though that's why it looks a little bit
more<00:01:25.220> tapered<00:01:25.610> in<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.120> back<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:27.050> on<00:01:27.500> the

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
more tapered in the back and on the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960 
more tapered in the back and on the
sides<00:01:28.010> down<00:01:28.430> low<00:01:28.790> here<00:01:29.860> and<00:01:30.860> I<00:01:31.430> think<00:01:31.850> I'm<00:01:31.940> just

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
sides down low here and I think I'm just

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.670 
sides down low here and I think I'm just
going<00:01:32.270> to<00:01:32.330> keep<00:01:32.480> the<00:01:32.690> sides<00:01:32.960> kind<00:01:33.290> of<00:01:33.410> short

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
going to keep the sides kind of short

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.430 
going to keep the sides kind of short
but<00:01:33.890> look<00:01:34.070> the<00:01:34.250> front<00:01:35.180> grow<00:01:35.390> out<00:01:35.570> at<00:01:35.990> least<00:01:36.260> for

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
but look the front grow out at least for

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.990 
but look the front grow out at least for
the<00:01:36.500> summer<00:01:36.680> time<00:01:36.980> then<00:01:37.250> when<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.850> winter

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
the summer time then when the winter

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.650 
the summer time then when the winter
hits<00:01:38.390> then<00:01:38.660> I'll<00:01:38.810> go<00:01:39.560> out<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:39.830> rest<00:01:40.040> of<00:01:40.190> it<00:01:40.660> and

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
hits then I'll go out the rest of it and

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.690 
hits then I'll go out the rest of it and
even<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:42.229> out<00:01:42.350> but<00:01:42.650> I'm<00:01:42.860> kind<00:01:43.160> of<00:01:43.190> liking<00:01:43.400> my

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700
