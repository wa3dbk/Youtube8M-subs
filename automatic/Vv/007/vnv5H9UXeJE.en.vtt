have invested I guess we could take a
little<00:04:12.530> walk<00:04:12.740> around<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.370> really<00:04:13.910> shouldn't<00:04:14.210> be

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
little walk around I really shouldn't be

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.150 
little walk around I really shouldn't be
walking<00:04:15.920> with<00:04:16.310> electrical<00:04:17.799> it's<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:19.100> think

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
walking with electrical it's I think

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.640 
walking with electrical it's I think
it's<00:04:19.520> I'm<00:04:19.730> walking<00:04:20.150> very<00:04:20.360> carefully<00:04:20.870> I<00:04:21.200> don't

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:44.780 
one-handed its moments before this now

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.740 
one-handed its moments before this now
see<00:05:45.680> they<00:05:45.800> design<00:05:46.190> this<00:05:46.370> one<00:05:46.639> smart<00:05:47.000> they<00:05:47.509> put

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
see they design this one smart they put

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.559 
see they design this one smart they put
this<00:05:47.930> on<00:05:48.169> an<00:05:49.330> incline<00:05:51.910> so<00:05:52.910> I<00:05:52.940> guess<00:05:53.270> with<00:05:53.479> the

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:53.569 
this on an incline so I guess with the

00:05:53.569 --> 00:06:01.719 
this on an incline so I guess with the
magnitude<00:05:53.990> velocity<00:05:59.560> the<00:06:00.560> only<00:06:00.770> moments<00:06:01.250> it's

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
magnitude velocity the only moments it's

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.790 
magnitude velocity the only moments it's
not<00:06:02.000> I<00:06:02.030> said<00:06:02.509> you<00:06:02.660> might<00:06:02.840> this<00:06:03.289> one<00:06:03.590> might

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
not I said you might this one might

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.900 
not I said you might this one might
survive<00:06:04.509> and<00:06:05.509> I<00:06:05.660> think<00:06:05.960> just<00:06:06.319> being<00:06:07.130> able<00:06:07.460> on

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
survive and I think just being able on

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.890 
survive and I think just being able on
that<00:06:08.150> incline<00:06:08.599> that<00:06:08.810> helps<00:06:09.229> it<00:06:10.690> and<00:06:11.690> they're

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
that incline that helps it and they're

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.279 
that incline that helps it and they're
smoking<00:06:13.000> never<00:06:14.000> notice<00:06:14.330> it<00:06:14.479> hit<00:06:14.630> a<00:06:14.659> Red<00:06:14.960> Cross

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
smoking never notice it hit a Red Cross

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:23.080 
smoking never notice it hit a Red Cross
and<00:06:15.680> I'm<00:06:15.800> excited<00:06:20.199> like<00:06:21.199> bar<00:06:21.440> feet<00:06:21.740> oh<00:06:22.009> oh<00:06:22.639> that

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:23.090 
and I'm excited like bar feet oh oh that

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.689 
and I'm excited like bar feet oh oh that
might<00:06:23.270> be<00:06:23.419> why<00:06:23.539> there<00:06:23.750> isn't<00:06:23.960> that<00:06:24.490> but<00:06:25.490> that's

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:25.699 
might be why there isn't that but that's

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:28.480 
might be why there isn't that but that's
only<00:06:25.880> here<00:06:26.120> that<00:06:26.240> difficulty<00:06:26.840> flooding<00:06:27.490> and

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:28.490 
only here that difficulty flooding and

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:34.559 
only here that difficulty flooding and
it's<00:06:28.729> only<00:06:30.190> time<00:06:31.190> before<00:06:31.759> it<00:06:32.050> but<00:06:33.050> for<00:06:33.470> because

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:34.569 
it's only time before it but for because

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:44.279

yep<00:06:45.289> and<00:06:45.529> it's<00:06:45.800> it<00:06:46.639> might<00:06:46.849> have<00:06:47.029> stopped

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:47.419 
yep and it's it might have stopped

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.269 
yep and it's it might have stopped
turning<00:06:47.779> but<00:06:48.289> it<00:06:48.529> looks<00:06:48.739> like<00:06:48.889> there's<00:06:49.069> not<00:06:49.219> a

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:49.279
