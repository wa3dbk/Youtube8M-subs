00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
here with very very modest funds we

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.509 
here with very very modest funds we
could<00:02:48.120> see<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.900> school<00:02:49.470> building<00:02:49.859> completed

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
the top that would bring a huge

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.849 
the top that would bring a huge
improvement<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.609> school<00:03:00.470> as<00:03:01.470> well<00:03:01.530> as
