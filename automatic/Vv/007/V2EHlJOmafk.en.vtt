00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.480
 the new law of coexistence that the 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.070
 education ministry is 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.080
 implementing has a very focused 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.030
 interesting and it is that it recognizes the 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.800
 sexual rights and 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.650
 reproductive as a component 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.880
 fundamental of every human being this is 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.310
 The main square of San Juan 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.810
 nepomuceno the department of bolívar in 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.450
 this municipality is developing 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.300
 since 2006 a very interesting project 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.070
 in this respect I will enter the table 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.870
 work of the education project for 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.970
 sexuality and construction for the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
 citizenship from here all the 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.720
 strategies that are going to be applied with the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.490
 Children and young girls of this 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.490
 region with emphasis on sexuality 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.340
 I think aracely as the months arise 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.460
 of work 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.200
 but the work table originates from the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
 own education for the sexuality of 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.390
 the normal school in the case of our 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.810
 local context because it 's a condition 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.600
 basic so that there is a participation and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.490
 true democratic consensus 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.500
 because there at the table there are students 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.390
 teachers parents and family management 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.250
 we work from the table entrance a part 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.560
 inspection care depending on the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.240
 needs that arise at the table because 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.430
 it is important to incentivize in the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.009
 education projects for 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.460
 sexuality if sexuality a 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.990
 normal dimension that is part of 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.020
 our daily life 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.909
 that we live it 24 hours that these 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.180
 projects what help to strengthen 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.820
 those processes and you can not stay 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
 only in the theoretical thing that but it 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600
 have to organize in this case that 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.710
 month adventure because how rich can 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.670
 know suddenly one of the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.090
 activities that are being developed 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.740
 in this good moment I invite you to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.840
 any activity that we are 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.619
 developing here at school notes 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.619
 in parts 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.470
 I want to know so that a work of 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.020
 theater 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.180
 good for a play and 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.330
 because a play is a way 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.280
 to use a way that the person 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.320
 draws attention for the theater 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.360
 we show what happens in the everyday and 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.450
 things 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:36.030
 reflect to sexual diversity and all 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.950
 the themes of sexuality I want 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.720
 know and masters who think and I imagine 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.730
 that the students have had the 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.230
 possibility of seeing them when you 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.340
 present here at school they have 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 received by all comments 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.519
 according address the issues that are 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.129
 they expose but in the same way what one 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.830
 wants is to send a message that they 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.870
 be those who interpret the way 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.140
 how are we taking diversity 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.940
 sexual 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.370
 and in these work tables for example 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.100
 that has been the most significant thing or what 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.140
 What has brought you the most 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.209
 called attention to you in the 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.040
 sexuality issue we are talking about 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.750
 the changes that we see the 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.570
 transformations that we see from 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.930
 these critical reflection spaces 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.209
 of analysis are all that great 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.740
 knowledge that we acquire at the table and 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.200
 we take it that we make it part of 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.730
 our life and we show it to everyone 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.160
 the spaces in which we 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.930
 we develop each one is reflected 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.850
 then all that color that knowledge 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.620
 that we acquired the transformation that 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.240
 we live someone means 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.520
 something else 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.410
 also very curious as young people who 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.510
 they are inside the table will not be changes 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.790
 only in itself but also their 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 families change and that from what 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.970
 they know and what they have learned 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.680
 inside the table they have tried to change 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.870
 his family for good and for the sake of 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.300
 society the objective of this kind of 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 activities is to incorporate the points of 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.290
 view of the students and articulate them 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.390
 in solving life situations 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.060
 everyday that have to do with the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.160
 sexuality so that they leave 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.780
 transforming into promoters and 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.810
 defenders of human rights 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.460
 sexual and reproductive 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.460
 family and educational 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.300
 but for céline I want to know how 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:24.500
 you have directed all of these 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.720
 activities towards the little ones 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.120
 because I work development 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.950
 good to us when walking our 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.260
 activity is the smallest since the 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.240
 investigative pedagogical practice and 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.070
 from the classroom project are our 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.120
 lives that allow us through 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.530
 the training students 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.200
 complementary that are the futures 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.830
 teachers from colombia work with the 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.720
 children 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.570
 objects of your botelho that are the books 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.430
 from preschool and primary then to 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.590
 through the classroom pedagogical project 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.380
 allows us to make a series 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.080
 and mainstreaming activities 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.330
 education for sensuality from every 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.920
 one of the areas of knowledge that 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.780
 develop in primary school in the 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.500
 secondary and in the same cycle of 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:08.670
 Further training 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.980
 all this work 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.500
 imagine you will not support it if the law of 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.630
 coexistence has a reason why they are the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.670
 sexual and reproductive human rights 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.480
 and we want a citizenship 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:25.009
 active that is subject to the fact 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:29.310
 Mysterious 50 for the elaboration 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:33.919
 good super good because something beautiful that 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.919
 did after the law 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.010
 but the law is born from the communities 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.410
 to cadences and that the 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.820
 particularities of country that we have not 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.610
 it's the same how you live in the 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.550
 Sexuality in a municipality like San Juan 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.440
 it's like being how you measure for example 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.630
 sexuality in a kobe ​​attempt at 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.460
 the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta or in the 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.210
 department of the guajira then the 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.210
 particularities 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.940
 taking into account when making the 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.190
 16 year law 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.050
 it is very interesting to discover how are you 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.300
 activities help children and 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.190
 girls from very young discover that 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.620
 there are other ways of thinking like 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.420
 men and women that stereotypes 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.730
 reproduce perceptions that later 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.710
 can generate intolerances or 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.500
 Violence inside families 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:24.170
 also because sexuality is not only 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.060
 Its reproductive aspect includes other 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.680
 dimensions that describe how we 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:30.440
 We feel according to our sex or 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.720
 gender and these boys and girls already have 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:35.030
 new ideas that will help you think and 

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.990
 act in a more tolerant way and 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.990
 responsable
