00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
ace card that this is what mercedes

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.600 
ace card that this is what mercedes
calls<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.060> this<00:01:17.659> is<00:01:17.899> almost<00:01:18.530> an<00:01:19.070> armored

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
calls it and this is almost an armored

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.730 
calls it and this is almost an armored
vehicle<00:01:19.790> but<00:01:20.659> let's<00:01:20.840> have<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.050> look<00:01:21.229> now<00:01:21.259> as<00:01:21.560> to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
vehicle but let's have a look now as to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.600 
vehicle but let's have a look now as to
what<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.130> changes<00:01:22.460> inside<00:01:22.700> are

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.900 

to<00:01:29.210> give<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.480> some<00:01:29.690> examples<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.310> underflow

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
to give you some examples the underflow

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.910 
to give you some examples the underflow
protection<00:01:32.450> of<00:01:32.600> this<00:01:32.840> car<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:33.260> the<00:01:33.290> first<00:01:33.620> one

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
protection of this car is the first one

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.330 
protection of this car is the first one
which<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.270> completely<00:01:35.270> closed<00:01:35.660> so<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
which is completely closed so this is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.850 
which is completely closed so this is
the<00:01:37.520> first<00:01:37.760> passenger<00:01:38.510> car<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.590> absorb

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
the first passenger car that can absorb

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.110 
the first passenger car that can absorb
the<00:01:40.640> attack<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.240> two<00:01:41.570> hand<00:01:41.930> grenades<00:01:42.110> with

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
the attack of two hand grenades with

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.800 
the attack of two hand grenades with
simultaneous<00:01:44.120> ignition

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.859 

another<00:01:48.770> thing<00:01:49.100> is<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.490> increase<00:01:50.180> thickness

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
another thing is to increase thickness

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.700 
another thing is to increase thickness
of<00:01:51.080> the<00:01:51.320> safety<00:01:51.770> glass<00:01:52.010> which<00:01:52.909> lies<00:01:53.240> mean<00:01:54.140> far

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
of the safety glass which lies mean far

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.800 
of the safety glass which lies mean far
above<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.340> thickness<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:56.000> our<00:01:56.180> competitor

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
above the thickness of our competitor

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.430 
above the thickness of our competitor
cars<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.440> this<00:01:58.100> is<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.549> result<00:01:59.330> this<00:01:59.810> results

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
cars and this is the result this results

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.540 
cars and this is the result this results
in<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:01.070> safety<00:02:01.460> level<00:02:01.820> vr9<00:02:02.479> which<00:02:03.020> is<00:02:03.259> the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
in a safety level vr9 which is the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.359 
in a safety level vr9 which is the
biggest<00:02:04.570> safety<00:02:05.570> level<00:02:05.899> for<00:02:06.380> armored<00:02:07.009> cars

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.990 

this<00:02:10.369> car<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:11.060> can<00:02:11.480> withstand<00:02:12.670> for<00:02:13.670> example

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
this car can can withstand for example

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.150 
this car can can withstand for example
an<00:02:14.860> ak-47<00:02:15.860> with<00:02:16.459> hardcore<00:02:17.090> munition<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:19.010> is

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
an ak-47 with hardcore munition this is

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.440 
an ak-47 with hardcore munition this is
a<00:02:19.190> standard<00:02:19.880> weapon<00:02:20.540> -<00:02:20.810> -<00:02:21.550> yeah<00:02:22.550> that<00:02:23.150> we<00:02:23.330> use

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
a standard weapon - - yeah that we use

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.650 
a standard weapon - - yeah that we use
to<00:02:23.660> test<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.080> car<00:02:24.350> for<00:02:24.590> example<00:02:24.650> but<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:26.420> car

to test this car for example but the car
can<00:02:26.840> even<00:02:27.140> go<00:02:27.260> further<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:28.100> can<00:02:28.510> withstand<00:02:29.530> at

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
can even go further it can withstand at

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.250 
can even go further it can withstand at

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
over 200 kilometers and that should make

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.450 
over 200 kilometers and that should make
it<00:04:46.210> pretty<00:04:46.360> easy<00:04:46.690> for<00:04:46.870> you<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.380> escape<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:48.070> you
