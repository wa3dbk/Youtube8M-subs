00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 but I think there clothes washed well yes 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:23.609
 just before the lock, let's pull it all out 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:27.029
 forgetting nothing about hanging on the beam that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.710
 it's worth the gavryusha attack 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.500
 what are you going to do really Muto Season 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 ended the end of the motoseason and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.219
 it's time to preserve your motorcycle 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.260
 figuratively books have two kinds 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.489
 conservation is in the garage warm cold 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 in some 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.250
 and at home today we will tell you how it is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.530
 do at home what you need 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.870
 do when put the bike home 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.750
 First you need to remove the battery 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.030
 so that he does not sit down over the winter more accurately pull out 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.330
 it and put it away somewhere cold dark 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:10.860
 place and periodically charge it for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.180
 in winter , my battery is stored here 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.700
 somewhere here here I already pulled it 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.700
 so here it is empty and lonely 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 so that the footboard of the bike didnâ€™t do 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 the door to your floor needs to be substituted 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.119
 anything like a board like me this 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.329
 did but the main thing that it did not see 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.430
 your wife or mom next to yours 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.390
 the room did not smell wonderful smell 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.770
 gasoline 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.380
 you need to remove the tank and rinse it that we 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.950
 today we will do for this we will close 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 tap put on o 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.250
 I hope there can be seen merge gasoline and 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.390
 we wash it 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.860
 acetone we twist our tank which we 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:05.009
 Now unscrew the hexagon on the honda 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.899
 currently 1300 baht overturns and then 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 take off 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:19.650
 as if they are three hundred removed immediately 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:25.560
 in general we twist the top and im break tea 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.540
 two times and so we removed the tank 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:33.549
 rolls out on itself rises to the top 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.720
 and here is such a system in general hose 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.640
 fuel is removed here it goes with us 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.230
 of money 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 panic further there are no two hoses one 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.079
 I already took it off, that is, if you 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.359
 overfill the tank from here all merges and 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:03:00.190
 fuel sensor we have it attached 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:03:03.940
 here the shadows are all and further tank 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.379
 unscrews these bolts 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.980
 unscrew and remove our tank 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:13.180
 pour gasoline 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.560
 open the top cover as we have 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.560
 it's almost full tank 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:31.500
 we went to create vacu open 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.500
 kraynik create rarefaction 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:55.520
 pancake time went on and gasoline sitk 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:57.610
 itec with was a lot of gas for storage 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.550
 motorcycle in the garage 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:04.760
 but it's a different story to 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:09.830
 get rid of the smell you need to drain residues 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:14.360
 gasoline from the carburetor how it is done 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.860
 here on the bottom of the carburetors there is 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.660
 hole specialty which 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.880
 leftover gasoline merge ie 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.550
 in simple language we will use a screwdriver 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.950
 here and gasoline us merge with this 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.540
 holes 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:32.090
 but here are about 50 carburetors left 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.400
 milliliters of foul-smelling substance under 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.610
 name gasoline which can 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.430
 flood your entire apartment 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:45.080
 so we drain the leftovers from there 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.970
 also plug all the holes here 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.720
 I was supposed to have a bank 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:56.180
 silencer but I took it off and therefore shut up 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.520
 all that's left here is packages or 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.060
 rag all the main thing that all this 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.590
 everything was tight and gas free 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.080
 our room also I shut up the tube 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:18.610
 which go to the carburetor drainage 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:22.160
 tubes here one here one that's all 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:25.520
 let's see how many days the fuse will still 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:28.880
 stand in the apartment later accomplish your goal 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.480
 it is also best to wash the bike 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.200
 completely so I took it apart 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:40.130
 washed as best as possible the first time first 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:42.470
 layer a few more times about launder and will 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:48.780
 in general, well, well, that all this dirt and 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:55.540
 no dust from the street was spread on our lungs 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:58.600
 remained somewhere in the sewer yet 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.090
 that so well, in general, that's all I'm 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:02.380
 I wanted to tell you and yes I did not show 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.980
 how we washed 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:08.070
 tank acetone but there's nothing interesting 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:12.790
 no, it's all very simple 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:15.130
 wash and dry it and yes and in 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.310
 the apartment will smell a few days 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.390
 maybe a week somewhere but then smell 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:26.340
 decrease if you live alone think 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:30.880
 no problems will arise from the fact that 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.680
 your unit will smell if you 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.000
 liked the video put huskies and 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.790
 subscribe to the channel 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.050
 will continue to be much more interesting 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.480
 because winter is long we will begin soon 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.720
 toxicosis who did not subscribe that filip 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.720
