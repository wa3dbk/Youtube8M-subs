00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 Barbara Schöneberger is cheeky and not funny 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.600
 Half a year ago, she said in a star interview, "I rows rows in the 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.349
 NDR and the Talkshow moderate the NDR as heard and they now to the moderators 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.020
 made as a partner of Hubertus meyer-burckhardt the blonde poison in 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.240
 Drive 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.429
 Mrs. Schöneberger in the summer they said in star interview 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:24.339
 maybe I just have to go there so moderately before the NDR Schroeder 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.800
 and then shake and scream and the next day Tiergarten already in the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.960
 Contract in the pocket so we can get everything so easily in her life No 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.780
 Not at all, but I was extremely happy that it happened 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.420
 it was a very small ninth sentence in a huge interview in the 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.390
 Pool of the interview was about something very different namely about my goals the CD 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.699
 and I only had to ask the question which is always asked where you want 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.480
 you want to moderate what you want to say someday I will 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.680
 When would you like to host the NDR Talk Show, but unfortunately he's out of style? 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.589
 someone else and percent and no train is yet to come to me 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.519
 because I really never expected anyone to ever 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.519
 and then percent has then complained then it actually 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.500
 but I think he is he so dominant »So ACE was also the one 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.500
 miss a bit cheeky and the climax there takes place 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 That's why the countries wanted with the three 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.840
 I found it so insanely per cent and and good and percent and and 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.290
 cultural 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.560
 Rethinking of this mission to participate in any way 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.250
 and me Eric Steele me in my center economists age of 33 the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.430
 Girl 30 years 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.030
 to do something that makes sense, something in the beginning and around me 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.030
 could not find the pad or any other programs and thought so 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.899
 the ndr talk show who just great 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.619
 and I had liked to look at it, I always liked to be a guest and myself 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.959
 I've always wanted Bubacks meyer-Burckhardt back and 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.870
 this wish is now fulfilled 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.020
 Maybe they cover the male audience and Maier Burkhalter 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.150
 the mothers-in-law as the value 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.790
 because he would go crazy when he learns that he is for the l 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.040
 Mother-in-law is responsible 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.890
 I think nobody can cover the audience even if you look at that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.170
 theoretically she always wears just like the Million Mountain old below 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.750
 failed celebrated four as if it did not work 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.489
 either the viewer accepts and as a duo 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.909
 whatever the parents appeal to or Daimler we sell ourselves or 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.859
 Not you yourself have said I'm still why now 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.699
 I have long said that I do not want to sing at all and then 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.389
 At some point I started to sing and then I did not want to think now 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.329
 just sing 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.189
 Singing is really great, but not only because I have to 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.680
 wanted to do my CD or so that was not all I should have 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.420
 To stand on a stage and see for people who like it 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:36.889
 is the second feeling you can have when the CD is made and the 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.709
 Percent has very often sold Euro and was a great success and it is 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:41.330
 still 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.350
 and then percent of he I can think so yes I have to 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.640
 I think it's really good on the one hand, maybe something 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.880
 make more serious park and on the other side 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.200
 in pink projects percent dress with Sophie then on the head but on one 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.200
 Stage to stand I still want to do both 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:02.899
 at their World Cup it's no mistake a lot of foam advertising campaign they look so stunning 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:05.639
 like never before what else is silent hero's secret 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.279
 because the director got me 20 percent to z 

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:11.829
 it was no joke he said a Ghana's Thaci Advent the more present not old 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.039
 why does not the patient say percent and what does he do what the electronic 

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:20.839
 beautiful received so to speak, and he managed it, so to speak, the 

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.959
 Room around me as he was below me within this picture 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.229
 it is absolute 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:27.699
 I think it's great 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.669
 then I've not really seen habs yet but one 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:33.959
 I definitely saw what was done because that's how I see myself 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 out 

00:03:37.649 --> 00:03:39.719
 how is there in love life 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.759
 Ortmeyer love life is Miss but there is still no new man and 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.510
 under and I have also made some time ago 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.719
 even if they do not talk about it anymore 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.719
 but I had a super love life 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:55.829
 around 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.719
 They have the street again if they want to go to the street 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:01.719
 Interview clock from the star in the summer 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:06.649

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:10.709
 AP closing blessing at the team out of town therefore comes driving 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.849

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.110
 Magnolia people
