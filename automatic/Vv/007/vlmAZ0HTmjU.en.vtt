00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.560 
engineering associates r88 stereo ribbon
microphone<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.950> r88<00:00:14.340> basically<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.210> made<00:00:15.420> up

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
microphone the r88 basically is made up

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.260 
microphone the r88 basically is made up
of<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.049> ribbon<00:00:16.650> elements<00:00:17.340> basically<00:00:18.000> it's

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
of two ribbon elements basically it's

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.920 
of two ribbon elements basically it's
like<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> same<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.170> having<00:00:19.529> two<00:00:19.850> r84

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
like it's the same as having two r84

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.230 
like it's the same as having two r84
ribbon<00:00:21.930> microphones<00:00:22.410> put<00:00:23.010> together<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
ribbon microphones put together in a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.040 
ribbon microphones put together in a
coincident<00:00:25.050> pair<00:00:25.580> basically<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:27.050> on

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
coincident pair basically you have on

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.339 
coincident pair basically you have on
the<00:00:28.170> top<00:00:28.439> you're<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.960> your<00:00:30.960> element

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the top you're gonna have your element

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.620 
the top you're gonna have your element
that<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:32.040> off<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:32.910> direction<00:00:32.969> and

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
that is going off in this direction and

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.500 
that is going off in this direction and
picking<00:00:34.440> up<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.770> figure-eight<00:00:35.160> front<00:00:36.000> to

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
picking up and figure-eight front to

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.540 
picking up and figure-eight front to
back<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.050> they<00:00:37.739> show<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.280> and

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
back and they show that this and

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
back and they show that this and
basically<00:00:38.850> how<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> works<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> side

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
basically how it works is it like a side

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.369 
basically how it works is it like a side
profile<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.910> each<00:00:41.969> of<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> elements<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> so

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
profile for each of the elements and so

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.049 
profile for each of the elements and so
the<00:00:43.710> second<00:00:44.070> element<00:00:44.190> here<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the second element here this is the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.020 
the second element here this is the
front<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.860> basically<00:00:46.860> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> shows<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
front and basically kind of shows the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.080 
front and basically kind of shows the
side<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.530> back<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.100> or<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.879> side

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
side and the back here or the side

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.360 
side and the back here or the side
profile<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> front<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:52.370> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
profile of the front in the back so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.560 
profile of the front in the back so
basically<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> have<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> 90<00:00:54.719> degree<00:00:55.520> X<00:00:56.520> Y<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
basically you have a 90 degree X Y and

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.670 
basically you have a 90 degree X Y and
really<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> bloom<00:00:59.609> line<00:00:59.850> pair

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
really it's actually a bloom line pair

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.170 
really it's actually a bloom line pair
put<00:01:01.680> together<00:01:01.829> here<00:01:02.219> instead<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.059> doing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
put together here instead of just doing

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.549 
put together here instead of just doing
the<00:01:03.359> bloom<00:01:03.510> line<00:01:03.719> pair<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.080> is<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.320> stock

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
the bloom line pair which is the stock

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
the bloom line pair which is the stock
configuration<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.460> microphone<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
configuration of this microphone you

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
configuration of this microphone you
also<00:01:06.600> can<00:01:06.930> do<00:01:07.110> an<00:01:07.409> MS<00:01:07.860> pair<00:01:08.250> middle<00:01:08.580> side<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
also can do an MS pair middle side if

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.590 
also can do an MS pair middle side if
you<00:01:10.110> basically<00:01:10.290> need<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.650> create<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.790> strong

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
you basically need to create a strong

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.929 
you basically need to create a strong
Center<00:01:13.049> image<00:01:13.380> or<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.860> able<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> pull<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
Center image or be able to pull the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.950 
Center image or be able to pull the
front<00:01:15.530> forward<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> imaging<00:01:17.960> and

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
front forward or back in the imaging and

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
front forward or back in the imaging and
so<00:01:19.170> basically<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.680> you<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.130> there<00:01:20.420> is

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so basically what you would do there is

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.590 
so basically what you would do there is
how<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.470> EI<00:01:22.619> describes<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
how a EI describes this just use the the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.480 
how a EI describes this just use the the
second<00:01:25.020> diaphragm<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> bottom<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.159> your

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
second diaphragm the bottom one as your

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.840 
second diaphragm the bottom one as your
principal<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.290> the<00:01:28.290> top<00:01:28.560> number<00:01:28.829> one<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.490> your

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
principal and the top number one as your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.140 
principal and the top number one as your
side<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:31.259> need<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.710> create<00:01:31.979> an<00:01:32.100> MS<00:01:32.490> matrix<00:01:33.000> out

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
side you need to create an MS matrix out

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.840 
side you need to create an MS matrix out
of<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:35.100> there<00:01:35.340> are<00:01:35.369> several<00:01:35.670> different

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
of that and there are several different

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.550 
of that and there are several different
plugins<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.869> allow<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.409> that

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
plugins that can allow you to do that

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.890 
plugins that can allow you to do that
wave<00:01:38.159> comes<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.210> mind<00:01:39.390> there's<00:01:39.630> one<00:01:39.750> that

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
wave comes to mind there's one that

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.590 
wave comes to mind there's one that
offers<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.740> MS<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.189> decoding<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> is

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
offers the MS is decoding but it is

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.109 
offers the MS is decoding but it is
something<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:43.380> manually<00:01:43.740> do

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
something that you can manually do

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
something that you can manually do
inside<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.180> da<00:01:45.390> w<00:01:45.750> or<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> console<00:01:47.040> channel

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
inside of da w or on the console channel

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.539 
inside of da w or on the console channel
strip<00:01:47.630> as<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.720> said<00:01:48.930> before<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.350> r88<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:50.100> is

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
strip as I said before the r88 is is

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.840 
strip as I said before the r88 is is
really<00:01:50.790> fairly<00:01:51.420> easy<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.840> place<00:01:52.850> basically

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
really fairly easy to place basically

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.399 
really fairly easy to place basically
they've<00:01:54.030> redesigned<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.930> used<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
they've redesigned it used to have the

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
they've redesigned it used to have the
mounting<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.920> back<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.460> now<00:01:57.210> it's<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
mounting on the back here now it's on

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.160 
mounting on the back here now it's on
the<00:01:57.509> bottom<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:59.090> it<00:02:00.090> ships<00:02:00.390> also<00:02:00.719> with<00:02:01.049> this

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the bottom and it ships also with this

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.459 
the bottom and it ships also with this
adjustable<00:02:01.880> stand<00:02:02.880> adaptor<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.869> you<00:02:04.259> can

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
adjustable stand adaptor so you can

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
adjustable stand adaptor so you can
basically<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.399> large<00:02:05.640> stand<00:02:06.060> is

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
basically with the large stand is

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
keep mentioning drums though which is

keep mentioning drums though which is
how<00:02:31.060> most<00:02:31.330> users<00:02:31.930> would<00:02:32.080> end<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.350> using<00:02:32.410> this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
how most users would end up using this

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.100 
how most users would end up using this
probably<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.510> it's<00:02:34.510> actually<00:02:34.840> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.990> be

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
probably but it's actually going to be

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.590 
probably but it's actually going to be
very<00:02:35.350> very<00:02:35.620> good<00:02:35.800> for<00:02:36.120> ensemble<00:02:37.120> recording

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600
