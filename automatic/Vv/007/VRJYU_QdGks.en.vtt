my time and do it a proper way so as you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.389 
my time and do it a proper way so as you
can<00:01:38.319> see<00:01:38.380> like<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:38.890> waveforms<00:01:39.640> here<00:01:40.030> I<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:42.250> to

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
can see like the waveforms here I had to

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.359 
can see like the waveforms here I had to
find<00:01:42.610> a<00:01:42.759> song<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.409> went<00:01:44.409> exactly<00:01:45.039> with<00:01:45.189> the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
find a song that went exactly with the

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.109 
find a song that went exactly with the
beat<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.729> those<00:01:45.939> waveforms<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:47.229> I<00:01:47.939> was<00:01:48.939> going

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
beat on those waveforms so I was going

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.960 
beat on those waveforms so I was going
to<00:01:49.240> use<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:49.659> song<00:01:49.899> for<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.140> 1v1<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.399> I<00:01:51.640> decided

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
to use this song for a 1v1 but I decided

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.919 
to use this song for a 1v1 but I decided
to<00:01:52.149> use<00:01:52.330> this<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:54.099> intro<00:01:54.549> so<00:01:55.539> I<00:01:55.569> find<00:01:55.810> that

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
to use this for the intro so I find that

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.779 
to use this for the intro so I find that
a<00:01:56.079> good<00:01:56.140> spot<00:01:56.829> we're<00:01:57.009> like<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> beat<00:01:57.459> drops

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
a good spot we're like the beat drops

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.449 
a good spot we're like the beat drops
and<00:01:58.500> might<00:01:59.500> work<00:02:00.130> good<00:02:00.490> for<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.819> thing<00:02:01.209> so<00:02:01.569> I

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
and might work good for the thing so I

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.639 
and might work good for the thing so I
like<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.489> use<00:02:03.759> youtube<00:02:04.239> to<00:02:04.270> mp3<00:02:04.509> converter<00:02:05.289> and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the 10-second range or the little blue

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.750 
the 10-second range or the little blue
the<00:02:16.540> blue<00:02:16.720> segment<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.769> it's<00:02:18.489> like

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
the blue segment is here and it's like

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.720 
the blue segment is here and it's like
nine<00:02:19.060> seconds<00:02:19.540> so<00:02:19.630> it's<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> pretty<00:02:19.989> good<00:02:20.170> time

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
nine seconds so it's a pretty good time

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.970 
nine seconds so it's a pretty good time

music that you put so I'll just play it
really<00:02:47.620> quick<00:02:47.859> for<00:02:48.069> you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.610 

so<00:02:57.620> if<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:58.010> notice<00:02:58.219> the<00:02:58.969> song<00:02:59.329> like<00:02:59.689> actually

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
so if you notice the song like actually

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860 
so if you notice the song like actually
went<00:03:01.010> with<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.549> waveform<00:03:02.030> and<00:03:02.329> I<00:03:02.540> was<00:03:02.659> pretty

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
went with the waveform and I was pretty

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.170 
went with the waveform and I was pretty
surprised<00:03:03.319> like<00:03:03.680> it<00:03:04.099> was<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> first<00:03:04.730> cut<00:03:05.030> that

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
surprised like it was the first cut that

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.599 
surprised like it was the first cut that
I<00:03:05.239> did<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.719> I<00:03:06.109> was<00:03:06.200> pretty<00:03:06.469> pretty<00:03:07.159> happy<00:03:07.250> that

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609 
I did and I was pretty pretty happy that

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.479 
I did and I was pretty pretty happy that
it<00:03:07.969> actually<00:03:08.329> matched<00:03:08.599> up<00:03:08.870> with<00:03:09.019> that<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.799> what

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
it actually matched up with that so what

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.610 
it actually matched up with that so what
you're<00:03:10.670> gonna<00:03:10.730> want<00:03:10.969> to<00:03:11.030> do<00:03:11.150> now<00:03:11.359> is<00:03:11.659> probably

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:42.169 
here I like a good font so let's go with

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:46.270 
here I like a good font so let's go with
this<00:03:42.349> one<00:03:42.620> and<00:03:43.780> let's<00:03:44.780> go<00:03:44.989> full<00:03:45.169> with<00:03:45.319> a<00:03:45.349> 36

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
this one and let's go full with a 36

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.360 
this one and let's go full with a 36
yeah<00:03:47.060> kind<00:03:47.900> of<00:03:47.959> line<00:03:48.200> it<00:03:48.349> up<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:49.220> looks

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
yeah kind of line it up that looks

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.220 
yeah kind of line it up that looks
pretty<00:03:49.549> good<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.829> now<00:03:51.829> we<00:03:51.889> have<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:53.659> caption

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
pretty good so now we have the caption

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.610 
pretty good so now we have the caption
in<00:03:54.349> there<00:03:54.560> what's<00:03:55.489> fine<00:03:55.700> like<00:03:55.939> maybe<00:03:56.269> a<00:03:56.359> good

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
in there what's fine like maybe a good

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.059 
in there what's fine like maybe a good
add-in<00:03:57.620> for<00:03:58.189> the<00:03:58.370> effect<00:03:59.090> here<00:03:59.359> so<00:03:59.659> I<00:04:00.069> think

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
add-in for the effect here so I think

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.710 
add-in for the effect here so I think
the<00:04:01.190> one<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.459> I<00:04:01.519> used<00:04:01.849> was<00:04:02.030> this<00:04:02.949> that<00:04:03.949> was<00:04:04.069> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
the one that I used was this that was it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.539 
the one that I used was this that was it
so<00:04:05.720> let's<00:04:05.900> select<00:04:06.079> that<00:04:06.290> let's<00:04:06.979> watch<00:04:07.370> it

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
so let's select that let's watch it

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:15.159 
so let's select that let's watch it
through<00:04:08.079> right<00:04:09.079> from<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:13.780> now<00:04:14.780> as<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.049> can

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
through right from here now as you can

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.800 
through right from here now as you can
see<00:04:15.229> I<00:04:15.680> probably<00:04:16.519> need<00:04:16.760> to<00:04:16.789> fix<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:17.599> let's

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
see I probably need to fix that so let's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.379 
see I probably need to fix that so let's
edit<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.440> right<00:04:18.650> around<00:04:20.949> text<00:04:21.949> tools<00:04:22.190> I<00:04:22.580> really

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 
edit it right around text tools I really

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.240 
edit it right around text tools I really
put<00:04:23.570> on<00:04:23.659> like<00:04:25.479> 270<00:04:26.479> is<00:04:26.690> when<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.710> caption

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
put on like 270 is when the the caption

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.580 
put on like 270 is when the the caption
goes<00:04:28.460> out<00:04:30.159> so<00:04:31.159> that<00:04:31.460> was<00:04:31.580> pretty<00:04:31.789> pretty<00:04:32.270> good

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
goes out so that was pretty pretty good

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.760 
goes out so that was pretty pretty good
it<00:04:33.590> went<00:04:33.860> out<00:04:33.949> right<00:04:34.220> before<00:04:34.400> a<00:04:34.610> little<00:04:34.880> fade

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
it went out right before a little fade

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.490 
it went out right before a little fade
comes<00:04:36.770> in<00:04:37.659> now<00:04:38.659> the<00:04:38.720> other<00:04:38.900> problem<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.440> I

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
comes in now the other problem is I

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.920 
comes in now the other problem is I
think<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.250> should<00:04:40.820> put<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.300> caption<00:04:41.810> in

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
think I should put the caption in

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.589 
think I should put the caption in
earlier<00:04:42.380> or<00:04:42.770> later<00:04:42.909> I<00:04:43.909> think<00:04:44.030> earlier

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
earlier or later I think earlier

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.580 
earlier or later I think earlier
probably<00:04:44.810> let's<00:04:45.050> watch<00:04:45.199> it<00:04:45.380> I<00:04:47.440> can't<00:04:48.440> really

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
probably let's watch it I can't really

tell us I'm just going to maybe like

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.159 
tell us I'm just going to maybe like
move<00:04:51.949> it<00:04:52.330> this<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.599> how<00:04:54.320> I<00:04:54.349> like<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:54.680> just<00:04:55.009> picky

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
move it this is how I like it just picky

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.480 
move it this is how I like it just picky
making<00:04:57.169> customizing<00:04:57.919> it<00:04:58.009> the<00:04:58.099> way<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.370> you

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
making customizing it the way that you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.580 
making customizing it the way that you
want<00:04:58.729> it<00:04:58.849> so<00:04:59.090> let's<00:04:59.270> see

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.260 

so<00:05:05.590> now<00:05:05.740> I<00:05:05.770> think<00:05:05.920> we<00:05:06.190> should<00:05:06.370> add<00:05:06.550> on<00:05:06.880> some

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
so now I think we should add on some

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.020 
so now I think we should add on some
time<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:08.680> looks<00:05:08.920> pretty<00:05:09.040> good<00:05:09.460> I<00:05:10.080> think<00:05:11.940> put<00:05:12.940> it

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
time it looks pretty good I think put it

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.370 
time it looks pretty good I think put it
to<00:05:13.180> 30<00:05:13.510> and<00:05:14.050> what<00:05:14.350> did<00:05:14.590> I<00:05:14.680> just<00:05:14.710> do

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
to 30 and what did I just do

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.890 
to 30 and what did I just do
oh<00:05:20.190> all<00:05:21.190> right<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.520> let's<00:05:21.670> go<00:05:21.850> with<00:05:21.970> to<00:05:22.210> 90<00:05:22.750> now

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
oh all right so let's go with to 90 now

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.450 
oh all right so let's go with to 90 now
