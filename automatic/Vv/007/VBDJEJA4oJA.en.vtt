rich tradition of making corn whiskey
the<00:00:25.310> water<00:00:25.550> that<00:00:25.970> we<00:00:26.090> have<00:00:26.270> here<00:00:26.450> is<00:00:26.540> perfect

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
the water that we have here is perfect

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.200 
the water that we have here is perfect
for<00:00:27.110> making<00:00:27.230> good<00:00:27.890> quality<00:00:28.340> whiskey<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.000> the

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
for making good quality whiskey so the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.760 
for making good quality whiskey so the
old-timers<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.750> were<00:00:29.960> making<00:00:30.259> whiskey<00:00:30.439> here

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
old-timers that were making whiskey here

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.380 
old-timers that were making whiskey here
back<00:00:30.980> in<00:00:31.009> those<00:00:31.310> days<00:00:31.340> made<00:00:31.880> really<00:00:32.270> good

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
back in those days made really good

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.570 
back in those days made really good
whiskey<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.110> I<00:00:33.620> really<00:00:33.890> wanted<00:00:34.129> to<00:00:34.309> capture

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
whiskey and I really wanted to capture

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.520 
whiskey and I really wanted to capture
that<00:00:34.760> I<00:00:34.910> wanted<00:00:35.239> to<00:00:35.330> bring<00:00:35.600> that<00:00:35.870> back<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.410> the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
that I wanted to bring that back to the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.220 
that I wanted to bring that back to the
Ozarks<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:37.760> produce<00:00:37.970> our<00:00:38.269> moonshine<00:00:38.750> we<00:00:38.960> start

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
Ozarks to produce our moonshine we start

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.920 
Ozarks to produce our moonshine we start
with<00:00:39.500> fresh<00:00:39.739> corn<00:00:39.769> we<00:00:40.640> grind<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.210> up<00:00:41.300> very<00:00:41.629> fine

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
with fresh corn we grind it up very fine

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.990 
with fresh corn we grind it up very fine
to<00:00:42.530> cornmeal<00:00:42.920> then<00:00:43.309> we<00:00:43.489> mix<00:00:43.670> it<00:00:43.790> with<00:00:43.970> water

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
to cornmeal then we mix it with water

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.990 
to cornmeal then we mix it with water
and<00:00:44.360> allow<00:00:44.900> the<00:00:44.960> sour<00:00:45.500> mash<00:00:45.800> process<00:00:46.070> to

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
and allow the sour mash process to

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.539 
and allow the sour mash process to
naturally<00:00:47.930> convert<00:00:48.470> the<00:00:48.620> corn<00:00:48.830> starch<00:00:49.129> to

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
naturally convert the corn starch to

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.000 
naturally convert the corn starch to
corn<00:00:49.760> sugar<00:00:50.030> then<00:00:50.659> we<00:00:50.809> can<00:00:50.960> add<00:00:50.989> yeast<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.830> our

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
corn sugar then we can add yeast to our

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.160 
corn sugar then we can add yeast to our
mash<00:00:52.549> and<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.180> yeast<00:00:53.390> converts<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.960> corn

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
mash and the yeast converts the corn

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.890 
mash and the yeast converts the corn
sugar<00:00:54.409> in<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.739> corn<00:00:54.949> alcohol<00:00:55.460> the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
sugar in the corn alcohol the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.210 
sugar in the corn alcohol the
fermentation<00:00:56.900> gives<00:00:57.170> us<00:00:57.350> about<00:00:57.530> five<00:00:57.979> percent

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
fermentation gives us about five percent

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.130 
fermentation gives us about five percent
alcohol<00:00:58.610> and<00:00:59.150> that<00:00:59.330> takes<00:00:59.570> three<00:00:59.870> or<00:00:59.900> four

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
alcohol and that takes three or four

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.770 
alcohol and that takes three or four
days<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.650> achieve<00:01:01.010> after<00:01:01.549> that<00:01:01.729> we<00:01:02.150> pump<00:01:02.600> our

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
days to achieve after that we pump our

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.869 
days to achieve after that we pump our
mash<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.500> still<00:01:03.619> where<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.400> heat<00:01:04.610> it<00:01:04.640> up

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
mash to the still where we heat it up

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.899 
mash to the still where we heat it up
and<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:05.630> alcohol<00:01:06.280> evaporates<00:01:07.280> travels

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
and the alcohol evaporates travels

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.700 
and the alcohol evaporates travels
through<00:01:08.150> our<00:01:08.299> still<00:01:08.659> through<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.440> condenser

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
through our still through the condenser

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.590 
through our still through the condenser
where<00:01:10.010> it<00:01:10.130> cools<00:01:10.310> back<00:01:10.549> to<00:01:10.729> a<00:01:10.760> liquid<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.390> we

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
where it cools back to a liquid and we

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.649 
where it cools back to a liquid and we
collect<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:12.280> whiskey<00:01:13.280> in<00:01:13.520> our<00:01:13.909> stainless

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
collect the whiskey in our stainless

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.440 
collect the whiskey in our stainless
steel<00:01:14.930> drums<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.680> first<00:01:16.340> run<00:01:16.670> through<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
steel drums the first run through the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.570 
steel drums the first run through the
still<00:01:17.689> we<00:01:18.200> call<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.380> stripping<00:01:18.830> run<00:01:19.040> and<00:01:19.250> we're

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
still we call a stripping run and we're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.520 
still we call a stripping run and we're
literally<00:01:19.939> stripping<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.659> alcohol<00:01:21.170> from<00:01:21.380> the

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
literally stripping the alcohol from the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.670 
literally stripping the alcohol from the
corn<00:01:21.770> mash<00:01:21.980> we<00:01:22.520> then<00:01:22.970> put<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.690> stripping<00:01:24.470> run

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
corn mash we then put the stripping run

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.130 
corn mash we then put the stripping run
into<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.490> still<00:01:25.730> run<00:01:26.360> at<00:01:26.480> the<00:01:26.570> second<00:01:26.960> time

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
into the still run at the second time

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.530 
into the still run at the second time
which<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.710> call<00:01:27.950> our<00:01:28.100> spirit<00:01:28.520> run<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:29.090> spirit

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
which we call our spirit run the spirit

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.480 
which we call our spirit run the spirit
run<00:01:29.780> comes<00:01:30.230> out<00:01:30.440> of<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.680> still<00:01:30.740> at<00:01:31.160> about

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
run comes out of the still at about

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.720 
run comes out of the still at about
eighty<00:01:31.820> percent<00:01:32.240> alcohol<00:01:32.600> or<00:01:33.110> 160<00:01:33.950> proof<00:01:34.130> so

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
eighty percent alcohol or 160 proof so

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.850 
eighty percent alcohol or 160 proof so
the<00:01:34.880> next<00:01:35.060> step<00:01:35.180> for<00:01:35.570> us<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.930> proof<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.530> down

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
the next step for us is to proof it down

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.850 
the next step for us is to proof it down
using<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.730> water<00:01:38.180> here<00:01:38.600> from<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.870> Ozarks<00:01:39.380> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
using the water here from the Ozarks the

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.520 
using the water here from the Ozarks the
next<00:01:40.100> step<00:01:40.250> for<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.820> moonshine<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.930> to<00:01:42.260> run<00:01:42.440> it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
next step for the moonshine is to run it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.350 
next step for the moonshine is to run it
through<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> filter<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.310> then<00:01:43.670> get<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.210> ready

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
through a filter and then get it ready

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.390 
through a filter and then get it ready
for<00:01:44.480> bottling<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.290> we<00:01:45.440> hand<00:01:45.710> bottle<00:01:46.070> every

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
for bottling and we hand bottle every

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.300 
for bottling and we hand bottle every
