straight across and then sew it so yeah
this<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.570> how<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.840> looks<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:24.470> super<00:03:24.799> cool

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
this is how it looks and it's super cool

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.970 
this is how it looks and it's super cool
because<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:25.579> do<00:03:25.730> not<00:03:25.940> need<00:03:26.209> any<00:03:26.450> elastic

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
because you do not need any elastic

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.069 
because you do not need any elastic
because<00:03:27.980> if<00:03:28.519> you<00:03:28.670> have<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.910> fabric<00:03:29.390> that's<00:03:29.780> very

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
because if you have a fabric that's very

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.710 
because if you have a fabric that's very
stretchy<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:30.980> won't<00:03:31.220> need<00:03:31.400> any<00:03:31.670> elastic<00:03:32.000> but

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
stretchy you won't need any elastic but

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.780 
stretchy you won't need any elastic but
if<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.049> do<00:03:33.290> have<00:03:33.709> a<00:03:33.739> fabric<00:03:34.250> that's<00:03:34.549> not

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
if you do have a fabric that's not

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.270 
if you do have a fabric that's not
stretchy<00:03:35.359> enough<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:36.709> would<00:03:36.859> have<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.160> add

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
stretchy enough you would have to add

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.420 
stretchy enough you would have to add
some<00:03:37.670> elastic<00:03:38.359> along<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.840> top<00:03:39.680> portions<00:03:40.250> of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
some elastic along the top portions of

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.849 
some elastic along the top portions of
the<00:03:40.819> band<00:03:41.600> oh<00:03:41.920> maybe<00:03:42.920> like<00:03:43.250> right<00:03:43.459> here<00:03:43.850> and

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
the band oh maybe like right here and
