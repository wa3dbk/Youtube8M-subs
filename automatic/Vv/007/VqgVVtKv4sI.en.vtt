00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.299

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.250
 highest possible from the wall 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.430

 until I give you one 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.640
 the consistency

 from the same size at the same time 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 the texture 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.030

 from the east 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.010
 from the rock table 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.050
 to repair it to disarm them 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 seville east 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.730

 to the ground 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.140
 so that a single line is left 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
