3rd Domo Hair Soldiers Image Reform Project

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.680
Hello I’m Sam.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.580
This is my engagement day.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.280
I feel so nervous

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.460
and hope today has a happy ending.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.120
(The bride) Thanks, DOMO HAIR

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.240
for my husband’s brand-new look.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.480
Everyone is so satisfied with his new look.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.420
growing up through elementary school,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.360
junior high school,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.860
college,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.480
working

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.420
and now.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740
How’s the bridegroom SAM’s new hairstyle?

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.420
(SAM's younger sister) Just come in, then I am surprised

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.420
I doubt if he is my bother.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.300
Feeling surprised !

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.640
That he becomes much younger and handsome.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.180
(Photographer) When he put it (DOMO hair system)on after,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.360
actually,

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.580
I really felt so surprised that wigs could be so real.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.060
If he in today is me to take marriage photos for the first time,

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.620
before I didn’t know his original look,

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.000
I should be unable to perceive his hair is a wig

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
He really becomes so young.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.960
I want to ask him if he wants to take marriage photos once again.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.960
What about one more reservation?

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.000
(Best man)This new look makes him more confident.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.560
I think him who not look like before

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.360
that he worried about his hairline was lost more.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.860
I think it’s a good change.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.860
(College mates)Basically, I didn’t notice it at all.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.560
Because I couldn’t recognize it was him when I got in.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.960
(College mates)I think he becomes so young.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.640
And you won’t focus on his hair.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.180
In fact he is young.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.880
(College mates) Gook-looking.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.800
Very natural.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.580
Good style.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.280
(Maid of honor)In fact the new look of the bridegroom really surprised me.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580
A successful style.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.980
I even touched his hair,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.520
I think it was really like the real hair.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.800
The feeling is exactly the same.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:20.940
(Assistant Photographer) I felt handsome

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.160
and look so different with hair and no hair.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.700
If said...

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.820
That hat can cover no hair, that is good

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.280
that is good

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.860
but comparing to having hair,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.560
comparing

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.320
having hair is more natural.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.200
Instead of a hat is a cover up.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.880
(Maid of honor)Now he looks handsome.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.400
(ex colleague) Today I saw him

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.540
and I can feel the bride who put in a lot of effort to learn

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.340
that she wanna change this.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.680
Actually, it’s quite nature

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.060
and I feel an innovative technique.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.400
(Friend) At first, we couldn't recognize him.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.440
Yes, we couldn't. That is True.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.260
We didn't know that is him.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.180
Because the original image of bridegroom ...

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.600
The bridegroom is so different from the image now.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.840
(High School Friends)  Is not recognized him.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.780
Yes.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.860
I feel he look like big difference.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.180
But a good difference.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.820
Looks like an entrepreneur.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:22.780
Yes.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.080
A young talent.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.200
(College friend) I can’t tell it .

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.220
It’s mixed with the real hair so naturally,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.140
can’t tell what’s wrong this guy

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.760
for Sam

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.140
(Assistant Photographer)After using this wig,

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.300
you can be more confident

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.780
Because I feel you look like handsome more

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.260
and younger 10 years more.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.940
(Friends) I think he can keep using this product and it is really good.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.180
(College friend) He can keep doing it.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.900
