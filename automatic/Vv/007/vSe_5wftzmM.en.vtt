00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
up for a plan that's probably ultimately

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.970

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
know for the fact that you're not going

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.240 
know for the fact that you're not going
to<00:02:47.280> succeed<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.390> ruins<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:49.110> also<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
to succeed and it just ruins it also the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.449 
to succeed and it just ruins it also the
Pokemon<00:02:50.640> movie<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.360> new<00:02:51.510> Pokemon<00:02:51.900> movie<00:02:51.989> I
