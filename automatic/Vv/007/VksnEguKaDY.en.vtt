makes the oil go underwater so the spill
doesn't<00:00:59.950> look<00:01:00.160> as<00:01:00.340> bad<00:01:00.370> as<00:01:00.670> it<00:01:00.820> actually<00:01:01.000> is

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
to this oil spill in obvious ways like

filling up our gas tanks feel surfing
and<00:01:21.190> I<00:01:21.310> found<00:01:21.580> another<00:01:21.729> way<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.390> we're

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
and I found another way that we're

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.289 
and I found another way that we're
connected<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:22.990> it<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.680> turns<00:01:23.979> out<00:01:24.190> that
