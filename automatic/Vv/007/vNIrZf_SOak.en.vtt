00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.880 
the motor and stuff you can do that
there's<00:04:19.700> your<00:04:19.850> motor<00:04:20.500> one<00:04:21.500> of<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.680> cool

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:21.890 
there's your motor one of the cool

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.320 
there's your motor one of the cool
things<00:04:22.190> about<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.640> mules<00:04:22.880> that<00:04:23.030> Kawasaki

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
things about the mules that Kawasaki

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.800 
things about the mules that Kawasaki
does<00:04:23.960> is<00:04:24.500> this<00:04:25.430> is<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.820> air<00:04:25.970> intake<00:04:26.390> for<00:04:26.630> both

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
does is this is the air intake for both

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.420 
does is this is the air intake for both
the<00:04:27.020> motor<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:27.620> for<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.100> torque<00:04:28.340> converter

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
the motor and for the torque converter

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.190 
the motor and for the torque converter
we<00:04:28.940> circulate<00:04:29.419> air<00:04:29.630> through<00:04:29.840> the<00:04:29.930> torque

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
we circulate air through the torque

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.150 
we circulate air through the torque
converter<00:04:30.260> to<00:04:30.590> keep<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.860> torque<00:04:31.070> converter

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
converter to keep the torque converter

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.450 
converter to keep the torque converter
cool<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:32.900> we<00:04:33.380> draw<00:04:33.590> that<00:04:33.830> air<00:04:33.980> from<00:04:34.190> up<00:04:34.250> here

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
cool and we draw that air from up here

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.159 
cool and we draw that air from up here
this<00:04:34.669> is<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.820> snorkel<00:04:35.270> air<00:04:35.390> intake<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.870> that<00:04:35.990> air

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
this is a snorkel air intake so that air

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.659 
this is a snorkel air intake so that air
gets<00:04:36.440> drawn<00:04:36.710> down<00:04:36.950> this<00:04:37.220> pipe<00:04:38.200> here<00:04:39.200> and<00:04:39.669> if

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
gets drawn down this pipe here and if

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.180 
gets drawn down this pipe here and if
you'll<00:04:40.820> notice<00:04:40.850> there's<00:04:41.570> a<00:04:41.630> tube<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.979> and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
you'll notice there's a tube here and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.360 
you'll notice there's a tube here and
there's<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.090> the<00:04:44.240> other<00:04:44.270> side<00:04:45.220> let's<00:04:46.220> go

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
there's one on the other side let's go

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.730 
there's one on the other side let's go
right<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.610> here<00:04:46.640> so<00:04:47.060> this<00:04:47.750> tube<00:04:48.140> coming<00:04:48.530> off<00:04:48.710> of

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
right in here so this tube coming off of

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.830 
right in here so this tube coming off of
this<00:04:48.950> bar<00:04:49.280> here<00:04:49.729> is<00:04:49.910> going<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.450> air<00:04:50.600> filter

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
this bar here is going to the air filter

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.380 
this bar here is going to the air filter
here<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.320> this<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.560> for<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.800> engine<00:04:52.190> and<00:04:52.580> so

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
here and this is for the engine and so

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.330 
here and this is for the engine and so
there's<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.900> filter<00:04:54.320> here<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:54.740> we<00:04:54.830> filter<00:04:55.190> that

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
there's a filter here so we filter that

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.950 
there's a filter here so we filter that
air<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.550> goes<00:04:55.790> in<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.030> motor<00:04:56.210> but<00:04:56.450> we<00:04:56.570> intake

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
air that goes in the motor but we intake

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.070 
air that goes in the motor but we intake
that<00:04:57.140> air<00:04:57.380> right<00:04:58.100> up<00:04:58.280> here<00:04:58.550> at<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.510> snorkel<00:04:59.960> so

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
that air right up here at the snorkel so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.780 
that air right up here at the snorkel so
we<00:05:00.169> get<00:05:00.320> cleaner<00:05:00.590> air<00:05:00.770> there's<00:05:01.040> less<00:05:01.220> dust<00:05:01.580> up

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
we get cleaner air there's less dust up

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.820 
we get cleaner air there's less dust up
high<00:05:02.000> and<00:05:02.690> the<00:05:02.870> same<00:05:03.080> thing<00:05:03.320> on<00:05:03.410> this<00:05:03.560> side

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
high and the same thing on this side

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.560 
high and the same thing on this side
this<00:05:04.160> one<00:05:04.400> there's<00:05:04.610> another<00:05:04.880> filter<00:05:05.180> right

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
this one there's another filter right

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.060 
this one there's another filter right
under<00:05:05.870> here<00:05:06.169> and<00:05:06.350> that's<00:05:06.560> for<00:05:06.740> the<00:05:06.800> torque

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
under here and that's for the torque

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.520 
under here and that's for the torque
converter<00:05:07.190> we<00:05:07.669> circulate<00:05:08.120> the<00:05:08.270> air<00:05:08.300> we<00:05:09.140> filter

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
converter we circulate the air we filter

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.950 
converter we circulate the air we filter
it<00:05:09.560> through<00:05:09.620> the<00:05:09.770> torque<00:05:10.010> converter<00:05:10.960> under

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
it through the torque converter under

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.180 
it through the torque converter under
here<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.229> course<00:05:12.380> you've<00:05:12.560> got<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:12.800> air<00:05:12.860> box<00:05:13.010> we
