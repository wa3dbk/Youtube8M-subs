00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 good afternoon also thanks for 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.280
 attend and receive us at this time 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.960
 so hard 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:13.269
 I do not know what to say 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.990
 I do not think so 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:20.710
 It is very unfair that over time you 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.640
 Place in the place it deserves 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.400
 it's like 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.900
 where the street gives you the name of 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.119
 Street once you are're dead 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:36.050
 it seems to me that it is a standard pons and many 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.560
 others and others deserved more tributes 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 in life 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.280
 and obviously for the trajectory but for 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.940
 what represents the living history of 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.240
 pedestrian the television walks divine a 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.240
 mine 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.450
 to have a certain age so that 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.720
 begin to recognize the strict 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.450
 best energy standards carry 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 Best emilio I'm Rodrigo Lussich 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.140
 good afternoon 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 we have also lost a calabrÃ³ 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.330
 little time with the biggest honor of 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.580
 the scene in the case of norm also 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.360
 a great comedian 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.670
 You could see him in Bernarda's house 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.220
 alba 'in the last time in this his 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.430
 last job with search and no no no no 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.570
 [Music] 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.860
 they told me about the laburo of super 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.390
 well there is a very tragic thing 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.729
 by Garcia Lorca beyond style 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.450
 search and that breaks the fourth bit 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.040
 wall and play some licenses be a 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.440
 great comedian consider me with no 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.590
 I had few that's a born comedian 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.729
 you will also know and you will be able to see what happens 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.369
 few with gas to end diane has 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.040
 allowed to see it and allowed that 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.840
 show off in humorous characters 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.609
 really unmissable 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.030
 say I did a comedy is how it 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:05.159
 He called cassock was pretending that he 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.490
 there are larger sacristans of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:11.880
 Spain in the life of a priest 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:15.900
 and cast 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.840
 behind its failure the failure fails 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.720
 of that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.590
 with a cast very well and color 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.110
 more brightness of normal lincoln 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.190
 and you do not know the mor world of this mine 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.610
 old 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.460
 about leading the failure with a 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.600
 dignity we were all depressed 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.600
 oysho formed 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.480
 because I was an enjoyer has to be 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.710
 on the stage that is beyond what 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.530
 what will happen to the public would be 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.840
 happy to be acting because I loved 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.400
 his laburo like all but some good 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.320
 can agree more as you said good 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.180
 we were devastated we were wrong because 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.100
 it was going badly and even for that I think it was 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.840
 an incredible now enjoy your 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.290
 profession was an advance because I 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.689
 now 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:11.019
 I take the beginning to a failure 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:14.069
 he took the same normal attitude but not 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.709
 we go to an advance of d 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.799
 had a philosophy that you had to 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.430
 enjoy everything enjoy the life of the 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.430
 laburo 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.939
 what you say transmitted it not because 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.579
 had as its own light because many 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.530
 of you had the possibility of 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.099
 know about sharing the scenario 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.250
 share chats dinners and yet 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:44.010
 people who did not know her had this 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.640
 sensation did not reach him and this light that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.890
 I had normal 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.170
 signs of positive energy 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:58.390
 it is a positive talk or 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.390
 clear negative yes 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.129
