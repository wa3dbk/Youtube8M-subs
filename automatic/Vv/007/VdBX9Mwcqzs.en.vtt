00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.630 

after<00:02:57.500> you're<00:02:57.620> done<00:02:57.650> glittering<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.400> shoe

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
after you're done glittering your shoe

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.339 
after you're done glittering your shoe
you're<00:02:58.849> going<00:02:59.090> to<00:02:59.270> take<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.630> excess<00:03:00.050> glitter

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
you're going to take the excess glitter

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.350 
you're going to take the excess glitter
that<00:03:00.620> you've<00:03:00.830> shaken<00:03:01.069> off<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.580> put<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.090> back

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
that you've shaken off and put it back

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.270 
that you've shaken off and put it back
into<00:03:02.660> your<00:03:02.930> mixing<00:03:03.200> container<00:03:03.620> so<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:04.220> a

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
into your mixing container so it's a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.330 
into your mixing container so it's a
good<00:03:04.430> idea<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.849> do<00:03:04.970> this<00:03:05.000> project<00:03:05.390> over<00:03:05.750> paper

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:31.780 

now<00:03:10.340> it's<00:03:10.520> time<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.060> other<00:03:11.090> shoe

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.280 

so<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.120> glitter<00:03:33.360> doesn't<00:03:33.600> fall<00:03:33.870> off<00:03:34.050> our

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
so that the glitter doesn't fall off our

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
so that the glitter doesn't fall off our
shoes<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.710> very<00:03:34.890> first<00:03:35.160> time<00:03:35.370> we<00:03:35.520> wear<00:03:35.730> them

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
shoes the very first time we wear them

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.640 
shoes the very first time we wear them
we're<00:03:36.390> going<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.780> spray<00:03:37.050> the<00:03:37.230> glitter<00:03:37.440> with

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
we're going to spray the glitter with

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.560 
we're going to spray the glitter with
hair<00:03:37.860> spray<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.580> hairspray<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:39.210> sticky

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
hair spray the hairspray is sticky

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.120 
hair spray the hairspray is sticky
enough<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.990> hold<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.380> glitter<00:03:40.590> into<00:03:40.860> place

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
enough to hold the glitter into place

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.280 
enough to hold the glitter into place
and<00:03:41.370> it's<00:03:41.700> also<00:03:41.910> transparent<00:03:42.780> enough<00:03:43.050> that

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
and it's also transparent enough that

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.780 
and it's also transparent enough that
it's<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.980> reduce<00:03:44.220> any<00:03:44.490> of<00:03:44.670> the

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it's not going to reduce any of the

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.860 
it's not going to reduce any of the
sparkle<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.390> shine
