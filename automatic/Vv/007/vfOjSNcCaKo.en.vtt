00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.740
 aluminum suitcases designed for the 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.030
 world of big road enduro 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.620
 one of the main difficulties of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.000
 owners of this type of bike was 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.980
 being able to find suitcases that you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.210
 adapt to the offroad style of the 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.570
 from today gv wants to get into this 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.520
 market usually had to turn 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.619
 abroad to be able to find this 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.750
 type of product with the gv 3 karol beck 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.730
 suitcases made of aluminum from a 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.090
 look extremely solid and really off 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 road 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.539
 let's see a little more in detail 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 the first thing you notice is this look 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.440
 really robust given by aluminum 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 that a highly resistant material but 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.219
 at the same time very light 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 passing to the opening system we find 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.730
 the new key to ensuring givi 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.800
 maximum security since one 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 then numerical combination key 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.910
 the mechanism is difficult to replicate 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.620
 opening is as simple as it is robust 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 as you can see it is enough after having 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.550
 turned the key up this 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 clamp that allows you to open the 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 cover 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.079
 it is also possible to remove it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 completely simply by removing 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.219
 also in another end gilli has conceived 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.840

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.400

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.580
 fixed correctly while being of 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.229
