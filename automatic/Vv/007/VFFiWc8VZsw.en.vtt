00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
hair to be moisturized water has to be

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.430 
hair to be moisturized water has to be
the<00:02:49.440> first<00:02:49.769> step<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.599> have<00:02:51.840> raved<00:02:52.110> about

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
the first step and I have raved about

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.380 
the first step and I have raved about
the<00:02:52.709> Kimmy's<00:02:52.980> who<00:02:53.099> believe<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.610> I<00:02:53.970> have<00:02:54.180> used

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the Kimmy's who believe in I have used

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.280 
the Kimmy's who believe in I have used
loc<00:02:54.690> method<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.769> done<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.190> whole<00:02:57.290> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
loc method I have done the whole you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.039 
loc method I have done the whole you
know<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.829> think<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.610> like<00:02:59.760> people<00:03:00.720> call<00:03:00.870> it

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
know I think it's like people call it

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.039 
know I think it's like people call it
the<00:03:01.200> LC<00:03:01.709> old<00:03:02.010> method<00:03:02.549> I've<00:03:02.730> done<00:03:02.879> it<00:03:03.030> all<00:03:03.269> but

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
the LC old method I've done it all but

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.990 
the LC old method I've done it all but
if<00:03:04.260> water<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.620> not<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.040> first<00:03:05.250> step<00:03:05.400> my<00:03:05.760> hair

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
if water is not the first step my hair

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.539 
if water is not the first step my hair
is<00:03:06.180> not<00:03:06.480> going<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> be<00:03:07.019> moisturized<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:08.400> way

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
is not going to be moisturized the way

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.069 
is not going to be moisturized the way
that<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:08.819> think<00:03:08.879> of<00:03:09.239> it<00:03:09.359> is<00:03:09.480> when<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> use<00:03:10.049> a

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
that I think of it is when I use a

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.199 
that I think of it is when I use a
leave-in<00:03:10.470> water<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.519> first<00:03:11.730> step<00:03:12.030> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
leave-in water is the first step and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.539 
leave-in water is the first step and
then<00:03:12.420> everything<00:03:12.900> after<00:03:13.079> that<00:03:13.319> is<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.889> seal<00:03:14.250> in

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
then everything after that is to seal in

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.580 
then everything after that is to seal in
the<00:03:14.760> moisture<00:03:14.790> from<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> water<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:16.109> I<00:03:16.319> could

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
the moisture from the water if I could

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.339 
the moisture from the water if I could
just<00:03:16.859> leave<00:03:17.160> it<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.670> hair<00:03:18.000> and<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.420> dry

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.930
