hey<00:00:02.100> just<00:00:02.370> needing<00:00:02.669> some<00:00:02.939> wiring<00:00:03.899> help<00:00:05.990> so

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
hey just needing some wiring help so

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:12.310 
hey just needing some wiring help so
took<00:00:08.309> off<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.700> lighting<00:00:09.090> gauges<00:00:09.480> but<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.679> have

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:12.320 
took off the lighting gauges but I have

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.000 
took off the lighting gauges but I have
here's<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.530> ignition<00:00:13.950> switch<00:00:15.379> there's<00:00:16.379> these

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.910 

three<00:00:20.010> visible<00:00:20.490> wires<00:00:21.260> right<00:00:22.260> here<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:22.859> I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
three visible wires right here now I

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.439 
three visible wires right here now I
assume<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:24.689> red<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.160> is<00:00:26.160> power<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:27.420> I

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
assume that the red one is power but I

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.019 
assume that the red one is power but I
don't<00:00:27.630> know<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.840> these<00:00:27.960> other<00:00:28.109> two<00:00:28.439> are

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
don't know what these other two are

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:31.519 
don't know what these other two are
whoever<00:00:30.029> owned<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.449> before<00:00:30.570> me<00:00:30.929> did<00:00:31.140> something

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
whoever owned it before me did something

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.440 
whoever owned it before me did something
that<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.740> knew<00:00:31.949> they're<00:00:32.070> supposed<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:32.610> clip

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
that I knew they're supposed to be clip

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.600 
that I knew they're supposed to be clip
right<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.110> took<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.350> off<00:00:34.610> but

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
right here but they took that off but

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.000 
right here but they took that off but
there's<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.000> black<00:00:36.329> one<00:00:36.570> with<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> yellow<00:00:37.800> or

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
there's this black one with a yellow or

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.670 
there's this black one with a yellow or
gold<00:00:38.370> ish<00:00:38.640> stripe<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.649> follow<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.670> down

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
gold ish stripe and it follow it down

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.459 
gold ish stripe and it follow it down
and<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.989> right<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> goes

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and it is right here and then it goes

00:00:49.469 --> 00:01:03.380 
and it is right here and then it goes
right<00:00:49.590> here<00:00:50.480> and<00:00:54.590> they<00:00:55.590> splice<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.489> into<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
right here and they splice it into that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:12.679 
right here and they splice it into that
one<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.700> this<00:01:05.700> thing<00:01:05.760> goes<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:08.510> so<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:11.630> so<00:01:12.630> I

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
one and this thing goes in so there so I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.030 
one and this thing goes in so there so I
don't<00:01:12.869> even<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.320> any<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.770> wires

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
don't even know what any of these wires

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
don't even know what any of these wires
are<00:01:14.630> there's<00:01:15.630> these<00:01:15.930> three<00:01:17.570> that<00:01:18.570> are<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
are there's these three that are with it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.810 
are there's these three that are with it
and<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.409> don't<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.770> anything<00:01:20.240> then<00:01:21.240> there's
