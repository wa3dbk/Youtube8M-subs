00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 with such he told you bianchi good is 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.069
 Carlos asked me for a very simple function 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.290
 that the 8 did not play did not interest him 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.469
 so much that I play as not play the 8 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 of the rival team 8 and believed that the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 team of them many was based on the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.160
 Pauline game and he sent me in a 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.100
 function that was not so used 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.539
 but as I always say it's not the most 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 important is the team and one deals with 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.199
 do what the coach asks for the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.760
 the possible way but there is what 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 extraordinary that a player of your 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 conditions of your skills that you are 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.840
 to build the game have that sacrifice 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.820
 that asks you in a certain thing and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 ball and do the rest 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.290
 to play that is the good thing and for me what 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 extraordinary of a player like you in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.379
 fernando that the things that one says 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.640
 have to demonstrate on the court I 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.960
 I can fill my mouth saying that the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.070
 team is important that always the most 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.960
 important is the equipment but if the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.059
 time they ask me function is different 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.649
 I do not try to fulfill them, surely not 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.780
 serves nothing I do not know I prefer to talk 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.920
 inside the court as appropriate and 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.170
 always thinking about the benefit of mouth 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.140
 they played a very good first half 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.509
 thought they did not block it they drowned it 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.670
 they let him play and they had space 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.320
 you when everyone around here 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.920
 I thought it was going to be a waterspout 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.530
 corinthians evokes current noises 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.920
 the handcuffed could not play passed 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.390
 really this victory if we do not 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.039
 we did that, surely we were going up 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.570
 to overcome and we would enter by 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.369
 Everywhere is a great team with 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.110
 great players we had to 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.200
 make a perfect match like what 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.600
 we did very carefully and thanks to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.909

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.060

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:43.240
 they came in the local championship fallen on 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.619

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.860

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.250
 great professionals asked again 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.840

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.729

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.000
 pending mouths of us 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.429
 results 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.290
