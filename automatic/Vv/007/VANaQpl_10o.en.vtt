00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.350
 ok let's start with this short bull than the lenny and electronic pdt 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.619
 we entered the program and once here 

00:00:09.619 --> 00:00:12.619
 let's go when registering moss 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:17.320
 bush in a declarant record 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.609
 let's put new 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:22.609
 he asks us for something we put our rock 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.080
 stephanie naumoska occupies a good legal person for a social reason 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.420
 in the remype we do not leave it in no 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.830
 public administration but this case sees work in itself 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.230
 public work regime 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.910
 and the rest left him without smoke 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 in fiscal domicile of sections 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.830
 we put a magician 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.160
 the code is 0 0 0 0 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.380
 tax domicile type or whatever you want but even better if you are the center of 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.210
 risk goes up to work 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.650
 and I put the rate 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.850
 a new one at a point 53 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.640
 I agree 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.710
 my health 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.620
 well in this part he accepted 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.830
 and our fiscal domicile was recorded 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.720
 after this 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.170
 seeing that and is all our data ready keeps more 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.640
 and as we can see we are here registered as declarant we left 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.369
 for let's proceed to register our workers record 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.110
 workers 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.910
 we select our 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.520
 I saw below we are going to proceed with importing the files that we have created 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 in the fox pro viewer 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.790
 we look for our folder 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.290
 in which all your files are 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.450
 in that electric way and we can see here 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.750
 in those files that we have created 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.630
 I in my class created only broken personal data of workers 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.740
 entitled but floral and this is correct 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.960
 ma 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.079
 give up 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.159
 the satisfactory import 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.379
 if you do not have to correct at the missal any cost 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.469
 narrated that it is committed we left ca 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.469
 i is not so much our jobs 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.719
