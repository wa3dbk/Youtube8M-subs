00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hi friends with you appleinsider.ru we 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.819
 we know that apple music is a convenient service 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.720
 which allows you to enjoy 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.610
 favorite music 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.889
 However, not everyone knows what to do. 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:22.859
 even more comfortable with the effort and let's 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:24.570
 let's see how it's done go for 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.880
 start note that this feature works 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.330
 not only for iphone but also for apple 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 watch 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.260
 However, not all the possibilities that 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.679
 available on iphone not available on apple 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.270
 watch 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.739
 for example you walk down the street with your 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.540
 watch apple watch you want 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.460
 listen to music that you don't have 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.079
 phone thanks to apple music 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 easy enough to do 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 and thanks to the series do it also 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:50.879
 more convenient for example put the music group 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.430
 nautilus pompilius and now we see that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.739
 on the phone the band started playing music 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.390
 nautilus pompilius and compilation for best 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.070
 if we want to listen to some 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.829
 specific album then we too can it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.710
 make using siri and using apple 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:14.250
 watch for example put the album titanic 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.960
 nautilus pompilius groups and now we 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.270
 we see that the Titanic album starts playing 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.130
 very first track but this is far from 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:28.920
 all for example we can skip a song 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 skip the song now played next 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 track if you know this album then you 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.729
 surely you believe the songs 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.590
 titanic will come next 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.570
 than jamon so pause 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.670
 and if you have absolutely no idea 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 What boomers now listen to something possible 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.460
 Syria will recommend you to listen 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.649
 any new hit 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.090
 for this you just need to call and 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.470
 ask to put music which 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:56.030
 is now at the top of the charts 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:59.750
 done it so put the best music and 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.400
 Now starts the track sam smith 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.580
 Well, apparently this is one of the most 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.370
 fresh hits at the moment so we 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.259
 stop the song and the following features 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.850
 will only be available for iPhone therefore 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.500
 Now we'll move on our iphone and 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.740
 now let's talk about the functions 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.420
 apple music from the series that are available 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.880
 only on iphone but not on apple watch 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.740
 There are many such functions and one of 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.600
 them called shazam we know that siri 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.730
 learned to recognize music and even 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.370
 allows you to buy recognized tracks in 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.990
 one layer thanks to apple music syria 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.330
 could do even more for example 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.090
 now we are listening to the song that sounds 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:40.690
 us from the column and we ask that syria and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.690
 recognized who sings 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.370
 let's listen 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.170
 so sitting correctly guessed at this melody 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.240
 and see we can either directly from the screen 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.440
 iphone and click on the play button to 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.270
 listen to this song or we can 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.250
 ask siri so she herself us us 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.790
 reproduced 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.790
 put this song 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:21.190
 so we hear that this song is with us 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:24.220
 sounds from our iphone and let's 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.010
 stop this song and try 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.390
 ask the siri to do something else 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.880
 for example we can say that this song 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.100
 we like and siri automatically 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.030
 will like this song perform for 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.190
 so that later 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.370
 I can recommend you a similar system 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.150
 tracks see how it's done to me 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.150
 like this song 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.680
 loss remembered that we liked it 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.760
 then this song is on our list 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.049
 preferences then I understand with 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.930
 using this iphone we can listen 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:58.239
 music that we like even more and 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.010
 so besides music from various charts and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.870
 album series can you put music 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.299
 from various playlists 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.430
 for example, and you are now at home on 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.319
 rest on the couch and want to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.670
 listen to something relaxing him 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.410
 just talk out of the series about what you 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:16.780

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:19.289

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.289

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.290
 yes this is exactly what birds singing needs 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:39.560

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:40.760
 south of nature and finally now we 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.530
 tell about one more function 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.660

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.890
 Available only in English siri 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.990

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.240
