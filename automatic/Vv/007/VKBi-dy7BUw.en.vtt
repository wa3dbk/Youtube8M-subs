think he he is more interest for his

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
think he he is more interest for his
money<00:00:57.149> than<00:00:57.690> particularly<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.350> his<00:00:58.410> talent

at the moment but of course that doesn't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
at the moment but of course that doesn't
mean<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> say<00:01:00.960> he<00:01:01.109> hasn't<00:01:01.350> got<00:01:01.469> any<00:01:01.500> talent<00:01:02.039> but

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
mean to say he hasn't got any talent but

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.100
