00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
with the worst mod 0.7 turned on and as

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.340

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.190 
much of the UI as I can turn off turned
off<00:00:38.559> what<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.489> basically<00:00:39.700> does<00:00:40.150> is<00:00:40.450> bring

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
off what this basically does is bring

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.650

the game back to how are at least close
to<00:00:43.780> how<00:00:44.230> it<00:00:44.470> looked<00:00:44.770> when<00:00:45.070> it<00:00:45.370> was<00:00:45.460> first

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.189 
to how it looked when it was first
revealed<00:00:46.000> at<00:00:46.690> 2012<00:00:47.559> III<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.900> basically

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
revealed at 2012 III so basically

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.799 
revealed at 2012 III so basically
happened<00:00:50.559> is<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:50.800> modder<00:00:51.190> the<00:00:51.550> worst<00:00:51.850> found

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
happened is this modder the worst found

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.200 
happened is this modder the worst found
within<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.379> game<00:00:53.559> files<00:00:53.860> these<00:00:54.250> options<00:00:54.910> that

stuff<00:01:03.010> that<00:01:03.280> Ubisoft<00:01:03.790> had<00:01:04.030> decided<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.659> turn

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
stuff that Ubisoft had decided to turn

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.969 
stuff that Ubisoft had decided to turn
off<00:01:05.340> let's<00:01:06.340> talk<00:01:06.549> about<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.560> while

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
off let's talk about this and I while

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.430 
off let's talk about this and I while
ago<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.220> spoke<00:01:09.700> of<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.000> watch<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.080> hogs<00:01:11.229> in<00:01:11.409> a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
ago I spoke of it watch the hogs in a

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.500 
ago I spoke of it watch the hogs in a
video<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:11.920> how<00:01:12.070> it<00:01:12.220> looks<00:01:12.250> I<00:01:12.729> said<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.360> game

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
video and how it looks I said the game

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.120 
video and how it looks I said the game
looks<00:01:13.720> good<00:01:13.930> and<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.260> did<00:01:14.440> look<00:01:14.619> good<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:15.010> it

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
looks good and it did look good and it

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.710 
looks good and it did look good and it
does<00:01:15.310> look<00:01:15.520> good<00:01:15.700> what<00:01:15.909> I<00:01:15.940> did<00:01:16.240> stuff<00:01:16.450> turned

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
does look good what I did stuff turned

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.670 
does look good what I did stuff turned
on<00:01:16.900> but<00:01:17.170> it<00:01:17.350> looks<00:01:17.530> better<00:01:17.770> with<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.790> on<00:01:18.970> and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
on but it looks better with it on and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830 
on but it looks better with it on and
and<00:01:20.680> that's<00:01:21.010> really<00:01:21.430> as<00:01:21.610> simple<00:01:22.119> as<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.510> is<00:01:22.600> it

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
and that's really as simple as it is it

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.530 
and that's really as simple as it is it
looks<00:01:23.049> better<00:01:23.290> so<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.909> reason<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.299> we're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
looks better so the reason that we're

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.899 
looks better so the reason that we're
hearing<00:01:25.900> is<00:01:25.960> parity<00:01:26.380> parity<00:01:26.799> between<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.549> PC

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
hearing is parity parity between the PC

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.760 
hearing is parity parity between the PC
experience<00:01:28.150> and<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.720> console<00:01:29.110> experience

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
experience and the console experience

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.230 
experience and the console experience
that<00:01:30.730> the<00:01:31.510> next-gen<00:01:32.200> consoles<00:01:33.000> they're<00:01:34.000> just

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
that the next-gen consoles they're just

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.570 
that the next-gen consoles they're just
not<00:01:34.390> as<00:01:34.570> powerful<00:01:34.750> as<00:01:35.370> Ubisoft<00:01:36.370> were

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
not as powerful as Ubisoft were

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.760 
not as powerful as Ubisoft were
expecting<00:01:37.120> them<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.300> be<00:01:37.450> when<00:01:37.930> development<00:01:38.680> on

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
expecting them to be when development on

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.830 
expecting them to be when development on
watch<00:01:38.980> dogs<00:01:39.190> began<00:01:39.700> so<00:01:40.330> there<00:01:40.450> was<00:01:40.570> all<00:01:40.690> these

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
watch dogs began so there was all these

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.510 
watch dogs began so there was all these
options<00:01:41.260> that<00:01:41.440> they<00:01:41.470> couldn't<00:01:41.800> implement<00:01:42.100> so

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
options that they couldn't implement so

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.120 
options that they couldn't implement so
they<00:01:42.640> decided<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.270> turn<00:01:43.480> them<00:01:43.660> off<00:01:43.810> on<00:01:44.020> PC<00:01:44.470> to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
they decided to turn them off on PC to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.210 
they decided to turn them off on PC to
make<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.640> next-gen<00:01:46.150> console<00:01:46.690> and<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.220> pc

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
make the next-gen console and the pc

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.910 
make the next-gen console and the pc
version<00:01:48.250> be<00:01:48.940> reasonably<00:01:49.630> similar<00:01:49.960> now<00:01:50.560> even

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
version be reasonably similar now even

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.830 
version be reasonably similar now even
when<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> these<00:01:51.490> options<00:01:51.940> turned<00:01:52.240> on<00:01:52.390> I'm<00:01:52.630> not

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
when I these options turned on I'm not

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.560 
when I these options turned on I'm not
like<00:01:53.550> giving<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> huge<00:01:54.850> manta<00:01:55.030> credence<00:01:55.480> to

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
like giving a huge manta credence to

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.860 
like giving a huge manta credence to
these<00:01:55.810> arguments<00:01:56.140> even<00:01:56.800> when<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.100> these

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
these arguments even when I these

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.390 
these arguments even when I these
options<00:01:58.870> turn<00:01:59.080> on<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.560> pc<00:01:59.770> version<00:01:59.920> just

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
options turn on the pc version just

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.170 
options turn on the pc version just
looks<00:02:00.640> way<00:02:00.790> better<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.300> on<00:02:02.110> console<00:02:02.820> our<00:02:03.820> done

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
looks way better and on console our done

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.830 
looks way better and on console our done
console<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.990> quite<00:02:05.830> frankly<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:07.630> is

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
console and quite frankly and it is

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.229 
console and quite frankly and it is
superior<00:02:08.200> and<00:02:08.530> that<00:02:09.489> goes<00:02:09.640> what<00:02:09.849> I<00:02:09.909> saying

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
superior and that goes what I saying

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.449 
superior and that goes what I saying
being<00:02:10.539> run<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.989> decent<00:02:11.500> spec<00:02:11.739> PC<00:02:12.159> it<00:02:12.340> will

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
being run on a decent spec PC it will

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.350 
being run on a decent spec PC it will
look<00:02:12.640> better<00:02:12.819> than<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.269> a<00:02:13.300> console<00:02:14.280> hardly

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
look better than on a console hardly

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.059 
look better than on a console hardly
hardly<00:02:16.360> shocking<00:02:16.690> news<00:02:17.110> but<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:17.920> these

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
hardly shocking news but with these

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.339 
hardly shocking news but with these
options<00:02:18.550> turned<00:02:18.849> on<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.360> does<00:02:19.629> do<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.019> lot<00:02:20.170> of

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
options turned on it does do a lot of

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.649 
options turned on it does do a lot of
stuff<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:20.680> clearly<00:02:21.250> dwarfs<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> hardware's

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
stuff that clearly dwarfs the hardware's

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.330

and now your pc is starting to struggle
they<00:03:26.870> may<00:03:27.110> not<00:03:27.140> be<00:03:27.470> able<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.770> run<00:03:27.920> watchdogs

on<00:03:31.570> ultra<00:03:32.570> so<00:03:33.380> why<00:03:33.950> do<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.160> have<00:03:34.400> ultra<00:03:34.760> options

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
on ultra so why do I have ultra options

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.910 
on ultra so why do I have ultra options
that<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.390> can<00:03:35.630> run<00:03:35.750> why<00:03:36.230> don't<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.530> remove<00:03:36.890> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
that I can run why don't we remove the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.130 
that I can run why don't we remove the
ultra<00:03:37.460> options<00:03:37.850> because<00:03:38.270> other<00:03:38.570> people<00:03:38.990> don't

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
ultra options because other people don't

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.740 
ultra options because other people don't
have<00:03:39.290> good<00:03:40.070> enough<00:03:40.280> PC<00:03:40.670> spat<00:03:41.030> on<00:03:41.180> ultra<00:03:41.540> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
have good enough PC spat on ultra and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.330 
have good enough PC spat on ultra and
then<00:03:42.080> some<00:03:42.320> people<00:03:42.470> won't<00:03:42.770> have<00:03:42.890> good<00:03:43.160> enough

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
then some people won't have good enough

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.000 
then some people won't have good enough
pcs<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:44.030> play<00:03:44.210> it<00:03:44.360> on<00:03:44.510> even<00:03:45.080> high<00:03:45.260> so<00:03:45.680> why<00:03:45.800> don't

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
pcs to play it on even high so why don't

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.880 
pcs to play it on even high so why don't
we<00:03:46.040> just<00:03:46.250> cut<00:03:46.490> out<00:03:46.700> all<00:03:46.970> pc<00:03:47.540> games<00:03:47.810> at<00:03:48.050> medium

of this stuff that the xbox one and the
ps4<00:03:54.800> can't<00:03:55.610> do<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.810> why<00:03:57.140> don't<00:03:57.590> we<00:03:57.680> just<00:03:57.770> cut

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
ps4 can't do so why don't we just cut

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.690 
ps4 can't do so why don't we just cut
out<00:03:58.910> everything<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.900> wii<00:04:00.080> u<00:04:00.260> levels<00:04:00.710> that's

it so why don't we just kept everything

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.310 
it so why don't we just kept everything
out<00:04:12.230> at<00:04:12.709> oh<00:04:13.160> yeah<00:04:13.400> levels<00:04:13.940> for<00:04:14.270> parity<00:04:14.720> but

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
out at oh yeah levels for parity but

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.650 
out at oh yeah levels for parity but
then<00:04:15.500> what<00:04:16.370> about<00:04:16.459> game<00:04:16.820> what<00:04:17.120> a<00:04:17.150> mobile

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
then what about game what a mobile

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.120 
then what about game what a mobile
gaming<00:04:17.900> what<00:04:18.170> are<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.320> people<00:04:18.470> under<00:04:18.739> phones

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
gaming what are the people under phones

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.820 
gaming what are the people under phones
phones<00:04:19.850> can't<00:04:20.299> really<00:04:20.570> do<00:04:20.720> what<00:04:20.989> consoles<00:04:21.500> or

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
phones can't really do what consoles or

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.760 
phones can't really do what consoles or
pcs<00:04:22.520> can<00:04:22.940> do<00:04:23.120> so<00:04:23.960> why<00:04:24.110> don't<00:04:24.260> we<00:04:24.290> just<00:04:24.350> cap

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
pcs can do so why don't we just cap

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.150 
pcs can do so why don't we just cap
everything<00:04:25.370> to<00:04:25.630> mobile<00:04:26.630> gaming<00:04:26.960> levels<00:04:27.500> do

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
everything to mobile gaming levels do

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.770 
everything to mobile gaming levels do
you<00:04:28.220> know<00:04:28.340> why<00:04:28.550> because<00:04:29.210> that<00:04:29.420> would<00:04:29.750> be

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
you know why because that would be

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.220 
you know why because that would be
fucking<00:04:30.350> stupid<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:31.730> the<00:04:32.660> argument<00:04:32.870> that

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
fucking stupid so the argument that

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.910 
fucking stupid so the argument that
there's<00:04:33.500> any<00:04:33.620> validity<00:04:33.710> to<00:04:34.370> parity<00:04:35.300> is<00:04:35.920> dumb

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:36.920 
there's any validity to parity is dumb

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.910 
there's any validity to parity is dumb
as<00:04:37.100> fuck<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.700> there<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.780> no<00:04:38.900> logic<00:04:39.410> there<00:04:39.650> it's

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
as fuck and there is no logic there it's

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.350 
as fuck and there is no logic there it's
just<00:04:40.160> people<00:04:40.310> being<00:04:40.520> bought<00:04:40.820> her<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.030> they

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
just people being bought her that they

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.180 
just people being bought her that they
can't<00:04:41.600> do<00:04:41.810> shit<00:04:42.080> that<00:04:42.320> they<00:04:42.350> want<00:04:42.710> to<00:04:42.800> do<00:04:42.920> and

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
can't do shit that they want to do and

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.650 
can't do shit that they want to do and

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
that they're you know where they

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.420 
that they're you know where they
invested<00:04:45.140> their<00:04:45.260> money<00:04:45.290> isn't<00:04:45.950> getting<00:04:46.100> them

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
invested their money isn't getting them

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.409 
invested their money isn't getting them
the<00:04:46.580> results<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:47.090> they<00:04:47.270> want<00:04:47.390> to<00:04:47.690> get<00:04:48.250> etc

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
the results that they want to get etc

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.940 
the results that they want to get etc
it's<00:04:50.419> fucking<00:04:50.810> stupid<00:04:51.020> and<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.560> shall<00:04:51.800> not

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
it's fucking stupid and I shall not

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.750 
it's fucking stupid and I shall not
entertain<00:04:52.460> it

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
entertain it

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.100 
entertain it
and<00:04:54.220> Ubisoft<00:04:55.220> have<00:04:55.580> really<00:04:56.300> fucked<00:04:56.570> up<00:04:56.780> here

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and Ubisoft have really fucked up here

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.920 
and Ubisoft have really fucked up here
because<00:04:57.800> what<00:04:58.430> they<00:04:58.580> did<00:04:58.880> was<00:04:59.120> they<00:04:59.180> created<00:04:59.600> a

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
because what they did was they created a

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.740 
because what they did was they created a
game<00:05:00.170> that<00:05:00.770> looked<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.160> certain<00:05:01.340> way<00:05:01.570> then<00:05:02.570> they

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
game that looked a certain way then they

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.330 
game that looked a certain way then they
decided<00:05:03.140> that<00:05:03.290> systems<00:05:03.860> couldn't<00:05:04.190> run

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
decided that systems couldn't run

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.890 
decided that systems couldn't run
instead<00:05:04.640> it<00:05:04.790> turned<00:05:04.940> off<00:05:05.180> a<00:05:05.210> lot<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.600> shit

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
instead it turned off a lot of the shit

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.200 
instead it turned off a lot of the shit
but<00:05:06.500> they<00:05:06.650> turned<00:05:06.710> it<00:05:07.070> off<00:05:07.190> for<00:05:07.220> people<00:05:08.060> who

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
but they turned it off for people who

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.920 
but they turned it off for people who
could<00:05:08.540> run<00:05:08.780> it<00:05:08.930> that<00:05:09.080> way<00:05:09.460> that<00:05:10.460> was<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> mistake

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
could run it that way that was a mistake

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.950 
could run it that way that was a mistake
mistake<00:05:11.930> number<00:05:12.080> two<00:05:13.210> was<00:05:14.210> to<00:05:14.390> create<00:05:14.570> lots

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
mistake number two was to create lots

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.110 
mistake number two was to create lots
and<00:05:15.200> lots<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.470> game<00:05:15.740> footage<00:05:16.220> with<00:05:16.910> these

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
and lots of game footage with these

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.540 
and lots of game footage with these
options<00:05:17.630> all<00:05:17.810> turned<00:05:18.140> on<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.680> then<00:05:19.250> using

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
options all turned on and then using

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.460 
options all turned on and then using
that<00:05:19.700> game<00:05:20.090> footage<00:05:20.420> to<00:05:20.750> promote<00:05:21.110> the<00:05:21.320> game

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
that game footage to promote the game

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.930 
that game footage to promote the game
and<00:05:21.770> implied<00:05:22.250> at<00:05:22.400> that<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:22.670> how<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.850> game

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
and implied at that is how the game

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.710 
and implied at that is how the game
would<00:05:23.180> look<00:05:23.480> that<00:05:24.140> adds<00:05:24.470> a<00:05:24.890> new<00:05:25.130> level<00:05:25.580> of

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
would look that adds a new level of

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.630 
would look that adds a new level of
underhandedness<00:05:26.720> to<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.230> whole<00:05:27.440> setup<00:05:28.040> which

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
underhandedness to the whole setup which

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.050 
underhandedness to the whole setup which
I<00:05:28.790> find<00:05:29.030> to<00:05:29.180> be<00:05:29.270> rather<00:05:29.600> distasteful<00:05:30.320> and<00:05:31.100> it

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
I find to be rather distasteful and it

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.640 
I find to be rather distasteful and it
was<00:05:32.480> a<00:05:32.510> case<00:05:32.780> of<00:05:32.810> this<00:05:33.200> is<00:05:33.290> what<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.530> game

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
was a case of this is what the game

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.500 
was a case of this is what the game
looks<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:34.130> we're<00:05:34.430> gonna<00:05:34.610> lie<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:34.910> you<00:05:35.270> right

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
looks like we're gonna lie to you right

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.760 
looks like we're gonna lie to you right
now<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:35.900> then<00:05:36.020> we're<00:05:36.110> going<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.290> turn<00:05:36.500> off<00:05:36.620> all

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
now and then we're going to turn off all

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.560 
now and then we're going to turn off all
these<00:05:36.920> options<00:05:37.370> we're<00:05:37.970> not<00:05:38.060> gonna<00:05:38.180> say<00:05:38.420> we

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
these options we're not gonna say we

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.970 
these options we're not gonna say we
turned<00:05:38.780> off<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.930> options<00:05:39.440> or<00:05:39.590> that's<00:05:39.740> how<00:05:39.920> the

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 
turned off the options or that's how the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.000 
turned off the options or that's how the
game<00:05:40.250> looks<00:05:41.530> will<00:05:42.530> have<00:05:42.650> changed

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 
game looks will have changed

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.800 
game looks will have changed
dramatically<00:05:43.490> and<00:05:44.120> then<00:05:44.450> we're<00:05:44.570> not<00:05:44.690> even

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
dramatically and then we're not even

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.120 
dramatically and then we're not even
going<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.050> admit<00:05:45.380> to<00:05:45.560> the<00:05:45.650> fact<00:05:45.800> that<00:05:45.950> these

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
going to admit to the fact that these

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.910 
going to admit to the fact that these
options<00:05:46.610> are<00:05:46.730> there<00:05:46.970> in<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.390> game<00:05:47.600> and<00:05:47.920> could

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 
options are there in the game and could

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.500 
options are there in the game and could
have<00:05:49.010> been<00:05:49.190> used<00:05:49.460> by<00:05:49.670> people<00:05:49.730> who<00:05:50.150> are<00:05:50.300> capable

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
have been used by people who are capable

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.620 
have been used by people who are capable
of<00:05:50.840> doing<00:05:51.200> so<00:05:51.410> it's<00:05:52.130> all<00:05:52.430> just<00:05:52.760> very<00:05:52.850> very<00:05:53.390> very

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
of doing so it's all just very very very

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.640 
of doing so it's all just very very very
bad<00:05:53.960> so<00:05:54.770> we<00:05:54.920> can<00:05:55.070> add<00:05:55.250> that<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:57.050> the<00:05:57.350> list<00:05:57.380> of

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
bad so we can add that to the list of

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.890 
bad so we can add that to the list of
stupid<00:05:58.010> shit<00:05:58.040> that<00:05:58.400> Ubisoft<00:05:59.270> insists<00:05:59.780> on

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
stupid shit that Ubisoft insists on
