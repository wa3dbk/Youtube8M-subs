hello<00:00:01.439> everyone<00:00:01.890> Rekha<00:00:02.250> Billy<00:00:02.550> here<00:00:02.939> today<00:00:03.780> I

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hello everyone Rekha Billy here today I

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.860 
hello everyone Rekha Billy here today I
want<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.440> show<00:00:04.680> you<00:00:04.740> how<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.009> do<00:00:05.279> different

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.870 
want to show you how to do different

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.960 
want to show you how to do different
speeds<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.109> clunks<00:00:07.859> in<00:00:08.040> 1.9

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
speeds of clunks in 1.9

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.789 
speeds of clunks in 1.9
now<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.139> 1.8<00:00:10.830> in<00:00:11.040> previous<00:00:11.700> versions<00:00:12.620> we<00:00:13.620> were

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
now in 1.8 in previous versions we were

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
now in 1.8 in previous versions we were
able<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.070> do<00:00:14.309> almost<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.690> same<00:00:15.780> thing<00:00:16.020> but<00:00:16.650> now

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
able to do almost the same thing but now

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.000 
able to do almost the same thing but now
we<00:00:17.010> have<00:00:17.460> different<00:00:17.699> types<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> clocks<00:00:18.619> so<00:00:19.619> I

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
we have different types of clocks so I

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.070 
we have different types of clocks so I
thought<00:00:20.490> we'd<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:20.939> ahead<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.210> revisit<00:00:21.779> for

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
thought we'd go ahead and revisit for

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.660 
thought we'd go ahead and revisit for
any<00:00:22.320> newcomers<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.300> commandblocks

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
any newcomers to commandblocks

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.720 
any newcomers to commandblocks
this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.939> probably<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:28.199> far<00:00:28.890> as<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.400> tell

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
this is probably as far as I can tell

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
this is probably as far as I can tell
this<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.210> probably<00:00:30.570> gonna<00:00:30.750> be<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.050> way<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this is probably gonna be the way that

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.139 
this is probably gonna be the way that
we<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.800> clocks<00:00:32.219> from<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:34.489> for<00:00:35.489> minigames

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
we do clocks from now on for minigames

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.830 
we do clocks from now on for minigames
and<00:00:36.540> adventure<00:00:36.960> maps<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.710> okay<00:00:38.840> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and adventure maps and so on okay so

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.590 
and adventure maps and so on okay so
these<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.320> basic<00:00:40.710> clocks<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> sidebar

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
these are basic clocks on the sidebar

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.990 
these are basic clocks on the sidebar
you<00:00:42.899> can<00:00:43.050> see<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.500> have<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> scoreboard<00:00:44.219> set<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
you can see I have a scoreboard set to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
you can see I have a scoreboard set to
count<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.570> my<00:00:45.989> score<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.590> zero<00:00:47.600> if<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.870> stand<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
count and my score is zero if I stand on

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.139 
count and my score is zero if I stand on
one<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.460> these<00:00:51.289> relative<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.340> armorstands

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
one of these relative to the armorstands

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.450 
one of these relative to the armorstands
if<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:54.960> stand<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.590> these<00:00:55.770> iron<00:00:56.100> blocks

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
if I stand on one of these iron blocks

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
if I stand on one of these iron blocks
that<00:00:56.910> counts<00:00:57.629> score<00:00:58.079> will<00:00:58.379> go<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:59.300> this<00:01:00.300> one

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that counts score will go up this one

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.009 
that counts score will go up this one
right<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.050> fast<00:01:01.320> clock<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> regular

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
right here the fast clock is the regular

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.130 
right here the fast clock is the regular
speed<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.799> which<00:01:05.309> these<00:01:05.820> clocks<00:01:06.210> counts<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.080> if

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
speed at which these clocks counts so if

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.859 
speed at which these clocks counts so if
I<00:01:07.260> stand<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.619> you<00:01:08.040> can<00:01:08.670> see<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.420> going

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
I stand here you can see that is going

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.500 
I stand here you can see that is going
up<00:01:10.080> pretty<00:01:10.470> quickly<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.909> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> reset

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
up pretty quickly it's going to reset

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.969 
up pretty quickly it's going to reset
that<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.840> zero<00:01:13.580> now<00:01:14.630> we<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.110> medium<00:01:16.680> clock

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
that to zero now we have a medium clock

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.620 
that to zero now we have a medium clock
here<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.060> stand<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.950> see<00:01:20.630> it's

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
here so if I stand here you can see it's

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.679 
here so if I stand here you can see it's
going<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.110> pretty<00:01:22.710> quickly<00:01:23.159> but<00:01:23.700> not<00:01:24.119> nearly

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
going up pretty quickly but not nearly

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.820 
going up pretty quickly but not nearly
as<00:01:25.020> fast

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.630 

now<00:01:30.830> we<00:01:30.890> have<00:01:31.220> a<00:01:31.490> slower<00:01:32.060> clock<00:01:33.640> yeah

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
now we have a slower clock yeah

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.370 
now we have a slower clock yeah
definitely<00:01:35.510> a<00:01:35.540> slow<00:01:35.900> clock<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:39.550> finally<00:01:40.550> a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
definitely a slow clock and finally a

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.960 
definitely a slow clock and finally a
really<00:01:42.380> slow<00:01:42.650> clock<00:01:46.300> yeah<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:48.740> is<00:01:48.970> extremely

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
really slow clock yeah that is extremely

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.490 
really slow clock yeah that is extremely
slow

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
slow

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.100 
slow
compare<00:01:52.160> this<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:55.540> Vince<00:01:58.810> so<00:01:59.810> you<00:01:59.900> can

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
compare this to Vince so you can

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.560 
compare this to Vince so you can
definitely<00:02:00.290> have<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.890> very<00:02:01.460> wide<00:02:01.759> range<00:02:02.180> of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
definitely have a very wide range of

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.320 
definitely have a very wide range of
speeds<00:02:03.470> in<00:02:03.860> fact<00:02:04.369> you<00:02:04.520> can<00:02:04.640> go<00:02:04.790> a<00:02:04.820> lot<00:02:05.090> slower

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
speeds in fact you can go a lot slower

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.800 
speeds in fact you can go a lot slower
than<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:06.130> I'm<00:02:07.130> not<00:02:07.369> sure<00:02:07.759> how<00:02:08.000> much<00:02:08.149> faster

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
than this I'm not sure how much faster

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.570 
than this I'm not sure how much faster
you<00:02:09.170> can<00:02:09.530> go<00:02:09.860> though<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:12.070> yeah<00:02:13.070> I<00:02:13.100> think<00:02:13.190> I

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
you can go though so yeah I think I

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.460 
you can go though so yeah I think I
think<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.120> probably<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.810> fastest<00:02:15.260> we'll

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
think this is probably the fastest we'll

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.400 
think this is probably the fastest we'll
be<00:02:15.590> able<00:02:15.709> to<00:02:16.040> do<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.459> cloth<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.840> far<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.230> I<00:02:18.350> can

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
be able to do a cloth as far as I can

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.880 
be able to do a cloth as far as I can
tell<00:02:19.270> there<00:02:20.270> might<00:02:20.420> be<00:02:20.450> ways<00:02:20.720> around<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.200> but

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
tell there might be ways around it but

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.770 
tell there might be ways around it but
let<00:02:22.489> me<00:02:22.580> go<00:02:22.700> ahead<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.880> show<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.270> guys<00:02:23.360> what's

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
let me go ahead and show you guys what's

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.010 
let me go ahead and show you guys what's
going<00:02:24.020> on<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:25.430> first<00:02:25.700> one<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.209> simplest<00:02:26.810> and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
going on this first one the simplest and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.840 
going on this first one the simplest and
easy<00:02:27.170> one

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
easy one

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.460 
easy one
basically<00:02:28.850> it's<00:02:29.180> executing<00:02:29.870> from<00:02:30.200> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
basically it's executing from the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.540 
basically it's executing from the
armorstand

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
armorstand

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.860 
armorstand
and<00:02:31.640> it's<00:02:32.239> counting<00:02:32.780> my<00:02:33.470> score<00:02:33.830> up<00:02:34.450> if<00:02:35.450> I'm<00:02:35.690> in

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
and it's counting my score up if I'm in

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.470 
and it's counting my score up if I'm in
the<00:02:36.019> correct<00:02:36.260> spot<00:02:36.650> so<00:02:36.920> count<00:02:37.220> add<00:02:37.970> one<00:02:38.300> to

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
the correct spot so count add one to

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.750 
the correct spot so count add one to
count<00:02:38.660> if<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.680> am<00:02:39.800> there

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
count if I am there

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600 
count if I am there
so<00:02:41.300> no<00:02:41.629> problem<00:02:42.019> that's<00:02:42.349> how<00:02:42.890> that<00:02:42.950> works<00:02:43.280> now

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
so no problem that's how that works now

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.020 
so no problem that's how that works now
these<00:02:44.390> ones<00:02:44.720> are<00:02:45.409> all<00:02:45.830> pretty<00:02:46.280> similar<00:02:46.790> so

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
these ones are all pretty similar so

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.649 
these ones are all pretty similar so
let's<00:02:47.870> go<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.230> check<00:02:48.440> them<00:02:48.590> out<00:02:49.450> we<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.480> an

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
let's go and check them out we have an

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.649 
let's go and check them out we have an
execute<00:02:51.230> @e<00:02:51.769> whose<00:02:52.069> name<00:02:52.459> equals<00:02:53.450> medium

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
execute @e whose name equals medium

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.880 
execute @e whose name equals medium
clock<00:02:54.400> that's<00:02:55.400> this<00:02:55.640> guy<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:57.019> it's<00:02:57.650> going

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
clock that's this guy and it's going

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.509 
clock that's this guy and it's going
from<00:02:58.430> negative<00:02:59.180> 5x<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.769> direction<00:03:01.040> of

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
from negative 5x so in the direction of

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.180 
from negative 5x so in the direction of
execute<00:03:02.390> @p<00:03:02.840> whose<00:03:03.080> radius<00:03:03.470> equals<00:03:03.769> zero<00:03:03.980> so

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
execute @p whose radius equals zero so

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.949 
execute @p whose radius equals zero so
that's<00:03:04.310> just<00:03:04.549> basically<00:03:05.000> saying<00:03:05.330> if<00:03:05.480> I'm<00:03:05.720> in

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
that's just basically saying if I'm in

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.630 
that's just basically saying if I'm in
that<00:03:06.220> spot<00:03:07.220> then<00:03:08.560> do<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.799> next<00:03:10.010> command<00:03:10.459> this

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
that spot then do the next command this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.630 
that spot then do the next command this

clock speed min equals one block speed

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.580 
clock speed min equals one block speed
one<00:03:22.640> now<00:03:23.480> that<00:03:24.319> means<00:03:24.620> I<00:03:24.890> have<00:03:25.310> a<00:03:25.579> new

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
one now that means I have a new

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.610 
one now that means I have a new
scoreboard<00:03:27.590> objective<00:03:27.950> called<00:03:28.670> clock<00:03:28.970> speed

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
scoreboard objective called clock speed

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.770 
scoreboard objective called clock speed
now<00:03:30.620> if<00:03:30.769> I<00:03:30.859> do<00:03:30.920> slash<00:03:31.310> scoreboard<00:03:31.970> objective

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
now if I do slash scoreboard objective

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.210 
now if I do slash scoreboard objective
set<00:03:33.680> display<00:03:34.040> sidebar<00:03:34.760> clock<00:03:35.209> speed<00:03:36.040> we<00:03:37.040> can

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
set display sidebar clock speed we can

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.720 
set display sidebar clock speed we can
see<00:03:37.430> we<00:03:37.549> have<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.879> few<00:03:38.180> different<00:03:38.329> scores<00:03:38.930> set

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
see we have a few different scores set

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.789 
see we have a few different scores set
so<00:03:40.730> a<00:03:40.760> fast<00:03:41.269> clock<00:03:41.629> he<00:03:41.930> doesn't<00:03:42.290> need<00:03:42.379> a<00:03:42.440> score

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
so a fast clock he doesn't need a score

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.909 
so a fast clock he doesn't need a score
set<00:03:43.099> that's<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.849> there<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:45.049> kind<00:03:45.590> of<00:03:45.680> signify

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
set that's just there to kind of signify

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.940 
set that's just there to kind of signify
that<00:03:46.430> yes<00:03:46.639> this<00:03:46.880> is<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.269> fast<00:03:47.569> clock<00:03:47.950> medium

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
that yes this is a fast clock medium

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.930 
that yes this is a fast clock medium
clock<00:03:49.220> though<00:03:49.489> has<00:03:50.120> a<00:03:50.510> score<00:03:51.079> of<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:52.669> believe

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
clock though has a score of I believe

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.330 
clock though has a score of I believe
it's<00:03:53.450> either<00:03:53.599> fine<00:03:54.230> you<00:03:54.650> know<00:03:54.709> what<00:03:54.859> it's<00:03:55.069> 5

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
it's either fine you know what it's 5

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.740 
it's either fine you know what it's 5
it's<00:03:55.639> 5<00:03:56.079> so<00:03:57.079> if<00:03:57.410> we<00:03:57.560> go<00:03:57.739> here<00:03:57.769> you<00:03:58.220> can<00:03:58.910> see<00:03:59.180> his

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
it's 5 so if we go here you can see his

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.670 
it's 5 so if we go here you can see his
score<00:04:00.169> is<00:04:00.200> changing<00:04:00.980> very<00:04:01.010> quickly<00:04:02.530> so<00:04:03.530> what

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
score is changing very quickly so what

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.050 
score is changing very quickly so what
it's<00:04:03.829> doing<00:04:03.919> is<00:04:04.280> it's<00:04:04.669> removing<00:04:05.299> one<00:04:05.799> from

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
it's doing is it's removing one from

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.589 
it's doing is it's removing one from
medium<00:04:08.060> clonk<00:04:08.359> score<00:04:09.160> then<00:04:10.160> over<00:04:10.400> here<00:04:10.599> this

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
medium clonk score then over here this

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.099 
medium clonk score then over here this
is<00:04:11.870> a<00:04:12.290> scorable<00:04:12.859> whose<00:04:13.160> player<00:04:14.000> set<00:04:14.450> medium

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
is a scorable whose player set medium

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:17.080 
is a scorable whose player set medium
clock<00:04:15.349> whose<00:04:15.560> score<00:04:15.889> come<00:04:16.430> on<00:04:16.489> speed<00:04:16.789> equals

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
clock whose score come on speed equals

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.740 
clock whose score come on speed equals
zero<00:04:17.299> clock<00:04:17.630> speed<00:04:17.989> 5<00:04:18.289> so<00:04:18.620> basically<00:04:19.010> if

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
zero clock speed 5 so basically if

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.040 
zero clock speed 5 so basically if
medium<00:04:20.750> clock<00:04:21.019> has<00:04:21.590> a<00:04:21.620> score<00:04:22.130> of<00:04:22.160> 0<00:04:22.720> set<00:04:23.720> the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
medium clock has a score of 0 set the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.520 
medium clock has a score of 0 set the
clock<00:04:24.410> speed<00:04:24.770> to<00:04:25.430> 5<00:04:25.849> so<00:04:26.840> this<00:04:27.139> kind<00:04:27.410> of<00:04:27.470> just

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
clock speed to 5 so this kind of just

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.000 
clock speed to 5 so this kind of just
loops<00:04:27.830> around<00:04:28.099> 5<00:04:29.000> 4<00:04:29.180> 3<00:04:29.270> 2<00:04:29.479> 1<00:04:29.690> set<00:04:29.900> to<00:04:29.990> 5<00:04:30.169> 5<00:04:30.530> 4<00:04:30.740> 3<00:04:30.800> 2

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010

when this one sets the score to five
does<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.200> make<00:04:57.320> any<00:04:57.440> sense<00:04:57.530> so<00:04:57.950> it's<00:04:58.270> five

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
does that make any sense so it's five

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.390 
does that make any sense so it's five

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.720 
and you can do that before
whatever<00:05:09.790> amount<00:05:10.790> of<00:05:12.250> command<00:05:13.250> blocks<00:05:13.490> that

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
whatever amount of command blocks that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:17.680 
whatever amount of command blocks that
it<00:05:14.390> is<00:05:14.480> possible<00:05:14.960> so<00:05:15.950> yeah<00:05:16.240> you<00:05:17.240> can<00:05:17.330> just<00:05:17.540> set

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
it is possible so yeah you can just set

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.060 
it is possible so yeah you can just set
a<00:05:17.720> long<00:05:17.960> chain<00:05:18.260> and<00:05:18.290> do<00:05:18.500> whatever<00:05:18.680> you<00:05:18.860> want

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
a long chain and do whatever you want

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.740 
a long chain and do whatever you want
from<00:05:19.190> there<00:05:19.370> on<00:05:19.520> so<00:05:20.090> these<00:05:20.300> ones<00:05:20.510> are<00:05:20.720> all

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
from there on so these ones are all

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.020 
from there on so these ones are all
pretty<00:05:21.080> similar<00:05:21.200> it's<00:05:22.190> removing<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.790> clock

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
pretty similar it's removing the clock

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.230 
pretty similar it's removing the clock
speed<00:05:23.360> from<00:05:23.750> slow<00:05:24.380> clock<00:05:24.650> but<00:05:25.610> it's<00:05:25.850> setting

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
speed from slow clock but it's setting

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.830 
speed from slow clock but it's setting
his<00:05:26.390> speed<00:05:26.690> to<00:05:26.930> ten<00:05:27.280> so<00:05:28.280> that's<00:05:28.790> 10<00:05:29.480> ticks

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
his speed to ten so that's 10 ticks

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.280 
his speed to ten so that's 10 ticks
rather<00:05:30.440> than<00:05:30.830> five<00:05:31.480> and<00:05:32.480> stand<00:05:32.780> here<00:05:32.870> and<00:05:33.080> see

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
rather than five and stand here and see

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:38.590 
rather than five and stand here and see
that<00:05:34.960> so<00:05:35.960> it<00:05:36.200> gets<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.530> zero<00:05:36.920> a<00:05:37.130> lot<00:05:37.520> slower<00:05:38.180> and

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:38.600 
that so it gets to zero a lot slower and

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.710 
that so it gets to zero a lot slower and
then<00:05:39.440> again<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:40.280> adds<00:05:40.550> one<00:05:41.150> to<00:05:41.300> the<00:05:41.420> score

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
then again this adds one to the score

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.380 
then again this adds one to the score
and<00:05:42.110> you<00:05:42.350> can<00:05:42.500> just<00:05:42.680> continue<00:05:43.490> this<00:05:43.970> and<00:05:44.240> do

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
and you can just continue this and do

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.540 
and you can just continue this and do
absolutely<00:05:44.900> anything<00:05:45.560> you<00:05:45.860> want<00:05:46.160> from<00:05:46.340> there

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
absolutely anything you want from there

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.240 
absolutely anything you want from there
on<00:05:47.050> you<00:05:48.050> don't<00:05:48.200> even<00:05:48.290> need<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.560> scoreboard<00:05:48.920> I'm

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.250 
on you don't even need a scoreboard I'm

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.130 
on you don't even need a scoreboard I'm
just<00:05:49.460> showing<00:05:49.700> this<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:50.030> to<00:05:50.360> kind<00:05:50.630> of<00:05:50.720> give<00:05:51.050> an

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:51.140 
just showing this to to kind of give an

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.810 
just showing this to to kind of give an
example<00:05:51.470> of<00:05:51.680> what<00:05:51.860> it<00:05:51.950> can<00:05:52.040> do<00:05:52.190> this<00:05:52.460> can<00:05:52.670> be

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
example of what it can do this can be

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.870 
example of what it can do this can be
powering<00:05:53.240> anything<00:05:53.990> so<00:05:54.860> let's<00:05:55.100> say<00:05:55.310> every

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
powering anything so let's say every

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.600 
powering anything so let's say every
three<00:05:56.870> seconds<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.590> a<00:05:57.620> player<00:05:57.920> is<00:05:58.220> in<00:05:58.400> this

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
three seconds that a player is in this

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.960 
three seconds that a player is in this
room<00:05:58.880> some<00:05:59.720> in<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.930> zombie<00:06:00.370> so<00:06:01.370> this<00:06:01.580> is<00:06:01.760> what

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
room some in a zombie so this is what

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.280 
room some in a zombie so this is what
you<00:06:02.090> would<00:06:02.270> do<00:06:02.480> where<00:06:02.840> you<00:06:02.960> would<00:06:03.080> put<00:06:03.230> the

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
you would do where you would put the

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.150 
you would do where you would put the
summon<00:06:03.830> zombie<00:06:04.190> kind<00:06:04.430> of<00:06:04.520> thing<00:06:05.920> now<00:06:06.920> we<00:06:06.980> have

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
summon zombie kind of thing now we have

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.400 
summon zombie kind of thing now we have
a<00:06:07.190> really<00:06:07.460> slow<00:06:07.850> clock<00:06:08.180> so<00:06:08.480> exactly<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.200> same

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
a really slow clock so exactly the same

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.110 
a really slow clock so exactly the same
thing<00:06:09.650> but<00:06:09.770> I<00:06:09.830> have<00:06:10.010> this<00:06:10.130> box<00:06:10.400> speed<00:06:10.730> set<00:06:11.030> to

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
thing but I have this box speed set to

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.250 
thing but I have this box speed set to
25<00:06:11.600> so<00:06:11.900> 25<00:06:11.930> ticks<00:06:12.680> later<00:06:12.860> this<00:06:13.730> and<00:06:14.000> any<00:06:14.420> chain

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
25 so 25 ticks later this and any chain

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.629 
25 so 25 ticks later this and any chain
block<00:06:15.500> after<00:06:15.920> it<00:06:16.460> will<00:06:17.300> be<00:06:17.390> powered

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 
block after it will be powered

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.409 
block after it will be powered
and<00:06:19.419> you<00:06:20.139> can<00:06:20.289> see<00:06:20.560> this<00:06:21.129> scourge<00:06:21.550> steps<00:06:21.849> to<00:06:21.969> 25

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
and you can see this scourge steps to 25

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.800 
and you can see this scourge steps to 25
gets<00:06:22.780> really<00:06:23.439> slow<00:06:23.889> to<00:06:24.490> go<00:06:24.639> to<00:06:24.699> zero<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.629> like

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
gets really slow to go to zero and like

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.959 
gets really slow to go to zero and like
I<00:06:25.990> said<00:06:26.259> you<00:06:26.409> can<00:06:26.560> extend<00:06:26.889> this<00:06:27.069> number<00:06:27.460> to

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
I said you can extend this number to

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:31.950 
I said you can extend this number to
absolutely<00:06:28.599> anything<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:29.740> want<00:06:30.270> 250<00:06:31.270> I'm

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
absolutely anything you want 250 I'm

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.570 
absolutely anything you want 250 I'm
sure<00:06:32.199> -<00:06:32.349> why<00:06:32.439> not<00:06:32.620> that's<00:06:32.830> gonna<00:06:33.039> take<00:06:33.370> a

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
sure - why not that's gonna take a

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.179 
sure - why not that's gonna take a
really<00:06:34.090> long<00:06:34.120> time<00:06:34.599> to<00:06:34.780> reach<00:06:34.960> zero<00:06:35.409> and

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:36.189 
really long time to reach zero and

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:44.679 
really long time to reach zero and
that's<00:06:36.340> gonna<00:06:36.490> be<00:06:36.669> a<00:06:36.699> really<00:06:37.289> slow<00:06:38.289> clock

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:44.689 

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.820 

yeah<00:06:45.259> that's<00:06:45.739> pretty<00:06:45.919> slow<00:06:46.279> but<00:06:47.439> if<00:06:48.439> that's

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
yeah that's pretty slow but if that's

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.979 
yeah that's pretty slow but if that's
what<00:06:49.039> you<00:06:49.129> want<00:06:49.459> then<00:06:50.209> that's<00:06:50.239> what<00:06:50.719> you<00:06:50.809> can

one<00:07:09.369> okay<00:07:10.369> so<00:07:10.669> what<00:07:10.999> we<00:07:11.119> actually<00:07:11.269> need<00:07:11.659> is

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:11.689 
one okay so what we actually need is

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:15.069 
one okay so what we actually need is
called<00:07:12.019> an<00:07:12.139> xor<00:07:12.559> gate<00:07:13.179> I've<00:07:14.179> actually<00:07:14.539> only

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:15.079 
called an xor gate I've actually only

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:17.229 
called an xor gate I've actually only
used<00:07:15.559> this<00:07:15.739> once<00:07:15.979> before<00:07:16.129> and<00:07:16.639> I<00:07:16.969> totally

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:17.239 
used this once before and I totally

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:22.059 
used this once before and I totally
forgot<00:07:17.689> about<00:07:17.749> it<00:07:18.019> until<00:07:18.439> now<00:07:20.199> but<00:07:21.199> basically
