00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.250 
I don't wait
video<00:01:44.490> games<00:01:44.730> myself<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.870> would<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> to

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
video games myself so I would have to

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.480 
video games myself so I would have to
leave<00:01:46.380> that<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> Masters<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
leave that up to the Masters of the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.860 
leave that up to the Masters of the
video<00:01:47.700> game<00:01:47.880> universe<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.510> I<00:01:48.570> would<00:01:48.690> love

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
video game universe but I would love

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.990 
video game universe but I would love
some<00:01:49.230> sort<00:01:49.530> that<00:01:49.620> would<00:01:49.920> combine<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:51.900> a<00:01:51.930> good

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
some sort that would combine like a good

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.030 
some sort that would combine like a good
first-person<00:01:54.000> shooter<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.450> guess<00:01:54.830> maybe<00:01:55.830> it's

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
first-person shooter I guess maybe it's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.440 
first-person shooter I guess maybe it's
maybe<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.400> Teen<00:01:56.700> Wolf<00:01:56.820> game<00:01:57.090> should<00:01:57.330> be<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
maybe the Teen Wolf game should be a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.120 
maybe the Teen Wolf game should be a
hunter<00:01:57.780> game<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.440> you're<00:01:58.620> armed<00:01:58.950> with

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
hunter game and you're armed with

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.970 
hunter game and you're armed with
crossbows<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.700> flash<00:02:00.270> bolts<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.200> you're

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
crossbows and flash bolts and and you're

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.970 
crossbows and flash bolts and and you're
after<00:02:02.160> some<00:02:02.790> evil<00:02:03.120> werewolves<00:02:03.710> have<00:02:04.710> talked

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
after some evil werewolves have talked

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.740 
after some evil werewolves have talked
about<00:02:05.190> it<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.640> potential<00:02:06.150> in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.300> future

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
about it so it's potential in the future

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.680 
about it so it's potential in the future
well<00:02:07.080> we<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.399> something<00:02:08.759> being<00:02:08.970> being

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
well we there was something being being

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.410 
well we there was something being being
done<00:02:09.990> recently<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.890> think<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:11.880> launch<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.300> it

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
done recently I think the launch of it

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.970 
done recently I think the launch of it
had<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.810> delayed<00:02:13.110> due<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> amount<00:02:13.920> of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
had to be delayed due to the amount of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.590 
had to be delayed due to the amount of
graphics<00:02:14.520> but<00:02:14.760> they<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.240> definitely

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
graphics but they are definitely

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.080 
graphics but they are definitely
planning<00:02:15.720> something
