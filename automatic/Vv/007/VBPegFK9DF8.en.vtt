00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 I have interest 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.740
 positive announcements I am a nurse 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.139
 Ad gr 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.810
 in a second time after the 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:22.130
 medical consultation on 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.960
 proposal from the oncologist and I get 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.599
 after the patients in a dedicated place 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.900
 with an appointment as dedicated acronym 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.900
 wish 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.650
 so 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.690
 hold dance 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.250
 we first place the frame I 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.200
 actually explains why I 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.440
 I can meet the patient 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.829
 accompanied or not his wife or 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.339
 family members 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.339
 I in the frame definition I their 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.899
 explain why I receive them at this 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.000
 moment that is to say that it is first of all a 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.649
 interview to put a little bit of 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.960
 things 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.489
 resume with treatment and 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.270
 side effects of treatment on 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.909
 everything and then make assessments of 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.680
 their needs and according to these 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.750
 assessments I direct them towards 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.360
 support care professionals and 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.090
 it's mostly an interview and I insist 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.759
 always on it is an interview or in 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.440
 private blows you are really rest 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.440
 things flat together 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.950
 the follow up interview is a little bit 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.719
 different from the ad interview 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.159
 that is, we are asked for either 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.900
 by the patient actually directly 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.870
 for a problem related to his treatment or 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.310
 that you need to be oriented towards 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.350
 support care professionals 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.650
 an appointment that did not take place 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.300
 for example at the beginning at the announcement and at this 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.370
 moment I orientate them according to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.020
 needs towards these professionals that this 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.610
 is the social worker the 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.900
 dietitian where psychologists if a 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.900
 need at that moment 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 these lists are a support we approach 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.380
 different areas so at the level of 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.630
 the social aspect if there are for example 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.400
 problems of social security or if 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.280
 there are problems at the professional level 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.640
 or apart for report to the judgment of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.800
 job 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.209
 at that moment actually we orient 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.709
 will have the past towards the assistant 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.430
 social 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.880
 if we detect a fragility or a 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.620
 distress at the psychological level to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.750
 through the different tools that we 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.810
 have on the establishment at that time 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.459
 we will refer to the same psychologists 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.930
 thing compared to the pain we 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.000
 also have rating scales 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.410
 to guide patients to 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.660
 doctors specialized in taking 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.770
 burden of pain 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.630
 we also have compared to the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.860
 dietician 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.420
 if there are effects like with 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.720
 treatments there are side effects 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.860
 with a gain or loss of weight that 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 this is in relation to the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.519
 chemotherapy hormone therapy at this 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 moment there is actually directed towards 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.989
 the dietitian 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.239
 if there are indeed problems related 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.340
 to nails or a related hair loss 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.519
 at the chemotherapy at that moment one in 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.410
 orient through the socio-beautician 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.209
 this is it through these criteria 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.209
 that when one orients patients
