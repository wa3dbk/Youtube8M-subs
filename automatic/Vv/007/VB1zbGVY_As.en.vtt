00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.690
 The materials that we are going to use are 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.560
 include for fabric 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.560
 scissors 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.029
 a tape measure 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.680
 needle and thread 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.200
 a roll toilet paper 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:45.269
 and this this arito that is for 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.570
 towels and stuff so I'm going to use this 

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.570
 size 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.750
 I will also use 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.699
 and lace and lace of the color that you 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.699
 like 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.059
 I'm going to use thick ribbon 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.059
 like this 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.970
 and I'm going to use filters this filter what 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.680
 I had already been there and this is the one I'm going to 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.680
 use and I'll start 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.460
 first what I will do is match and I 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.300
 felt because as I tell you I had it 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.480
 out there then I'm going to match what 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:33.480
 I'm going to take measures you can leave 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.090
 alone or are they a certain measure go but 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.740
 I also have to see how much I'm going to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.200
 cut because this one 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.560
 for that I want the roll of paper for 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.920
 to be able to take action I want it 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.870
 is is this section as well 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.320
 this 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.540
 and more or less I will calculate to where 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.220
 I want it and from there I will take my measurement 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.220
 to be able to cut the excess 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.619
 i 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.300
 and well cut it already 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.400
 and then I already paired it and here is a 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.600
 a little narrower but it does not matter 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.900
 because I'm not going to anyway I'm going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.400
 to do something like that I'm going to cut 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.310
 sides so that it is md and can bend it 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.400
 and sew it and I can have it and 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.780
 something where I'm going to hang it obviously 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:55.020
 then I will try to trace something and 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.020
 something similar or similar that looks even 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.480
 and why to try not to leave 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.900
 hollow no more 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.040
 big or small or whatever then what 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.040
 I'm going to fold it in half 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.819
 and I already do one and if I do not get Swedish or 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.819
 nothing 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.460
 and it's ready I know where to cut something 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 A) Yes 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.550
 and well the next thing I'm going to do is 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.010
 put the lace 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.920
 I do not know whether to start it from here or 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.620
 start everything here I think it's going to 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.620
 see more beautiful from here I'm going to start 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:52.640
 I'm going to give you some stitches today I'm going to 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.050
 pick it up and I'm going to start sticking it and 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.050
 when I finish back 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.970
 and we do 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.940
 but seven millennia 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.750
 yes 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.750
 it's your life 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.430
 a handsome but not us 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.320
 I've finished putting the lace on everything 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.320
 around 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.199
 with small stitches so you do not 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:13.130
 see both because I put it on 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:16.100
 over it looks - so if there was 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:19.300
 put down below I mean I put it 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.340
 I would have put it like that so it looks more 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.510
 so I put it like that to give more 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.010
 nice view to the lace and apart so that 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.419
 do not see stitches so much because 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:37.580
 As they are by hand they look more noticeable more 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:40.490
 then it is to put this bar 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.650
 here in this part just know it what 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.289
 I'm going to sew on both sides, that is 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.219
 saying I'm going to sew it like that I'm going to do two 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:54.069
 lines like that and then since I have it put 

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:54.069
 I'm going to proceed 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.880
 to bake here to give a few stitches here 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.420
 just so that it stops 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.000
 A) Yes 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:08.800
 and then since you have it ready it is very 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.800
 good girls, I'm done 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:16.880
 I put the ribbon on both sides and I 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:20.660
 he gave a few stitches here because he was going to 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.190
 put on one side but I was very 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.360
 very wide 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.389
 so I hide a little bit the one 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.630
 is wide that does not fit the arito well 

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:34.360
 I already stayed 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:39.130
 As I tell you, this is very small because 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:44.129
 it was the only formality I had so 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:46.469
 I put I 'm going to put only two 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:48.390
 then two rolls of toilet paper 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:51.510
 jumbo 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.080
 then I just stood there because 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.080
 that was it 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:07:00.170
 and well these two girls I have one for 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.150
 here that I wanted to show you that I have 

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:08.810
 like a year with him this is narrower 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.610
 and I did it also in orange only 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:14.740
 what I put 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.740
 a white lace 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:22.449
 and I put a green ribbon 

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:25.810
 and this I will only do it like this back and 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:29.320
 I gave a few stitches and this one reached me for 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:32.500
 three rolls of paper 1 2 3 3 rolls of 

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:36.220
 paper and one of those that I use that 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.380
 those that I have at home and good girls 

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:41.800
 I hope you liked this day 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:44.290
 equal and that it serves them that they put it in 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:46.810
 practice that if they put it into practice I 

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:48.740
 show it and I'll leave some pictures 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:51.830
 how it looked 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.389
 keep subscribing and watching my videos 

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.389
 until the next
