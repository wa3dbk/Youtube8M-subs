00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.750 

I'm<00:03:22.150> going<00:03:22.420> our<00:03:22.540> controller<00:03:22.900> manager<00:03:23.830> here<00:03:24.040> is

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
I'm going our controller manager here is

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.300 
I'm going our controller manager here is
still<00:03:25.000> there<00:03:25.320> look<00:03:26.320> down<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.740> this<00:03:26.860> is<00:03:27.010> what

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
still there look down and this is what

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.790 
still there look down and this is what
the<00:03:27.430> TSI<00:03:27.880> looks<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.270> one<00:03:28.510> generic<00:03:28.840> MIDI<00:03:29.140> one

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
the TSI looks like one generic MIDI one

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.520 
the TSI looks like one generic MIDI one
D<00:03:30.370> NHC<00:03:31.470> 4500<00:03:32.490> so<00:03:33.490> we're<00:03:33.700> going<00:03:33.790> to<00:03:33.880> use<00:03:34.120> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
D NHC 4500 so we're going to use the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.010 
D NHC 4500 so we're going to use the
4500<00:03:35.530> first<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.300> strictly<00:03:37.570> for<00:03:37.750> your

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
4500 first this is strictly for your

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.170 
4500 first this is strictly for your
display<00:03:38.490> so<00:03:39.490> we're<00:03:39.640> going<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.820> go<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.000> the

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
display so we're going to go to the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:45.720 
display so we're going to go to the
first<00:03:40.450> s<00:03:40.660> 1200<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:44.320> see<00:03:44.830> if<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.100> activated

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
first s 1200 and see if that activated

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.920 
first s 1200 and see if that activated
the<00:03:45.940> display<00:03:46.680> nope<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:51.360> got<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.390> go<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.630> the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
the display nope so got to go to the

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.110 
the display nope so got to go to the
second<00:03:53.380> one<00:03:54.750> as<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:55.960> see<00:03:56.080> it's<00:03:56.320> Dec<00:03:56.680> a

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
second one as you can see it's Dec a

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.450 
second one as you can see it's Dec a
right<00:03:58.120> here<00:03:58.860> so<00:03:59.860> once<00:04:00.100> we<00:04:00.190> do<00:04:00.310> it<00:04:00.340> there<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:01.300> go

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
right here so once we do it there we go

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:10.680 
right here so once we do it there we go
the<00:04:03.460> elapsed<00:04:03.730> -<00:04:03.970> showing<00:04:05.280> great<00:04:09.390> so<00:04:10.390> once<00:04:10.540> we

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
the elapsed - showing great so once we

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:16.070 
the elapsed - showing great so once we
get<00:04:10.810> to<00:04:10.990> that<00:04:11.020> point<00:04:11.490> go<00:04:12.490> to<00:04:12.550> edit<00:04:13.350> duplicate

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
get to that point go to edit duplicate

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.780 
get to that point go to edit duplicate
set<00:04:17.080> it<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.410> be<00:04:18.660> and<00:04:20.190> since<00:04:21.190> we<00:04:21.340> know<00:04:21.459> that<00:04:21.489> the

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
set it to be and since we know that the

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.940 
set it to be and since we know that the
second<00:04:22.150> one<00:04:22.270> was<00:04:22.450> decade<00:04:22.870> we<00:04:23.440> know<00:04:23.590> this<00:04:23.770> one

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
second one was decade we know this one

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.800 
second one was decade we know this one
will<00:04:24.100> be<00:04:24.250> Dec<00:04:24.430> based<00:04:24.730> on<00:04:25.000> something<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.480> select

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
will be Dec based on something to select

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.180 
will be Dec based on something to select
the<00:04:25.930> first<00:04:26.230> one<00:04:27.990> yeah<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.710> have<00:04:29.920> it

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.930 

so<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:35.590> generic<00:04:35.920> MIDI<00:04:36.220> is<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.550> actual

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
so the generic MIDI is the actual

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.460 
so the generic MIDI is the actual
controller<00:04:37.360> mapping<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.840> we<00:04:40.960> know<00:04:41.110> that<00:04:41.140> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
controller mapping so we know that the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.930 
controller mapping so we know that the
deck<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.890> was<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.520> second<00:04:42.970> s<00:04:43.540> 1200<00:04:44.670> so<00:04:45.670> click

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
deck a was the second s 1200 so click

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:53.640 
deck a was the second s 1200 so click
there<00:04:48.300> again<00:04:49.300> duplicate<00:04:51.240> click<00:04:52.240> here<00:04:52.480> deck<00:04:53.440> B

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
there again duplicate click here deck B

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.730 
there again duplicate click here deck B
and<00:04:54.780> since<00:04:55.780> we<00:04:55.960> know<00:04:56.050> what<00:04:56.170> BEC<00:04:56.200> B<00:04:56.530> was<00:04:56.710> the

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
and since we know what BEC B was the

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.210 
and since we know what BEC B was the
first<00:04:57.160> s<00:04:57.640> 1200<00:04:58.440> we'll<00:04:59.440> put<00:04:59.620> it<00:04:59.710> on<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.070> and

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
first s 1200 we'll put it on there and

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:10.800 
first s 1200 we'll put it on there and
just<00:05:01.230> go<00:05:03.000> close<00:05:05.100> now<00:05:08.670> I'm<00:05:09.670> able<00:05:09.940> to<00:05:10.240> scroll<00:05:10.570> my

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
just go close now I'm able to scroll my

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.900 
just go close now I'm able to scroll my
tracks

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
tracks

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:24.060 
tracks
right<00:05:15.330> and<00:05:16.330> there<00:05:16.510> comes<00:05:16.810> up

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.350 

all<00:05:24.490> right

all right

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.210 
all right
and<00:05:26.900> then<00:05:27.110> we<00:05:27.289> could<00:05:27.439> do<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.560> same<00:05:27.710> with<00:05:27.919> our

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
and then we could do the same with our

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:39.159 
and then we could do the same with our
second<00:05:32.770> process<00:05:33.770> I<00:05:33.979> load<00:05:34.280> it<00:05:34.310> up<00:05:34.550> there
