00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 as part of the comprehensive program of 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.540
 sanitation of the metropolitan area of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.400
 guadalajara that drives the government of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.320
 the republic was carried out the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.360
 construction of the treatment plant 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400
 of sewage water brown in the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.320
 municipality of zapopan this plant 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.569
 considered until now as the most 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.029
 great of mexico and the second largest 

00:00:21.569 --> 00:00:26.130
 of Latin America will have the capacity to 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.140
 treat up to 8,500 liters per 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.789
 second wastewater which is what 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.070
 it requires to reach 100 per 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.110
 percent in sanitation coverage of the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.820
 metropolitan area of Guadalajara in 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.590
 benefiting more than 3 million

 and the state capital until before 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.710
 the entry into operation of this 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.270
 important work was just little more 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.520
 of 20 percent of the waters 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.400
 municipal waste and liquid without 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.660
 try that was unloaded to the river santiago 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.730
 contributed significantly to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.370
 said affluent was the most polluted 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.260
 of the state with the water plant brown one 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.150
 Much of the municipal wastewater

 that is generated in the metropolitan area 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.940
 from Guadalajara will be taken to the 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:09.490
 plant through the network to reach 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.140
 and collectors of the conurbated area and 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.480
 through physical treatments and 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.970
 biological will be healthy to remove 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.560
 pollutants should be noted that with 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.660
 the biogas that will be produced by the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.220
 treatment process will generate the 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.290
 Most electric power 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.600
 required for the total operation of the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.370
 plant this action will contribute to having 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.560
 a lower incidence of diseases 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.900
 between the population improves the environment

 in addition to giving greater sustainability 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.300
 to the water resource the above in 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.640
 congruence with the new policy of

 treatment plants 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.420
 considering the integral reuse of 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.880
 liquid and enhance its benefits with
