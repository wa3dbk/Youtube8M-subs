take care of it we want to be a part of
this<00:01:50.270> solution<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.710> we<00:01:52.310> firmly<00:01:53.030> believe<00:01:53.270> in

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
this solution so we firmly believe in

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.370 
this solution so we firmly believe in
WCS<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.210> what<00:01:56.509> they're<00:01:56.630> doing<00:01:56.690> out<00:01:57.110> there

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
WCS and in what they're doing out there

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.550 
WCS and in what they're doing out there
and<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.100> answers<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.820> you<00:01:59.600> know<00:01:59.840> the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
and then the answers and you know the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.850 
and then the answers and you know the
waste<00:02:00.770> is<00:02:01.039> all<00:02:01.220> around<00:02:01.430> us<00:02:01.700> it's<00:02:02.270> everywhere

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
waste is all around us it's everywhere
