hi I'm Molly in this video we're going
to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.179> taking<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.540> look<00:00:03.659> at<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.899> ultra-thin

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
to be taking a look at the ultra-thin

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.519 
to be taking a look at the ultra-thin
slide-out<00:00:05.160> keyboard<00:00:05.370> for<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.060> iPhone<00:00:06.509> 5<00:00:06.839> so

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
slide-out keyboard for the iPhone 5 so

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.230 
slide-out keyboard for the iPhone 5 so
basically<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.160> case<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.940> slide-out

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
basically it's a case and a slide-out

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.060 
basically it's a case and a slide-out
bluetooth<00:00:09.780> keyboard<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.410> one<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:10.800> that's<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
bluetooth keyboard in one so that's the

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.009 
bluetooth keyboard in one so that's the
back<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.000> case<00:00:12.240> there's<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> front

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
back of the the case there's the front

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.799 
back of the the case there's the front
so<00:00:13.830> what<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> idea<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.549> if<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.059> flick<00:00:15.299> them<00:00:15.480> up

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
so what the idea is if you flick them up

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.779 
so what the idea is if you flick them up
there's<00:00:16.320> your<00:00:16.590> keyboard<00:00:17.190> scoop<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.580> close

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
there's your keyboard scoop you close

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.490 
there's your keyboard scoop you close
for<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:18.779> you've<00:00:18.900> got<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> full<00:00:19.260> QWERTY

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
for that so you've got a full QWERTY

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.740 
for that so you've got a full QWERTY
keyboard<00:00:20.130> with<00:00:20.369> cursor<00:00:20.670> keys<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.090> few<00:00:21.449> extra

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
keyboard with cursor keys a few extra

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.349 
keyboard with cursor keys a few extra
functions<00:00:22.170> added<00:00:22.470> on<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.880> what<00:00:23.880> I'll<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.210> if

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
functions added on so what I'll do if

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.050 
functions added on so what I'll do if
I'll<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.600> pop<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.900> iPhone<00:00:25.230> 5<00:00:25.560> in<00:00:25.910> give<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
I'll just pop the iPhone 5 in give you a
quick<00:00:27.269> idea<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.630> how<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.869> functions<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> case

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
quick idea of how it functions the case

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.380 
quick idea of how it functions the case
then<00:00:29.070> I'll<00:00:29.189> show<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.519> Bluetooth<00:00:29.910> side<00:00:30.240> of

then I'll show you the Bluetooth side of
it<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.170> keyboard<00:00:31.619> itself<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.669> if<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it and the keyboard itself so if we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.370

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
close it you can see that you've got a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.549 
close it you can see that you've got a
crack<00:00:34.649> for<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> camera<00:00:35.480> does<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> fair

crack for the camera does have a fair
bit<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.800> Bowl<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.309> considering<00:00:38.850> what<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.120> is

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

keyboard<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:39.030> turn<00:01:39.240> off<00:01:39.420> after<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
keyboard up it just turn off after a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.319 
keyboard up it just turn off after a
short<00:01:40.110> time<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.520> stays<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.119> you

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
short time and but it stays on as you

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.819 
short time and but it stays on as you
wear<00:01:42.540> as<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> keep<00:01:42.930> typing<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.680> do

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
wear as you keep typing so you can do

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:44.870 
wear as you keep typing so you can do
that<00:01:44.009> you've<00:01:44.130> got<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> few<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.640> functions

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
that you've got a few of the functions

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.780 
that you've got a few of the functions
you<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:45.930> change<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.439> brightness<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.490> screen

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
you can change the brightness the screen

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
you can change the brightness the screen
if<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.939> hold<00:01:48.149> function<00:01:48.390> push<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.079> change

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
if you hold function push that change

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.630 
if you hold function push that change
your<00:01:50.009> brightness<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.549> screen<00:01:50.880> up<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.149> down

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
your brightness you screen up and down

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.249 
your brightness you screen up and down
closer<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.509> keys<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.110> so

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
closer for the the keys on there so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.450 
closer for the the keys on there so
they've<00:01:55.380> included<00:01:55.409> quite<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> few<00:01:56.159> things

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
they've included quite a few things

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.440 
they've included quite a few things
obviously<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.880> an<00:01:56.939> Enter<00:01:57.180> key

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
obviously got an Enter key

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.749 
obviously got an Enter key
there's<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.860> function<00:01:59.159> here<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.490> if<00:01:59.700> you

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
there's a little function here so if you

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.969 
there's a little function here so if you
push<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.320> proper

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
push that you can get the the proper

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
push that you can get the the proper
pop-up<00:02:02.369> keyboard<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> phone<00:02:03.439> which<00:02:04.439> is

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
pop-up keyboard on the phone which is

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.490 
pop-up keyboard on the phone which is
quite<00:02:04.829> useful<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:06.570> there's<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:07.350> lot<00:02:07.469> of

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
quite useful so there's a lot of

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.410 
quite useful so there's a lot of
functionality<00:02:07.710> added<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> again<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
functionality added with it again you

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.580 
functionality added with it again you
just<00:02:09.569> take<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> little<00:02:10.140> bit<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.319> time<00:02:10.470> of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
just take a little bit of time of

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.990 
just take a little bit of time of
getting<00:02:10.709> used<00:02:11.009> to<00:02:11.099> talking<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.760> you're<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
getting used to talking with it you're a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.390 
getting used to talking with it you're a
little

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
little

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.009 
little
it<00:02:12.519> crammed<00:02:12.790> across<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.239> top<00:02:13.450> road<00:02:13.750> because

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
it crammed across the top road because

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.589 
it crammed across the top road because
of<00:02:14.049> the<00:02:14.170> design<00:02:14.849> but<00:02:15.849> overall<00:02:16.239> does

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
of the design but overall does

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.240 
of the design but overall does
definitely<00:02:16.780> does<00:02:17.709> definitely<00:02:18.040> see<00:02:18.189> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
definitely does definitely see the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.030 
definitely does definitely see the
potential<00:02:18.730> for<00:02:18.970> speeding<00:02:19.480> up<00:02:19.599> typing<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.890> it

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
potential for speeding up typing so it

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.170 
potential for speeding up typing so it
just<00:02:21.189> closed<00:02:21.400> that<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.670> while<00:02:21.849> give<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
just closed that a while give you a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.750 
just closed that a while give you a
quick<00:02:22.420> look<00:02:22.569> around<00:02:22.810> what<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.310> case<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
quick look around what the case and the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.119 
quick look around what the case and the
protection<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.599> offers<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.470> it's<00:02:26.590> quite<00:02:26.769> open

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
protection it offers so it's quite open

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.339 
protection it offers so it's quite open
at<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> top<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.599> lip<00:02:28.810> there<00:02:29.049> doesn't

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
at the top the the lip there doesn't

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.599 
at the top the the lip there doesn't
actually<00:02:29.439> cover<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.890> front<00:02:30.099> of<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> screen

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:30.609 
actually cover the front of the screen

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:31.979 
actually cover the front of the screen
so<00:02:30.879> they're<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.180> protecting<00:02:31.569> the<00:02:31.659> back<00:02:31.840> of

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
so they're you protecting the back of

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.720 
so they're you protecting the back of
the<00:02:32.049> phone<00:02:32.290> you're<00:02:32.890> not<00:02:33.010> really<00:02:33.280> getting<00:02:33.519> any

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
the phone you're not really getting any

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.270 
the phone you're not really getting any
drop<00:02:34.030> protection<00:02:34.569> from<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.989> as<00:02:35.799> I<00:02:35.980> said<00:02:36.159> before

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
drop protection from it as I said before

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.130 
drop protection from it as I said before
it<00:02:36.519> doesn't<00:02:36.640> add<00:02:36.790> too<00:02:37.000> much<00:02:37.209> bulk<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.079> if

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
it doesn't add too much bulk so if

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.119 
it doesn't add too much bulk so if
you're<00:02:38.260> looking<00:02:38.349> for<00:02:38.530> something<00:02:38.769> that<00:02:38.890> can

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
you're looking for something that can

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.309 
you're looking for something that can
speed<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.549> your<00:02:39.760> speed<00:02:40.420> up<00:02:40.540> your<00:02:40.659> typing<00:02:41.140> I

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
speed up your speed up your typing I

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.869 
speed up your speed up your typing I
think<00:02:41.709> once<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.099> used<00:02:42.370> to<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:42.579> you<00:02:42.730> can

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:42.879 
think once you get used to this you can

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.550 
think once you get used to this you can
definitely<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.359> have<00:02:43.810> benefits<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.409> bit

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
definitely have have benefits a bit

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.220 
definitely have have benefits a bit
before<00:02:45.280> Australia<00:02:45.849> the<00:02:46.000> keys<00:02:46.209> down<00:02:46.480> to<00:02:46.900> line

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
before Australia the keys down to line

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.960 
before Australia the keys down to line
up<00:02:47.440> like<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.590> normal<00:02:47.980> QWERTY<00:02:48.340> keyboard<00:02:48.760> that's

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
up like a normal QWERTY keyboard that's

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.580 
up like a normal QWERTY keyboard that's
took<00:02:49.480> me<00:02:49.569> a<00:02:49.599> little<00:02:49.750> bit<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.930> time<00:02:50.079> to<00:02:50.200> get<00:02:50.349> used

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
took me a little bit of time to get used

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.789 
took me a little bit of time to get used
to

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
to

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.710 
to
obviously<00:02:51.549> I'll<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.849> arrange<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.480> that

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
obviously I'll just arrange like that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.990 
obviously I'll just arrange like that
I'm<00:02:53.170> sure<00:02:53.500> after<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.829> few<00:02:54.099> days<00:02:54.310> time<00:02:54.579> with<00:02:54.879> you

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
I'm sure after a few days time with you

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.539 
I'm sure after a few days time with you
will<00:02:55.180> definitely<00:02:55.450> notice<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.989> benefit<00:02:56.549> few

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
will definitely notice the benefit few

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:59.039 
will definitely notice the benefit few
features<00:02:57.909> they<00:02:58.060> point<00:02:58.359> out<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.780> you've<00:02:58.900> got

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
features they point out so you've got

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.839 
features they point out so you've got
the<00:02:59.109> backlight<00:02:59.590> it<00:02:59.950> slides<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.639> nice<00:03:00.819> and

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 
the backlight it slides out nice and

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.690 
the backlight it slides out nice and
easily<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:02.019> the<00:03:02.470> standby<00:03:02.829> time<00:03:03.159> apparently

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
easily and the standby time apparently

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.210 
easily and the standby time apparently
is<00:03:03.849> 45<00:03:04.450> days<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.109> it's<00:03:05.590> got<00:03:05.709> a<00:03:05.769> built<00:03:06.010> in

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
is 45 days on it it's got a built in

battery and you get its lead here so you

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.099 
battery and you get its lead here so you
can<00:03:09.400> just<00:03:09.519> plug<00:03:09.700> into<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.970> USB<00:03:10.060> socket<00:03:10.870> socket

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
can just plug into a USB socket socket

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.679 
can just plug into a USB socket socket
to<00:03:11.409> charge<00:03:11.470> it<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.459> apparently<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:13.120> keys

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
to charge it and apparently the keys

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.990 
to charge it and apparently the keys
lasts<00:03:14.019> up<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.200> five<00:03:14.470> million<00:03:14.769> presses<00:03:15.370> so<00:03:15.939> I

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
lasts up to five million presses so I

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.789 
lasts up to five million presses so I
don't<00:03:16.180> think<00:03:16.359> it's<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:17.199> to<00:03:17.230> wear<00:03:17.379> in<00:03:17.560> your

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
don't think it's going to wear in your

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.009 
don't think it's going to wear in your
lifetime<00:03:18.280> so<00:03:18.639> a<00:03:18.819> lot<00:03:19.419> seems<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:19.780> a<00:03:19.810> really

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
lifetime so a lot seems like a really

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.559 
lifetime so a lot seems like a really
good<00:03:20.230> product<00:03:20.470> not<00:03:20.709> too<00:03:20.889> expensive
