 other players for the best areas 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.640
 producers on the board invade that

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.309

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.750

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.039

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.330
 a brief review of God 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.770
 so let pastor jack talk a little 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.940
 about God that you my a game of 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.820
 sebastian do japan is a french game and the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.250
 name may seem strange because there is 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.500
 money nor gogh is it has been released 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.670
 was a great success in the United States and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.979
 in europe but god is a game where you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.299
 will have to build civilizations 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.850
 in fact not a great civilization 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.979
 a modest civilization 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.690
 It's all you see, it's usually a game. 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.910
 very long a game where you have to 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.150
 build lots of battle strategies 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.510
 much conflict in god has conflict yes 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.370
 but the conflict is but it is only for 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.440
 win the points do not have 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.569
 direct war you can steal a little 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.970
 of money or a victory point of the 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.209
 opponent okay but if you have a good 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.730
 strategy and build your 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.340
 empire with the correct cards with the 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.870
 farms with logging quarries and 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.819
 correct temples 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.489
 You'll be able to score more points. 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.739
 even without having to attack anyone 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.900
 God is very lucky, so involved. 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.030
 is in the purchase of cards if you 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.209
 able to buy the correct cards in the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.799
 correct order you will have more 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.170
 opportunities to build new buildings 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.420
 they will be scores fast 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.920
 resources needed to continue 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.320
 growing your empire 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.989
 but if you also know how to administer 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.450
 very well these letters and know how to do 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.780
 offerings for the right books in the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.810
 time you can dial for 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.209
 always have options on hand to dial 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.329
 points are you have to have a lot of attention 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:23.090
 it's a game so any point can 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.280
 be fundamental in the end then a letter 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.070
 now that you score two more points 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.709
 maybe it will cost me points then it can be 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.709
 six for half a dozen and if you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.620
 let others do more points 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.420
 in your shifts and will also stay for 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.090
 back then you have to manage not 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.120
 only your hand but also keep an eye on 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.950
 resources and money that each has 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.230
 at the table is this is very interesting 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.690
 because it gives enough interaction and sometimes 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.650
 have to change my strategy of 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.090
 construction 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.430
 according to what others 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.410
 pains at the table build on that turn 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.080
 even because the board is limited 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.540
 I can not break into an area where my 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.670
 opponent has already built something I 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.590
 I can even pass like the army over there. 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.650
 of the gateway by him but not 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.140
 I can stop, I can not afford to 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.870
 money from that point and there comes a 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.120
 determined moment in the game in which you 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.940
 have to build more buildings of the 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.760
 some letters of civilization that give 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.889
 points for the size of your city 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.229
 The more you ask, the more you 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.960
 resources and more money but points 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:32.780
 victory in the end you will achieve 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.000
 I found God very interesting. 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.100
 because everyone ignorant is too long 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.139
 tie and if he is very fast and the rules 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.419
 they are easy and intuitive 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.790
 I can learn, I can learn. 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.680
 speed up for more players 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.470
 experienced enough in your likes 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.210
 new players also understood the 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.789
 rules and also enjoy the 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.699
 idea of ​​being able to build an 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.770
 nothing with letters only text is minimal 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:00.160
 and choreography is very large does not depend 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.830
 both of the language 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.770
 God is not so unique in his 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.639
 but he brings two that I like 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.060
 enough 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.700
 one of them is she concerned that you've 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.750
 must have seen in games like catan or 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.639
 agricultural 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.830
 different from the area control was in 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:21.639
 cause you have to make your 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.280
 influence of nothing or you 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:27.440
 conquers an area on the board that you 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.990
 She believes she's actually there. 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.700
 Virgin you are creating right now 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.550
 producing this will produce that and 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.220
 joking she 's in the area control 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.990
 you normally compete for an area already 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.760
 existing on the board 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:44.300
 The fact that you have to build your 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.400
 empire always differently makes 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.310
 that responsibility is nice 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.780
 because one thing is to build or 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.620
 try to always try to 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.870
 same press 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.060
 it is obvious that letters also come 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.650
 in my hand will also edit this 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.280
 region of skill has to adapt a 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.270
 strategy with each match and that is very 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.419
 interesting 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.360
 this then was god if you want 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.219
 watch 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.229
 the complete game I made here a 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.629
 hold playing being divided into three 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:14.580
 only apply here on the screen that you 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:16.949
