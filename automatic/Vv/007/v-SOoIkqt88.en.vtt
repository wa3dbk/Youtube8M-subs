00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.910
 Welcome to Brazil. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.210
 This is a medical project . 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.740
 entertainment that was created to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.350
 gather two passions 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.990
 the first is the passion for taking care of 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.330
 people and the second passion for traveling 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.130
 our idea is to use the rally route 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.019
 of the sertões and stop in some 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.330
 communities to take a moment 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 especially a magical moment for these 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.010
 people 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 We're going to take both the medical part 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.700
 while the entertainment and entertainment 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.260
 also the moment when we learn 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 with the populations 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.879
 the project brings together a team that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.850
 liked adventure always liked off 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.489
 and our proposal will be to take the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.360
 better we have the populations of the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.360
 sertões rally route 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.770
 So what are we going to do is take 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.150
 information is mainly focused on the 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.430
 question of the morality of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.100
 infant mortality , then 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.960
 decontaminate the water that often 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.700
 have no access to water when 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.770
 they have this water is contaminated then 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.670
 How to decontaminate those who kill 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.140
 preventive and seeking action is 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.270
 healing take remedy to heal 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.729
 diseases caused by worms that people 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.930
 knows that it causes a lot of death in children 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.930
 from the backlands of Brazil 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.490
 I'm a physical education teacher and I 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.440
 I 've always been in love with sports and I 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.300
 I believe that sport will contribute 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.250
 much with these populations that people 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.990
 going to visit our idea is to take a 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.150
 material impediment we will go 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.740
 to establish an impediment gang and the 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.500
 children go there learned a modality 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.450
 and has the opportunity to stay with 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.600
 that to them so they do not have a choice 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.729
 an entertainment option 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.229
 throughout the year until our 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.229
 near the beach 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.280
 My name is Alexandre 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.830
 I'm an architect, I'm going to stay. 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.050
 in charge of trying to deploy at 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.940
 least one cistern in each city ​​for 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.700
 where we pass and the external ones 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.220
 are a way of reserving and storing 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.350
 rainwater will bring a lot of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.260
 facility to exhibit that often 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.120
 stays long periods without our water is 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.650
 essential for each day another 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.230
 also proposed from my area of 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.270
 architecture is to take technical knowledge 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.600
 teaching them to use materials that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.489
 they have the clay instead of the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.590
 tree branches and stories all 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.720
 that you have immediately there to download the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.060
 cost of making a home and even 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.209
 so you can make a home with a great 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.209
 quality 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.240
 the mamata flints my mission in the 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.400
 iss brasil is besides taking the heart and 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:56.150
 force to help these communities 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.760
 need to report the entire project in 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.230
 create a journal and bring 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.570
 Back to São Paulo 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 this very rich experience that can 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.000
 serve as an example for many other 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.470
 people 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.650
 We plan to make an exhibition. 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.350
 photograph that portrays reality well 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.989
 that we will meet and also 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.020
 publish a book where people can 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.770
 see about the project nor about the 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.140
 communities visited and to disseminate 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.950
 this social attitude that is very special 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.950
 it's very beautiful 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.300
 besides taking health and not bringing joy 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:38.600
 would not complete care with the person 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.030
 because health is the joy of the body and 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.440
 Soul health joy that will put together a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.750
 cinema we are going to take a cinema 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.480
 itinerant at each stop we will go 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.280
 project a super special film of the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.690
 children to interact with something 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.579
 that they do not normally have the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.510
 opportunity to watch what will be the 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:04:00.320
 great moment of action to our proposal 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.180
 that the entrance to this cinema is in the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.239
 participation in an action of 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.820
 medical information and 300 more 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.459
 the focus that we want to bring joy 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.440
 so it hopes to leave the framework of 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.049
 leave a record in the memory of 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.739
 the entire population that will attend 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.739
 this movie 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:23.430
 makes a collective financing where 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.800
 everybody can help 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.300
 resources it speaks of 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.860
 independent projects support the 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.560
 independent of government support 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.180
 companies is a creative and always 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.160
 that we have to gather people into 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.910
 around a purpose as a form of a 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:43.009
 dream and help us bring health and 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.009
 joy to the sequencing community 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:54.379
 that
