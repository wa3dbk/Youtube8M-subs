you<00:00:09.010> through<00:00:09.540> dividing<00:00:10.540> a<00:00:10.630> softer<00:00:11.110> dough<00:00:11.320> you

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:11.830 
you through dividing a softer dough you

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.509 
you through dividing a softer dough you
know<00:00:11.920> 73%<00:00:12.450> hydration<00:00:13.450> and<00:00:13.660> up<00:00:14.140> up<00:00:14.350> to<00:00:14.710> 80%<00:00:14.980> if

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
know 73% hydration and up up to 80% if

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.700 
know 73% hydration and up up to 80% if
you're<00:00:15.730> working<00:00:15.880> with<00:00:16.000> whole<00:00:16.269> grains<00:00:16.710> 100%

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
you're working with whole grains 100%

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.980 
you're working with whole grains 100%
hydrated<00:00:18.189> so<00:00:19.119> I'm<00:00:19.539> going<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.810> talk<00:00:19.960> you

hydrated so I'm going to talk you
through<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.560> steps<00:00:20.830> after<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.520> bulk

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
through the steps after the bulk

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.400 
through the steps after the bulk
fermentation<00:00:22.360> so<00:00:22.570> when<00:00:22.720> you<00:00:22.810> move<00:00:22.960> into<00:00:23.170> the

be<00:01:04.059> nice<00:01:04.239> and<00:01:04.269> extensible<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:06.150> dough<00:01:07.150> like<00:01:07.360> this

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
be nice and extensible a dough like this

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.110 
be nice and extensible a dough like this
I'm<00:01:08.110> not<00:01:08.680> going<00:01:09.100> to<00:01:09.220> use<00:01:09.430> dusting<00:01:10.000> flour

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
I'm not going to use dusting flour

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.670 
I'm not going to use dusting flour
underneath<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:11.080> I'm<00:01:11.260> going<00:01:11.410> to<00:01:11.470> let<00:01:11.650> that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
underneath so I'm going to let that

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.590 
underneath so I'm going to let that
dough<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:13.150> pour<00:01:13.540> out<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.230> container<00:01:14.710> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.030 

will<00:01:19.600> only<00:01:19.750> use<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:20.020> little<00:01:20.170> bit<00:01:20.560> of<00:01:20.650> dusting

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
will only use a little bit of dusting

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.580 
will only use a little bit of dusting
flour<00:01:21.220> on<00:01:21.550> this<00:01:21.700> top<00:01:21.940> surface<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:26.080> my<00:01:26.230> hand

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
flour on this top surface get my hand

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.540 
flour on this top surface get my hand
coated<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:29.710> bit<00:01:29.830> across<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.310> top<00:01:30.520> of

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
coated a little bit across the top of

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.230 
coated a little bit across the top of
this<00:01:30.850> and<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:32.130> idea<00:01:33.130> is<00:01:33.370> it's<00:01:33.640> we<00:01:33.850> know<00:01:34.060> it's

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
this and the idea is it's we know it's

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.450 
this and the idea is it's we know it's
stuck<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.810> table<00:01:35.050> we're<00:01:35.860> going<00:01:35.980> to<00:01:36.040> cut

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
stuck to the table we're going to cut

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.070 
stuck to the table we're going to cut
this<00:01:37.450> piece<00:01:37.780> of<00:01:37.990> dough<00:01:38.170> from<00:01:38.800> the<00:01:38.860> mass<00:01:40.080> so

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
this piece of dough from the mass so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.900 
this piece of dough from the mass so
we're<00:01:41.200> going<00:01:41.290> to<00:01:41.380> cut<00:01:41.620> that<00:01:41.730> scraping<00:01:42.730> that

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
we're going to cut that scraping that

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.870 
we're going to cut that scraping that
clean<00:01:43.390> on<00:01:43.660> the<00:01:43.750> table<00:01:44.200> so<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.280> severed

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
clean on the table so this is severed

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.899 
clean on the table so this is severed
I<00:01:45.909> can<00:01:46.450> then<00:01:46.540> cut<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.260> little<00:01:48.190> bit<00:01:48.400> of<00:01:48.550> dusting

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
I can then cut a little bit of dusting

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.490 
I can then cut a little bit of dusting
flour<00:01:49.980> set<00:01:50.980> that<00:01:51.220> onto<00:01:51.850> my<00:01:51.970> scale<00:01:52.360> sticky<00:01:53.260> side

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
flour set that onto my scale sticky side

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:01.980 
flour set that onto my scale sticky side
down<00:01:54.330> I'll<00:01:55.330> go<00:01:55.540> for<00:01:55.780> 1.2<00:01:56.380> kilos<00:02:00.420> from<00:02:01.420> there<00:02:01.780> I

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
down I'll go for 1.2 kilos from there I

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.550 
down I'll go for 1.2 kilos from there I
can<00:02:02.409> move<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:03.280> piece<00:02:03.610> of<00:02:03.820> dough<00:02:04.200> back<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.409> my

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
can move that piece of dough back to my

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.210 
can move that piece of dough back to my
table<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.190> divide<00:02:06.729> my<00:02:06.970> next<00:02:07.240> piece<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:09.039> it's

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
table and divide my next piece so it's

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.709 
table and divide my next piece so it's
gathered<00:02:09.759> into<00:02:10.659> a<00:02:10.690> slightly<00:02:11.700> organized<00:02:12.719> mass

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.719 
gathered into a slightly organized mass

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.890 
gathered into a slightly organized mass
and<00:02:14.709> I<00:02:14.829> can<00:02:15.010> come<00:02:15.189> back<00:02:15.370> with<00:02:15.579> my<00:02:15.730> scraper

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and I can come back with my scraper

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.119 
and I can come back with my scraper
for<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.099> pre-shape<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:20.260> I'll<00:02:20.409> divide<00:02:20.620> another

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
for the pre-shape so I'll divide another

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.339 
for the pre-shape so I'll divide another
one<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:21.580> little<00:02:22.269> bit<00:02:22.659> sticks<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.080> your<00:02:23.200> knife

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
one a little bit sticks to your knife

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
hand the dough isn't going to stick to

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.599 
hand the dough isn't going to stick to
the<00:03:02.140> scraper<00:03:02.409> as<00:03:02.590> much<00:03:02.769> our<00:03:03.040> hands<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.519> it

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:03.609 
the scraper as much our hands and it

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.360 
the scraper as much our hands and it
keeps<00:03:03.849> that<00:03:04.060> surface<00:03:04.510> clean<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.739> grab<00:03:06.069> one<00:03:06.340> of

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
keeps that surface clean so grab one of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.330 
keeps that surface clean so grab one of
your<00:03:06.579> masses<00:03:07.030> of<00:03:07.180> dough<00:03:07.500> smooth<00:03:08.500> clean<00:03:09.010> sides

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
your masses of dough smooth clean sides

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.580 
your masses of dough smooth clean sides
still<00:03:09.609> on<00:03:09.790> top<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.450> you're<00:03:11.019> going<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.200> sweep

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
still on top and you're going to sweep

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.740 
still on top and you're going to sweep
around<00:03:11.799> that<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:12.400> pulling<00:03:13.299> that<00:03:13.510> dough

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
around that and pulling that dough

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.500 
around that and pulling that dough
towards<00:03:14.260> yourself<00:03:14.650> I'll<00:03:15.459> show<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:15.879> on<00:03:16.299> that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
towards yourself I'll show you on that

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.569 
towards yourself I'll show you on that
angle<00:03:17.010> by<00:03:18.010> pushing<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.819> dough<00:03:19.060> away<00:03:19.209> from<00:03:19.690> me

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
angle by pushing that dough away from me

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.390 
angle by pushing that dough away from me
so<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.730> oval<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.239> one<00:03:22.450> direction<00:03:23.040> from<00:03:24.040> there

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
so it's oval in one direction from there

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.610 
so it's oval in one direction from there
I<00:03:24.639> can<00:03:25.209> rotate<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:26.049> then<00:03:26.889> push<00:03:27.340> again<00:03:28.530> so<00:03:29.530> I'm

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
I can rotate and then push again so I'm

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.409 
I can rotate and then push again so I'm
generating<00:03:30.010> tension<00:03:30.549> it's<00:03:30.700> slowly<00:03:31.090> coming

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
generating tension it's slowly coming

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.460 
generating tension it's slowly coming
around<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:34.150> I'm<00:03:34.269> pushing<00:03:34.720> away<00:03:35.139> from<00:03:35.290> myself

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
around so I'm pushing away from myself

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.000 
around so I'm pushing away from myself
rotating<00:03:39.150> resetting<00:03:40.590> pushing<00:03:41.590> into<00:03:41.859> that

rotating resetting pushing into that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.650 
rotating resetting pushing into that
dough<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:43.209> it's<00:03:43.329> slowly<00:03:43.720> rounding<00:03:44.470> up<00:03:44.650> for<00:03:44.919> me

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
dough and it's slowly rounding up for me

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.069

pull rotate pull until that stands up
you<00:03:50.290> don't<00:03:50.500> want<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.680> go<00:03:50.769> too<00:03:50.829> far<00:03:51.220> once<00:03:51.609> you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you don't want to go too far once you

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.289 
you don't want to go too far once you
break<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.359> thin<00:03:53.129> gluten<00:03:54.129> membrane<00:03:54.579> this

break this thin gluten membrane this

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.059 
break this thin gluten membrane this
dough<00:03:55.540> would<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.870> kind<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.109> start<00:03:56.440> getting

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
dough would just kind of start getting

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.409 
dough would just kind of start getting
more<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:57.849> losing<00:03:58.660> more<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:58.870> more<00:03:59.139> volume<00:03:59.590> so

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
more and losing more and more volume so
