00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
see until you get the heart to jiggle

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600 
see until you get the heart to jiggle
like<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.450> sometimes<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.619> takes<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.920> while<00:01:34.950> but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
determines whether or not the heart is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.140 
determines whether or not the heart is
attached<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.470> not<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.759> for<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:41.909> you're

we're not gonna use this room again and
if<00:02:01.829> your<00:02:02.130> heart<00:02:02.280> it<00:02:02.610> hurt<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.020> around

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
if your heart it hurt you to be around

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.160 
if your heart it hurt you to be around
the<00:02:04.200> middle<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.560> heart<00:02:04.829> needs<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.280> kind<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
the middle it heart needs to be kind of

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.440 
the middle it heart needs to be kind of
facing<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> right<00:02:07.469> way<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.740> guess<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.580> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
facing the right way I guess and this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.720 
facing the right way I guess and this
would<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.690> gone<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.869> lot<00:02:10.050> quicker<00:02:10.289> had<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:10.730> done

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
would have gone a lot quicker had I done

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.230 
would have gone a lot quicker had I done
that<00:02:11.970> correctly

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
that correctly

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.700 
that correctly
but<00:02:14.070> well<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.280> isn't<00:02:15.640> good<00:02:16.380> well<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.410> guess

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
but well this isn't good well I guess

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.160 
but well this isn't good well I guess
this<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:18.070> a<00:02:18.100> way<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.400> get<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.820> right<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:20.050> I'm

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
this is a way to get it right and I'm

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.540 
this is a way to get it right and I'm
just<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.500> push<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.920> heart<00:02:21.070> around<00:02:21.280> I

at<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.630> beginning<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:32.850> it<00:03:33.850> causes<00:03:34.150> him<00:03:34.510> to

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
at the beginning and it causes him to

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.020 
at the beginning and it causes him to
not<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.320> doesn't<00:03:35.650> cause<00:03:35.800> him<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.100> lose<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.910> whole

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
not it doesn't cause him to lose a whole

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.480 
not it doesn't cause him to lose a whole
lot<00:03:37.240> of<00:03:37.270> blood<00:03:37.770> which<00:03:38.770> is<00:03:38.920> also<00:03:39.250> great<00:03:39.520> because

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
lot of blood which is also great because

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.370 
lot of blood which is also great because
before<00:03:42.490> I<00:03:42.820> was<00:03:43.030> always<00:03:43.390> dying<00:03:43.840> before<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.260> could

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
before I was always dying before I could

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.740 
before I was always dying before I could
get<00:03:44.440> the<00:03:44.560> heart<00:03:44.740> in<00:03:44.890> there<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:46.000> was<00:03:46.150> he<00:03:46.600> was

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
get the heart in there and it was he was

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.290 
get the heart in there and it was he was
bleeding<00:03:47.170> out<00:03:47.440> in<00:03:47.620> like<00:03:49.260> three<00:03:50.260> minutes<00:03:50.440> maybe

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
bleeding out in like three minutes maybe

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.790 
bleeding out in like three minutes maybe
because<00:03:52.300> I<00:03:52.330> was<00:03:52.660> using<00:03:52.810> like<00:03:52.990> buzz<00:03:53.350> saws<00:03:53.590> and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
because I was using like buzz saws and

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.320 
because I was using like buzz saws and
stuff<00:03:53.830> and<00:03:54.190> I<00:03:54.250> was<00:03:54.370> cutting<00:03:54.820> him<00:03:54.910> up<00:03:54.970> too<00:03:55.150> much

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
stuff and I was cutting him up too much

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.480 
stuff and I was cutting him up too much
so<00:03:55.630> he'd<00:03:55.810> be<00:03:55.960> start<00:03:56.290> to<00:03:56.830> just<00:03:57.040> start<00:03:57.280> losing

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
so he'd be start to just start losing

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.810 
so he'd be start to just start losing
blood<00:03:58.000> right<00:03:58.450> away<00:03:58.710> with<00:03:59.710> the<00:03:59.860> hammer<00:04:00.130> since

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
blood right away with the hammer since

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.190 
blood right away with the hammer since
it's<00:04:01.120> probably<00:04:01.300> because<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:01.960> blunt

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
it's probably because it's a blunt

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.590 
it's probably because it's a blunt
object<00:04:02.400> well<00:04:03.400> look<00:04:03.610> at<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.910> blood<00:04:04.360> level

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
object well look at the blood level

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.000 
object well look at the blood level
right<00:04:04.750> now<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.170> you<00:04:05.290> go<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.560> see<00:04:05.800> it's

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
right now and you go and see it's

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.210 
right now and you go and see it's
dropping<00:04:06.370> pretty<00:04:07.090> slowly<00:04:07.680> compared<00:04:08.680> to<00:04:08.950> if

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
dropping pretty slowly compared to if

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.520 
dropping pretty slowly compared to if
you<00:04:09.430> were<00:04:09.520> to<00:04:09.640> use<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:10.090> saw<00:04:10.360> which<00:04:10.959> was<00:04:11.200> at

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
first my weapon of choice and I

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.510 
first my weapon of choice and I
shouldn't<00:04:14.350> call<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:14.620> weapon<00:04:15.040> I<00:04:15.220> should<00:04:15.370> say

out<00:04:42.520> of<00:04:42.580> there<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.650> make<00:04:44.830> sure<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.310> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
out of there just to make sure that the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.809 
out of there just to make sure that the
heart<00:04:45.699> has<00:04:46.180> a<00:04:46.210> place<00:04:46.629> to<00:04:46.810> go<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.639> one<00:04:48.639> went

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
heart has a place to go that one went

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:52.800 
heart has a place to go that one went
flying<00:04:49.150> Jesus<00:04:49.599> and<00:04:49.860> then<00:04:51.389> I'm<00:04:52.389> gonna<00:04:52.569> try<00:04:52.780> to

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
flying Jesus and then I'm gonna try to

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.790 
flying Jesus and then I'm gonna try to
set<00:04:53.740> this<00:04:53.889> in<00:04:54.039> there<00:04:54.190> nicely<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:55.210> bam<00:04:56.050> one

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
set this in there nicely and bam one

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.460 
set this in there nicely and bam one
minute<00:04:57.069> 32<00:04:57.310> seconds<00:04:57.729> that<00:04:58.539> is<00:04:58.780> probably<00:04:59.319> the

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
minute 32 seconds that is probably the

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.700 
minute 32 seconds that is probably the
fastest<00:04:59.860> I<00:04:59.979> have<00:05:00.099> done<00:05:00.280> it<00:05:00.370> yet<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.810> if<00:05:02.440> you're

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
fastest I have done it yet so if you're

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.370
