00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 with the galaxy s 6 have the colleagues 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.250
 by samsung already at the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.020
 Imagination did it all right 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.809
 is called a high-quality smartphone 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.090
 Focus on camera quality and great 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.460
 performance in everyday life and with the galaxy 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:21.570
 s 6 force the competition even up 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:23.279
 At the rounded rat that's six 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.470
 edge is only slightly different 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.699
 from s 6 the display is rounded and 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.380
 thereby minimally larger 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.359
 the battery is 50 billion hours 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 the smartphone itself is minimal 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.110
 thicker with 142 1 x 70 mm for that too 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.879
 slightly more compact and six grams lighter 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.219
 the sims there is on the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.290
 top and the price is easily 100 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.340
 and 50 euro apart before you 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.450
 however, for one of the two devices 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 you should definitely decide 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.590
 Both devices also in the times 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.230
 had had hands because the design 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.829
 straight at galaxy s 6 is not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.050
 everybody's thing 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.699
 the most noticeable feature of ms access is 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 the display on the left and the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.629
 the glass is bent on the right side 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.010
 or rounded thereby acts 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.930
 The picture is bigger than it is 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.570
 Special functions like the contacts 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.250
 rss feeds the weather and even the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.659
 time can be displayed on the edge 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.740
 will be without the complete display 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.689
 to start 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.460
 that saves electricity and it still looks 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.680
 damn cool from so far there is only 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 a handful of supported chips too 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.610
 The Samsung App Store does not offer a great deal 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.170
 alternation and the twitter bar shows 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 only the trending topics 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.080
 for a real value of this 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.860
 So it still needs a function 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.930
 a bit more 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.840
 so far, it's just a pretty bauble 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.119
 both smartphones have 1 5 1 2 quad hd 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 s amoled display with a resolution of 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.060
 Get 2560 x 1440 pixels donated 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.700
 to three gb faster ddr4 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 RAM is a 64 bit of core 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.030
 processor from samsung and 1 2550 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.220
 milliamps or 2600 milliamp hours 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.329
 mah battery to a 16 megapixel 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.399
 main camera with optical 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.439
 Image stabilizer and a 5 megapixel 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.930
 front camera both with a bright 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.390
 f 19 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.710
 especially the processor and internal 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.370
 memory must be highlighted here 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.490
 become 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.950
 the exodus 74 20 was awarded a 14 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.720
 nanometer production technology made that 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.890
 result is a better performance at 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.360
 less power consumption 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.010
 the 32 64 or 128 GB internal memory 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.100
 are not expandable 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.290
 thanks to us 2.0 construction but on the level 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.300
 a ssd the complete system 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.070
 benefits from the fast reading and 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.250
 Write speed if 4k videos 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:30.440
 photos in 0.7 seconds or the liquid 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.900
 surface everything runs buttery softly 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.130
 but here too the subject matter is exceptional 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.870
 confirm the rule 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 because despite all the services and 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.200
 stripped foliage comes and goes 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.330
 again and again to the performance 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.950
 whether it is the system itself or not 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.150
 or badly programmed apps 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.480
 is we can not spontaneously 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.730
 It samsung reproduce the ssv 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.830
 Even a smart manager has his own app 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.750
 store a file manager and various 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.780
 smaller apps like calculator memo 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.000
 dictaphone and a mushroom smart remote 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.739
 app for the remote control function of the 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.019
 on this important system epss can 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.209
 Almost everything can be granted to help both 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.560
 device-shoot very good photos even in 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.400
 days or difficult 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.620
 light conditions 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.510
 The optical image stabilizer ensures 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.920
 a smooth shot the camera 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.900
 starts on request in under one 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.430
 Seconds very fast and focused 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.350
 offers with the function becomes school 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.610
 even scotch the possibility 3d 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.040
 object to scan 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.110
 in per mode can iso focus and 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.940
 White balance adjusted manually 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.380
 Aperture and shadow unfortunately remain outside 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.600
 in front of a better camera 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.459
 interface may even be available in the future 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.540
 be able to save raw files 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.580
 with so many multimedia features 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.080
 you ask yourself to hold the phone 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.820
 in the beginning at the beginning of the battery 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.170
 rather mediocre after a few updates 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.610
 samsung is the term but 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.739
 much better 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.810
 First we arrived at about 29 hours 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.540
 Stand-by on three levels screen 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.579
 use just under an hour to use the phone 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.140
 that gets more here with just under five 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.120
 hours of video usage is the battery 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.920
 within 18 hours all and if 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.810
 that's not enough that it's six 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.069
 ley thanks to quick charge technology in 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.099
 one and a half hours 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:03.560
 0 to 100 and can also be wireless 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:06.290
 be charged wirelessly next to wireless 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.739
 the connectivity features like lte k6 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.540
 and wlan ac is in galaxy s 6 and dms 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.459
 hexagon also a new fingerprint 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.079
 Sensor installed by the one finger 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.609
 just hang up that needs 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.769
 also works accurately in seven of 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.930
 try ten and is almost up 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.940
 Eye level with touch from apple what leaves 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.030
 to say that it is six effective 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.039
 is a successful evolution of the f6 more 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.750
 as just a design study 

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.910
 you could actually say it's one 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.310
 kind of little innovation as well 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.770
 transparent displays or foldable 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.630
 wait because actually the topic is 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.150
 chases an old technological idea 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.970
 Finally his samsung for the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 the end user has become tangible 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.060
 But question is not if you have this 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.580
 display needs or not but whether 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.740
 you willingly 150 euros for more 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.900
 pay was against the galaxy s 6 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.300
 Overall, display processing and 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.699
 performance so the whole package on 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.449
 of the highest level and it 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.650
 probably already in the video 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.580
 description or here in the video 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.889
 read the title 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.570
 we have the galaxy s 6 all the time 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.159
 spoken and from the asics edge and 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.020
 That's why we have to do it 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.720
 follow up and that we cut this 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:18.169
 Get out of here samsung galaxy s 6 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.639
 with 32 gigabytes and white pearl and how 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.370
 Can you write that down? 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.949
 in the comments funniest joke and 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.490
 the most likes arafat where 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.280
 comes the thing 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.990
 Of course you are allowed one or even 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.759
 write on 2 comments 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:36.289
 103 edit and in case of galaxy 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.490
 smartphones is not getting enough 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.860
 we can still our test the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.560
 linked to galaxy 85 and samsung 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.199
 and of course our unboxing to the s6 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.030
 and s6 had click on it 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:52.490
 otherwise, as always, do not forget 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.560
 to lure social media platforms and 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.719
 great - start the for even more infos 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.719
 and videos around the topic of technology 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.410
 I'm getting on I 've gone off 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.410
 do you have that
