00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.109 

say<00:02:07.650> more<00:02:07.890> than<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> was

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
say more than that was

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.830 
say more than that was
Corvettes<00:02:11.019> and<00:02:11.319> police<00:02:11.709> interceptors

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.360 

pretty<00:02:16.440> clean<00:02:16.709> under<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.069> hood

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.460 

definitely<00:02:25.209> one's<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.540> lot<00:02:25.629> better<00:02:25.930> than<00:02:26.140> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
definitely one's a lot better than the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.449 
definitely one's a lot better than the
mercury<00:02:26.860> I<00:02:28.709> don't<00:02:29.709> think<00:02:29.890> there's<00:02:30.069> any<00:02:30.190> rust

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
mercury I don't think there's any rust

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.530 
mercury I don't think there's any rust
on<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.819> car

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:42.229 

nice<00:02:34.540> big<00:02:34.870> trunk<00:02:37.019> power<00:02:38.019> antenna<00:02:38.440> still<00:02:38.830> works

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:50.520 

so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.160 

that's<00:02:50.950> it
