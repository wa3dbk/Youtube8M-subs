00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay so we're looking now the

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.030 
okay so we're looking now the
arrangement<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.389> back<00:00:03.629> four<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.290> the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
arrangement of the back four and the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.490 
arrangement of the back four and the
various<00:00:05.430> movements<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:06.270> you<00:00:06.629> will<00:00:07.379> be

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
various movements that you will be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.709 
various movements that you will be
making<00:00:07.680> when<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.580> ball<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:09.090> in<00:00:09.120> various

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
making when the ball is in various

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.049 
making when the ball is in various
positions<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.710> field<00:00:13.610> so<00:00:14.610> when<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:14.910> ball

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
positions on the field so when the ball

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.090 
positions on the field so when the ball
is<00:00:15.089> central<00:00:15.660> obviously<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.440> will<00:00:16.710> pressure

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
is central obviously one will pressure

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.890 
is central obviously one will pressure
the<00:00:17.340> other<00:00:17.609> will<00:00:17.820> act<00:00:18.029> as<00:00:18.240> cover<00:00:18.510> in<00:00:18.630> ten<00:00:18.810> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the other will act as cover in ten to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.540 
the other will act as cover in ten to
the<00:00:18.990> central<00:00:19.320> defenders<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.189> at<00:00:20.400> the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
the central defenders but look at the

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.670 
the central defenders but look at the
positions<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.660> these<00:00:21.840> side<00:00:22.140> defenders

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
positions here of these side defenders

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.370 
positions here of these side defenders
you<00:00:22.830> are<00:00:22.949> very<00:00:23.160> much<00:00:23.340> tucked<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.570> force<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you are very much tucked in to force the

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.830 
you are very much tucked in to force the
pass<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.949> go<00:00:26.099> wide<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.300> what<00:00:27.449> you're<00:00:27.570> doing<00:00:27.599> is

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
pass to go wide so what you're doing is

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.900 
pass to go wide so what you're doing is
preventing<00:00:28.080> any<00:00:28.410> through<00:00:28.680> balls<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.820> it

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
preventing any through balls when it

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
preventing any through balls when it
goes<00:00:30.090> wide<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.689> all<00:00:30.900> slide<00:00:31.230> across<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:32.070> you

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
goes wide you all slide across and you

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
goes wide you all slide across and you
adopt<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.880> position<00:00:33.329> with<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.020> far-sighted

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
adopt this position with the far-sighted

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.010 
adopt this position with the far-sighted
fullback<00:00:35.219> tucked<00:00:35.550> in<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> ball<00:00:39.570> travels

fullback tucked in as the ball travels
back<00:00:40.230> across<00:00:40.910> you<00:00:41.910> all<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.270> into<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
back across you all get back into the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.860 
back across you all get back into the
center<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> funnel<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.450> three<00:00:45.660> balls

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
center to funnel and make three balls

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740 
center to funnel and make three balls
impossible<00:00:46.469> again<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:48.210> defenders<00:00:48.660> are

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
impossible again the side defenders are

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.229 
impossible again the side defenders are
both<00:00:48.899> tucked<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:50.730> travels<00:00:51.120> across

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
both tucked in as it travels across

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.100 
both tucked in as it travels across
again<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.469> see<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.039> reconfiguration

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
again you see there the reconfiguration

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
again you see there the reconfiguration
note<00:00:55.110> here<00:00:55.410> that<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:55.860> central<00:00:56.160> defenders

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
note here that the two central defenders

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
note here that the two central defenders
are<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.329> staggered<00:00:57.899> they<00:00:58.079> are<00:00:58.230> flat<00:00:58.530> that's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
are not staggered they are flat that's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.040 
are not staggered they are flat that's
quite<00:00:59.370> important<00:00:59.850> all<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.809> don't

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
quite important all right so you don't

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720 
quite important all right so you don't
want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.320> one<00:01:01.590> as<00:01:01.920> a<00:01:01.980> sweeper<00:01:02.460> in<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
want to have one as a sweeper in this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.920 
want to have one as a sweeper in this
situation

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.150 

now<00:01:09.930> hopefully<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.560> would<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.770> for<00:01:10.950> some

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
now hopefully you would have for some

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.400 
now hopefully you would have for some
outside<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.030> they<00:01:12.660> try<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.110> come<00:01:13.320> inside<00:01:15.410> then

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
outside if they try and come inside then

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.010 
outside if they try and come inside then
we're<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.890> great<00:01:17.220> position<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:18.060> double-team

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
we're in a great position to double-team

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.499 
we're in a great position to double-team
as<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.530> will<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.920> right<00:01:20.640> here

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:33.410 

and<00:01:26.509> then<00:01:27.200> hopefully<00:01:27.409> when<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:27.859> ball<00:01:28.009> back

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.910 

or<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.700> keep<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.000> around<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> outside

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
or if they keep going around the outside

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.300 
or if they keep going around the outside
this<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.190> alternative<00:01:41.479> in<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:43.320> second<00:01:43.710> here

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
this is the alternative in a second here

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.130 
this is the alternative in a second here
we<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.000> they<00:01:45.150> keep<00:01:45.330> going<00:01:45.600> down<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we go so they keep going down the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320 
we go so they keep going down the
outside<00:01:46.290> at<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.860> time<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:47.880> trying<00:01:48.180> it

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
outside at this time and they trying it

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.170 
outside at this time and they trying it
across<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.900> then<00:01:49.380> obviously<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:50.640> goal<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.150> for

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
across in then obviously the goal is for

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
across in then obviously the goal is for
you<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.630> block<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.080> cross<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.619> outside

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you to block the cross as the outside

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.170 
you to block the cross as the outside
back<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.660> put<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.900> of<00:01:55.050> play<00:01:55.259> again<00:01:56.060> if<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
back and put it out of play again if you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.820 
back and put it out of play again if you
look<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.369> compact<00:01:59.820> shape<00:02:00.150> and

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.590 

we're<00:02:04.830> still<00:02:05.100> getting<00:02:05.340> massively<00:02:05.970> wide<00:02:06.270> we're

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
we're still getting massively wide we're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.029 
we're still getting massively wide we're
still<00:02:06.810> staying<00:02:07.080> connected<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.710> we're<00:02:07.800> still

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
still staying connected and we're still

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.859 
still staying connected and we're still
defending<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.550> central<00:02:08.970> area<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> matter

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
defending the central area as a matter

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.709 
defending the central area as a matter
of<00:02:10.020> priority
