00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
knowledge on board very very a-league's

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.929 
knowledge on board very very a-league's
we<00:01:37.710> find<00:01:37.920> that's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> good<00:01:38.220> determination<00:01:38.820> as

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
we find that's a good determination as

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.260 
we find that's a good determination as
to<00:01:39.170> what<00:01:40.170> assets<00:01:40.650> particularly<00:01:41.549> risk<00:01:41.880> or<00:01:42.119> any

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
to what assets particularly risk or any
