 hi hi i am glad to welcome you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.250
 on our channel today video we 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 talk a little about the hair parade I 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 just talk about how I am leaving 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 you are interested then stay with me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.769
 I'll start by saying that I am nothing special 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.590
 with my hair, I don't make it just mine 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.110
 use a balm mask main what would 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.370
 I wanted to start I almost do not use a hair dryer 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.690
 I almost do not use rectifier curling iron 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.140
 iron litmus gel and this is all I 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.449
 practically dont use but i do it 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.090
 when do i have any holidays there 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 what a super reason when i really need 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.370
 so i use but exclusively 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
 rarely on a little bit talk about those 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.090
 the means that I use in this 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.769
 moment i can't say it's straight 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.920
 Here is a super tool that a hundred times 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.740
 I bought no I did not buy them a hundred times 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.799
 i'm in search of my perfect care 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 hair last 4 i use 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.000
 shampoo and balm and 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.110
 Organic shop at the moment I went and 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.939
 bought this one like this shampoo 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.140
 natural shampoo restoration 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.049
 organic oil or extract colors 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.670
 orange 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.900
 like super natural here any 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.240
 certificates 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 then this is a German certificate 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.000
 there is no natural organic cosmetics 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.920
 no paraben silicones 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.100
 I really didn't like this shampoo 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.810
 principle just because of its smell but here 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.300
 these are the orange flowers about which I 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.610
 she said they ruined everything not 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.650
 shampoo gives such unpleasant bitterness 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.470
 I do not like when the funds 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.300
 which i use smells tasteless so 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.190
 what yes here with this shampoo I don't 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.440
 It happened in principle if you 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.970
 bitter taste more precisely the smell is not 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.180
 confuses you can buy 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.759
 well foams well washes hair 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.330
 Further from the same series I bought myself 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.300
 balm also balm astana 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.330
 organic olive extract 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.400
 argan oil is not here these colors 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.640
 nasty orange so balm 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.350
 it smells very tasty 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.510
 in principle, if shampoos were not 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.180
 orange flowers he would smell absolutely 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.810
 also but there they don't like anything 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.340
 caps that there is no pump for any 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.620
 squeezing in my opinion from the planet 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.200
 organics shampoo my planeta organica 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.600
 century miracle you did so much more convenient 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.489
 spend much much less everything 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.370
 balsam organic shop me more than 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.310
 they arrange they are very thick they are very 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.010
 fatty if you hold them a little longer 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.320
 something clearly on the packaging here 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.239
 written one two minutes i keep minutes 5 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.959
 It turns out that you seem to do 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.290
 a mask 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.880
 almost all organic silk balsam I advise 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.650
 everybody try it they smell delicious 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.989
 and they are simply amazingly performing their 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.750
 its purpose and this is also 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.019
 advise delicious smells cool moisturizes 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.650
 hair so envelops them some 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.269
 plenochka and so the hair fell osinki straight 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.860
 great really like business too without 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.940
 paraben silicones are all type 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.829
 natural cosmetic 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.160
 the next tool you want 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:37.930
 tell it masks first mask here 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.760
 This is a mask from nature Siberian 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.400
 here is the regime for packaging is still the same 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.739
 blue is for hair restoration then 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.780
 to accelerate hair growth 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.780
 but in principle, the effect is the same 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.299
 smells in principle all means of nature 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.250
 Siberian smell about the same 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.530
 somehow so know natural 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.040
 dried herbs with herbs 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.090
 so 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.840
 if the organic shop and such smells are not 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.140
 dried flowers and there are herbs and so 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.989
 such straight cut grass plus 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.790
 some pretty flowers there that 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.180
 natures siberki feeling that 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.250
 Any broths that added Masochka 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.770
 It looks like so I had to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.500
 basically it ends cool 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.449
 she's great at restoring 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.550
 In fact , I promise to restore advised 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.380
 in the summer when we feel that 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.310
 hair a little burn in the sun then 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.039
 here it is like that more moisturizes nourishes 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.460
 something like that the following is very 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.940
 Cheap but irreplaceable for me 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.889
 mask 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.870
 skeptical rage to such a stroke 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.729
 concerned but then when I try them 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.000
 i like it i'm straight delighted i don't 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.669
 I know very cheap 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.680
 so this is us bath Agafi secrets 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.000
 Siberian travnitsa restoring 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.620
 Express hair mask is still there 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.280
 instant mask the mask is no such 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.490
 very beautiful color with such a smell 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:11.610
 cinnamon is that it's here and the smell here 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.200
 very cool also smells some 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:17.520
 freshly cut grass plus very 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.870
 some kind of delicious yummy flower 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.150
 when i first tried this mask 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.060
 I put on all the entire length of hair 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.710
 held for 35 minutes somewhere and changed 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.570
 I did not understand the effect at all 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.940
 salad nothing happened what were 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.789
 Damascus still remained then when 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.479
 hair began to dry up here 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:39.880
 the effect is manifested they are so soft steel 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.830
 added volume but cool shorter 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.620
 I advise everyone here to mask this one 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.680
 supersky is also written without sls and 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.510
 Paraben hundred percent natural 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.520
 the ingredient we i'm certainly in is not 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.280
 weakened yes god bless him she works and 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.920
 Thank God and the following but this is 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.510
 remedy due to a series of pampering this 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:03.170
 Here is such a raspberry vinegar from 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.820
 companies are good for what it is for 

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:07.070
 just to soften the hair and 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:10.190
 give them shine to apply this vinegar 

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.280
 need on the ends of the hair but in principle 

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.740
 can be applied on that length which is not 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.510
 touches not like hair roots that's better 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.280
 I’m going to do everything in principle 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.880
 this is the consistency 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.890
 but the water is a little colored but what 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.490
 individual smell this one really 

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:30.170
 raspberry smell and when applied to hair 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.540
