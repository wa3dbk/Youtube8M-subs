00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
app on the App Store after watching your

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.979 
app on the App Store after watching your
video<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.000> being<00:00:39.149> said<00:00:39.239> we're<00:00:39.870> going

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
video with that being said we're going

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.569 
video with that being said we're going
to<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.170> addressing<00:00:40.379> two<00:00:40.980> things<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.489> this

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
to be addressing two things in this

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.280 
to be addressing two things in this
video<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.450> first<00:00:42.480> thing<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.050> we're<00:00:43.200> going

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
video the first thing that we're going

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.650 
video the first thing that we're going
to<00:00:43.379> be<00:00:43.500> addressing<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:45.000> actual<00:00:45.300> creation

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to be addressing is the actual creation

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.540 
to be addressing is the actual creation
of<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:45.960> app<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:46.590> we<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.309> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
of the app and how we can go about that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.040 
of the app and how we can go about that
without<00:00:47.940> having<00:00:48.120> any<00:00:48.390> programming<00:00:48.899> knowledge

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
without having any programming knowledge

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.990 
without having any programming knowledge
and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> second<00:00:50.640> thing<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.789> we're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and then the second thing that we're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520 
and then the second thing that we're
going<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.239> addressing<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.930> fact<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
going to be addressing is the fact that

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.880 
going to be addressing is the fact that
once<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.120> app<00:00:54.270> created<00:00:54.960> half<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
once you have the app created half the

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
once you have the app created half the
battle<00:00:56.280> isn't<00:00:56.610> even<00:00:56.789> over<00:00:56.940> because<00:00:57.719> more<00:00:58.170> than

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
battle isn't even over because more than

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.099 
battle isn't even over because more than
half<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.829> battle<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.399> getting<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.329> sold<00:01:00.719> on

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
half the battle is getting it sold on

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.110 
half the battle is getting it sold on
the<00:01:01.260> App<00:01:01.410> Store<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> science<00:01:03.030> to

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
the App Store and there is a science to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
the App Store and there is a science to
that<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> want<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:04.019> walking<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.589> through

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that so I want to be walking you through

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
that so I want to be walking you through
that<00:01:05.100> process<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:05.909> well<00:01:07.700> your<00:01:08.700> time<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
that process as well your time is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.899 
that process as well your time is
extremely<00:01:09.810> valued<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:11.220> process<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
extremely valued and the process of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
extremely valued and the process of
creating<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.420> app<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:12.780> inherently<00:01:13.409> difficult

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
creating an app is inherently difficult

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
creating an app is inherently difficult
from<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.280> outside<00:01:14.700> but<00:01:15.270> easy<00:01:15.659> if<00:01:15.900> somebody

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
from the outside but easy if somebody

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.160 
from the outside but easy if somebody
shows<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.220> do<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.720> imagine<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.810> rubik's

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
shows you how to do it imagine a rubik's

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.200 
shows you how to do it imagine a rubik's
cube<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.799> someone<00:01:20.189> handed<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> rubik's

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
cube if someone handed you a rubik's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
cube if someone handed you a rubik's
cube<00:01:21.479> most<00:01:22.049> people<00:01:22.530> wouldn't<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:23.040> able<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
cube most people wouldn't be able to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.050 
cube most people wouldn't be able to
figure<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.360> at<00:01:24.540> least<00:01:24.900> not<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.470> quickly

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
figure it out at least not very quickly

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
figure it out at least not very quickly
but<00:01:27.060> if<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.299> go<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.630> YouTube<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.080> look<00:01:28.350> up<00:01:28.680> how

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
but if you go on YouTube and look up how

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.020 
but if you go on YouTube and look up how
to<00:01:28.920> solve<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> Rubik's<00:01:29.729> Cube

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
to solve a Rubik's Cube

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.929 
to solve a Rubik's Cube
you<00:01:30.689> can<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.960> solving<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> less<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.670> five

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
you can be solving it in less than five

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.730 
you can be solving it in less than five
minutes<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.869> why<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.200> need<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.560> hook

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
minutes this is why you need to hook

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.460 
minutes this is why you need to hook
yourself<00:01:34.890> up<00:01:35.369> with<00:01:35.790> app<00:01:36.060> dev<00:01:36.329> secrets<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:37.049> the
