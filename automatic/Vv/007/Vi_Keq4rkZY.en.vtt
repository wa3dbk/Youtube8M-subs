00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.860
 revolver and fired a shot only 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960
 bullet hit the smartphone then the

 I can not handle this image you see. 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 Iraq is the episode that we give to 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.070
 see that the damage was not so great 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.200
 given appropriate circumstances right 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.600
 Leverage that the subject is smartphone. 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 in the technician we have a special well 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 interesting with photos of different 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.690
 devices that inspired the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.430
 development of appliances 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.219
 intelligent people that we know today 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 this material explains the concept of 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.810
 smart phones also talks about 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.610
 some devices that have developed this 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
 idea of ​​a phone do more than 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.710
 calls and there are many cool pics who 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 is interested in history of technology 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.799
 Sure, it's going to take a lot of good stuff. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.360
 this special tecmundo so after 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.340
 As you watch a video of today the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 tecmundo is there in this special that has 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.540
 a lot of cool 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.970
 amd presented the fourth generation of 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.060
 appeals of the series also known as 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.680
 cave the main model of this line is 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.040
 the a10 7,800 that has 12 cores of these 12 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.729
 4 are cpus and others are gpu 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.159
 there are also models with 10 in six cores 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.170
 according to AMD, this series simplifies 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.210
 optimizations for programmers and 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.340
 game developers 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.680
 in addition the manufacturer unlocked 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.990
 higher levels of performance for the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.299
 performance of games with prices 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 suggested for these new appeals varies 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.750
 between $ 77 and $ 155 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.179
 The issue now is cars we have to 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.080
 be here cool in this edition of today 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.500
 no tek world 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.740
 the first is audi a3 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.140
 and tron ​​is a very economical car that 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.180
 model started to be sold in europe 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.820
 responsible for optimal consumption of 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.550
 fuel is its engine lived this 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.230
 motor has one electrical unit and another 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.140
 combustion unit 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.060
 besides consumption the a3 e-tron emits less 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.370
 gases in the atmosphere 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.130
 it is still unknown if this model will be 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.550
 sold outside Europe but the pure 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.920
 The value of this audi is somewhere around 114 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.020
 thousand reais and another highlight in this matter 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.470
 of cars is that ford assemblers 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.620
 chevrolet were processed because they 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.959
 manufacture cars that equip cds 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.660
 the point is that these assemblers have 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:59.180
 cars whose stereos record a 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.530
 cd to an internal disk because this is fine 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.360
 more convenient, huh? 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.030
 You do not have to be carrying 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.700
 is frail but the alliance of artists and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.070
 record labels do not like 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.530
 a lot of it but she does not want the 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.530
 cars stop going to the cds what she 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.660
 either a percentage of royalties 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.769
 this alliance is based on a law 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:24.590
 1992 which prevents the marketing of 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.650
 apparatus whose main purpose is to 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.870
 make copies of registered content to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.489
 Ford says he's not doing anything out 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.110
 of your rights while chevrolet 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.440
 has not yet pronounced 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.690
 in the United States the man supposedly 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.430
 stole a glass goal and then had his day 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.040
 recorded because the unit was 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.630
 configured to broadcast the footage 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.030
 with a video was posted on youtube 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.750
 by someone supposedly called mark 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.670
 heller 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.190
 filming shows that he was giving 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.049
 some bands in new york city 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.299
 until someone asks to see the glass and 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.610
 ends up running away with his glasses 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.160
 then the thief appears to enjoy a night out 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:04.010
 then only that many people do not 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.230
 believe that this video is real 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.480
 google maps user commented that the 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.150
 young people do not work without smartphones 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.269
 and also that the battery does not 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.700
 It would last a long time to record it all then. 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.950
 Do you think this real story 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.590
 even leave your opinion in the area of 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.770
 comments and to end this today in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:27.460
 note that the world a hint of law 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.860
 I told you that it is actually 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.409
 a selection of photos already published in this 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.050
 lingerie day is already a tradition of some 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:37.449
 years then it is perfectly possible that 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.159
 many will not read or only read 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.129

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.139

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.159
 but was gaining strength in other networks 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.949
 social 

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:50.650
 on that date many people wear clothes 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.360
 take photos and spread it with the 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.030
