today we're going to talk about PPA also
known<00:00:24.989> as<00:00:25.289> perfect<00:00:25.680> paper<00:00:25.890> adhesive<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.820> was

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
known as perfect paper adhesive it was

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359 
known as perfect paper adhesive it was
originally<00:00:27.599> designed<00:00:27.809> for<00:00:28.169> paper<00:00:28.529> because

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
originally designed for paper because

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.819

I'm<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.579> collage<00:00:29.939> artist<00:00:30.419> and<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.899> why<00:00:31.800> I

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
I'm a collage artist and that's why I

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.770 
I'm a collage artist and that's why I
designed<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.610> adhesive<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.269> wanted

of this tissue paper that we could just

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
of this tissue paper that we could just
tear<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.759> nice<00:01:38.969> to<00:01:39.240> have

with photography you'll begin by

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
with photography you'll begin by
applying<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:55.170> little<00:01:55.229> bit<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.710> water<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> the

applying a little bit of water to the
brush<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.909> then<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.240> want<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> dry<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:57.899> off

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.319 
brush but then you want to dry it off
and<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.829> dry<00:01:59.039> it<00:01:59.100> off<00:01:59.280> onto<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.670> paper<00:01:59.969> towel

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and you dry it off onto a paper towel

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.410 
and you dry it off onto a paper towel
and<00:02:00.719> then<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> apply<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.890> adhesive<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:03.270> the

and then you apply the adhesive to the

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.410 
and then you apply the adhesive to the
paper<00:02:03.770> now<00:02:04.770> I'm<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> put<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> on<00:02:05.670> with

the<00:02:06.600> brush

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
the brush

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.340

generously<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:08.789> not<00:02:09.030> too<00:02:09.539> much<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.320> that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
generously but not too much so that

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.069 
generously but not too much so that
there's<00:02:10.709> too<00:02:10.950> much<00:02:11.100> white<00:02:11.959> taking<00:02:12.959> this

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079
