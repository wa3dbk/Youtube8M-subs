skip<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.750> step<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.009> really<00:02:06.610> think<00:02:06.850> it

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
skip this step but I really think it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.610 
skip this step but I really think it
provides<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.900> fresh<00:02:08.819> touch<00:02:09.819> to<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.329> dough<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.560> I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
provides a fresh touch to the dough so I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.930 
provides a fresh touch to the dough so I
really<00:02:11.980> like<00:02:12.189> it

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
really like it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.390

so then in the mean time preheat the
oven<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.970> 200<00:02:32.989> degrees<00:02:33.989> Celsius<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:35.040> line<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
oven to 200 degrees Celsius and line a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.290 
oven to 200 degrees Celsius and line a
cupcake<00:02:36.180> tray<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.170> paper<00:02:37.350> cups<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.300> then

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
cupcake tray with paper cups and then

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.530 
cupcake tray with paper cups and then
you<00:02:39.450> feel<00:02:39.690> with<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> mixture<00:02:41.010> until<00:02:41.540> it's

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
you feel with the mixture until it's

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.500 
you feel with the mixture until it's
filled<00:02:43.200> like<00:02:43.650> 3/4<00:02:44.489> of<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.790> caps<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.239> more

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
filled like 3/4 of the caps not more

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.130 
filled like 3/4 of the caps not more
remember<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.800> will<00:02:46.980> grow<00:02:47.220> in<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> oven

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
remember that it will grow in the oven

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.680 
remember that it will grow in the oven
so<00:02:49.140> as<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.590> messed<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.519> tray<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.060> had<00:02:51.540> to

so as I messed up the tray I had to
clean<00:02:51.870> it<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.290> avoid<00:02:52.590> these<00:02:52.799> dots<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.519> dough<00:02:53.730> to

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
clean it to avoid these dots of dough to

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.110 
clean it to avoid these dots of dough to
burn<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.450> oven<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:55.519> another<00:02:56.519> important

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
burn in the oven in another important

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.470 
burn in the oven in another important
