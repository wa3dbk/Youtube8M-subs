00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.870
 Welcome back to Detailing Garage 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.969
 we are doing photos for ours 

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:16.969
 brushes for upholstery and carpet drills 

00:00:17.928 --> 00:00:24.928
 We have not yet done this piece of seat and as you can see, a big difference before and after 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.829
 We do it to show you 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.969
 how the brush works on upholstery that is more sensitive 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:37.359
 than these solid rugs when you clean them with a drill. 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.370
 Now I'll show you in real time. 

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:51.319
 We apply a little NonSense that binds dirt and grease with it 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.289
 We'll do it very easily 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:59.300
 but watch the difference I make here 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.540
 As you saw, we wiped all the dirt off the seat 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.729
 with soft carpet and upholstery brush 

00:01:36.728 --> 00:01:42.209
 Wipe with a cloth to remove any residue from the cleaner 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:47.000
 and dirt deposited on the surface. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.340
 Now you see what was in the seat! 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.500
 With the right tool, which is this brush, 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.328
 And with the right cleaner, you'll get an amazing result in a minute! 

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:05.250
 The rest of the interior remains to complete the photo shoot 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.620
 mainly it was about showing the right product to do a lot with it! 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.990
 You have a nice car 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.700
 so keep it clean 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:14.639
 with Chemical Guys!
