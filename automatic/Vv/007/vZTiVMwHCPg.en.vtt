00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.629
 Well today I want to talk about a 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.339
 very important topic especially 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.940
 for the people that we have a 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.219
 mac computer in terms of security 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.860
 many people say that it is not necessary 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.710
 install what is an antivirus to your 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.380
 machine because it does not run the risk 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.080
 of contamination or anything like that I want 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.590
 mention that it was considered 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.150
 previously 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 now technically any 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.840
 computer including max are found 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.129
 in danger of contracting what are viruses 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.649
 infections also like spywares 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.469
 etcetera it is very important that you 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.749
 protect and protect your information to 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.999
 that in that way later you do not pay 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.649
 the consequences the only thing that could you 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:45.870
 say that if it's true is that a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.899
 Mac computer is less prone to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 be contaminated that a pc with windows but 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 technically you are not exempt what you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.929
 I will recommend below is a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.659
 antivirus that I have always recommended 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.699
 it's called avast if you come to the page 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.949
 of avast dotcom from your mac 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.350
 regularly he detects that you have a 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 computer with this operating system and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.600
 gives you on this side the opportunity to 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 to urge 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.159
 the antivirus completely free what 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.439
 let's do is install it we're going to 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.110
 give here download sends us to this 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.299
 next window we give you download us 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.580
 send to this other page we are going to give 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.159
 from this side download and here you have to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.170
 start what is the download ok already 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.920
 came from this side the only thing that remains 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.570
 here is wait for it to end 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.700
 well once it's finished downloading 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.439
 after a few minutes we can come to 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.840
 this section where we have our 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.369
 downloads or you can even go to 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.229
 the folder where you have downloaded it 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.240
 regularly it is the download folder 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.759
 in this case I'm going to run it from 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.009
 right here I'm going to give you a click so that 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.710
 automatically open I will minimize 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 or to close the window that I have behind and 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.830
 let's wait for the process to 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.810
 carry out 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.060
 I want to mention the following, I already 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.610
 I previously had another antivirus 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.370
 installed in this case is the norton most 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.200
 however I wanted to show you this 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.410
 another program because this is 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.899
 completely free and I also think that 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.610
 it's much better to my point of view than 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.460
 the norton I will soon 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.770
 change for this now in the next 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:18.830
 what we have to do is move 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.690
 what is the installation icon to 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.970
 our portfolio of applications we will 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.070
 to do from here we drag 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.210
 to the facilities folder we close 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:31.220
 this once I finish copying it 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.709
 now we close it we come to the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.720
 finder 'on this side I give a click 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.540
 when the window opens 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.940
 we select the applications folder 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.380
 and we look for what is avast 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.190
 we double click 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.190
 we open it 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.170
 we accept what the terms are and 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.260
 conditions confirming on this side and 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.390
 we give you here to install 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.209
 He tells me that I have to close the safari 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.220
 if you have it open right button you 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.349
 We give quit or leave so that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.720
 automatically close it will ask you 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.790
 your password so you can do the 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.510
 installation of the program regarding your 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.810
 mac computer we give ok 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.880
 and it starts to install 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.739
 well then this appears 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.630
 window where we have to 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.520
 register the program I want to mention you 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.770
 that the moment we click on the 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.330
 blue button that you just saw brings us 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.670
 this window but what I love you 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.400
 to mention is that you are going to register this 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.620

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.410

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.290
 our mac and it tells us in the next 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.810
 window that the record has been made 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.910
