00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 once upon a time in a deaf abandoned and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.919
 the black city of gunpowder was born dear 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.719
 a boy named aleshenka 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:13.049
 he was different from many guys around 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.610
 his interests are not, he ate children or 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.460
 chopped them with an ax no 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.320
 the age of 7 he loved the comic book and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.240
 thanks to comics he loved that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 cool author as frank miller and 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 today he will tell you about one of 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.240
 most sublime and gloomy 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.240
 comics is a city of sins baby 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.360
 yes hello everybody as said offscreen 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.380
 guy beginning we'll talk about 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.570
 sin City 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.430
 I will not retell you the plot you 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.010
 know at least from the movie so 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.520
 brewing question what are we going to 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.260
 speak more precisely i will say yes all 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.210
 extremely simple thing is that quite 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.250
 most recently and extra for a 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.200
 released one of the chapters in Russian so 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.650
 that guys we will talk about that 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.380
 how they did it and maybe i will say 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.430
 a few words about the creation if you 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.010
 of course you want 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.510
 sometime in the late eighties one uncle 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.160
 by the name of frank miller nehilo so 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.900
 rose in the comic industry 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.570
 for their at the time innovative and 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.270
 original approaches to everything in the comic 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.729
 the first thing people love though not all 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.650
 of course but many of his dardevil who 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.869
 distinguished by its darkness from more 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.760
 early image and after many years he 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.460
 took up one more characters of the universe 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.140
 blind guy for electra pose 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.540
 eighty-third it was hurt 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.460
 which I never read so 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.560
 I won't know 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.150
 eighty-sixth year as we all know 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.700
 on the counter got one of the most 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.210
 the greatest comics return dark 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.970
 knight 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.190
 and the very beginning of the 90 appeared cool 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.290
 welded as you might guess for everything 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.040
 Miller of the above product 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.750
 waited for success 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.880
 he scatter right and left 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.950
 with their grotesque plots and graphics 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.260
 if you really wanted to write the word bastard 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.540
 he did so in general principle 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.230
 always did what I wanted no one 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.300
 sagging 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.400
 so actually ninety first year did 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.410
 sunk to the creation of the city of sins 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.420
 Initially, the first story is reference 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.110
 hard and goodbye printed in a magazine 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.120
 dark horse 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.620
 but then looking at the success of the comic strip 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.820
 decided to pass in etc. 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.860
 BECBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB Support Tool 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.080
 Miller as always chocolate is true 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.620
 his last works for some reason 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.090
 received very negative criticism and 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.920
 attacks by different people on 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.930
 today frankie created no longer 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.420
 one tone under the auspices of the city of sins 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.709
 but we will talk about the first one 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.890
 hard and goodbye 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.700
 this is the one that about margot and needles once 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.310
 long 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.510
 in 2007 the publishing house pore music 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.099
 let the city of sins 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:51.830
 Exactly this one here it is 1 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.540
 so and give birth to this that just kapets but 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.099
 apparently listening to a lot of people 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.599
 we still waited for a miracle 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.430
 reprint book came out in solid 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.950
 glossy binding as it should be 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.230
 cool edition is already on the cover we see 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.480
 elegant design all very civilized and 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.090
 beautiful when you open the book you too 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.440
 don't be disappointed print nice page 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.330
 certainly not glossy but in my opinion 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.610
 black and white comics on it no one and no 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.620
 prints edition contains not only himself 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.959
 comic book at the end of the pages all set aside 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.590
 on arts from frank himself and dictionaries 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.319
 camphor 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.470
 sizing at the book I also clearly like 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.940
 will not break as you yourself know what 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.260
 the size of the comic when compared with the same 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.299
 superman land 1 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.849
 Slightly weird in width it is the same 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.230
 but the most adjustment circumcised centimeters 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.329
 and so on 34 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.880
 but it doesn't affect the coolness of the book. 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.130
 I think in general, as you understand the comics 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:44.959
 ask you to the collection it will take 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.030
 worthy place on your shelf will be 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.280
 stand out with your spine among others 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.100
 it was still time you promised to release neither 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.040
 one to three houses and a series of short 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.750
 buy guys will not regret 100 percent 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.880
 yes by the way I have a question for you 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.220
 create a vk group with my reviews and 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.060
 until the second question I take off on my new 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:08.060
 camera and how do you sound and the video itself pancake 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.430
 I remembered one more question or rather 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.590
 no question in general I do not really like 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.420
 the name of my show and if you have 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.850
 any ideas about how you can 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.950
 call then write about it to everyone 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.130
