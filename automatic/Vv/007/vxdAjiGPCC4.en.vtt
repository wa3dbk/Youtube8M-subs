valve and what happened well the reason
we<00:01:00.989> did<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.829> because<00:01:02.010> Toro<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:03.000> happens

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

210<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> 270<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> needed<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:25.020> full<00:01:25.140> circle

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
210 to 270 then you needed a full circle

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.179 
210 to 270 then you needed a full circle
whether<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.490> Toro<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:27.540> from<00:01:27.810> 45<00:01:28.650> degrees

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189

circle the other thing and the reason
for<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.130> marriage

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.260 

this<00:01:38.450> nozzle<00:01:38.720> goes<00:01:39.710> approximately<00:01:40.520> 26<00:01:41.060> feet

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
this nozzle goes approximately 26 feet

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020 
this nozzle goes approximately 26 feet
and<00:01:41.680> in<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:43.070> riddler<00:01:43.340> system<00:01:43.730> it'll<00:01:43.850> probably

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
and in a riddler system it'll probably

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.360 
and in a riddler system it'll probably
get<00:01:44.240> down<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.480> about<00:01:44.540> 23<00:01:45.050> 24<00:01:45.230> it's<00:01:46.070> shooting

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
get down to about 23 24 it's shooting

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.940 
get down to about 23 24 it's shooting
all<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.790> way<00:01:46.880> back<00:01:47.060> against<00:01:47.480> the<00:01:47.540> background

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
all the way back against the background

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.680 
all the way back against the background
but<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:49.190> it<00:01:49.310> therapy<00:01:49.760> out<00:01:50.030> there<00:01:50.240> yeah<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.600> by

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
but was it therapy out there yeah and by

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.660 
but was it therapy out there yeah and by
the<00:01:50.750> way<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:50.990> big<00:01:51.230> advantage<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.890> Toro<00:01:52.130> PRN

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
the way a big advantage to the Toro PRN

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.130 
the way a big advantage to the Toro PRN
also<00:01:53.030> if<00:01:53.180> that's<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.450> very<00:01:53.630> low<00:01:53.900> trajectory

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
also if that's a very low trajectory

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.510 
also if that's a very low trajectory
right<00:01:55.100> okay

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
right okay

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.900 
right okay
however<00:01:56.270> with<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:56.840> nozzle<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:58.310> can<00:01:58.340> go<00:01:58.670> from

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
however with this nozzle you can go from

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.440 
however with this nozzle you can go from
24<00:01:59.630> to<00:01:59.660> 26<00:02:00.290> feet<00:02:00.590> all<00:02:01.040> the<00:02:01.100> way<00:02:01.430> down<00:02:01.730> to<00:02:01.970> 3<00:02:02.150> feet

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
24 to 26 feet all the way down to 3 feet

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
24 to 26 feet all the way down to 3 feet
with<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.660> little<00:02:02.960> bow<00:02:03.080> it's<00:02:03.770> really<00:02:04.220> neat<00:02:04.430> look

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.270 
with a little bow it's really neat look
at<00:02:04.910> that<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.920> precision<00:02:06.920> there<00:02:07.310> I<00:02:09.280> just

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
at that that's a precision there I just

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.400 
at that that's a precision there I just
want<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.760> have<00:02:10.850> a<00:02:10.880> few<00:02:11.120> sprays<00:02:11.420> here<00:02:11.690> right<00:02:11.840> so

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
want to have a few sprays here right so

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.140 
want to have a few sprays here right so
it's<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.800> really<00:02:13.100> it's<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.430> wonderful<00:02:13.820> nozzle

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
it's just really it's a wonderful nozzle

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.670 
it's just really it's a wonderful nozzle
and<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.300> two<00:02:14.450> of<00:02:14.570> them<00:02:14.660> together<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.410> just

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
and the two of them together it's just

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.650 
and the two of them together it's just
awesome<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:16.520> would<00:02:16.640> be<00:02:16.670> an<00:02:17.330> advantage

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
awesome and what would be an advantage

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.020 
awesome and what would be an advantage

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
of the big things with little valves is

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.510 
of the big things with little valves is
you<00:02:42.020> don't<00:02:42.200> have<00:02:42.320> any<00:02:42.440> overspray<00:02:42.890> because<00:02:43.400> you

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
you don't have any overspray because you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.699 
you don't have any overspray because you
dial<00:02:43.850> in<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.209> distance<00:02:44.600> so<00:02:45.290> he'll<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.470> able<00:02:45.620> to

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
dial in the distance so he'll be able to

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.860 
dial in the distance so he'll be able to
dial<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.310> because<00:02:47.270> without<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.750> little

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
dial it in because without the little

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.750 
dial it in because without the little
valve<00:02:48.110> this<00:02:48.230> only<00:02:48.410> goes<00:02:48.620> down<00:02:48.740> to<00:02:48.860> 14<00:02:49.280> feet<00:02:49.520> and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
valve this only goes down to 14 feet and

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.790 
valve this only goes down to 14 feet and
there's<00:02:49.910> no<00:02:50.120> real<00:02:50.510> good<00:02:50.810> rotary<00:02:51.410> that<00:02:51.620> gets

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
there's no real good rotary that gets

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.070 
there's no real good rotary that gets
under<00:02:52.160> 10<00:02:52.400> feet<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:53.090> little<00:02:53.450> bad<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> can<00:02:53.930> bring

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
under 10 feet a little bad you can bring

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.380 
under 10 feet a little bad you can bring
it<00:02:54.170> down<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.440> 7<00:02:54.739> or<00:02:54.800> 8<00:02:54.950> feet<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.970> cover<00:02:56.180> those

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
it down to 7 or 8 feet and cover those

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.500 
it down to 7 or 8 feet and cover those
smaller<00:02:56.720> areas<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.590> big<00:02:57.739> advantage

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
smaller areas so that's a big advantage

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.449 
smaller areas so that's a big advantage
