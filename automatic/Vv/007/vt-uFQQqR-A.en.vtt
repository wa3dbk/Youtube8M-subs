rate which you know I couldn't read

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.810

notice<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.290> PM<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.710> got<00:01:28.920> got<00:01:29.340> less<00:01:29.549> recoil

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
notice and the PM I got got less recoil

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.569 
notice and the PM I got got less recoil
which<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> definitely<00:01:30.720> noticeable<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
which is definitely noticeable but you

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.179 
which is definitely noticeable but you
know<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> recoil<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.509> still<00:01:33.950> still<00:01:34.950> there

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
know the recoil is still still there

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.520 
know the recoil is still still there
it's<00:01:35.670> still<00:01:35.909> pretty<00:01:36.479> bad<00:01:36.840> recoil<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.780> out<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
it's still pretty bad recoil but out of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
it's still pretty bad recoil but out of
these<00:01:40.799> guns<00:01:41.100> probably<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.079> one<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.290> had<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
these guns probably the one that had the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.700 
these guns probably the one that had the
biggest<00:01:44.549> effect<00:01:45.979> on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.280> gun<00:01:47.520> was<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.710> m16

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
biggest effect on the gun was the m16

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.359 
biggest effect on the gun was the m16
the<00:01:49.890> f<00:01:50.040> ad<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:52.229> much<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.799> their

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the f ad it is just so much of their

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.219 
the f ad it is just so much of their
both<00:01:53.640> better<00:01:54.030> weapons<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.780> they're<00:01:54.869> easier

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
both better weapons and they're easier

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.429 
both better weapons and they're easier
to<00:01:55.259> use<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> they<00:01:56.520> can<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.570> m16<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.320> now

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
to use and they can the the m16 can now

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.789 
to use and they can the the m16 can now
compete<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.280> type<00:01:59.549> 95<00:02:00.200> but<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.229> still<00:02:01.530> think

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
compete the type 95 but I still think

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.249 
compete the type 95 but I still think
that<00:02:01.860> type<00:02:02.250> 95<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> little<00:02:03.119> bit<00:02:03.240> better<00:02:04.579> and

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
that type 95 is a little bit better and

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.169 
that type 95 is a little bit better and
yeah<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.799> fa<00:02:08.160> b<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.489> really<00:02:08.789> good<00:02:08.940> though<00:02:09.119> you

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
yeah the fa b is really good though you

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.860 
yeah the fa b is really good though you
can<00:02:09.509> get<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.899> of<00:02:10.730> kills<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:12.209> from<00:02:12.780> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
can get a lot of kills from from a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.790 
can get a lot of kills from from a
distance

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
distance

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.760 
distance
and<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.640> fa<00:02:14.940> be<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.450> think<00:02:16.020> what<00:02:16.290> they<00:02:16.410> did<00:02:16.620> was

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
and the fa be I think what they did was

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.530 
and the fa be I think what they did was
they<00:02:16.830> made<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.280> four-shot<00:02:17.790> kill<00:02:18.030> no<00:02:18.330> matter

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
they made it a four-shot kill no matter

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.380 
they made it a four-shot kill no matter
where<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:18.990> body<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.730> no<00:02:20.730> matter<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
where in the body and no matter what the

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.660 
where in the body and no matter what the
distance<00:02:21.810> might<00:02:21.990> be<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:23.160> you<00:02:23.220> know<00:02:23.520> that's

guy through and it exploded and it was

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.060 
guy through and it exploded and it was
like<00:03:23.700> an<00:03:23.820> EMP<00:03:24.330> kind<00:03:24.810> of<00:03:24.989> so<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.739> know<00:03:25.920> it's

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
like an EMP kind of so you know it's

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:30.680 
like an EMP kind of so you know it's
pretty<00:03:26.480> pretty<00:03:27.480> cool<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.550> um<00:03:29.550> near<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.480> end

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
pretty pretty cool and um near the end

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.740 
pretty pretty cool and um near the end
of<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.989> trailer<00:03:31.290> uh<00:03:32.900> um<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.410> was<00:03:34.650> like<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:36.540> was

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
of the trailer uh um it was like it was

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.120 
of the trailer uh um it was like it was
showing<00:03:37.110> the<00:03:37.200> first<00:03:37.470> part<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.739> the<00:03:37.860> trailer

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
showing the first part of the trailer

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.770 
showing the first part of the trailer
but<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.090> guess<00:03:39.300> somebody<00:03:39.510> was

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
but like I guess somebody was

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.650 
but like I guess somebody was
commentating<00:03:40.290> over<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:41.090> and<00:03:42.090> he<00:03:42.420> showed

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
commentating over it and and he showed

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.780 
commentating over it and and he showed
the<00:03:42.810> score<00:03:43.170> up<00:03:43.410> on<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> top<00:03:43.980> so<00:03:44.310> kind<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.640> like

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
the score up on the top so kind of like

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.810 
the score up on the top so kind of like
a<00:03:44.820> like<00:03:45.630> an<00:03:45.780> MLG<00:03:46.140> type<00:03:46.650> thing<00:03:46.920> you<00:03:47.040> know<00:03:47.190> where

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
a like an MLG type thing you know where

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.940 
a like an MLG type thing you know where
they<00:03:48.000> do<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.510> life<00:03:48.720> calms<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.410> they're

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
they do the life calms and they're

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.460 
they do the life calms and they're
saying<00:03:50.390> what<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.510> happening<00:03:51.989> while<00:03:52.290> it's

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
saying what is happening while it's

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.260 
saying what is happening while it's
happening<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:54.020> it's<00:03:55.020> pretty<00:03:55.290> confusing<00:03:55.560> to<00:03:56.270> to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
happening so it's pretty confusing to to

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.540 
happening so it's pretty confusing to to
say<00:03:57.480> but<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:59.640> it<00:04:00.300> looks<00:04:00.570> pretty<00:04:00.840> cool<00:04:00.989> and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.400 
pretty cool and also there's you know
the<00:04:19.230> RC<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:20.519> quadrotor<00:04:21.120> I'm<00:04:21.840> sure<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.260> guys

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
the RC the quadrotor I'm sure you guys

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.450 
the RC the quadrotor I'm sure you guys
have<00:04:22.470> seen<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.010> but<00:04:23.850> it's<00:04:24.000> basically<00:04:24.210> an<00:04:24.810> RC

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
have seen it but it's basically an RC

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.020 
have seen it but it's basically an RC
helicopter<00:04:26.460> and

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
helicopter and

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.760 
helicopter and
you<00:04:27.120> can<00:04:27.300> shoot<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:28.020> you<00:04:28.350> know<00:04:28.590> that's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
you can shoot so you know that's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.650 
you can shoot so you know that's
something<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.580> people<00:04:30.270> have<00:04:30.360> been<00:04:30.510> asking

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
something that people have been asking

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.500 
something that people have been asking
for<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:32.340> know<00:04:32.460> I<00:04:32.490> guess<00:04:32.790> they<00:04:33.000> finally

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
for and you know I guess they finally
