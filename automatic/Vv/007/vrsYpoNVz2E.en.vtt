levy weld you don't need to open your
wallet<00:00:17.580> so<00:00:18.180> big<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.289> tank<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.949> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
wallet so big because this tank is a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.870 
wallet so big because this tank is a
tier<00:00:20.850> free<00:00:21.500> premium<00:00:22.500> tank<00:00:22.830> called<00:00:23.400> the

artillery BTM where meanwhile the 12 1 b
will<00:00:29.369> mostly<00:00:29.849> be<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.359> clan<00:00:31.320> wars<00:00:32.120> reward<00:00:33.120> tank

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
will mostly be a clan wars reward tank

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.240 
will mostly be a clan wars reward tank
but<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.100> artillery<00:00:35.820> bt7<00:00:36.780> it's<00:00:37.250> basically

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
but to the artillery bt7 it's basically

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.690 
but to the artillery bt7 it's basically
a<00:00:38.520> tier<00:00:39.239> 3<00:00:40.129> bt7<00:00:41.129> light<00:00:41.550> tank<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.700> 67.2

millimeter katie 28 gun so let's have a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.860 
millimeter katie 28 gun so let's have a
look<00:00:47.789> at<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:49.050> stats<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.590> tank<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.100> has

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
look at the stats of this tank it has

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.410 
look at the stats of this tank it has
220<00:00:51.870> hit<00:00:52.020> points<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> an<00:00:53.190> engine<00:00:53.579> with<00:00:53.699> 500

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
horse powers the weight is 13.5 tons and

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.220 
horse powers the weight is 13.5 tons and
this<00:00:59.039> gives<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.460> an<00:00:59.579> horrendous<00:01:00.210> good<00:01:00.809> power

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
this gives it an horrendous good power

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.820 
this gives it an horrendous good power
to<00:01:01.320> weight<00:01:01.590> ratio<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.629> 47.0<00:01:03.629> for<00:01:04.320> HP<00:01:04.920> per<00:01:05.129> ton

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
to weight ratio and 47.0 for HP per ton

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.320 
to weight ratio and 47.0 for HP per ton
unfortunate<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> through<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.670> maximum<00:01:09.210> speed

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
unfortunate of through the maximum speed

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.219 
unfortunate of through the maximum speed
with<00:01:09.630> 51.6<00:01:10.530> km/h<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.450> high<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
with 51.6 km/h is not really high so

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.859 
with 51.6 km/h is not really high so
yeah<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> will<00:01:14.130> quite<00:01:14.400> reach<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.850> will<00:01:15.540> reach

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
yeah you will quite reach it will reach

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.820 
yeah you will quite reach it will reach
quite<00:01:16.080> fast<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.600> this<00:01:18.600> top<00:01:18.930> speed<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
quite fast this this top speed the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
quite fast this this top speed the
backward<00:01:20.340> speed<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:20.909> dick<00:01:21.030> alarm<00:01:21.270> spell

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
backward speed is one dick alarm spell

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.690 
backward speed is one dick alarm spell
which<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:21.960> really<00:01:22.229> good<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.220> whole<00:01:23.369> traversed

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
which is really good the whole traversed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
which is really good the whole traversed
is<00:01:23.850> 45<00:01:24.450> degrees<00:01:24.479> per<00:01:24.960> second<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.350> also<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
is 45 degrees per second is also really

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.700 
is 45 degrees per second is also really
great<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.460> turret<00:01:26.729> reverse<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.210> 4G<00:01:27.780> 7.5

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
great and the turret reverse with 4G 7.5

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.399 
great and the turret reverse with 4G 7.5
degrees<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.780> rain<00:01:30.990> terrain

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
degrees as well the rain terrain

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.300 
degrees as well the rain terrain
resistance<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.220> fairly<00:01:32.850> low<00:01:33.119> with<00:01:33.950> 0.76<00:01:34.950> on

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
resistance is fairly low with 0.76 on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.230 
resistance is fairly low with 0.76 on
hard<00:01:35.670> ground<00:01:35.930> 0.9<00:01:36.930> medium<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.829> 1.8<00:01:38.700> on<00:01:38.939> soft

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
hard ground 0.9 medium and 1.8 on soft

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.690 
hard ground 0.9 medium and 1.8 on soft
ground<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.350> as<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.979> see<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.340> isn't<00:01:41.670> a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
ground so as you can see this isn't a

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.399 
ground so as you can see this isn't a
good<00:01:41.820> example<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> really<00:01:42.960> low<00:01:43.140> terrain

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
good example for a really low terrain

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.960 
good example for a really low terrain
resistance<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:46.049> feeling<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:47.399> low<00:01:47.610> but

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
resistance the feeling is really low but

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
resistance the feeling is really low but
it<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.240> normal<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.500> tier<00:01:49.710> 3<00:01:49.950> tank<00:01:50.220> with

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it is normal for the tier 3 tank with

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
it is normal for the tier 3 tank with
two<00:01:50.549> hundred<00:01:50.820> ninety<00:01:51.030> meters<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.259> radio

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
two hundred ninety meters and the radio

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.050 
two hundred ninety meters and the radio
range<00:01:52.799> where<00:01:52.950> 300<00:01:53.340> meters<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.909> also<00:01:54.630> quite<00:01:54.960> bad

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
range where 300 meters is also quite bad

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.090 
range where 300 meters is also quite bad

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to the armor as you probably can think

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.340 
to the armor as you probably can think

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
genius it won't be an armor monster like

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.210 
genius it won't be an armor monster like
the<00:02:41.130> mini<00:02:41.580> mouse<00:02:41.959> but<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:42.989> gun<00:02:43.530> is<00:02:43.709> quite

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the mini mouse but the gun is quite

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.800 
the mini mouse but the gun is quite
funny<00:02:44.670> because<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.660> as<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.989> said<00:02:46.370> 267<00:02:47.810> 76.2

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
funny because it is as I said 267 76.2

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.280 
funny because it is as I said 267 76.2
millimeters<00:02:49.530> kt20<00:02:50.370> I'd<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.850> has<00:02:51.570> with<00:02:51.840> AP<00:02:52.260> a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
millimeters kt20 I'd it has with AP a

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.850 
millimeters kt20 I'd it has with AP a
damaged<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.800> 110<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.230> 37<00:02:55.230> millimeter<00:02:55.590> and

damaged of 110 and 37 millimeter and

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.050 
damaged of 110 and 37 millimeter and
with<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.280> cheat<00:02:56.580> at<00:02:57.200> 146<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.610> eighty<00:02:59.610> three

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
with a cheat at 146 and eighty three

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.870 
with a cheat at 146 and eighty three
millimeters<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.660> penetration<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:02.430> has<00:03:02.610> around

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
millimeters of penetration it has around

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.770 
millimeters of penetration it has around
the<00:03:03.000> fire<00:03:03.239> of<00:03:03.360> 14.5<00:03:04.340> 51<00:03:05.340> shots<00:03:06.120> per<00:03:06.360> minute<00:03:06.420> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the fire of 14.5 51 shots per minute and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.949 
the fire of 14.5 51 shots per minute and
this<00:03:07.440> gives<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.130> DPM<00:03:08.610> with<00:03:08.820> AP<00:03:09.390> which<00:03:09.810> I

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
this gives it a DPM with AP which I

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.030 
this gives it a DPM with AP which I
wouldn't<00:03:10.170> use<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:12.140> 1609<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.470> with<00:03:13.920> HG<00:03:15.019> 2330

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
wouldn't use of 1609 and with HG 2330

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.840 
wouldn't use of 1609 and with HG 2330
6.4<00:03:17.690> so<00:03:18.690> before<00:03:19.680> we<00:03:19.829> go<00:03:19.950> to<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.370> reload<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
6.4 so before we go to the reload and

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.759 
6.4 so before we go to the reload and
things<00:03:21.090> like<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:22.170> tank<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.500> quite

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
things like this this tank is quite

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.330 
things like this this tank is quite
funny<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.790> probably<00:03:24.269> think<00:03:24.720> ap<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.380> not

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
funny you probably think ap is not

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.870 
funny you probably think ap is not
really<00:03:26.670> important<00:03:27.239> because<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.959> is<00:03:28.019> only<00:03:28.200> 37

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
really important because it is only 37

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.610 
really important because it is only 37
millimeters<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:29.910> penetration<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:31.380> still

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
millimeters of penetration but still

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.830 
millimeters of penetration but still
don't<00:03:31.829> forget<00:03:32.130> when<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.489> hit<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.730> HD<00:03:33.450> tracks

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
don't forget when you hit with HD tracks

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.410 
don't forget when you hit with HD tracks
it<00:03:34.200> doesn't<00:03:34.500> matter<00:03:34.560> from<00:03:34.799> black<00:03:35.070> from<00:03:35.730> what

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
it doesn't matter from black from what

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.420 
it doesn't matter from black from what
distance<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:38.670> won't<00:03:38.970> penetrate<00:03:40.100> this<00:03:41.100> time

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
distance it won't penetrate this time

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
distance it won't penetrate this time
can<00:03:41.700> get<00:03:41.910> pins<00:03:42.120> red<00:03:42.269> with<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> AP<00:03:42.900> from<00:03:43.110> the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
can get pins red with the AP from the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.920 
can get pins red with the AP from the
side<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:44.010> still<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.489> would<00:03:45.150> say<00:03:45.390> when<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.750> know

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
side but still I would say when you know

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.449 
side but still I would say when you know
how<00:03:46.079> to<00:03:46.140> use<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:47.130> chi<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:47.820> this<00:03:48.030> tank<00:03:49.010> well<00:03:50.010> to

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
how to use a chi on this tank well to

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.300 
how to use a chi on this tank well to
the<00:03:50.549> reload<00:03:50.989> 4.1<00:03:51.989> seconds<00:03:52.410> reload<00:03:52.769> time<00:03:53.070> and

Anna crazy of an amazing 0.5 75 you

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.490 
Anna crazy of an amazing 0.5 75 you
won't<00:03:59.610> be<00:03:59.760> a<00:03:59.790> sniper<00:04:00.090> especially<00:04:01.019> not<00:04:01.260> after

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
won't be a sniper especially not after

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.150 
won't be a sniper especially not after
nine<00:04:01.860> point<00:04:02.160> six<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.930> aim<00:04:04.140> time<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.620> 2.3

nine point six the aim time of 2.3

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.750 
nine point six the aim time of 2.3
seconds<00:04:05.820> is<00:04:06.150> fairly<00:04:06.720> fast<00:04:07.680> when<00:04:08.160> we<00:04:08.280> compare

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
seconds is fairly fast when we compare

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.870 
seconds is fairly fast when we compare
it<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.239> example<00:04:09.570> to<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.720> 88<00:04:10.109> l71<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.519> v<00:04:11.670> KP

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
it for example to the 88 l71 of the v KP

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.990 
it for example to the 88 l71 of the v KP
which<00:04:12.329> have<00:04:12.510> 2.7<00:04:13.290> seconds<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.850> gun

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
which have 2.7 seconds and the gun

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.979 
which have 2.7 seconds and the gun
diversion<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.780> minus<00:04:16.200> five<00:04:16.440> is<00:04:16.709> ok<00:04:17.780> we<00:04:18.780> don't

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
diversion with minus five is ok we don't

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.750 
diversion with minus five is ok we don't
need<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.289> forget<00:04:19.560> this<00:04:19.709> is<00:04:19.859> a<00:04:19.890> quite<00:04:20.160> huge<00:04:20.489> gun

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
need to forget this is a quite huge gun

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.560 
need to forget this is a quite huge gun
for<00:04:20.970> such<00:04:21.209> a<00:04:21.269> small<00:04:21.510> turret

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
for such a small turret

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.340 
for such a small turret
so<00:04:24.170> yeah<00:04:24.320> this<00:04:24.560> is<00:04:24.740> it<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:25.130> bt7<00:04:25.640> artillery<00:04:26.350> it

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
so yeah this is it the bt7 artillery it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.040 
so yeah this is it the bt7 artillery it
will<00:04:27.590> mostly<00:04:27.980> be<00:04:28.070> in<00:04:28.400> regular<00:04:29.090> premium<00:04:29.510> tank

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
will mostly be in regular premium tank
