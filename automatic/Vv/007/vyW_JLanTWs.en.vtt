00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
mean that says it's you know it works or

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.580 
mean that says it's you know it works or
it's<00:00:33.300> compatible<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.870> Xbox<00:00:34.380> Playstation

it's compatible with Xbox Playstation

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.869 
it's compatible with Xbox Playstation
and<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.540> however<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.500> mean<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.219> don't<00:00:38.370> see<00:00:38.550> how

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and we however I I mean I don't see how

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.060 
and we however I I mean I don't see how
I<00:00:38.910> wouldn't<00:00:39.450> be<00:00:39.540> compatible<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.260> anything<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I wouldn't be compatible with anything I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.410 
I wouldn't be compatible with anything I
mean<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.280> guess<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.460> covers<00:00:41.879> everything<00:00:42.090> but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
mean I guess that covers everything but

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.049 
mean I guess that covers everything but
I<00:00:43.320> mean<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> would<00:00:44.070> imagine<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.610> able<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> use<00:00:44.940> it

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
I mean I would imagine be able to use it

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.590 
I mean I would imagine be able to use it
on<00:00:45.180> your<00:00:45.270> PC<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.780> well<00:00:47.030> because<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.180> I

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
on your PC as well because it just I

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.180 
on your PC as well because it just I
mean<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.020> can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
mean as you can see it right there it's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.869 
mean as you can see it right there it's
a<00:00:50.640> little<00:00:51.600> strip<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.649> with<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> LED<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> so

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
a little strip and with the LED on it so

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.840 
a little strip and with the LED on it so
I<00:00:53.910> don't<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.300> why<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> would<00:00:54.719> use<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.079> PC

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
I don't know why you would use it on PC

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.340 
I don't know why you would use it on PC
but<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> mean<00:00:57.149> whatever<00:00:57.480> whatever<00:00:57.870> helps<00:00:58.289> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
but I mean whatever whatever helps you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.400 
but I mean whatever whatever helps you
get<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.739> advantage<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.309> guess<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> thing

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
get the advantage I guess is the thing

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.450 
get the advantage I guess is the thing

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
hundred percent sure why I believe it's

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.469 
hundred percent sure why I believe it's
just<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> make<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.850> accurate<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.240> don't

know
but<00:01:32.159> we're<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.579> go<00:01:32.790> ahead<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> uh<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
but we're gonna go ahead and uh take a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
but we're gonna go ahead and uh take a
look<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.860> looks<00:01:34.890> like<00:01:35.250> but<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> does

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
look at what it looks like but it does

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.140 
look at what it looks like but it does
say<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.869> does<00:01:37.049> have<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:38.150> eliminated

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

you know anything that's USB powered
which<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.030> pretty<00:04:32.240> awesome<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.940> means

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
which is pretty awesome because means

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.250 
which is pretty awesome because means
most<00:04:35.360> TVs<00:04:35.750> nowadays<00:04:36.229> have<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:37.190> USB<00:04:37.699> port<00:04:38.150> so<00:04:38.810> you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
most TVs nowadays have a USB port so you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:40.659 
most TVs nowadays have a USB port so you
don't<00:04:39.440> necessarily<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.979> to<00:04:40.100> rely<00:04:40.430> on<00:04:40.460> your

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
don't necessarily have to rely on your

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.480 
don't necessarily have to rely on your
system<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.330> you<00:04:41.600> know<00:04:41.690> plug<00:04:42.139> this<00:04:42.290> in<00:04:42.530> but<00:04:43.430> if

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
system to you know plug this in but if

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.890 
system to you know plug this in but if
you<00:04:43.610> wanted<00:04:43.850> to<00:04:44.000> I<00:04:44.030> mean<00:04:44.300> obviously<00:04:44.540> that

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
you wanted to I mean obviously that

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.650 
you wanted to I mean obviously that
would<00:04:45.169> be<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.440> ideal<00:04:45.919> location<00:04:47.350> go<00:04:48.350> ahead<00:04:48.500> and

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
would be the ideal location go ahead and

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.020 
would be the ideal location go ahead and
plug<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:51.010> because<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.160> is<00:04:52.280> obviously

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
plug that in because it is obviously

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.260 
plug that in because it is obviously
gonna<00:04:53.180> be<00:04:53.560> probably<00:04:54.560> closest<00:04:54.979> to<00:04:55.100> your<00:04:55.190> TV<00:04:55.370> not

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
gonna be probably closest to your TV not

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.029 
gonna be probably closest to your TV not
exactly<00:04:56.630> sure<00:04:56.840> on<00:04:56.870> how<00:04:56.990> everybody's<00:04:57.560> setup<00:04:57.860> is

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
exactly sure on how everybody's setup is

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:02.290 
exactly sure on how everybody's setup is
but<00:04:58.880> my<00:04:59.150> example<00:05:00.070> would<00:05:01.070> probably<00:05:01.520> be<00:05:01.699> it<00:05:01.850> so

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
but my example would probably be it so

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.560 
but my example would probably be it so
there<00:05:02.539> you<00:05:02.630> have<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:03.710> is<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.570> Hipshot

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
there you have it that is the Hipshot

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:07.990 
there you have it that is the Hipshot
dot<00:05:05.870> I'm<00:05:06.620> gonna<00:05:06.770> go<00:05:06.919> ahead<00:05:07.100> put<00:05:07.520> it<00:05:07.639> on<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.820> TV

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
dot I'm gonna go ahead put it on the TV

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.600 
dot I'm gonna go ahead put it on the TV
see<00:05:08.510> how<00:05:08.630> it<00:05:08.720> looks<00:05:08.960> and<00:05:09.229> we'll<00:05:09.740> be<00:05:09.949> back<00:05:10.130> so

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 
to get a honey badger here but basically

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:21.670 
to get a honey badger here but basically
you<00:05:19.099> just<00:05:19.130> want<00:05:19.310> to<00:05:19.520> aim<00:05:19.729> down<00:05:19.760> sights<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.810> went

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
you just want to aim down sights I went

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.360 
you just want to aim down sights I went
ahead<00:05:21.770> and<00:05:21.919> plugged<00:05:22.310> in<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:23.389> the<00:05:24.370> Hipshot

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
ahead and plugged in the the the Hipshot

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.960 
ahead and plugged in the the the Hipshot
dot<00:05:25.900> already<00:05:26.900> so<00:05:27.620> it's<00:05:27.770> gonna<00:05:27.950> light<00:05:28.250> up<00:05:28.280> as

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
dot already so it's gonna light up as

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.159 
dot already so it's gonna light up as
soon<00:05:29.419> as<00:05:29.570> you<00:05:29.630> do<00:05:30.590> it<00:05:30.740> it<00:05:30.889> lights<00:05:31.099> up<00:05:31.310> so

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
soon as you do it it lights up so

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.379 
soon as you do it it lights up so
aim-down-sights<00:05:33.169> get<00:05:34.010> this<00:05:34.220> right<00:05:34.550> at<00:05:35.240> the

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
aim-down-sights get this right at the

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.750 
aim-down-sights get this right at the
end<00:05:35.660> there<00:05:36.080> so<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.950> game<00:05:37.160> like<00:05:37.190> this<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:37.729> is

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
end there so with a game like this it is

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.740 
end there so with a game like this it is
kind<00:05:38.090> of<00:05:38.210> hard<00:05:38.560> to<00:05:39.560> do<00:05:40.250> this<00:05:40.460> just<00:05:40.970> because<00:05:41.419> are

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
kind of hard to do this just because are

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.360 
kind of hard to do this just because are
not<00:05:42.050> even<00:05:42.289> just<00:05:42.440> a<00:05:42.500> game<00:05:42.650> like<00:05:42.770> this<00:05:42.830> just<00:05:43.250> with

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
not even just a game like this just with

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.700 
not even just a game like this just with
any<00:05:43.580> game<00:05:43.940> at<00:05:44.300> least<00:05:44.479> nowadays<00:05:44.690> because<00:05:45.470> they

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
any game at least nowadays because they

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.560 
any game at least nowadays because they
do<00:05:45.770> have<00:05:46.190> that<00:05:47.169> swivel<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:49.580> little<00:05:50.419> more

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
do have that swivel so a little more

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.779 
do have that swivel so a little more
realism<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.500> I'm<00:05:52.160> gonna<00:05:52.280> go<00:05:52.460> ahead<00:05:52.550> and

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
realism to it I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.390 
realism to it I'm gonna go ahead and
slide<00:05:53.030> the<00:05:53.210> other<00:05:53.389> plus<00:05:53.870> ik<00:05:54.289> here<00:05:54.530> down<00:05:54.770> some

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
slide the other plus ik here down some

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.750 
slide the other plus ik here down some
and<00:05:55.639> just<00:05:56.229> attach<00:05:57.229> it<00:05:57.260> to<00:05:57.650> the<00:05:57.919> bottom<00:05:58.310> there

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
and just attach it to the bottom there

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.000 
and just attach it to the bottom there
so<00:05:59.440> you<00:06:00.440> do<00:06:00.590> have<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:00.919> wire<00:06:01.190> in<00:06:01.460> the<00:06:01.580> way<00:06:01.840> and

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
so you do have that wire in the way and

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.140 
so you do have that wire in the way and
sorry<00:06:04.010> for<00:06:04.099> the<00:06:04.310> lights<00:06:04.610> in<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.940> background

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
sorry for the lights in the background

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.640 
sorry for the lights in the background
there<00:06:05.860> but<00:06:06.860> essentially<00:06:07.780> that's<00:06:08.780> pretty<00:06:09.500> much

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
there but essentially that's pretty much

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.439 
there but essentially that's pretty much
it<00:06:09.889> right<00:06:09.919> there<00:06:10.280> so<00:06:10.669> in<00:06:11.060> the<00:06:11.539> event<00:06:11.630> of<00:06:12.110> a<00:06:13.449> EMP

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
it right there so in the event of a EMP

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.050 
it right there so in the event of a EMP
or<00:06:14.630> anything<00:06:14.840> like<00:06:15.080> that<00:06:15.110> that's<00:06:16.010> not<00:06:16.789> in<00:06:16.940> your

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:17.060 
or anything like that that's not in your

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.770 
or anything like that that's not in your
way<00:06:17.180> so<00:06:18.760> once<00:06:19.760> you<00:06:19.849> get<00:06:19.970> something<00:06:20.360> with<00:06:20.570> a

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
way so once you get something with a

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.630 
way so once you get something with a
with<00:06:21.169> a<00:06:21.199> red<00:06:21.470> dot<00:06:21.620> you'll<00:06:21.919> be<00:06:22.039> able<00:06:22.159> to<00:06:22.340> see<00:06:22.520> it

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
with a red dot you'll be able to see it

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.000 
with a red dot you'll be able to see it
a<00:06:22.760> little<00:06:22.909> clearer<00:06:23.770> unfortunately<00:06:24.770> I<00:06:24.800> think<00:06:24.830> I

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
a little clearer unfortunately I think I

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.440 
a little clearer unfortunately I think I
have<00:06:25.099> a<00:06:25.159> blue<00:06:25.340> dot<00:06:25.550> on<00:06:25.580> this<00:06:25.820> but<00:06:26.030> when<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.300> aim

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
have a blue dot on this but when you aim

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:27.250 
have a blue dot on this but when you aim
down<00:06:26.690> as

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
down as

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.650 
down as
you<00:06:27.290> can<00:06:27.440> see<00:06:27.650> it's<00:06:28.490> right<00:06:28.790> on<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:29.090> same<00:06:29.270> spot

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
you can see it's right on the same spot

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.650 
you can see it's right on the same spot
where<00:06:29.960> the<00:06:30.200> the<00:06:30.710> dot<00:06:30.920> should<00:06:31.160> be<00:06:31.540> other<00:06:32.540> than

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
where the the dot should be other than

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.630 
where the the dot should be other than
the<00:06:32.930> little<00:06:33.110> swivel<00:06:33.680> there<00:06:33.830> every<00:06:34.310> now<00:06:34.460> and

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
the little swivel there every now and

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.590 
the little swivel there every now and
then<00:06:34.810> but<00:06:36.430> at<00:06:37.430> least<00:06:37.550> you<00:06:37.670> get<00:06:37.790> a<00:06:37.850> general<00:06:38.300> idea

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:38.600 
then but at least you get a general idea

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.370 
then but at least you get a general idea
as<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.110> where<00:06:40.030> you<00:06:41.030> know<00:06:41.150> to<00:06:41.630> shoot<00:06:41.810> if<00:06:42.320> you

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
as to where you know to shoot if you

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.620 
as to where you know to shoot if you
didn't<00:06:42.800> have<00:06:42.890> a<00:06:42.950> red<00:06:43.160> dot<00:06:43.340> so<00:06:43.940> this<00:06:44.090> opens<00:06:44.420> up<00:06:44.510> a

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
didn't have a red dot so this opens up a

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.330 
didn't have a red dot so this opens up a
lot<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:44.810> possibilities<00:06:45.020> because<00:06:45.890> essentially

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.340 
lot of possibilities because essentially

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:48.820 
lot of possibilities because essentially
you<00:06:47.090> can<00:06:47.270> remove<00:06:47.600> the<00:06:47.900> red<00:06:48.080> dot<00:06:48.290> attachment

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
you can remove the red dot attachment

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.800 
you can remove the red dot attachment
completely<00:06:49.310> and<00:06:49.520> you'll<00:06:50.060> be<00:06:50.240> able<00:06:50.390> to<00:06:50.630> use

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
completely and you'll be able to use

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.530 
completely and you'll be able to use
another<00:06:51.760> attachment<00:06:52.760> there<00:06:53.150> on<00:06:53.270> your<00:06:53.360> weapon

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:53.540 
another attachment there on your weapon

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.110 
another attachment there on your weapon
so<00:06:54.410> you<00:06:54.440> do<00:06:54.740> have<00:06:54.950> a<00:06:54.980> bit<00:06:55.280> of<00:06:55.400> an<00:06:55.490> upper<00:06:55.700> hand<00:06:55.880> on

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
so you do have a bit of an upper hand on

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.600 
so you do have a bit of an upper hand on
that<00:06:56.240> end<00:06:56.590> but<00:06:57.590> we'll<00:06:57.740> go<00:06:57.830> ahead<00:06:57.920> and<00:06:58.040> test

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
that end but we'll go ahead and test

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.050 
that end but we'll go ahead and test
this<00:06:58.820> and<00:06:59.440> give<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:00.560> a<00:07:00.590> review<00:07:00.970> thanks<00:07:01.970> for

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.060
