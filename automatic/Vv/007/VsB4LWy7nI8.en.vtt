00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.170
 welcome to a dotcom teacher today 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.480
 let's find out what the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.360
 major differences between 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.360
 mitosis division and the meiosis division 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.039
 half is of the meiosis have 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.349
 very different biological meanings 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.790
 mitosis was the first type of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.090
 division that appeared on earth 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.780
 and it was made by bacteria and all kinds of 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:47.310
 very simple unicellular organisms 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 mitosis consists of a single division 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.780
 and creates clones in a way that is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.570
 linked with asexuality 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.360
 this was very useful at a time when the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.260
 that the earth makes millions of 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.020
 years was subject to conditions 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.520
 very hard as for example being 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.259
 subjected to continuous radiation from the sun 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.420
 including ultraviolet rays without 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.909
 have an ozone layer that the 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.030
 protect what it means that all the 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.470
 heat came directly we talked about 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.470
 thousands of degrees 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.729
 that amount of energy 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.560
 too much so that the kind of 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.189
 organisms that can survive are 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.439
 very very simple organisms with cycles 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.979
 of life quite short and that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.130
 reproduce very fast the mitosis was what 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.130
 best 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.570
 at the time when evolutionarily 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.390
 the plants appeared 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.510
 the first oxygen and cas plants that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.610
 they started to release oxygen and that 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.070
 little by little he came to generate the layer of 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.020
 ozone 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.080
 that today protects us from the rays 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.060
 solar 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.040
 that 's what produced is that in the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.020
 land at a time apart from that no longer 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.360
 rays came so energetic that 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.040
 it seemed that it was an oven or a 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.489
 Soup 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.090
 they also favored that 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.010
 different ecosystems different climates 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.830
 because by softening the conditions of 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.140
 lifetime 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 that allowed life to begin 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.120
 unfold with greater complexity no longer 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.760
 was subjected to so much pressure and not 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:36.180
 it was only a few individuals who 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.180
 could live there therefore in that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.180
 moment was not as important or better 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.670
 said so advantageous divide a lot and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.130
 fast but what was interesting was 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.980
 generate variability because having a 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.650
 greater stability that allowed different 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.920
 climates 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.170
 did not know the individuals that could 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.610
 happen in the next generation if the 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.790
 climate would be the same if the weather 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.939
 would change with which to create clones 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 she is a little more tricky in that 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:11.040
 sense meiosis is very interesting 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.290
 when it appears although it takes its time is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 more complex and requires more expense 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.400
 of investment by individuals 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.670
 it's a little history and meaning 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.670
 of why there are the two types 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.600
 at a purely division level they are 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:33.210
 mitosis is a division in it 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.100
 they distribute the chromatic sisters of a 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.760
 single chromosome 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.550
 as I said believe clones are cells 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.410
 identical daughters to the mother and that has 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.270
 what to do with asexuality 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.440
 here there is no sexuality none are very 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.410
 boring 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.230
 the genetic endowment of a 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.610
 cell is diploid the daughters are going to be 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.990
 diploids 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:04.270
 in all the cells of our body 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.270
 except sex cells 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:15.499
 the hair the eyes the nails the skin all 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.499
 that grows or regenerates by mitosis 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:24.350
 meiosis meiosis are two divisions 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.280
 one successive of the other in the first 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.639
 Division is divided chromosomes 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.400
 homologs 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.840
 if I have two chromosomes, not two 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.540
 chromatic two chromosomes and divide 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.760
 when the first division ends I have 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.820
 cells with the same genetic endowment 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.770
 that the mother if the mother was diploid the 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:50.310
 first division I get two daughters 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:53.280
 diploides is in the second division that 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.710
 they are distributed chromatic and of a cell 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.710
 diploid I get two to floyd is 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.849
 this division creates sex cells 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.360
 specifically the ovule and the 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:07.360
 spermatozoon 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:13.510
 also instead of maintaining the envelope 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.580
 genetics reduces it by half 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.540
 that is what forces the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:23.710
 individuals who have in their cycle of 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:26.410
 life the meiosis how it happened ' have to 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.320
 meet another individual to join 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:33.550
 your genes or your genomes and hence you can 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:36.280
 appear a new diploid individual 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:39.220
 as I said it only affects cells 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.790
 sexual or that my eyes do not 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.790
 meiosis 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.790
 and something that is specific is that 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.500
 there is genetic recombination that as I have 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.700
 said is one of the big points 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.860
 strengths of meiosis this generates me 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:57.110
 variability in offspring thing that 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.240
 I will never have mitosis since 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.910
 the only source of variability that 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.540
 they have the individuals that make mitosis 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.870
 is that they mute their DNA is because of an error in 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.970
 the copy they mutate because there are agents 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.289
 mutagens such as rays 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.569
 gamma that make them mutate 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.520
 or there are other types of sexuality that 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:21.699
 we are not going to see them in this video but if 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.889
 you will see it in other subsequent videos as well 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.649
 that mitosis itself what it does is 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:29.080
 clones and the meiosis individuals with a 

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:31.660
 genetic recombination and half of 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.370
 genetic endowment that the mother cell 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.860
 I hope that now you have more clear 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.810
 what are these differences and can you 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.520
 do the exercises that are in this 

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:43.170
 page to add that you have 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.170
 understood good study
