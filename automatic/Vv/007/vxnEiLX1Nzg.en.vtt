on it right there a little escapement
for<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.660> chips<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.380> crank<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.980> around

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
for the chips and you crank that around

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.030 
for the chips and you crank that around
a<00:03:58.610> dowel<00:03:59.000> say<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.960> cylinder<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.560> wood<00:04:00.860> and<00:04:00.980> it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
a dowel say a cylinder of wood and it

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.700 
a dowel say a cylinder of wood and it
will<00:04:01.160> cut<00:04:01.460> the<00:04:01.700> threads<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.330> so<00:04:02.510> taps<00:04:03.350> and

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
will cut the threads in it so taps and

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.430 
will cut the threads in it so taps and
screw<00:04:04.460> boxes<00:04:05.000> for<00:04:05.540> woods<00:04:05.780> let's<00:04:06.080> see<00:04:06.200> how<00:04:06.380> to

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
screw boxes for woods let's see how to

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.070 
screw boxes for woods let's see how to
do<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.680> like<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.130> said<00:04:07.340> you've<00:04:07.490> got<00:04:07.520> to<00:04:08.080> begin

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
do it like I said you've got to begin

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.800 
do it like I said you've got to begin
with<00:04:09.620> the<00:04:09.890> little<00:04:10.280> tap<00:04:10.820> and<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.120> have<00:04:11.300> one<00:04:11.540> here

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
with the little tap and I have one here

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.270 
with the little tap and I have one here
that<00:04:12.500> I<00:04:12.560> have<00:04:13.040> made<00:04:14.560> before<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:15.710> begin<00:04:16.070> on

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
that I have made before you begin on

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.670 
that I have made before you begin on
this<00:04:16.430> though<00:04:16.670> you<00:04:17.420> have<00:04:17.600> got<00:04:17.930> to<00:04:17.959> understand

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
this though you have got to understand

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.070 
this though you have got to understand
some<00:04:19.250> of<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.459> concepts<00:04:20.120> I<00:04:20.330> mean<00:04:20.660> this<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.810> real

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.080 
some of the concepts I mean this is real

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.570 
some of the concepts I mean this is real
complicated<00:04:21.410> let's<00:04:21.709> look<00:04:21.860> at<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.160> in<00:04:22.370> fact

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
complicated let's look at this in fact

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.830 
complicated let's look at this in fact
let's<00:04:22.760> look<00:04:22.850> at<00:04:23.000> how<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.150> whole<00:04:23.330> thing<00:04:23.540> works

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
let's look at how the whole thing works

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.490 
let's look at how the whole thing works
because<00:04:24.220> what<00:04:25.220> is<00:04:25.460> a<00:04:25.520> screw<00:04:26.270> what<00:04:26.780> is<00:04:26.960> a<00:04:26.990> screw

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
because what is a screw what is a screw

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.590 
because what is a screw what is a screw
it<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.800> an<00:04:27.980> inclined<00:04:28.670> plane<00:04:28.790> if<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.330> look<00:04:29.480> at

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
it is an inclined plane if you look at

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.780 
it is an inclined plane if you look at
this<00:04:29.690> you<00:04:29.750> can<00:04:29.930> see<00:04:30.200> the<00:04:30.380> slope<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:31.100> we<00:04:31.520> have

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
this you can see the slope that we have

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.150 
this you can see the slope that we have
here<00:04:31.940> and<00:04:32.120> just<00:04:32.390> as<00:04:32.540> if<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.780> had<00:04:33.020> to<00:04:33.260> remember

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
here and just as if you had to remember

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.920 
here and just as if you had to remember
the<00:04:34.250> old<00:04:34.340> illustrations<00:04:35.060> of<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.540> simple

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
the old illustrations of the simple

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.900 
the old illustrations of the simple
machines<00:04:36.320> you<00:04:36.560> have<00:04:36.770> trying<00:04:37.430> to<00:04:37.610> lift

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
machines you have trying to lift

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.630 
machines you have trying to lift
something<00:04:38.690> up<00:04:39.050> on<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.920> something<00:04:40.310> well<00:04:40.460> if<00:04:40.550> you

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
something up on to something well if you

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.170 
something up on to something well if you
have<00:04:40.880> a<00:04:40.910> slope<00:04:41.540> an<00:04:41.750> inclined<00:04:42.560> plane<00:04:43.180> you've

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
have a slope an inclined plane you've

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.000 
have a slope an inclined plane you've
added<00:04:44.540> a<00:04:44.720> little<00:04:44.960> distance<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:45.650> you've<00:04:45.830> made

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
added a little distance but you've made

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.980 
added a little distance but you've made
the<00:04:46.160> work<00:04:46.340> easier<00:04:46.850> you've<00:04:47.150> slid<00:04:47.600> it<00:04:47.720> up<00:04:47.840> the

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
the work easier you've slid it up the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.140 
the work easier you've slid it up the
slope<00:04:48.230> well<00:04:48.830> with<00:04:49.100> a<00:04:49.130> screw<00:04:49.580> what<00:04:49.970> you've<00:04:50.120> got

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
slope well with a screw what you've got

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.200 
slope well with a screw what you've got
is<00:04:50.360> an<00:04:50.690> inclined<00:04:51.260> plane<00:04:51.440> wrapped<00:04:52.340> around<00:04:52.550> a

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
is an inclined plane wrapped around a

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.870 
is an inclined plane wrapped around a
cylinder<00:04:53.450> so<00:04:54.410> you're<00:04:54.710> trading<00:04:55.070> distance<00:04:55.669> in

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
cylinder so you're trading distance in

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.670 
cylinder so you're trading distance in
other<00:04:56.000> words<00:04:56.210> you<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.600> move<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.140> six<00:04:57.440> feet

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
other words you to move the six feet

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.320 
other words you to move the six feet
length<00:04:57.950> of<00:04:58.160> this<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.700> have<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.940> turn<00:04:59.150> this

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
length of this you have to turn this

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:08.010 
length of this you have to turn this
thing<00:04:59.390> half<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.230> mile

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020
