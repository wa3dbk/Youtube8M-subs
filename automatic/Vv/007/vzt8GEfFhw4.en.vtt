trick when making bettors is not to

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.339 
trick when making bettors is not to

and<00:02:36.470> stirring<00:02:36.530> trying<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.159> get<00:02:37.310> all<00:02:37.489> of<00:02:37.579> those

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
and stirring trying to get all of those

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.580 
and stirring trying to get all of those
lumps<00:02:38.090> out<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.480> all<00:02:38.689> it<00:02:38.870> does<00:02:39.049> is<00:02:39.260> make<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.819 
problematic because they're not so right
just<00:02:55.819> do<00:02:56.060> one<00:02:56.389> nice<00:02:56.750> slice<00:02:57.170> down<00:02:57.439> the<00:02:57.620> middle

just do one nice slice down the middle
there<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.280> then<00:02:58.760> cut<00:02:59.030> them<00:02:59.180> into<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.569> shapes

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
there and then cut them into the shapes

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.649 
there and then cut them into the shapes
that<00:03:00.139> you're<00:03:00.319> after<00:03:01.180> these<00:03:02.180> nice<00:03:02.450> little
