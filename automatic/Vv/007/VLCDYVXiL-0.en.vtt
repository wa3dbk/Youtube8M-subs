00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
have an EVGA full size poster so you get

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.240 
have an EVGA full size poster so you get
a<00:01:15.310> pretty<00:01:15.520> cool<00:01:15.700> bundle<00:01:16.060> inside<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> box

alright so now it's time to look at the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.520 
alright so now it's time to look at the
EVGA<00:01:20.679> geforce<00:01:21.340> gtx<00:01:22.000> 680

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.560 

and<00:01:27.140> here<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.260> is<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> first

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and here it is so one of the first

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.940 
and here it is so one of the first
things<00:01:30.869> you'll<00:01:31.049> notice<00:01:31.080> about<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.560> card<00:01:31.830> is

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
things you'll notice about this card is

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
things you'll notice about this card is
it<00:01:32.070> uses<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.490> 6-pin<00:01:33.060> PCIe<00:01:33.659> power<00:01:34.020> connectors

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
it uses two 6-pin PCIe power connectors

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
it uses two 6-pin PCIe power connectors
that<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.890> because<00:01:35.190> this<00:01:35.369> card<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> extremely

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
that is because this card is extremely

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.180 
that is because this card is extremely
power<00:01:36.659> efficient<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> output

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
power efficient for the output

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.160 
power efficient for the output
connectors<00:01:38.549> we<00:01:38.670> have<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> standard<00:01:39.240> dvi-i<00:01:39.690> and

vsync does is it's a smarter type of

vsync does is it's a smarter type of

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
vertical sync that it turns off vsync

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.120 
vertical sync that it turns off vsync
when<00:04:19.750> your<00:04:19.959> frame<00:04:20.260> rate<00:04:20.289> is<00:04:20.650> below<00:04:20.890> your
