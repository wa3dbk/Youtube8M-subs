alternating layers of line back between

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.979 
alternating layers of line back between
them<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:08.789> way<00:02:09.149> they'll<00:02:09.660> line<00:02:09.959> up

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
them you know that way they'll line up

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.920 
them you know that way they'll line up
alright<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.739> they'll<00:02:11.459> cinch<00:02:11.819> down<00:02:11.879> real<00:02:12.330> good

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
alright and they'll cinch down real good

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
take the tag end of the powerpro and you

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.590 
take the tag end of the powerpro and you
put<00:02:21.460> it<00:02:21.550> through<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.820> loop<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.240> saved

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.230 
put it through the loop that you saved
earlier<00:02:24.990> when<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.020> snug<00:02:26.710> it<00:02:26.830> back<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.180> you

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
earlier when you snug it back and you

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.690 
earlier when you snug it back and you
pull<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:28.750> back<00:02:29.010> it's<00:02:30.010> important<00:02:30.460> when

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
pull it all back it's important when

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.740 
pull it all back it's important when
you're<00:02:30.820> pulling<00:02:31.000> knots<00:02:31.330> you<00:02:31.450> don't<00:02:31.570> want<00:02:31.690> us
