00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.859
 psv b1 hit last Saturday 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 Heerenveen an opponent where it 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.940
 earlier this season in friesland with a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.040
 played a draw and so are the 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.900
 men of jurgen dirkx somewhat 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.670
 warned he had something beautiful in it 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.980
 thoughts dani van der moot 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.730
 starter of course in the rush hour at psv 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.920
 b1 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 but his shot goes wide beside the goal 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.109
 of goalkeeper Peter Bos of the visitors 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.470
 but psv is the strongest in the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.420
 opening phase and this is leonard and partly 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.870
 wonderful shot outside on the right 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.920
 ball turns away from forest and in the u and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.100
 that's a light up 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.870
 Next b1 watch the shot again 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.809
 from when as a goalkeeper one step to 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.110
 the wrong side and then that ball will come in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.110
 the upper corner 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.260
 nice goal for daneels 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.360
 and a great start for the b1 heerenveen 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 you on the 8 ball jan loves the ball 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.680
 with a bit of luck the ball reaches the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.329
 number seven that makes sense 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.260
 this is a nice gudmundsson cross 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.810
 there comes preference can kardash 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.119
 but the striker van heerenveen does not hit 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.610
 goal but psv is warned because 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.010
 heerenveen is getting stronger and stronger 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.689
 well such a bounce with arjan this is 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.640
 an intelligent page press on gudmundsson 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 goalkeeper from and from single 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.540
 ball on the crossbar but there is michel 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:30.720
 flap and he provides a nice attack 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:33.659
 good page well you run the ball on the bar 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.729
 caresse looks at it and there is flap 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.619
 goal is completely empty and therefore the hit 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.640
 for heerenveen there it is again one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.310
 a 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 but psv takes the initiative back this 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.259
 is a great shot of rigo and what to do 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.170
 think of that rescue of forest aunt 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.880
 rivo beautiful swipe runs straight 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.680
 to the corner flag because he is the man who 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.409
 the king goes rapper iroh and there it stands 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 cables right back by occupation nods 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.200
 here that beam rock hard behind goalkeeper 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.820
 forest and so psv leads again 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.939
 for that you go as a defender to 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.729
 forward and he does is good cause 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.940
 good for dream and psv here again 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.940
 head Start 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.260
 and psv wants more because this is still happening 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.790
 before halftime martijn third the action of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.880
 mountains is good you'd 3 with the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.160
 violation and referee takes such a time 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 Spirit PSV a free kick on a beautiful 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.940
 position 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.980
 the necessary specialists at psv dani van 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.290
 der moot is to one of shot is hard 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 rescue is good from bosch fred than with 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.250
 the for them and then very unhappy for 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.830
 who defend roast len of 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.230
 he Heerenveen with his own hitting and 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.540
 three one for psv 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.350
 luck for psv accident for eastern and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.980
 but at a nice moment the three one 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.510
 for the home team 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.840
 and that still plays a part 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.850
 easier caresse with the long ball 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.940
 berden puts his body well here 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.590
 meanwhile , daneels 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.680
 room light on the outside at dani 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.450
 Van der Moot with the goal 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.060
 the answer is no, because that ball ends up 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.970
 on the bar so what the rest still much 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.560
 could be nicer for psv b1 though 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.420
 it will stay with those three one for now 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.160
 intermediate position 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.380
 in the second half here three with one 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.620
 unfortunate header back on postal and 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.540
 which must pull over to the emergency brake 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.430
 training on the moat only one yellow 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.190
 card for the defender of heerenveen 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.730
 and another free kick for PSV on one 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.190
 nice position this time sam lammers 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.080
 ball turns the goalkeeper after the far corner 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.900
 forest had a good view of a whip 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.760
 that ball out symbolizes a beautiful moment 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.320
 a special moment this not sole and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.660
 Neil thought that treasure of the field but 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.790
 the man who comes in knows arrow back 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.440
 already injured himself after a serious injury 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.060
 in the supercup competition 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.340
 against at the start of the season 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.350
 feyenoord broke his leg but now so 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.120
 in the meantime, get the chance for this 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.640
 heerenveen and the goal but appearance 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.100
 the sect in between disapproves 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.480
 here that free kick from navarro then 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.190
 a violation is made on 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.130
 carts and so do not pass this hit 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:13.050
 but psv still needs to be there 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.370
 keep track in that final phase because 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.160
 heerenveen goes looking for the 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.660
 hit and there will be opportunities 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.579
 for the ron team not properties here 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.370
 the cross and fire on 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.759
 own pole no chance full of ox but 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.650
 PSV is released with a fright 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:29.879
 remains three and one in the 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.740
 final phase 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:34.169
 just before time another chance for the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.449
 visitors who is for goal scorer 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.750
 michel vlad but he hits the legs of 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:42.060
 janiek van os and so psv books a handsome one 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.199
 earned and also much needed victory 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.550
 heerenveen 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.469
 because if we look at the position then 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.509
 we see that psv and ajax in the 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.280
 chase are on feyenoord the 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.000
 rotterdammers achieved 38 so far 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.300
 points 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.050
 PSV and Ajax were behind with 32 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.050
 from 15
