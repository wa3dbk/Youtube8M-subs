or<00:00:09.519> I'm<00:00:09.910> here<00:00:10.120> in<00:00:10.210> gold<00:00:10.480> fields<00:00:10.930> with<00:00:11.110> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.140 

ten<00:00:15.509> by<00:00:15.690> five<00:00:15.990> coil<00:00:19.460> just<00:00:20.460> gave<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.849> bit<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ten by five coil just gave it a bit of a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.470 
ten by five coil just gave it a bit of a
run<00:00:21.359> here<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.349> diggings<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.360> to

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
run here on some diggings and just to

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.080 
run here on some diggings and just to
sort<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.020> tweak<00:00:25.829> the<00:00:26.009> mode<00:00:26.189> up<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.579> see<00:00:26.939> what

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
sort of tweak the mode up and see what

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.810 
sort of tweak the mode up and see what
runs<00:00:27.329> best<00:00:28.400> basically<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.939> relic<00:00:30.210> mode

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
runs best basically in in the relic mode

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.150 
runs best basically in in the relic mode
in<00:00:33.080> audio<00:00:34.080> long<00:00:34.519> and<00:00:35.629> I've<00:00:36.629> got<00:00:36.870> fast<00:00:37.410> off<00:00:37.650> and

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
in audio long and I've got fast off and

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.509 
in audio long and I've got fast off and
deep<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:40.610> it's<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.850> manual<00:00:42.329> sensitivity

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
deep on and it's in manual sensitivity

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.439 
deep on and it's in manual sensitivity
now<00:00:44.519> of<00:00:44.820> eighteen<00:00:46.640> because<00:00:47.640> air<00:00:47.940> testing<00:00:48.329> with

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
now of eighteen because air testing with

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.069 
now of eighteen because air testing with
Otto's<00:00:49.160> not<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.460> telling<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.820> much<00:00:51.079> so

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
Otto's not really telling you much so

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.099 
Otto's not really telling you much so
what<00:00:52.199> I've<00:00:52.289> got<00:00:55.309> got<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> point<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.109> grammar

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
what I've got got a point for grammar

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:14.240 
what I've got got a point for grammar
and<00:00:58.789> a<00:00:59.789> three<00:01:00.570> point<00:01:00.809> six<00:01:01.079> grammar<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:04.199> tests

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.160 

all<00:01:15.250> right<00:01:15.400> so<00:01:15.640> we'll<00:01:15.760> do<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.630> point<00:01:16.900> for

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
all right so we'll do the the point for

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:43.800 
all right so we'll do the the point for
grammar<00:01:42.000> it's<00:01:43.000> about<00:01:43.240> five<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.720> half

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
grammar it's about five and a half

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:59.660 
grammar it's about five and a half
centimeters

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.050 

all<00:02:00.670> right<00:02:00.970> now<00:02:01.090> we'll<00:02:01.300> do<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:02.850> three<00:02:03.850> point

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
all right now we'll do the three point

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:47.020 
all right now we'll do the three point
six<00:02:04.270> grammar

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.390 

so<00:02:48.030> there<00:02:48.210> you<00:02:48.240> go<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:50.930> ah<00:02:51.930> just<00:02:52.530> passed<00:02:52.950> 11

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
so there you go just ah just passed 11

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.220 
so there you go just ah just passed 11
centimeters<00:02:55.310> so<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.580> ridiculous<00:02:57.420> dips<00:02:57.660> but

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
centimeters so not ridiculous dips but

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.690 
centimeters so not ridiculous dips but
it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.470> coin<00:02:58.740> machine<00:02:58.890> primarily<00:03:00.770> but<00:03:01.770> in

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
it is a coin machine primarily but in

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.840 
it is a coin machine primarily but in
the<00:03:02.850> high<00:03:02.970> trashy<00:03:03.270> areas<00:03:04.400> this<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.520> any<00:03:05.700> gold

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
the high trashy areas this is any gold

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.960 
the high trashy areas this is any gold
day<00:03:07.370> you're<00:03:08.370> gonna<00:03:08.430> pick<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.700> up<00:03:10.640> no<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.670> thought

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
day you're gonna pick it up no I thought

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:25.990 
day you're gonna pick it up no I thought
it<00:03:12.030> was<00:03:12.180> interesting<00:03:14.840> catch<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.960> next<00:03:16.050> time

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.060 

you
