no<00:01:52.170> reason<00:01:52.380> as<00:01:52.710> shady<00:01:53.220> McCoy<00:01:53.610> gets<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
no reason as shady McCoy gets the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
no reason as shady McCoy gets the
touchdown<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.020> helps<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.380> so<00:01:55.409> we

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
touchdown there and it helps out so we

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.740 
touchdown there and it helps out so we
go<00:01:55.799> 14<00:01:56.340> nothing<00:01:56.520> on<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.939> heels<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.299> deep<00:01:57.540> and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
go 14 nothing on the heels or deep and

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.539 
go 14 nothing on the heels or deep and
so<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> little<00:01:58.049> bit<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> luck<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:58.979> Calvin
