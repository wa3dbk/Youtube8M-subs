00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:07.470
 Gentlemen, good night, this video is not going to work. 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.639
 appear on my face will appear 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 only the casio sgw watch dial 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:28.980
 400 and how I promised that teaching is 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 calibrate both the barometer and 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.040
 thermometer is how much also the altimeter 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.930
 I'm regulated right now 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:46.020
 including taking the notation for after 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.010
 deregulate the regular again ah how I 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:56.969
 I was just the way I was. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:04.820
 let's go to regulate the altimeter I come 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:07.890
 here where it jumps and entered the altimeter 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.260
 wait a little bit ready in training to the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 time is scoring 810 meters 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:21.110
 altitude above sea level and is 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.110
 checking here 24 ° né 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.270
 there is a variant against the thermometer 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 which marks May 24 and maybe a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.450
 variant costs but let's go there 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.259
 So 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.729
 so I set the altimeter well 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.750
 here in the tuning wait a little and already 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.540
 it is 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.479
 everything is cleared it will now appear 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:50.720
 the altimeter will appear is blinking 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.720
 I'll take the 810 meter note 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:02.039
 right and now I come here oh mute or 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:07.500
 up or down 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:09.569
 O 110 hundred up the very low 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.459
 from above go down 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.459
 Ok, let's go then 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.480
 I come here again I put in the 810 meters 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:34.019
 put us 810 I come here in the right way 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:36.450
 and I change right here I do not do anything alone 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.290
 Only in the barometer do you later 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.010
 The timer function can be done later. 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.400
 adjust 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.329
 so the temperature is ready 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.329
 I hit 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.069
 I come here back in fashion back to the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.069
 time position 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.980
 22/12 I'm in the function the time here 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.459
 so I come here again it comes in the mood 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.010
 now on this side on the way and I go high 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:17.519
 and subway should a little bit then it's the sea 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:20.549
 as here marking 922 barzon minutes 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:24.209
 pascal as you want to call ne 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.639
 I prefer to talk minibar time marking 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:35.010
 now at 123 thousand and bar so I come here 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:38.910
 again and I hope it's gone, it's all gone 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.410
 flashing the ready temperature 24.4 degrees 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:48.620
 so if I want to raise the temperature 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:51.870
 I come here indeed is downloaded and again 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:59.030
 in the same way as under the 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.030
 next week down 24.4 same 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.180
 24.4 ok now I come here it comes in the mold and 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.000
 I'm going fishing 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:14.209
 so here the barometer barometer is 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.209
 flashing middle and 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:32.840
 and I was marking the 920 Easter season 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:32.840
 lamy neighborhoods né 922 I'm not in error 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:40.200
 I already lost because I did not write, you see. 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.300
 So when you go and do what I do 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.780
 to do is to take the note soon otherwise 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.820
 the guy loses loses because that way I am 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.210
 narrow looks from here towel looking at 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.590
 then it gets a little complicated today. 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:59.610
 to thank you because a young man had the sound 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.280
 jovaldo was on pt and today I explain 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:07.020
 how to calibrate here 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:13.910
 the altimeter and the barometer and the thermometer 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:16.140
 the case is ready for the cw 400 here 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.479
 back to normal 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:23.220
 ready, right back to normal before 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.810
 I meant to talk to 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:31.140
 you the following the altitude marking 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.410
 and she society every five meters 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.539
 Okay then whenever a one fails yes 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:39.270
 metal 5 meters 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.220
 yes for more and for less 3 for more 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:48.919
 or so more or less so, right? 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:48.919
 Okay, so gentlemen, thank you and survive.
