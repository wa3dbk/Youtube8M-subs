blue<00:02:27.230> right<00:02:28.010> but<00:02:28.370> that<00:02:28.700> really<00:02:28.880> wasn't<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
blue right but that really wasn't the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.020 
blue right but that really wasn't the
case<00:02:29.569> right<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:29.989> went<00:02:30.260> online<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.730> Miller<00:02:31.730> had

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
case right I went online and Miller had

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.910 
case right I went online and Miller had
basically<00:02:32.480> everything<00:02:33.080> spect<00:02:33.440> out<00:02:33.650> so<00:02:33.890> I

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
basically everything spect out so I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.339 
basically everything spect out so I
could<00:02:34.160> see<00:02:34.430> which<00:02:35.300> welder<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:35.720> needed<00:02:36.170> but<00:02:36.290> more

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349

cars the auto set feature allowed me to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.670 
cars the auto set feature allowed me to
pretty<00:02:47.569> much<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.840> turn<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.110> dial<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.650> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
pretty much as turn a dial to the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.830 
pretty much as turn a dial to the
thickness<00:02:49.100> of<00:02:49.220> steel<00:02:49.489> i<00:02:49.519> was<00:02:49.790> using<00:02:49.940> so<00:02:50.690> my

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
thickness of steel i was using so my

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.259 
thickness of steel i was using so my
roll<00:02:51.019> cage<00:02:51.290> material<00:02:51.830> was<00:02:51.980> 120<00:02:52.610> wall<00:02:52.760> or<00:02:52.970> 18

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
roll cage material was 120 wall or 18

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.509 
roll cage material was 120 wall or 18
steel<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.560> was<00:02:54.680> able<00:02:54.830> to<00:02:54.950> just<00:02:55.069> turn<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
steel and I was able to just turn the

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.570 
steel and I was able to just turn the
dial<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.790> 18<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.769> pull<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.860> trigger<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.459> it

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
dial to 18 and pull the trigger and it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.920 
dial to 18 and pull the trigger and it
became<00:02:58.819> I<00:02:59.090> don't<00:02:59.239> want<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> say<00:02:59.480> it<00:02:59.540> was<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.690> glue

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
became I don't want to say it was a glue

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.660 
became I don't want to say it was a glue
gun<00:03:00.140> but<00:03:00.410> it<00:03:00.470> was<00:03:00.590> basically<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:01.010> glue<00:03:01.250> gun<00:03:01.400> for

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
gun but it was basically a glue gun for

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.850 
gun but it was basically a glue gun for
steel<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.120> became<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:02.930> much<00:03:02.959> easier<00:03:03.349> than

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
steel it became so much easier than

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.360 
steel it became so much easier than
anything<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.310> had<00:03:04.400> ever<00:03:04.580> tried<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.150> weld
