though I know that's gonna happen but
you<00:03:32.500> know<00:03:32.620> it's<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.610> it's<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.269> small<00:03:34.510> player<00:03:34.750> base

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
you know it's I it's a small player base

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.500 
you know it's I it's a small player base
but<00:03:35.830> that<00:03:36.010> has<00:03:36.190> its<00:03:36.340> positives<00:03:36.880> and<00:03:37.060> negatives

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
but that has its positives and negatives

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.930 
but that has its positives and negatives
it<00:03:37.690> really<00:03:37.959> does<00:03:38.140> because<00:03:38.650> one<00:03:39.310> positive<00:03:39.820> of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
it really does because one positive of

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.940 
it really does because one positive of
having<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.390> small<00:03:40.600> player<00:03:40.810> base<00:03:41.050> is<00:03:41.320> that<00:03:41.830> the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
having a small player base is that the

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.080 
having a small player base is that the
connections<00:03:42.400> all<00:03:42.549> the<00:03:42.670> way<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.940> are

connections all the way you are

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.570 
connections all the way you are
oftentimes<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.810> lot<00:03:43.959> better<00:03:44.170> because<00:03:44.830> you<00:03:45.489> know

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
oftentimes a lot better because you know

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.220 
oftentimes a lot better because you know
we<00:03:45.700> don't<00:03:45.820> have<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.120> deal<00:03:46.269> with<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.660> overload
