with the guy and he's going to step away

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
from the guy and see if the guy follows

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.930 
from the guy and see if the guy follows
him<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.080> that<00:01:47.380> kind<00:01:47.680> of<00:01:47.740> points<00:01:48.070> out<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.490> yes

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
him and that kind of points out that yes

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.450 
him and that kind of points out that yes
this<00:01:49.150> guy<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.450> at<00:01:50.080> least<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.530> some<00:01:50.740> rapport<00:01:51.130> and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
this guy is at least in some rapport and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.380 
this guy is at least in some rapport and
he's<00:01:51.670> Derren<00:01:52.600> Brown<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.900> able<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.229> lead<00:01:53.500> him<00:01:53.800> I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
he's Derren Brown is able to lead him I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.000 
he's Derren Brown is able to lead him I
suspect<00:01:55.390> if<00:01:55.479> he<00:01:55.540> didn't<00:01:55.869> have<00:01:56.110> that<00:01:56.170> if<00:01:56.800> that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
suspect if he didn't have that if that

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.500 
suspect if he didn't have that if that
test<00:01:57.220> wasn't<00:01:57.460> successful<00:01:58.090> when<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.300> stepped

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
test wasn't successful when I stepped

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.359 
test wasn't successful when I stepped
away<00:01:58.600> having<00:01:58.930> him<00:01:59.080> follow<00:01:59.830> that<00:02:00.190> he'd

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
away having him follow that he'd

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.820 
away having him follow that he'd
probably<00:02:00.580> would<00:02:00.790> have<00:02:00.880> not<00:02:01.210> tried<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:01.990> this

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
probably would have not tried this this

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.430 
probably would have not tried this this
a<00:02:02.860> trick<00:02:03.640> on<00:02:03.790> him<00:02:03.910> anyway<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.140> let's<00:02:05.259> continue

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
a trick on him anyway so let's continue

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.900 
a trick on him anyway so let's continue
it<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.830> this<00:02:08.979> isn't<00:02:09.160> pointing<00:02:09.640> where<00:02:09.820> he's

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
it so this isn't pointing where he's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.229 
it so this isn't pointing where he's
mirroring<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:11.910> steps<00:02:12.910> away<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> guy<00:02:15.970> does

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
mirroring I steps away and the guy does

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.800 
mirroring I steps away and the guy does
follow<00:02:18.000> there's<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> there<00:02:19.420> was<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.540> little

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
follow there's a there was a little

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.090 
follow there's a there was a little
statement<00:02:19.989> there<00:02:20.230> he<00:02:20.380> says<00:02:20.560> you're<00:02:20.769> you're

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
statement there he says you're you're

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.890 
statement there he says you're you're
you're<00:02:21.610> happy<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:22.030> give<00:02:22.450> me<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.660> that's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
you're happy to give me this that's

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.920 
you're happy to give me this that's
obviously<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.530> suggestion<00:02:24.600> for<00:02:25.600> what's<00:02:25.780> going

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
obviously a suggestion for what's going

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380 
obviously a suggestion for what's going
to<00:02:25.989> come<00:02:26.140> later<00:02:26.410> as<00:02:26.739> well<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.850> also<00:02:28.000> helps

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
to come later as well it also helps

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.740 
to come later as well it also helps
build<00:02:28.720> rapport

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.780 

okay<00:02:35.750> right<00:02:36.380> here<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.740> probably<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.610> key

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
okay right here is probably the key

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.960 
okay right here is probably the key
thing<00:02:38.030> once<00:02:38.270> he's<00:02:38.480> built<00:02:39.320> a<00:02:39.410> little<00:02:39.530> rapport

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
thing once he's built a little rapport

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.230 
thing once he's built a little rapport
he<00:02:40.970> has<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.180> guy<00:02:41.420> following<00:02:41.870> him<00:02:42.580> he<00:02:43.580> does

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
he has the guy following him he does

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.140 
he has the guy following him he does
what's<00:02:44.450> called<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.660> pattern<00:02:45.080> break<00:02:45.460> where<00:02:46.460> he

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
what's called a pattern break where he

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.670 
what's called a pattern break where he
sticks<00:02:47.810> out<00:02:47.930> his<00:02:47.990> hand<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.350> get<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.560> guy<00:02:48.650> to

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
sticks out his hand to get the guy to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.140 
sticks out his hand to get the guy to
shake<00:02:48.920> his<00:02:49.040> hand<00:02:49.220> although<00:02:49.490> there's<00:02:49.760> not<00:02:49.910> a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
shake his hand although there's not a

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.740 
shake his hand although there's not a
whole<00:02:50.480> lot<00:02:50.630> of<00:02:50.690> reason<00:02:51.050> for<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:52.600> what<00:02:53.600> he

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
whole lot of reason for that and what he

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.780 
whole lot of reason for that and what he
does<00:02:53.990> if<00:02:54.140> you<00:02:54.230> watch<00:02:54.470> is<00:02:54.800> he<00:02:55.010> interrupts<00:02:55.730> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
does if you watch is he interrupts a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.750 
does if you watch is he interrupts a
handshake<00:02:56.270> he'll<00:02:57.200> actually<00:02:57.590> take<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.520> man's

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
handshake he'll actually take the man's

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.270 
handshake he'll actually take the man's
hand<00:02:59.150> and<00:02:59.540> instead<00:03:00.140> of<00:03:00.170> shaking<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.770> he'll<00:03:00.980> put

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
hand and instead of shaking it he'll put

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.490 
hand and instead of shaking it he'll put
it<00:03:01.310> in<00:03:01.520> his<00:03:02.030> left<00:03:02.240> hand<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.600> hold<00:03:02.900> it<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:06.320> now

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
it in his left hand and hold it so now

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.230 
it in his left hand and hold it so now
he's<00:03:06.680> holding<00:03:07.070> his<00:03:07.100> left<00:03:07.310> hand<00:03:07.550> so<00:03:07.730> he's<00:03:07.880> he's

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
he's holding his left hand so he's he's

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.290 
he's holding his left hand so he's he's
aborted<00:03:08.870> this<00:03:09.050> handshake<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:09.740> mid<00:03:10.730> handshake

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
aborted this handshake in mid handshake

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.460 
aborted this handshake in mid handshake
and<00:03:11.450> a<00:03:12.320> handshake<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.220> typically<00:03:13.640> a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and a handshake is typically a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.940 
and a handshake is typically a
unconscious<00:03:17.260> unconscious<00:03:18.260> thing<00:03:18.710> that<00:03:18.860> you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
unconscious unconscious thing that you

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.320 
unconscious unconscious thing that you
do<00:03:19.100> you<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.520> without<00:03:19.730> thinking<00:03:20.090> about<00:03:20.180> it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
do you just do without thinking about it

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.660 
do you just do without thinking about it
your<00:03:20.900> subconscious<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.590> doing<00:03:21.830> it<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
your subconscious is doing it and a

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.060 
your subconscious is doing it and a
pattern<00:03:22.940> break<00:03:23.360> is<00:03:23.630> where<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.530> take<00:03:24.740> someone

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
pattern break is where you take someone

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.580 
pattern break is where you take someone
that's<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.400> an<00:03:25.580> unconscious<00:03:26.180> pattern<00:03:26.810> and<00:03:26.990> you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
that's in an unconscious pattern and you

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.040 
that's in an unconscious pattern and you
break<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.550> and<00:03:28.640> then<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.120> subconscious<00:03:29.840> gets

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
break it and then the subconscious gets

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.160 
break it and then the subconscious gets
confused<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:31.120> it<00:03:32.120> looks<00:03:32.420> within<00:03:32.840> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
confused and it looks within the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.770 
confused and it looks within the
person's<00:03:33.560> subconscious<00:03:33.710> starts<00:03:34.250> looking<00:03:34.700> for

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
person's subconscious starts looking for

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.540 
person's subconscious starts looking for
you<00:03:35.780> know<00:03:35.870> what<00:03:36.050> do<00:03:36.110> I<00:03:36.170> do<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.830> so<00:03:37.250> he's<00:03:37.430> in

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:37.550 
you know what do I do and so he's in

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.970 
you know what do I do and so he's in
kind<00:03:37.850> of<00:03:38.000> confused<00:03:38.510> state<00:03:38.780> where<00:03:39.110> this<00:03:39.740> is

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
kind of confused state where this is

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.500 
kind of confused state where this is
essentially<00:03:40.430> a<00:03:40.490> trance<00:03:40.790> state<00:03:41.090> it's<00:03:41.270> a<00:03:41.330> very

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
essentially a trance state it's a very

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.290 
essentially a trance state it's a very
very<00:03:41.690> brief<00:03:41.870> very<00:03:42.200> short<00:03:42.680> but<00:03:43.670> if<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.150> can

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
very brief very short but if you can

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.840 
very brief very short but if you can
take<00:03:44.450> advantage<00:03:44.570> of<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.050> here<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:46.430> can<00:03:46.610> start

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
take advantage of it here you can start

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.490 
take advantage of it here you can start
giving<00:03:47.240> him<00:03:47.330> suggestions<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:48.020> can<00:03:48.170> see<00:03:48.380> it's

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
giving him suggestions you can see it's

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.990 
giving him suggestions you can see it's
right<00:03:48.709> here<00:03:48.920> after<00:03:49.220> he's<00:03:49.340> done<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.610> handshake

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
right here after he's done the handshake

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.550 
right here after he's done the handshake
interrupt<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:51.170> he<00:03:51.770> begins<00:03:52.840> giving<00:03:53.840> him<00:03:54.020> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
interrupt that he begins giving him the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.830 
interrupt that he begins giving him the
suggestions<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.640> have<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.300> man<00:03:56.450> hand<00:03:56.690> over

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
suggestions to have the man hand over

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.340 
suggestions to have the man hand over
its<00:03:56.990> possessions<00:03:58.270> also<00:03:59.270> he<00:03:59.480> he<00:03:59.930> hands<00:04:00.140> him<00:04:00.290> a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
its possessions also he he hands him a

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.390 
its possessions also he he hands him a
bottle<00:04:00.730> which<00:04:01.730> i<00:04:02.300> think<00:04:02.600> is<00:04:02.930> a<00:04:03.230> an<00:04:03.560> anchor

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
bottle which i think is a an anchor

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.570 
bottle which i think is a an anchor
where<00:04:05.270> he's<00:04:05.590> put<00:04:06.590> the<00:04:06.680> man<00:04:06.830> in<00:04:06.860> a<00:04:07.010> trance<00:04:07.310> state

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
where he's put the man in a trance state

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.390 
where he's put the man in a trance state
by<00:04:07.790> aborting<00:04:08.270> the<00:04:08.360> handshake<00:04:08.780> he's<00:04:09.560> anchoring

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
by aborting the handshake he's anchoring

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.490 
by aborting the handshake he's anchoring
this<00:04:10.820> trance<00:04:11.209> state<00:04:11.540> by<00:04:11.990> giving<00:04:12.290> him<00:04:12.350> this

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
this trance state by giving him this

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.199 
this trance state by giving him this
bottle<00:04:12.920> it<00:04:13.010> also<00:04:13.310> probably<00:04:13.550> helps<00:04:13.790> distract

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
bottle it also probably helps distract

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.780 
bottle it also probably helps distract
him<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.480> confuse<00:04:14.870> him<00:04:15.220> and<00:04:16.220> later<00:04:16.520> in<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
him and confuse him and later in the

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.990 
him and confuse him and later in the
video<00:04:16.910> where<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.810> see<00:04:18.049> him<00:04:18.290> again<00:04:18.820> trick<00:04:19.820> the

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
video where you see him again trick the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.940 
video where you see him again trick the
man<00:04:20.209> he<00:04:20.870> doesn't<00:04:21.169> go<00:04:21.260> through<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> handshake

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
man he doesn't go through the handshake

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.140 
man he doesn't go through the handshake

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
the man back in a trance state that's

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.190 
the man back in a trance state that's
the<00:04:27.650> point<00:04:27.860> of<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.250> anchors<00:04:28.640> so<00:04:29.450> let's<00:04:30.020> uh

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
the point of the anchors so let's uh

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.470 
the point of the anchors so let's uh
let's<00:04:30.620> watch<00:04:31.250> him<00:04:31.430> finish<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.820> handshake

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
let's watch him finish the handshake

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.020 
let's watch him finish the handshake
interrupt<00:04:32.840> here

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.749 

so<00:04:39.030> now<00:04:39.150> Manson<00:04:39.570> trance<00:04:39.810> state<00:04:40.310> and<00:04:41.310> he's<00:04:41.610> just

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
so now Manson trance state and he's just

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.219 
so now Manson trance state and he's just
giving<00:04:42.090> them<00:04:42.150> suggestions<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:42.870> know<00:04:42.930> give<00:04:43.169> me
