00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.470
 tutorial on your rock that will stick to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.060
 make a shell on the top of the cake 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.560
 captain america we will use this 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 american pasta 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.619
 We are, yes, royal blue. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:32.250
 a dye in gel and we will also go 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 to wear after American ready red 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 give like this red paste of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 reaching the color then you will activate 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.590
 the fat in this paste 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.579
 in that part of your hand that the 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 hot 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.390

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 rings 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.280
 they are called as right measure 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.110
 proportion of a leveling of the slurry 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.370
 so there's not going to be a part that goes 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.230
 to be more open to another than not 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 will not have a good bid then this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.240
 it makes our work very easy to open 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.229
 a couple of times even plastic you go 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.890
 turning the folder is that we will do 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.930
 We're going to use this cutter, okay? 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 metal listener that's the number 3 already 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.729
 folder is open and has already 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 several as we open here we do not 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.880
 we want you to rezek right then you go 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.340
 to place between two plastics the tops 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.250
 that we will not use for now 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.710
 so you already come here close with 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.290
 Plastic Leave no place to people 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.909
 details of the dark you already came here from 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.500
 mark with a cutter there you come with 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.009
 mixture and then you have enough 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.689
