00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
like it's just like tapping it on like

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.160 
like it's just like tapping it on like
your<00:01:50.399> finger<00:01:50.790> would<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.540> finger<00:01:51.960> would

and<00:01:52.500> although<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.250> doesn't<00:01:53.430> have<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> warmth

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and although it doesn't have the warmth

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.780

everything out and it's a brush so it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.709 
everything out and it's a brush so it
works<00:01:59.189> even<00:01:59.399> better<00:01:59.579> than<00:01:59.880> using<00:02:00.180> your<00:02:00.420> finger

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
