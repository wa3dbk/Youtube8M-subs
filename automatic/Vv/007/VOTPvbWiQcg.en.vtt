00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.890
 the president the pp that the government beto in mind man is a government 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.339
 legitimate 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.749
 there is also the ziona government 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.749
 venezuela that seems legitimate 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.239
 the government coup 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.239
 if granted a constitutional succession 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.420
 Spain orbit 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.720
 the 21 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.090
 which means that the people did not choose it 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.970
 that is to say 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.310
 of course 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.360
 in Argentina 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.750
 because the thesis of the employer's constitutional succession to people does not understand this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 term but it is inside the house 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.020
 I think it's legitimate 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.930
 yes because democracy is supporting freedom and free expression that 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.180
 we have to attack 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.180
 last week the holidays 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.960
 again to love 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.560
 if it is legitimate 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 there were free elections 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 the good thing is that the whole town turned to vote 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520
 nobody can coerce 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.370
 it was by own will 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.600
 good to the victim because he had not spoken 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.150
 seven stops 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.150
 because it was militarized 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.479
 we go to article 20 of the constitution 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.400
 Article 139 of Pontevedra 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.970
 according to the constitution of the republic and article 2 39 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.840
 he speaks very clearly 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.380
 the new one 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.780
 have problems the president who was 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.420
 I would have to take possession 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.030
 the president of the congress that in which now of that 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.180
 President 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.250
 that we understand to open 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670
 it is illegitimate 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.950
 contribute is a constitutional government we do not pass on in the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.469
 constitution of the republic 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.139
 to elect our authorities all our authorities are elected by 

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.189
 a citizen 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.229
 and that a product of a coup d'etat are not 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.229
 legitimate because nobody chose them 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:28.659
 the legitimate de facto 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:33.459
 as palliative because 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.009
 must think 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.399
 the playable demo of northern Italy 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:38.789
 the one who lived 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.489
 vettel that we have three 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.489
 and this ad can see 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.489
 despite the fact that the current government is efficient and transparent
