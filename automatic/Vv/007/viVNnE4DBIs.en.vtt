00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
a little muscle showing here I didn't

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.940 
a little muscle showing here I didn't
get<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.849> front<00:03:22.090> yet<00:03:22.269> but<00:03:22.659> shows<00:03:23.409> her<00:03:23.590> muscle

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
get the front yet but shows her muscle

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.890 
get the front yet but shows her muscle
pretty<00:03:24.159> good<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:25.000> I'm<00:03:25.269> going<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.599> blend

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
pretty good and this I'm going to blend

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.990 
pretty good and this I'm going to blend
in<00:03:26.170> more<00:03:26.409> with<00:03:26.470> my<00:03:26.830> thinners<00:03:27.220> when<00:03:27.489> I<00:03:27.549> get<00:03:27.760> done

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
in more with my thinners when I get done

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.530 
in more with my thinners when I get done
so<00:03:28.480> it<00:03:29.080> won't<00:03:29.319> be<00:03:29.650> as<00:03:29.920> dramatic<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.970> change

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
so it won't be as dramatic of a change

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
so it won't be as dramatic of a change
in<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.610> leaps<00:03:33.610> approach<00:03:36.659> gonna<00:03:37.659> meet<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.319> up<00:03:38.440> a

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
in the leaps approach gonna meet it up a

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.170 
in the leaps approach gonna meet it up a
little<00:03:38.680> bit<00:03:38.860> no<00:03:39.129> matter<00:03:39.310> where<00:03:39.610> just<00:03:39.849> in<00:03:39.970> here
