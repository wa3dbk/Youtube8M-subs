00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 how did you remove seal or drill the sink 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.460
 bathroom to set the tour 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.260
 at the request of the colleague there the fÃ¡bio roberto 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.269
 came back showing a quick step by step 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.800
 How to remove this stamp is this stack of 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.859
 and what are you buying at a party? 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.340
 this is a very expensive piece and it's 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.029
 how to do this drilling there. 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.130
 shows you how to do is step by step 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.250
 a very simple and fast way 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.930
 let's go step by step then the head that the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 model I'm using here at home 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.320
 what more traditional model is your 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390
 The difference is that I saw it was square 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.899
 then you realize that you have the option of 23 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.780
 of lacalle in seal bar you put 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.210
 there the the planet will not choose the place 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.469
 is as necessary are here 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.390
 he ignores the month 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.600
 I love working these two here on the side. 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.280
 so opt for it from here to receive it 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
 It has about five cents of that 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.460
 door to door to the center of the seal 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 then you will ask it here too 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.180
 careful to support you in a cloth one receives 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:21.659
 that dry impact inhibit support dinho 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.070
 who is now going to do the marking so a 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.509
 Tatiana and you'll see that more or less. 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.820
 have a sense of where the center is 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.009
 from that top but if you prefer you can 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.619
 use that little pen and see what it was 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.110
 hot edge of the process 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.790
 of your pleasure can use that hand 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.079
 said in our region where 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.079
 stands the center of it 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.720
 By now there is this part do 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.580
 hole you will use a pointer here 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.030
 pointed object 11 nail will not give 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:58.320
 right not tried that the total prize 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:02.620
 161 pointer will do goes there 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.560
 I do not think the drill would 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.330
 very sure is not here centralize 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:12.730
 linked to a maximum until then short 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.730
 you find the center of that seal 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.010
 then he will remember here from the side with 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.320
 very careful and those blows 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:27.820
 violent and nilson armas gatti had to 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:29.590
 light and short here I already started 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.780
 I advise you not to do this 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.920
 never do that will happen if 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.040
 do here 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.050
 on the other side, there's a rhombus there you see 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.000
 that the enamel was damaged because of 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:46.030
 from the opposite combat then it is always 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.750
 good hitting that surface at the bottom of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.040
 sea too with partner contain the same 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.500
 do not hit the hammer can be too 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.650
 dangerous are cutting neither from the 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.890
 that half-handmade service but is 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.070
 much more guaranteed then it must have 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.820
 a more or less future you can 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.970
 use and the nozzle gives you pliers and 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.540
 removing those ones from the side 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 precision tongue and then the power 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.209
 she remembers right the beauty will have 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.880
 that leave the team so the old 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:27.160
 see what I did here in her life that is 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:31.120
