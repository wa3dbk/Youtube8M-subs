00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.410
 good of two come to a new video 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.899
 well you know that I speak a little bit ago 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
 of the precision releases 4 the 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.130
 notes that had taken vital and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 Well today it's time to talk a little about 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.360
 Xbox raid one and is being 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.280
 the first notes and it seems that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.830
 good in every rule it seems that it is 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.230
 disappointing many websites I 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.640
 really because the games always there 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.240
 to try them you can never trust 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.160
 the pages and talio 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.720
 is what I usually say is not what happened 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.890
 with ninja gaiden 3 for example I saw some 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.689
 fucking notes and then the game I 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.890
 liked I have not seen another game they see with 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.110
 fucking notes and then the games I 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.480
 they have always liked to try them 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.710
 but in this case it seems that all 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.900
 coincide in the same with others that 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.400
 they all agree on exactly the same 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.320
 it's because something is behind 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.450
 one of the things that everyone we 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.940
 we expected in the new generation is 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.680
 that came out in the scary games but 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.870
 like graphics is not one of the things 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.390
 what matters most to people and what 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.220
 what seems to be happening 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.950
 games with graphics with graphics 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.810
 excellent but games that really 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.229
 then do not go in the size 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.930
 today we are going to talk a little metacritic 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.460
 and to know metacritic that is a page 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.200
 that basically then make the average of 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.420
 all the notes that you have given all 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.240
 the pages with which is not a page 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.850
 Note that directly and is a 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.100
 sort of comparator of notes and such 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.549
 let's talk for now for the best 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.470
 valued that is force 5 has an 82 of 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.570
 100 quite recommended the truth 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.090
 force is a driving game of no 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.460
 You know I think it goes without 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.920
 repeat it and it's a great simulator for me 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.170
 I like it a lot and it's probably one 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.000
 of the games that I would buy out in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.780
 xbox one would probably be one of 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.899
 they 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.530
 to have fun and such of 3 in 3 578 of 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.689
 100 game also that how good that 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.619
 supers and many many 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.899
 developers good many 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.039
 developers many analysts 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.679
 exactly many things coincide 

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.090
 How good is the game? 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.759
 but sometimes being able to tire can reach 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.250
 be repetitive and such in the case of rise 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.890
 which it is what I want more focus is 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.260
 a little bit more extensive has a 61 of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.599
 100 a note then skimming the approved 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.640
 literally it 's a game that nobody 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.209
 I was hoping he's going to have the notes so 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.430
 low 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.700
 coming from where it comes looking like 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.230
 he saw microsoft giving him so much publicity and 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.549
 well it seems that almost every 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.390
 analysis coincide in the same 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:30.890
 totally incredible graphics but 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.110
 It seems that the game is very, very 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.780
 linear was very repetitive the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 combats are also very repetitive 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.290
 quick time events are also very 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.310
 repetitive the quick time events are 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.409
 basically when they put you to 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.079
 delivered this button or give the other that 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.500
 in the demo then in the e3 demo 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.989
 we could see that they abounded but at levels 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.720
 too exaggerated and this seems like 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.139
 be that makes the game repetitive 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.599
 and that you end up getting tired at 23 o'clock 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.040
 of the game play it seems that the 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.440
 History is not nothing special 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.440
 according to what is said and the truth 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.680
 an exception to reading that kind of thing 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 the truth because to take advantage of the power 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.190
 of the next generation console 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.230
 take advantage of the pull of the one of a 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.700
 launch of a console and such and not 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.099
 make a game in conditions I think 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.019
 a bit already cagarruta no we do not have 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:25.019
 no next generation game that 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.760
 really, well , let's talk 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.140
 we do not have any or that is no game 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.140
 next generation being caldas 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.930
 there is no game they are saying 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.549
 fuck is that it's amazing does not stay not 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.900
 I know how much you want lynch ting yeah that 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.989
 it seems that it is giving good 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.700
 notes in normal is a fighting game that 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.780
 come back after a long time free to 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.680
 play over it is a fucking good game 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:52.019
 really but so games like that first 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.480
 hand we do not have anything 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.159
 spectacular there's nothing you say 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.069
 fuck me everything buys this console for 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.359
 this great game there is nothing by heaven 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.669
 you can not buy the console let's go 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.650
 better pressure 4 by 15 and such by 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.849
 done in the multiplayer game 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.400
 you had fun hanging out with your friends 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.079
 and such but at the end of the day it is not 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.639
 really then what what are you going to 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:14.669
 wait for a game of 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:18.150
 next generation that can encompass 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.489
 much more not from graphics and the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.440
 age is one is a whore is a bitch 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.300
 which is how I say how disappointed 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.030
 rather that we have a start of 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.030
 generation like that I did not expect it but 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.330
 absolutely for nothing age wishing 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.220
 and wishing and waiting with much desire 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.110
 you do not imagine 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 the metal gear solid 5 the truth I believe 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.500
 which is one of the games that go to 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.600
 mark the difference of the brand a 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.890
 before and after and I really want 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.510
 that it comes out already metal gear solid 5 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.660
 because he's one of the ones I 'm most waiting for 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.710
 now the next generation the others 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.690
 logically I have many, many, many 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.450
 want to try those in fact upload some 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.490
 that another video very probably both 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.960
 of equipment which I will try as a price 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.280
 they are four 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.169
 and I really want to 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.060
 play it but they are taking away the desire 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.220
 with all the notes and analyzes that 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.099
 I'm reading and collecting information and 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.349
 such because it is a little scandalous then 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.419
 and from there the people will then take 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.460
 your own perspectives 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.160
 They will be their own analysis of what they 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.419
 it seems from each game but for now 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.460
 what there is for the part of the 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.380
 analysts 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.770
 rise is a game for now pretty 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.990
 mediocre not that brushes the approved and little 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.720
 more so well let's see what it is 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.340
 what just happens with all this 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.460
 if you have thought to buy the rise 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.900
 first they watch many videos and such I 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.849
 lara my recommendation you like the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.830
 Driving games is strength 5 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.650
 the game that I see best of 3 interest 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.810
 It's also very fun but rise 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.570
 because it seems to be repetitive and such 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.880
 and I do not know the same, it does not end up hooking 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.270
 to dress at 60 or 70 euros to the whore 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.130
 good garbage nothing more kids here 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.780
 I leave in the description also by all 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.130
 the analyzes and if you want to read read the 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.930
 hit game the metacritic page 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:04.300
 where they all meet and if you want to read 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.740
 so check them out 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.180
 nothing bad about it so good nothing 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.259
 more kids this true of nothing else in 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.259
 the next video will be presented
