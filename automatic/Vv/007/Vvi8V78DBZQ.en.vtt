much<00:01:56.009> about<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.759> if<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.270> had<00:01:57.450> said<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
much about this game if I had said that

the when I was commentating then

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.500 
the when I was commentating then
I'm<00:02:02.100> pretty<00:02:02.460> sure<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> stream<00:02:03.090> chat<00:02:03.330> would

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
I'm pretty sure the stream chat would

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.290 
I'm pretty sure the stream chat would
have<00:02:03.600> blown<00:02:03.870> me<00:02:04.140> out<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.300> not

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
have blown me out of the water and not

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.260 
have blown me out of the water and not
in<00:02:06.480> the<00:02:06.510> good<00:02:06.660> way<00:02:07.100> so<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> would<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.820> might<00:02:09.240> be

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
in the good way so I would be might be

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.969 
in the good way so I would be might be

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.009 
you can make some valid points on that
subject<00:04:16.940> but<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.049> can't<00:04:18.320> make<00:04:18.620> any<00:04:18.889> points

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019
