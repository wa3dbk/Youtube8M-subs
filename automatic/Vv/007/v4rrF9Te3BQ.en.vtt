00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.059
 in today's video what we're going to do 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:07.639
 is to transform three long jeans into 

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:10.580
 three shorts of different shapes I've 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:13.900
 took advantage of clothes and fabrics that he had in the 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.900
 wardrobe and he did not use 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.770
 first of all let's transform 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.809
 these jeans 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:41.800
 It had been a long time since I 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:44.739
 put to turn them into shorts 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.629
 with checkered fabric at the bottom and 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.629
 in the lapels of the pockets 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.519
 secondly these pants 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.230
 cowboys claritos 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.769
 in only with the bottom part with 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.769
 tiptoes 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:13.730
 and finally these jeans 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:19.180
 long dark we are going to transform them 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.180
 in us shorts with bright cloth 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.600
 these are the three shorts you can click 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.020
 in the cowboy that you want to see the 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.020
 tutorial 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:40.969
 let's see the first model and cut 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:44.240
 the pants as far as you want and 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:46.479
 in this case I have used as a fabric a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.250
 checkered shirt that I did not wear 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.289
 you can use any fabric or even 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.189
 keep you have to cut all 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.709
 current rectangles with the length 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.689
 of the circumference of each leg and in 

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:01.340
 this case the silvano on the part of 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.819
 back to know where I want to 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.819
 do what 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.170
 is double twice 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.590
 and then later we sew 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.510
 ah 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.439
 and nothing 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.359
 and more 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:54.209
 also in this case you have to take advantage 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.959
 the pockets of the shirt to put them 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.959
 in the part d 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.910
 and will put the pockets 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.660
 this is how they are ahead 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.640
 we cut the cowboy 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.300
 yes 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:39.830
 and we string it so that the edge is 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.830
 sharper and we also win the lace 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.349
 to then have everything ready to sew 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.920
 in a way that is the letter of 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:54.030
 sewn a point back and this is the 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 result all montero 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:06.209
 let's see the model is called double 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:12.390
 we cut the game by the extent that in 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:15.150
 this case we fold it out to 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.109
 this cowboy in used of the magazine of 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.569
 a shirt that we do not put on 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.590
 and has cut on the surface of the 

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:23.889
 pockets 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.889
 zero 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.889
 as a result 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.300
 they are the only thing we have to do is 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.300
 put it 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.610
 of course 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.260
 for the front we're going to do 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.780
 a window as if he is going to want 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.280
 write something 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:03.110
 where we want it to go 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.110
 and we make three cuts 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.419
 in this case it's just about 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.919
 remove the blue threads to stay 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.270
 with white threads and take a 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.270
 broken appearance 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.449
 in this way 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.190
 we do the same with the piece that we 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.160
 remains 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.560
 and that's how it is, we also add 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.920
 some beads from a bracelet that I got 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.920
 broke 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:42.420
 in the broken part what I have put is a 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.920
 fabric from the inside of it 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.920
 way that the pockets 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.010
 and fabric've stuck with glue 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.430
 for you or you can even use the ink 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.740
 double- sided and at the end you added 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.430
 logical this is the result ahead 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.320
 and behind these have been the three 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.850
 models I hope you liked it and I 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.850
 tell what was your favorite 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.570
 and gasman also wanted to go out in the 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.570
 videos 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.860
 yes
