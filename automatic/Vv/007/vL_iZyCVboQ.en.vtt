following<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.200> figure-eight<00:00:07.589> knot<00:00:07.760> is<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
following the figure-eight knot is a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.700 
following the figure-eight knot is a
figure<00:00:09.210> eight<00:00:09.360> follow<00:00:09.540> through<00:00:09.719> for<00:00:10.620> this

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
figure eight follow through for this

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.249 
figure eight follow through for this
you're<00:00:10.920> gonna<00:00:11.040> need<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.280> lot<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:11.639> rope<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.259> we're

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
you're gonna need a lot of rope so we're

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.709 
you're gonna need a lot of rope so we're
gonna<00:00:13.349> start<00:00:13.590> right<00:00:13.710> here<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> middle

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
gonna start right here in the middle

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.580 
gonna start right here in the middle
we're<00:00:15.719> gonna<00:00:15.870> do<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> figure<00:00:16.410> eight<00:00:16.560> knot

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
we're gonna do the figure eight knot

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.260 
we're gonna do the figure eight knot
just<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.699> did<00:00:19.340> figure<00:00:20.340> eight<00:00:20.609> we're

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
just as we just did figure eight we're

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.660 
just as we just did figure eight we're
left<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> long<00:00:21.779> tail<00:00:22.279> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.430> mainly

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
left with a long tail this is mainly

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.420 
left with a long tail this is mainly
used<00:00:24.029> for<00:00:24.470> rock<00:00:25.470> climbing<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.039> other<00:00:26.130> rescue

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
used for rock climbing and other rescue

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.830 
used for rock climbing and other rescue
situations<00:00:26.970> where<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.180> need<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> loop<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
situations where you need a loop to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.500 
situations where you need a loop to
connect<00:00:28.140> something<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:29.000> so<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.269> case

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
connect something to and so in this case

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.290 
connect something to and so in this case
we<00:00:31.199> were<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:32.070> this<00:00:32.340> as<00:00:32.610> an

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
we were going to use this as an

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.940 
we were going to use this as an
improvised<00:00:33.660> harness<00:00:33.870> say<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> harness

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
improvised harness say this is a harness

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.830 
improvised harness say this is a harness
attachment<00:00:35.550> we're<00:00:36.239> gonna<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.480> through<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
attachment we're gonna go through the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.100 
attachment we're gonna go through the
harness<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> figure<00:00:39.629> eight<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:39.899> just

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
harness and the figure eight we just

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.190 
harness and the figure eight we just
made<00:00:40.520> with<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> strand<00:00:42.180> we're<00:00:42.780> gonna<00:00:42.899> follow

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
made with this strand we're gonna follow

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.369 
made with this strand we're gonna follow
with<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.860> end<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:45.030> strand<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.200> means

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
with the end this strand so that means

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.540 
with the end this strand so that means
we're<00:00:46.500> gonna<00:00:46.590> follow<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.980> through<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> hole

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
we're gonna follow it through the hole

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
we're gonna follow it through the hole
we're<00:00:50.550> gonna<00:00:50.670> go<00:00:50.910> back<00:00:51.809> around<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:54.440> okay

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
we're gonna go back around this way okay

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.930 
we're gonna go back around this way okay
we're<00:00:55.649> still<00:00:55.829> following<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> same<00:00:56.520> strand

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
we're still following the same strand

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.990 
we're still following the same strand
we're<00:00:57.360> gonna<00:00:57.449> go<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:58.020> there<00:01:01.609> this<00:01:02.609> strand

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
we're gonna go down there this strand

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.050 
we're gonna go down there this strand
here<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.750> follow<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> around

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
here up so we're gonna follow it around

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.300 
here up so we're gonna follow it around
we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> follow<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:07.020> there

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.410 

this<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.520> called<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.820> figure<00:01:12.000> eight<00:01:12.240> follow

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
this is called the figure eight follow

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.410 
this is called the figure eight follow
through<00:01:15.890> as<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.040> can<00:01:17.189> see<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:18.000> makes<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.270> loop

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
through as you can see it makes a loop

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.359 
through as you can see it makes a loop
there<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.840> loop<00:01:18.990> there<00:01:19.229> when<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.159> know

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
there and a loop there when you know

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330 
there and a loop there when you know
it's<00:01:20.549> done<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.509> has<00:01:21.750> two<00:01:22.080> strands<00:01:22.470> two

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's done right it has two strands two

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.320 
it's done right it has two strands two
strands<00:01:23.880> two<00:01:24.570> strands<00:01:25.170> two<00:01:25.890> strands<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.580> it

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
strands two strands two strands and it

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.899 
strands two strands two strands and it
comes<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:27.659> with<00:01:27.720> two<00:01:27.930> strands<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.729> thing

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
comes out with two strands the one thing

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
comes out with two strands the one thing
I<00:01:30.030> would<00:01:30.150> suggest<00:01:30.240> with<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> knot<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.770> tail

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I would suggest with this knot the tail

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
I would suggest with this knot the tail
on<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> end<00:01:32.670> this<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.270> piece<00:01:33.509> here<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
on this end this little piece here is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.190 
on this end this little piece here is
too<00:01:34.170> short<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:35.780> unfortunately<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.930> knot<00:01:37.170> is

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
too short so unfortunately this knot is

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.469 
too short so unfortunately this knot is
a<00:01:37.710> little<00:01:38.070> bit<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> pain<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.579> actually<00:01:39.090> undo

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
a little bit of a pain to actually undo

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.100 
a little bit of a pain to actually undo
to<00:01:40.439> make<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.770> longer<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:42.509> only<00:01:42.750> way<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> do

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
to make that longer the only way to do

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
to make that longer the only way to do
that<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.040> start<00:01:44.310> your<00:01:44.399> figure

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
that really is to start your figure

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
that really is to start your figure
eight<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.479> more<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> rope<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.890> so

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
eight up more on the rope like here so

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.780 
eight up more on the rope like here so
let<00:01:47.850> me<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:47.970> do<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.329> again<00:01:48.810> real<00:01:49.079> quick<00:01:49.790> we've

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
let me just do it again real quick we've

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
let me just do it again real quick we've
got<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> figure<00:01:51.329> eight

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
got a figure eight

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.950 
got a figure eight
like<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.360> we're<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> pretend<00:01:54.840> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
like that we're going to pretend that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:03.250 
like that we're going to pretend that
this<00:01:55.050> is<00:01:55.500> our<00:01:57.740> harness<00:01:59.390> go<00:02:00.390> through<00:02:00.900> there

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.600 

there<00:02:04.260> we're<00:02:04.560> following<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:05.010> same<00:02:05.220> rope<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
there we're following that same rope the

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
there we're following that same rope the
whole<00:02:05.760> time<00:02:05.970> actually<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:07.170> what<00:02:07.320> makes

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
whole time actually that's what makes

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.620 
whole time actually that's what makes
this<00:02:07.740> not<00:02:08.660> easy<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:10.020> do<00:02:10.200> easy<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:11.009> learn<00:02:11.630> I'll

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
this not easy to do easy to learn I'll

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.180 
this not easy to do easy to learn I'll
show<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.870> another<00:02:13.050> way<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.709> not<00:02:13.890> just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
show you another way to do this not just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.030 
show you another way to do this not just
a<00:02:14.550> minute<00:02:17.000> well<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.240> stood<00:02:18.840> up<00:02:18.900> huh<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.620> knew<00:02:20.010> I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
a minute well I stood up huh I knew I

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.370 
a minute well I stood up huh I knew I
messed<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.370> up<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.670> wasn't<00:02:20.850> following<00:02:21.150> it

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
messed it up so it wasn't following it

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.590 
messed it up so it wasn't following it
okay<00:02:22.380> that's<00:02:22.830> over<00:02:22.950> there<00:02:23.220> okay<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.450> that's

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
okay that's over there okay so that's

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.449 
okay that's over there okay so that's
figure<00:02:24.900> eight<00:02:25.050> we<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.200> two<00:02:25.590> strands<00:02:25.920> two<00:02:26.190> two

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
figure eight we have two strands two two

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.660 
figure eight we have two strands two two
two<00:02:26.730> and<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.690> nice<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:27.870> neat<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:28.530> not<00:02:28.709> over

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
two and it's nice and neat it's not over

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.540 
two and it's nice and neat it's not over
tangled<00:02:30.090> okay<00:02:31.050> and<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.950> it's<00:02:32.100> not<00:02:32.250> alone

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
tangled okay and just it's not alone

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.340 
tangled okay and just it's not alone
with<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.000> long<00:02:33.209> enough<00:02:33.420> tail<00:02:33.600> should<00:02:34.080> be<00:02:34.260> able

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
with a long enough tail should be able

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.160 
with a long enough tail should be able
to<00:02:34.440> hold<00:02:34.620> most<00:02:35.430> loads<00:02:35.900> body<00:02:36.900> weight

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to hold most loads body weight

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.680 
to hold most loads body weight
especially<00:02:37.380> that's<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.010> it's<00:02:38.130> made<00:02:38.220> for<00:02:38.690> but

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
especially that's what it's made for but

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.449 
especially that's what it's made for but
just<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.170> case<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.590> end<00:02:40.860> strand<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.310> long

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
just in case this end strand is long

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.729 
just in case this end strand is long
enough<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.820> time<00:02:41.880> or<00:02:42.510> we<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.380> do<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
enough this time or we can do a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.120 
enough this time or we can do a
fisherman's<00:02:44.430> knot<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.630> is<00:02:45.780> simply

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
fisherman's knot and that is simply

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.540 
fisherman's knot and that is simply
going<00:02:47.130> around<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:49.100> and<00:02:50.100> then<00:02:50.280> going

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
going around like this and then going

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.140 
going around like this and then going
through<00:02:52.040> what<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.220> does<00:02:53.459> is<00:02:53.640> it<00:02:53.730> creates<00:02:53.850> a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
through what that does is it creates a

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.090 
through what that does is it creates a
knot<00:02:55.160> pull<00:02:56.160> tight<00:02:57.110> it<00:02:58.110> creates<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.500> knot<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:58.739> if

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
knot pull tight it creates a knot so if

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.800 
knot pull tight it creates a knot so if
this<00:02:59.250> were<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.519> slip<00:02:59.730> down<00:03:00.030> somehow<00:03:01.280> like<00:03:02.280> that

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
this were to slip down somehow like that

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.210 
this were to slip down somehow like that
it's<00:03:03.810> not<00:03:04.049> gonna<00:03:04.200> have<00:03:04.380> enough<00:03:04.590> room<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.860> go<00:03:05.130> in

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
it's not gonna have enough room to go in

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.759 
it's not gonna have enough room to go in
the<00:03:05.310> figure<00:03:05.549> eight<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.200> again<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.440> this

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
the figure eight and again as this

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.610 
the figure eight and again as this
tightens<00:03:08.250> as<00:03:08.430> more<00:03:08.579> pressure<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.060> put<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.299> this

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
tightens as more pressure is put on this

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.900 
tightens as more pressure is put on this
figure<00:03:10.620> eight<00:03:10.829> now<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.100> actually<00:03:11.400> tightens<00:03:11.760> up

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
figure eight now it actually tightens up

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.810 
figure eight now it actually tightens up
the<00:03:13.010> larger<00:03:14.010> day<00:03:14.130> I'm<00:03:14.250> gonna<00:03:14.370> rope<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.760> you

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
the larger day I'm gonna rope that you

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.400 
the larger day I'm gonna rope that you
use<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.420> easier<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.930> get<00:03:16.110> them<00:03:16.230> done

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
use the easier it is to get them done

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.310 
use the easier it is to get them done
and<00:03:16.709> this<00:03:17.519> fisherman's<00:03:17.970> knot<00:03:18.120> here<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:19.110> just

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
and this fisherman's knot here it just

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.800 
and this fisherman's knot here it just
stops<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> from<00:03:19.739> going<00:03:19.860> down<00:03:20.190> that<00:03:20.220> way<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.810> it

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
stops it from going down that way and it

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.020 
stops it from going down that way and it
also<00:03:21.930> keeps<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.040> rest<00:03:23.250> of<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> cord<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
also keeps the the rest of the cord the

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.060 
also keeps the the rest of the cord the
rest<00:03:24.209> of<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.420> Rope<00:03:24.600> here<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.440> manageable

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
rest of the Rope here just manageable

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
rest of the Rope here just manageable
and<00:03:26.190> not<00:03:26.280> just<00:03:26.430> hanging<00:03:26.700> all<00:03:26.790> over<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:27.030> place

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
and not just hanging all over the place

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.630 
and not just hanging all over the place
and<00:03:27.600> that<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.410> how<00:03:28.530> we<00:03:28.560> tie<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.920> figure<00:03:29.489> eight

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
and that is how we tie the figure eight

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:43.590 
and that is how we tie the figure eight
follow<00:03:29.820> through<00:03:29.970> on

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.660
