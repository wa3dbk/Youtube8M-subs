night we've got the running started off

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.529 
night we've got the running started off
a<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.220> bit<00:00:20.340> rough<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:20.760> Andre<00:00:21.090> cleaned<00:00:21.390> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
a little bit rough but Andre cleaned it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.200 
a little bit rough but Andre cleaned it
up<00:00:21.630> straightaway<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.910> sort<00:00:24.090> of

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
up straightaway and I was sort of

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.880 
up straightaway and I was sort of
nervously<00:00:24.630> checking<00:00:25.050> over<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> fluids

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
nervously checking over all the fluids

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
nervously checking over all the fluids
making<00:00:26.250> sure<00:00:26.460> everything<00:00:26.820> was<00:00:26.970> fine<00:00:27.410> it<00:00:28.410> was

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
making sure everything was fine it was

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.620 
making sure everything was fine it was
good<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.130> could<00:00:29.400> sort<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.210> test<00:00:30.420> out

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
good because we could sort of test out

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.940 
good because we could sort of test out
the<00:00:30.810> power<00:00:31.019> steering<00:00:32.630> circuit<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.200> also<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the power steering circuit and also the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130 
the power steering circuit and also the
alternator<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.059> those<00:00:36.239> things<00:00:36.480> are<00:00:36.690> sort<00:00:36.960> of

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
alternator so those things are sort of

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.810 
alternator so those things are sort of
questions<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.129> mind<00:00:38.190> before<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.700> start

finished so today I said about making
some<00:03:00.819> some<00:03:01.269> final<00:03:01.750> chicks<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:02.950> ECU<00:03:03.640> one<00:03:04.090> of

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
some some final chicks on the ECU one of

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.479 
some some final chicks on the ECU one of
the<00:03:04.269> main<00:03:04.450> things<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.870> wanted<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.319> get<00:03:05.530> 100%

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
the main things I wanted to get 100%

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.430 
the main things I wanted to get 100%
dialed<00:03:07.120> in<00:03:07.209> before<00:03:07.569> we<00:03:07.690> went<00:03:07.840> anywhere<00:03:08.230> near

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
dialed in before we went anywhere near

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.650 
dialed in before we went anywhere near
the<00:03:08.560> dyno<00:03:08.829> was<00:03:09.519> making<00:03:09.819> sure<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.180> triggering

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the dyno was making sure the triggering

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.140 
the dyno was making sure the triggering
was<00:03:10.840> correct<00:03:11.260> in<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.530> ECU<00:03:12.150> Nigel's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
was correct in the ECU Nigel's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.690 
was correct in the ECU Nigel's
fabricated<00:03:13.959> a<00:03:14.049> really<00:03:14.470> nice<00:03:14.709> custom<00:03:15.459> trigger

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
fabricated a really nice custom trigger

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.000 
fabricated a really nice custom trigger
setup<00:03:16.150> for<00:03:16.540> is<00:03:16.629> this<00:03:16.810> our<00:03:16.989> 20<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:17.680> he's<00:03:17.799> got<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
setup for is this our 20 so he's got a

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.430 
setup for is this our 20 so he's got a
24<00:03:18.639> tooth<00:03:18.910> trigger<00:03:19.419> wheel<00:03:19.660> on<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.079> crankshaft

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
24 tooth trigger wheel on the crankshaft

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.670 
24 tooth trigger wheel on the crankshaft
and<00:03:20.829> he's<00:03:21.400> got<00:03:21.549> a<00:03:21.579> single<00:03:22.150> sent<00:03:22.630> tooth<00:03:22.959> up<00:03:23.349> on

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
and he's got a single sent tooth up on

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.190 
and he's got a single sent tooth up on
one<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:24.040> camshafts<00:03:24.609> I<00:03:25.030> really<00:03:25.900> needed<00:03:26.079> to

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
one of the camshafts I really needed to

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.809 
one of the camshafts I really needed to
just<00:03:26.500> make<00:03:26.709> sure<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.280> alignment<00:03:27.760> of

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
just make sure that the alignment of

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.839 
just make sure that the alignment of
these<00:03:28.060> was<00:03:28.359> perfect<00:03:28.930> and<00:03:29.139> to<00:03:29.250> do<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.489> I

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
these was perfect and to do that I

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.789 
these was perfect and to do that I
didn't<00:03:31.389> really<00:03:31.599> know<00:03:31.780> what<00:03:32.079> equipment<00:03:32.500> I'd

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
didn't really know what equipment I'd

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.339 
didn't really know what equipment I'd
have<00:03:33.040> access<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.639> over<00:03:33.819> here<00:03:34.239> so<00:03:34.720> all<00:03:34.959> the<00:03:35.139> way

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
have access to over here so all the way

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.370 
have access to over here so all the way
from<00:03:35.650> New<00:03:35.799> Zealand<00:03:35.829> I<00:03:36.430> bought<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:37.109> motor<00:03:38.109> Silla

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
from New Zealand I bought a motor Silla

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.580 
from New Zealand I bought a motor Silla
scope<00:03:38.680> with<00:03:38.889> me<00:03:39.069> so<00:03:39.400> I<00:03:39.430> could<00:03:39.669> check<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.590> put

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
scope with me so I could check that put

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.990 
scope with me so I could check that put
the<00:03:41.709> oscilloscope<00:03:42.040> in<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.519> car<00:03:42.730> this<00:03:42.880> morning

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
the oscilloscope in the car this morning

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.259 
the oscilloscope in the car this morning
connected<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> up<00:03:44.049> to<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.530> two<00:03:45.000> sync<00:03:46.000> signal

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
connected it up to the two sync signal

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.319 
connected it up to the two sync signal
with<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.660> sentinel<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:48.099> crank<00:03:48.639> signal<00:03:49.120> and

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
with a sentinel and the crank signal and

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.479 
with a sentinel and the crank signal and
checked<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.139> and<00:03:50.319> wouldn't<00:03:50.980> you<00:03:51.069> know<00:03:51.099> it

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
checked it and wouldn't you know it

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.349 
checked it and wouldn't you know it
it<00:03:51.669> was<00:03:52.090> absolutely<00:03:53.079> 100%<00:03:53.609> perfect<00:03:54.609> couldn't

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
it was absolutely 100% perfect couldn't

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.619 
it was absolutely 100% perfect couldn't
have<00:03:55.480> got<00:03:55.660> it<00:03:55.780> any<00:03:55.959> better<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.590> Nigel<00:03:57.099> tried<00:03:57.629> so

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
have got it any better if Nigel tried so

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.259 
have got it any better if Nigel tried so
that's<00:03:59.169> just<00:03:59.500> how<00:03:59.650> it<00:03:59.980> works<00:04:00.190> out<00:04:00.489> if<00:04:00.790> I<00:04:00.910> hadn't

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
that's just how it works out if I hadn't

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:02.879 
that's just how it works out if I hadn't
bought<00:04:01.389> their<00:04:01.660> oscilloscope<00:04:02.410> all<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.769> way

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 
bought their oscilloscope all the way

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.530 
bought their oscilloscope all the way
across<00:04:03.190> from<00:04:03.489> New<00:04:03.609> Zealand<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:04.299> can

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
across from New Zealand you can

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.089 
across from New Zealand you can
guarantee<00:04:04.780> what<00:04:05.440> I've<00:04:05.590> been<00:04:05.769> fighting

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
guarantee what I've been fighting

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.069 
guarantee what I've been fighting
problems<00:04:06.730> with<00:04:06.940> triggering<00:04:07.510> for<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.900> whole

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
problems with triggering for the whole

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.879 
problems with triggering for the whole
dyno<00:04:08.379> session<00:04:09.359> but<00:04:10.359> it's<00:04:10.959> good<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.349> know<00:04:11.500> that

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:11.889 
dyno session but it's good to know that

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:13.949 
dyno session but it's good to know that
it's<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.099> hundred<00:04:12.220> percent<00:04:12.459> rock-solid<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.540> we

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
it's a hundred percent rock-solid and we

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.390 
it's a hundred percent rock-solid and we
don't<00:04:14.139> have<00:04:14.230> to<00:04:14.379> worry<00:04:14.620> about<00:04:14.919> that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
don't have to worry about that

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.310 
don't have to worry about that
once<00:04:15.970> we're<00:04:16.150> checked<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.630> confirmed<00:04:16.780> the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
once we're checked and confirmed the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.710 
once we're checked and confirmed the
triggering<00:04:17.859> was<00:04:18.010> dialed<00:04:18.370> and<00:04:18.489> perfectly<00:04:19.030> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
triggering was dialed and perfectly the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.599 
triggering was dialed and perfectly the
next<00:04:19.989> step<00:04:20.199> was<00:04:20.380> to<00:04:20.560> get<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.919> timing<00:04:21.370> light

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
next step was to get the timing light

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.430 
next step was to get the timing light
onto<00:04:21.789> the<00:04:22.030> engine<00:04:22.150> and<00:04:22.539> set<00:04:22.870> the<00:04:23.020> basicness

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
onto the engine and set the basicness

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.350 
onto the engine and set the basicness
and<00:04:23.770> timing<00:04:24.130> this<00:04:24.550> is<00:04:24.789> one<00:04:24.969> of<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.180> most

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and timing this is one of the most

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.100 
and timing this is one of the most
important

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
important

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.990 
important
parts<00:04:26.319> of<00:04:26.469> sitting<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:26.889> and<00:04:27.039> ECU<00:04:27.520> before<00:04:27.909> you

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
parts of sitting up and ECU before you

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.119 
parts of sitting up and ECU before you
go<00:04:28.180> anywhere<00:04:28.509> near<00:04:28.689> the<00:04:28.960> dyno<00:04:29.199> we<00:04:29.830> need<00:04:30.009> to

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:30.129 
go anywhere near the dyno we need to

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.070 
go anywhere near the dyno we need to
make<00:04:30.340> sure<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.180> timing<00:04:31.479> that<00:04:31.960> you're

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
make sure that the timing that you're

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.140 
make sure that the timing that you're
seeing<00:04:32.319> on<00:04:32.469> the<00:04:32.560> laptop<00:04:33.009> is<00:04:33.370> exactly<00:04:33.879> what

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
seeing on the laptop is exactly what

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:35.640 
seeing on the laptop is exactly what
we're<00:04:34.300> getting<00:04:34.419> at<00:04:34.629> the<00:04:34.719> crankshaft<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
we're getting at the crankshaft and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.249 
we're getting at the crankshaft and
there's<00:04:35.800> no<00:04:35.949> drift<00:04:36.370> it's<00:04:36.729> rock-solid<00:04:37.169> so<00:04:38.169> we

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
there's no drift it's rock-solid so we

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.170 
there's no drift it's rock-solid so we
set<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.620> up<00:04:38.680> made<00:04:39.069> sure<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.340> was<00:04:39.520> okay<00:04:39.909> and

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
set that up made sure it was okay and

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.570 
set that up made sure it was okay and
again<00:04:40.509> it<00:04:40.629> was<00:04:40.780> absolutely<00:04:41.289> perfect<00:04:41.409> so<00:04:42.400> that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
again it was absolutely perfect so that

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.219 
again it was absolutely perfect so that
was<00:04:42.699> good<00:04:42.879> to<00:04:43.030> tack<00:04:43.270> those<00:04:43.449> two<00:04:43.780> things<00:04:43.990> off

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
was good to tack those two things off

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.649 
was good to tack those two things off
the<00:04:44.379> list<00:04:44.409> after<00:04:45.099> that<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:45.939> just<00:04:46.000> had<00:04:46.330> a<00:04:46.360> cook

00:04:46.649 --> 00:04:46.659 
the list after that I just had a cook

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.140 
the list after that I just had a cook
switch<00:04:46.960> to<00:04:47.199> wire<00:04:47.409> up<00:04:47.680> and<00:04:47.949> we<00:04:48.550> were<00:04:48.699> basically

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
switch to wire up and we were basically

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.809 
switch to wire up and we were basically
good<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.629> get<00:04:49.780> it<00:04:49.900> in<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.110> trailer<00:04:50.349> and<00:04:50.680> go<00:04:50.889> so

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:51.819 
good to get it in the trailer and go so

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:53.490 
good to get it in the trailer and go so
this<00:04:52.120> afternoon<00:04:52.300> we<00:04:52.780> took<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.080> round<00:04:53.259> to<00:04:53.379> the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
this afternoon we took it round to the

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.279 
this afternoon we took it round to the
dyno<00:04:54.060> introduced<00:04:55.060> ourselves<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.780> the<00:04:55.960> the

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
dyno introduced ourselves to the the

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:58.290 
dyno introduced ourselves to the the
dyno<00:04:56.530> owners<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.189> got<00:04:57.310> familiar<00:04:57.819> with<00:04:58.030> their

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
dyno owners and got familiar with their

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.300 
dyno owners and got familiar with their
facilities<00:04:58.990> which<00:04:59.199> are<00:04:59.379> really<00:04:59.830> really<00:05:00.099> good

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
facilities which are really really good

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.059 
facilities which are really really good
really<00:05:01.180> really<00:05:01.210> tidy<00:05:01.779> little<00:05:01.990> dyno<00:05:02.349> shop<00:05:02.740> so

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
really really tidy little dyno shop so

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.459 
really really tidy little dyno shop so
we're<00:05:03.310> quite<00:05:03.550> happy<00:05:03.580> with<00:05:03.969> that<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.990> dts

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:05.469 
we're quite happy with that and the dts

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:07.409 
we're quite happy with that and the dts
dyno<00:05:05.800> is<00:05:05.949> gonna<00:05:06.189> be<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.759> great<00:05:07.150> piece<00:05:07.389> of

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
dyno is gonna be a great piece of

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.469 
dyno is gonna be a great piece of
equipment<00:05:07.629> to<00:05:08.139> do<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.409> job<00:05:08.620> for<00:05:08.650> us<00:05:08.949> tomorrow

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
equipment to do the job for us tomorrow

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:12.379 
equipment to do the job for us tomorrow
got<00:05:10.479> it<00:05:10.569> stripped<00:05:10.779> onto<00:05:11.169> the<00:05:11.319> the<00:05:11.680> dyno<00:05:11.949> and

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
got it stripped onto the the dyno and

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.480 
got it stripped onto the the dyno and
some<00:05:13.389> basic<00:05:13.870> running<00:05:14.139> just<00:05:14.860> wanted<00:05:15.189> to<00:05:15.310> make

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
some basic running just wanted to make

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.490 
some basic running just wanted to make
sure<00:05:15.789> that<00:05:16.210> the<00:05:16.479> charging<00:05:16.960> system<00:05:17.139> was

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
sure that the charging system was

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.159 
sure that the charging system was
working<00:05:17.710> properly<00:05:18.189> and<00:05:18.870> bleed<00:05:19.870> up<00:05:20.050> the

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
working properly and bleed up the

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.559 
working properly and bleed up the
cooling<00:05:20.560> system<00:05:21.009> set<00:05:21.819> up<00:05:21.939> a<00:05:22.090> few<00:05:22.300> parameters

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
cooling system set up a few parameters

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.240 
cooling system set up a few parameters
and<00:05:23.020> just<00:05:23.229> make<00:05:23.409> sure<00:05:23.650> that<00:05:23.680> we're<00:05:23.949> all<00:05:24.069> ready

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
and just make sure that we're all ready

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.300 
and just make sure that we're all ready
to<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:25.360> get<00:05:25.569> going<00:05:25.900> tomorrow<00:05:26.319> morning<00:05:26.680> so<00:05:27.009> I'm

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
to to get going tomorrow morning so I'm

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.730 
to to get going tomorrow morning so I'm
really<00:05:27.669> happy<00:05:27.969> that<00:05:28.150> everything's<00:05:28.870> sort<00:05:29.650> of

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:29.740 
really happy that everything's sort of

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.010 
really happy that everything's sort of
falling<00:05:30.039> into<00:05:30.250> place<00:05:30.599> one<00:05:31.599> more<00:05:31.750> day

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
falling into place one more day

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.749 
falling into place one more day
hopefully<00:05:32.740> we'll<00:05:32.889> have<00:05:33.039> this<00:05:33.219> thing<00:05:33.490> wrapped

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
hopefully we'll have this thing wrapped

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:35.879 
hopefully we'll have this thing wrapped
up<00:05:34.000> and<00:05:34.270> we'll<00:05:34.810> be<00:05:34.930> ready<00:05:35.110> to<00:05:35.319> go<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.560> do<00:05:35.710> some

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 
up and we'll be ready to go and do some

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.360 
up and we'll be ready to go and do some
skids<00:05:36.250> so<00:05:36.580> stay<00:05:37.060> tuned
