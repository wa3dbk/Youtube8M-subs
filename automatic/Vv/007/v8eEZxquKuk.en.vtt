in fact one more quick thing on this

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.900 
in fact one more quick thing on this
electric<00:01:56.430> piano<00:01:56.670> sound<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:56.970> can<00:01:57.150> even<00:01:57.360> control

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910

particular<00:02:54.770> amp<00:02:57.849> so<00:02:58.849> we've<00:02:59.030> done<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.180> really

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
particular amp so we've done it really

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.470 
particular amp so we've done it really
crunchy<00:02:59.989> we<00:03:00.920> can<00:03:01.069> do<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.430> or<00:03:01.910> dial<00:03:02.209> in<00:03:02.390> a

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
crunchy we can do that or dial in a

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.780 
crunchy we can do that or dial in a
specific<00:03:02.989> speaker<00:03:03.290> combination<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:07.520> make<00:03:07.640> it

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
specific speaker combination to make it

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.960 
specific speaker combination to make it
really<00:03:08.030> funky<00:03:08.860> so<00:03:09.860> that's<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.459> couple<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.880> the

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
really funky so that's a couple of the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.120 
really funky so that's a couple of the
electric<00:03:11.269> play<00:03:11.420> electric<00:03:12.230> piano<00:03:12.560> sounds

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
electric play electric piano sounds

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.580 
electric play electric piano sounds
there's<00:03:13.700> also<00:03:13.910> claves<00:03:14.450> compete<00:03:15.110> complete

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
there's also claves compete complete

with<00:03:16.300> release<00:03:17.300> samples<00:03:17.750> too<00:03:18.250> we<00:03:19.250> can<00:03:19.370> do<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
with release samples too we can do the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:26.320 
with release samples too we can do the
auto<00:03:19.760> wah<00:03:20.060> thing<00:03:24.610> which<00:03:25.610> is<00:03:25.790> velocity

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
auto wah thing which is velocity

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.009 
auto wah thing which is velocity
velocity<00:03:27.260> dependent<00:03:28.510> but<00:03:29.510> one<00:03:29.660> of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.810> cool

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
velocity dependent but one of the cool

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.900 
velocity dependent but one of the cool
things<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.500> using<00:03:30.980> an<00:03:31.069> ordinary<00:03:31.220> sustain

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
things is just using an ordinary sustain

remarkable<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.440> when<00:04:29.590> we<00:04:29.710> start<00:04:29.980> combining

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
remarkable is when we start combining

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.200 
remarkable is when we start combining
technology<00:04:32.169> that<00:04:32.440> was<00:04:33.400> initially<00:04:33.669> developed

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
technology that was initially developed

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.450 
technology that was initially developed
for<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.419> XW<00:04:34.930> series<00:04:35.230> that<00:04:35.410> has<00:04:35.590> brought<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.430> a

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
for the XW series that has brought to a

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.020 
for the XW series that has brought to a
new<00:04:36.820> league<00:04:37.210> here<00:04:37.660> in<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.870> PX<00:04:38.139> 5s<00:04:38.760> so<00:04:39.760> we<00:04:39.880> can

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
new league here in the PX 5s so we can

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.719 
new league here in the PX 5s so we can
do<00:04:40.360> some<00:04:40.570> remarkable<00:04:41.350> synth<00:04:41.650> textures<00:04:42.220> here<00:04:42.550> I

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
do some remarkable synth textures here I

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.550 
do some remarkable synth textures here I
can<00:04:43.270> use<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.570> sliders<00:04:43.990> to<00:04:44.020> control<00:04:44.410> these

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
can use the sliders to control these

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.960 
can use the sliders to control these
sounds<00:04:44.950> in<00:04:45.040> real<00:04:45.070> time<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.580> some<00:04:48.760> simple<00:04:48.910> bells

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
we get some remarkable textures so it's

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.700 
we get some remarkable textures so it's
all<00:05:34.400> kinds<00:05:34.910> of<00:05:35.000> great<00:05:35.390> synth<00:05:35.810> pads<00:05:36.140> piano
