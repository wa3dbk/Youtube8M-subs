00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.610
 some tips for success 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.879
 your house in minecraft 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:16.090
 you will see a lot of things 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.189
 quite original in this house 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.859
 so I'll explain a lot of 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.810
 advice 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.359
 So here is already so choose well 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.689
 the location and makes mostly 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.289
 large windows or bring in the 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.599
 light 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.270
 since it's a beautiful landscape not I 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.770
 makes a sofa facing robots landscape 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.770
 is very well chosen place 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.160
 here is a flower so here 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.600
 the interior which is big and especially 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 with big cities doing well 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:57.399
 enter the light 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.719
 it looks pretty here is the table she can 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.120
 switch to you talking about it all to 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.410
 time 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.680
 Well, no, it's a tape made with 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.890
 pistons so here I heard myself the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.780
 mechanism just now it takes some 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.390
 must put red stone torches in 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:18.549
 below the pistons to be able to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:23.920
 activate here is the first floor with my 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.540
 point my corner here I am linking him to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.700
 middle of the slabs finds that it makes 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.860
 pretty nice I took the opportunity to help me 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.240
 lighting 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.649
 as soon as we have lost them I will 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.790
 give a little advice is to put 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:44.610
 lights and blacks 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:50.130
 yes, here are the lights that I have 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 done on the ceiling I'm going to show you 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 now the cellar for me what 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.270
 I call it yes I made flowers that 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.770
 it's nice to put flowers here 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:09.300
 so the table with an emergency room 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.910
 you will see enjoy to put a 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.380
 little chest like the one of help if 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.650
 never she a problem in my house 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.170
 I can come over any refuge there 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.170
 the necessary to survive 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.180
 here and so the way the mechanism of the 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.700
 table just above the haxton torches 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.520
 are the pistons the end of the summer 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.330
 experience i 'm going to remove torches 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:41.760
 access I want to be there and we're going 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.150
 go see upstairs in the house he 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:53.130
 is that there are four who will be 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:55.440
 taken away here are watching the table I 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.810
 removed the fourteen tanks is stone so 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.489
 we can adjust the table like that 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.290
 not bad when I return to the cab 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:19.170
 hand over fight flagstone what is that 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:20.910
 it's less pretty here so 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.310
 I made the house a piece of wood 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.290
 so I'm in creative mode because 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.480
 in survival mode it would have been a lot 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.010
 too long because the pieces of wood 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.830
 it's not boards it should have been 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.980
 four times longer I've done 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.930
 small forests close to the millimeter 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.840
 I only took advantage to put torches 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.360
 the night it is you will see 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.299
 the lighting that I did this filter is 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.549
 pretty night you have to do the night of 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.500
 lighting around the house 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.960
 especially around water points 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.330
 it looks pretty good 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.070
 lighting around water points 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.430
 here is the gemmi torches 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.450
 I do not know if you can see them 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.940
 and so there too I made a 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.510
 lava waterfall and I put torches 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.480
 to light up the evening here we go 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.770
 to come back home 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.770
 I'll show you a little later at night 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.640
 the flashlight next to the water points 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.160
 that's a tip that I can help you 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.320
 give and around the house also this 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.690
 that the night is nice to have a 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.570
 good lighting around the house and 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.030
 in the house if I chose the 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.880
 place by the sea and then I find 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.900
 that the place has the ball he very pretty he 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.840
 just in front of the house that's then 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:48.020
 I will show you now the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:52.400
 night what it gives you here it is 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:56.390
 so I will show you outside 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.710
 it's also good with the table with 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.450
 tracks with sequelae illuminate the night 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.430
 also what they are right just in 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:06.590
 below so these hackers and so here 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.210
 watched the great landscape with the 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.060
 torches and cap of lavaux background 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:17.020
 which is clear here are torches next 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.020
 of the House 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.610
 we did it once you finish 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:32.530
 house do not hesitate to put flowers 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:35.860
 next door since that makes it give a little 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:39.220
 more stuff here is the night with the 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.020
 window overlooking the beautiful landscape at 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.340
 the bathtub also to that a council that 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:47.729
 I can give that 's it's original 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:50.110
 so put lights on the roof 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.310
 do not want too much we see them and light 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:55.389
 because it's not super pretty but 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.510
 that's me, I put them on the roof 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:06:02.620
 well we had we will sleep 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:07.840
 that's when we wake up we reveal ourselves 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:11.919
 just in front of Gabon at the I'm in 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.570
 the pope and write john smith the pack 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.460
 medieval he is really good I know 

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:18.160
 not if you saw the paintings are 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.320
 really beautiful here we do not know 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.550
 really minimal impact 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.620
