00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.319 
dig this stuff up a place like this has
been<00:03:53.069> hunted<00:03:53.400> over<00:03:54.979> that<00:03:55.979> that<00:03:56.970> right<00:03:57.120> there

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
been hunted over that that right there

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:58.909 
been hunted over that that right there
might<00:03:57.509> be<00:03:57.540> masking<00:03:58.079> another<00:03:58.319> coin<00:03:58.680> that's

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
might be masking another coin that's

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.249 
might be masking another coin that's
underneath<00:03:59.159> it<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.609> you<00:04:00.269> know<00:04:01.049> another

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:01.259 
underneath it and you know another

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.530 
underneath it and you know another
detectorists<00:04:01.919> will<00:04:02.729> say<00:04:02.909> that<00:04:03.060> see<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.359> same

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
detectorists will say that see the same

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.719 
detectorists will say that see the same
thing<00:04:03.810> that<00:04:03.989> I<00:04:04.019> just<00:04:04.109> saw<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.919> walk<00:04:05.340> right<00:04:05.549> by

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
thing that I just saw and walk right by

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:06.460 
thing that I just saw and walk right by
it

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
it

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.240 
it
so<00:04:07.669> you<00:04:08.669> know<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.030> dig<00:04:09.509> these<00:04:09.689> and<00:04:10.099> you<00:04:11.099> know<00:04:11.189> I

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
so you know I dig these and you know I

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.289 
so you know I dig these and you know I
hope<00:04:11.459> that<00:04:11.639> there's<00:04:11.819> something<00:04:12.000> else

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
hope that there's something else

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.119 
hope that there's something else
underneath<00:04:12.569> there<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.500> was<00:04:13.680> masking

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
underneath there that this was masking

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.580 
underneath there that this was masking
so<00:04:14.449> but<00:04:15.449> that's<00:04:15.659> what<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:15.870> finding<00:04:16.049> today<00:04:16.560> a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
on a clear night and and and see this

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.469 
on a clear night and and and see this
the<00:04:47.110> lights<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.440> Portland<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.820> I<00:04:48.850> kinda<00:04:49.389> that's

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
the lights of Portland so I kinda that's

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.820 
the lights of Portland so I kinda that's
what<00:04:49.660> I<00:04:49.720> kind<00:04:49.870> of<00:04:49.960> do<00:04:50.080> and<00:04:50.290> then<00:04:50.410> that<00:04:50.440> would<00:04:50.800> be

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
what I kind of do and then that would be

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:51.990 
what I kind of do and then that would be
a<00:04:50.949> really<00:04:51.190> good<00:04:51.280> spot<00:04:51.490> right<00:04:51.669> down<00:04:51.820> there

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
a really good spot right down there

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.270 
a really good spot right down there
where<00:04:52.240> those<00:04:52.389> guys<00:04:52.539> are<00:04:52.750> right<00:04:52.900> now<00:04:53.130> right<00:04:54.130> on

that<00:04:54.460> Ridge<00:04:54.669> right<00:04:54.940> down<00:04:55.120> there<00:04:55.300> people<00:04:55.750> would

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
that Ridge right down there people would

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.060 
that Ridge right down there people would
probably<00:04:56.020> sit<00:04:56.320> there<00:04:56.500> with<00:04:56.590> their<00:04:56.680> blanket

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070
