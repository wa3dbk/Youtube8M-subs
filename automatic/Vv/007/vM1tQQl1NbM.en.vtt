00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.080
 hi girls and guys this time I bring you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.210
 Another makeup of Peru next topmodel 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.460
 season 1 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.259
 that is episode number 4 and the 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.259
 makeup of warriors 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.700
 today my studio has come the model 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.170
 joanna saavedra contestant from Peru is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.170
 next topmodel season 1 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.670
 we are going to do practically a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
 makeup of one of the makeups that 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.440
 I liked the photoshop that I applied 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.840
 in several of the girls with some 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.930
 difference details is not a mask 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.430
 like a mask a little tribal lips 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.530
 naked and well sculpted face we are going to 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.110
 start with the skin hydrating the skin 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.530
 of joana with this felix leaf with blood 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 it is a super good moisturizer we are going to 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.729
 place it on the whole face 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.520
 definitely this is not a makeup 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.619
 for daily use, much less is it a 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.810
 makeup a little more kind like for a 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.899
 Halloween or costume party 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.869
 carnival and like that I'm not going to start 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.890
 placing this concealer of circles under the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.299
 color weapon chryler brand 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.670
 approximately 3 or 4 more shades 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.990
 clear that joana's skin we are going to 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.990
 put it on the entire eyelid 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.640
 from the lash line to the 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.050
 eyebrows and on the bottom too 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 this will serve us as a color of 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.120
 contrast of the shadows in powder that 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.500
 let's put then to give it a 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.690
 little bit of depth I'm going to place 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.510
 this other correct added is a couple of 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.090
 darker tone and we're going to put it in the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.760
 external part of the eye now with this 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.310
 shadow of the brand and the most quad in 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.740
 dark gray color and this brochita let's go 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.290
 to make johana frowns pretty 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.420
 eyes tighten the eyes that wrinkle 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.690
 well that web that these furrows are created 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 and little by little we are tapping on 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.750
 the furrows with the shadow in dust and that 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.480
 is the first part now we open the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.610
 eyes and as you can see there is a super design 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.870
 bacano now I'm going to make him go back to 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.390
 close your eyes fit well 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.129
 pretty pucker which is marked on the 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.409
 wrinkles true that I will continue 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.590
 placing pigment up and down the 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:39.500
 eyelid and as you can see it is staying in 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.260
 form of mask now let's do that 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.030
 Gather your nose to do part of the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:48.849
 little piquito of the mask just here you are 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.849
 wrinkles of the nose and ready 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.770
 now let's delineate the eyes with this 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.620
 black eye pencil brand 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.600
 brouwer nikkei let's fill the line 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.780
 of water and we're also going to delineate by 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:09.220
 outside and with a brush we are going to extend 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.620
 the pencil as low as we can 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.730
 then we are also going to delineate the part 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.360
 top of the eyelashes 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.360
 all right 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.710
 Now I'm simply placing a 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.380
 little shadow gray a little shadow 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.620
 black and I'm starting to give it a little 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.790
 more so a little more dark to the 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.310
 mask 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.080
 a little under the eyebrow and I'm going to 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.460
 extend a little towards the temples 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.100
 as well 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.280
 we are placing and blurring the same 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.280
 time 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.440
 Y 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.290
 do not 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.890
 now to light up my skin a little 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.080
 to place this try and in sik is 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:34.889
 exactly the color of joana's skin 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.770
 let's put it on the whole face 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.229
 and we blur it with this brochita 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.919
 then I will take a concealer of dark circles 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:47.800
 about 3 to 4 shades darker than johanna 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.390
 that the mac monster cover is here 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.310
 reconcile 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.170
 and with that we're going to sculpt the face 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.840
 we are going to mark the cheekbones well 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.700
 do the outline of the forehead and let's 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 leaving the central panel of the face 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.390
 much lighter and more illuminated than 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.390
 the rest of the skin 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.500
 then on the lips I will cover them with 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.729
 a little bit of the same concealer that we use 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.029
 in the eye the lightest 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:07.669
 and to give a little more warmth to 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:10.249
 mouth and not that it is not so cold I will 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:12.379
 place the same sample cover concealer 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:14.550
 to sculpt the face and I'm going to 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.710
 place over 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.290
 to give a little more brightness I'm going to 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.290
 place this pounds of mac 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.440
 and now to illuminate the cheekbones this 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.780
 is going to mark well the mask for let's say 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.069
 that highlight a little more makeup and 

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.919
 It will also give the impression that your 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:35.139
 cheekbones are much higher much more 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:38.889
 prominent and the nose and even a 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:42.250
 little thinner we are not placing this 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:45.210
 corrector dry land about two more tones 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.430
 clear that ioanine skin 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.110
 and ready girls and boys I hope there is 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.410

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:55.680
