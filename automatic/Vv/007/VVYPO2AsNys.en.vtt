00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello and welcome back to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.029
 collector worlds Bundesliga chrome wanted 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.460
 I 'll see you again and there I am 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.160
 just ordered again a display 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.599
 with 36 postern and I will now 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.429
 first open the display and then 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.330
 I'm ten booster or something for 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.920
 open today 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.740
 I think that then passes will 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.949
 next day a lot again 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.949
 bundesliga chrome come like that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 and then let's hope, of course 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.150
 that a special card I get have 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.440
 not yet performed as then 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.160
 even those were still packed 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.230
 straight and then we pack ten first 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 booster from then I look first if 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.350
 I still have a jersey card in it 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.660
 not then another card is in it 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:51.940
 because in each box his special cards 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.770
 thirds see somehow the lie there 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.600
 I thought it was the last time 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.440
 the upright no idea 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.510
 So now we take 14 boosters 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:08.410
 first booster no jersey card that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.509
 can I ever betray that 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:13.320
 all garbage behind this is as much 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:14.680
 garbage water always comes together 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.330
 Hajrovic 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.940
 I'm not sure so will 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:23.440
 i have not got full bvb yet 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:28.000
 fully subotic uwe hünemeier as a captain 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.470
 card sleeper and thomas force me 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.640
 I already had some teams full 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.310
 I think I have three, too 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:37.000
 presented no jersey card damage 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.300
 I think so too 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.160
 presented 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.369
 on the canal yes I'm pretty 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.369
 for sure 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:01.750
 david arnold Werner Behrami and spike 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.280
 third booster no jersey card me 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.209
 test the mountain before you have to 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.240
 her even if you so turn a bit 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:10.500
 You can see that can be bent 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.500
 there is no jersey card in it 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:22.940
 so the logo will bender me that's that 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.800
 Part in the middle of the ball 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.570
 I believe that I have not me 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.560
 two parts still missing or 34 million and 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:31.820
 broke and of course I try 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.070
 not to get full 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.750
 that would be great, of course I will now 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.160
 all in a heap here the last one 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.310
 sometimes too complicated all so 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.680
 on special hofen and stuff so throw the 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:50.300
 is the fourth booster high i wanted 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:53.690
 here 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.470
 so start with the booster years before 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.470
 I opened too much 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:09.620
 stranzl bayern munich lustenberger 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.370
 hamburger sv and I am natural 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 go back to the box no 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.110
 Let's see that we still have one 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.220
 draw some nice special cards 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.440
 that would be so great if i have a jersey 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.390
 would still have to pull an autograph 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.720
 we have not yet pulled raphael paris 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:36.200
 lehmann 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.050
 small oettinger pity it would be here 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 a jersey cartel sun 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:48.830
 the only question I feel is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:50.450
 which one so here is hector then one 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.780
 bicolor that's good 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.430
 from brooke that's a bicolor that's 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.140
 pretty cool here with the strip stop 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.700
 are more valuable we put down there 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.700
 and harnik so we have bad ones 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.650
 chances to make a good card 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.910
 in most cases there is only one card in each box 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.670
 but if you have two in it then it is 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.060
 a giant so your happiness has 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:17.780
 really lucky 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:23.919
 so hector schuster 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:29.630
 Müller could do Komorowski 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:30.620
 So there we were really lucky stupid 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.830
 I wanted to go now 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:39.320
 an autograph card obama kachunga 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:41.949
 volland rumia and hertha bsc again 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:47.750
 look what number we have here 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:51.020
 the 322 has the jersey number is that 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.650
 not like me four times as much 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.650
 I would say worth 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:06.740
 alba rodrigues marcelo reinartz and 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:16.039
 Seferovic 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:20.389
 and last booster for today so hermann 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:23.110
 draxler günther those how and schulz yes 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:30.729
 a jersey- katar still pulled 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.729
 let's say john anthony brooks and 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:35.050
 Hertha BSC 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.070
 if I draw a card now 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.510
 would it be great and of course 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.800
 Sincerely the box in any case reindeer 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.070
 otherwise maybe I have the 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.950
 collection of toppen was that and that 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.090
 was it synonymous with this video yes write 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:46.990

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.670
