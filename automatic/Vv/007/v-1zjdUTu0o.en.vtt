00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.020 

one<00:00:01.589> of<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.770> big<00:00:01.979> ideas<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.490> physics<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.970> that

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
one of the big ideas in physics is that

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.910 
one of the big ideas in physics is that
lights<00:00:03.510> can<00:00:03.720> behave<00:00:03.990> as<00:00:04.049> waves<00:00:04.500> or<00:00:04.859> particles

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
lights can behave as waves or particles

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.400 
lights can behave as waves or particles
and<00:00:05.850> this<00:00:06.330> demonstration<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:07.170> the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
and this demonstration of the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.049 
and this demonstration of the
photoelectric<00:00:08.010> effect<00:00:08.040> is<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.639> really<00:00:08.940> great

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
photoelectric effect is a really great

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.749 
photoelectric effect is a really great
way<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.420> introducing<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:10.050> idea<00:00:10.670> what<00:00:11.670> I've

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
way of introducing that idea what I've

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.480 
way of introducing that idea what I've
got<00:00:11.969> here<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.690> zinc<00:00:12.990> plate<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:14.070> if<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.340> want

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
got here is a zinc plate and if you want

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.250 
got here is a zinc plate and if you want
the<00:00:14.549> demonstration<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.150> work<00:00:15.299> it's

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the demonstration to work it's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
the demonstration to work it's
absolutely<00:00:17.190> essential<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.820> give<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> good

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
absolutely essential to give it a good

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.250 
absolutely essential to give it a good
scrub<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.109> both<00:00:19.740> sides<00:00:20.689> with<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.990> iron

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
scrub on both sides with a bit of iron

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.200 
scrub on both sides with a bit of iron
wool<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.430> removes<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.820> surface

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
wool and that just removes a surface

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.750 
wool and that just removes a surface
oxide<00:00:24.390> layer<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:24.990> then<00:00:25.949> place<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> plate<00:00:26.519> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
oxide layer I then place the plate on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.290 
oxide layer I then place the plate on
top<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.449> goldleaf<00:00:28.260> electroscope<00:00:29.300> I've

to<00:00:34.890> work<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.579> plate<00:00:35.910> has<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.480> be<00:00:36.510> negatively

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
to work this plate has to be negatively

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.900 
to work this plate has to be negatively
charged<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.129> do<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.489> using<00:00:38.850> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
charged and I can do that using the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:50.130

now<00:00:51.140> let<00:00:51.320> me<00:00:51.350> show<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.560> that<00:00:51.620> again<00:00:53.200> I've<00:00:54.200> got

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
now let me show you that again I've got

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.290 
now let me show you that again I've got
a<00:00:54.350> perspex<00:00:54.860> rod<00:00:54.950> here<00:00:55.370> which<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.060> can<00:00:56.120> make

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
a perspex rod here which I can make

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000 
a perspex rod here which I can make
positively-charged<00:00:57.110> by<00:00:57.350> rubbing<00:00:57.739> with<00:00:57.860> this

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
remove my finger then remove the rod now

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.590 
remove my finger then remove the rod now
watch<00:01:10.010> what<00:01:10.190> happens<00:01:10.250> when<00:01:10.700> I<00:01:10.729> shine<00:01:10.970> visible

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
watch what happens when I shine visible

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:21.420 
watch what happens when I shine visible
light<00:01:11.780> onto<00:01:12.470> the<00:01:12.560> plate<00:01:19.690> absolutely<00:01:20.690> nothing

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
light onto the plate absolutely nothing

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.770 
light onto the plate absolutely nothing
that's<00:01:22.430> actually<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:22.850> really<00:01:23.090> important<00:01:23.630> part

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
that's actually a really important part

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.170 
that's actually a really important part
of<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:24.020> demonstration<00:01:24.580> your<00:01:25.580> students<00:01:26.000> need

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
of the demonstration your students need

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.280 
of the demonstration your students need
to<00:01:26.270> notice<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.720> with<00:01:26.869> visible<00:01:27.229> light

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
to notice that with visible light

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.070 
to notice that with visible light
nothing<00:01:28.160> happens<00:01:28.729> but<00:01:29.660> watch<00:01:29.869> what<00:01:30.020> happens

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
nothing happens but watch what happens

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:39.639 
nothing happens but watch what happens
when<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.530> shine<00:01:30.770> ultraviolet<00:01:31.369> light<00:01:38.500> you<00:01:39.500> can

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
when I shine ultraviolet light you can

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.410 
when I shine ultraviolet light you can
see<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.130> gold<00:01:40.369> leaf<00:01:40.580> immediately

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
see that the gold leaf immediately

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.960 
see that the gold leaf immediately
starts<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.899> fall<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:43.490> must<00:01:43.729> mean<00:01:43.910> that

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
starts to fall and that must mean that

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.570 
starts to fall and that must mean that
the<00:01:44.210> UV<00:01:44.869> light<00:01:45.080> is<00:01:45.259> somehow<00:01:45.590> discharging<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
the UV light is somehow discharging the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.029 
the UV light is somehow discharging the
electroscope<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:48.380> know<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.710> we<00:01:48.800> started

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
electroscope we know that we started

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.550 
electroscope we know that we started
with<00:01:49.399> negative<00:01:49.910> charge<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.360> plate<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:51.410> the

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
with negative charge on the plate so the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.770 
with negative charge on the plate so the
UV<00:01:51.740> light<00:01:52.130> must<00:01:52.520> somehow<00:01:52.789> be<00:01:52.970> releasing<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
UV light must somehow be releasing the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.020 
UV light must somehow be releasing the
electrons<00:01:54.260> and<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.010> important<00:01:55.820> thing<00:01:55.880> to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
electrons and the important thing to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.179 
electrons and the important thing to
notice<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.750> that<00:01:57.049> is<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.320> frequency<00:01:57.799> of<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
notice is that is the frequency of the

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.190 
notice is that is the frequency of the
lights<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.610> makes<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:59.000> difference<00:01:59.360> remember

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
lights that makes a difference remember

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.109 
lights that makes a difference remember
with<00:02:00.470> a<00:02:00.500> visible<00:02:00.920> light<00:02:01.159> it<00:02:01.610> doesn't<00:02:01.880> matter

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
with a visible light it doesn't matter

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.539 
with a visible light it doesn't matter
how<00:02:02.450> bright<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.080> or<00:02:03.380> how<00:02:03.710> long<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.130> shines

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
how bright it is or how long it shines

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.320 
how bright it is or how long it shines
for<00:02:04.909> it<00:02:05.330> doesn't<00:02:05.869> release<00:02:06.110> any<00:02:06.259> electrons<00:02:07.330> now

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
for it doesn't release any electrons now

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.570 
for it doesn't release any electrons now
this<00:02:08.570> phenomenon<00:02:08.950> cannot<00:02:09.950> be<00:02:10.160> explained

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
this phenomenon cannot be explained

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.210 
this phenomenon cannot be explained
using<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:11.000> wave<00:02:11.269> model<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.780> light<00:02:12.019> but<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:12.920> can

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
using a wave model of light but we can

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.280 
using a wave model of light but we can
understand<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.910> if<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.390> adopt<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.780> idea<00:02:14.930> that

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
understand it if we adopt the idea that

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.320 
understand it if we adopt the idea that
radiation<00:02:16.010> arrives<00:02:16.549> at<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> plate<00:02:17.090> as

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
radiation arrives at the plate as

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.390 
radiation arrives at the plate as
packets<00:02:18.019> of<00:02:18.140> energy<00:02:18.260> which<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.100> can<00:02:19.250> call
