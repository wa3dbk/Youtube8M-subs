didn't get the I didn't get the
instructions<00:00:24.180> from<00:00:24.330> global<00:00:24.750> buckets<00:00:25.170> they<00:00:25.320> go

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
instructions from global buckets they go

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.860 
instructions from global buckets they go
to<00:00:25.560> someplace<00:00:25.830> else<00:00:26.750> but<00:00:29.449> these<00:00:32.510> that's<00:00:33.510> this

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
to someplace else but these that's this

to someplace else but these that's this
tomato<00:00:34.290> plant<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.890> there<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.360> grows<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
tomato plant in there the thing grows is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.190 
tomato plant in there the thing grows is
grown<00:00:37.440> right<00:00:37.739> now<00:00:37.950> about<00:00:38.129> three<00:00:38.930> quarters<00:00:39.930> of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
grown right now about three quarters of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.200 
grown right now about three quarters of
an<00:00:40.440> inch<00:00:40.590> per<00:00:40.920> day<00:00:41.480> now<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:44.000> planted<00:00:45.000> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
an inch per day now I planted that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
an inch per day now I planted that
that's<00:00:45.570> early<00:00:45.930> grilled<00:00:46.140> tomato<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.890> planted

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that's early grilled tomato I planted

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.020 
that's early grilled tomato I planted
that<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:48.149> I'd<00:00:48.510> say<00:00:48.809> ten<00:00:49.079> days<00:00:49.289> ago<00:00:49.820> it<00:00:50.820> was

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
that about I'd say ten days ago it was

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.450 
that about I'd say ten days ago it was
way<00:00:51.210> smaller<00:00:51.420> back<00:00:51.870> down<00:00:52.110> as<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.980> guess<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.280> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
way smaller back down as I guess you can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.650 
way smaller back down as I guess you can
imagine<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.270> next<00:00:57.510> one<00:00:57.780> here<00:00:58.199> I

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
imagine now this next one here I

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
imagine now this next one here I
originally<00:01:00.660> did<00:01:01.079> plant<00:01:01.559> tomatoes<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.190> that

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
originally did plant tomatoes in that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.969 
originally did plant tomatoes in that
one<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:03.320> but<00:01:05.090> for<00:01:06.090> some<00:01:06.270> reason<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.650> tomato

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
one also but for some reason the tomato

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.350 
one also but for some reason the tomato
plant<00:01:08.280> didn't<00:01:08.610> do<00:01:09.030> too<00:01:09.240> well<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.479> there<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.380> i

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
plant didn't do too well in there so i

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
plant didn't do too well in there so i
put<00:01:12.360> i<00:01:12.860> put<00:01:15.500> eggplant<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.830> instead<00:01:17.189> now

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
put i put eggplant in there instead now

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.050 
put i put eggplant in there instead now
i<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:18.240> know<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:19.049> eggplant<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:21.000> to

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
i don't know if eggplant is going to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.359 
i don't know if eggplant is going to
like<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.390> lime<00:01:21.659> soil<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:22.650> put<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.100> there

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like the lime soil that i put in there

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.539 
like the lime soil that i put in there

cover now these next to this one and
this<00:02:13.629> one<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:16.260> figure<00:02:17.260> out<00:02:17.290> which<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.530> which

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
this one I figure out which is which

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.970 
this one I figure out which is which
right<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:18.730> minute<00:02:18.970> but<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.650> these<00:02:20.739> has

carrots and the other one has spinach in
it<00:02:24.340> now<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.269> plan<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.849> actually<00:02:27.849> planted

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.960 
it now my plan is I actually planted
seeds<00:02:29.129> now<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.190> plan<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.549> to<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:32.970> remove

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
because I planted those seeds couple of

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.449 
because I planted those seeds couple of
days<00:02:43.390> ago<00:02:43.599> and<00:02:43.780> once<00:02:44.560> they<00:02:44.709> germinate<00:02:44.980> I'll

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
days ago and once they germinate I'll

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
take the top off the same with this one

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.620 
take the top off the same with this one
but<00:02:50.819> that's<00:02:51.819> if<00:02:52.060> those<00:02:52.299> seeds<00:02:52.989> well<00:02:53.430> I've<00:02:54.430> been

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
but that's if those seeds well I've been

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.400 
but that's if those seeds well I've been
wetting<00:02:55.630> them<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:57.569> kind<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.660> ensure<00:02:59.019> that<00:02:59.230> they

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
wetting them to kind of ensure that they

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.839 
wetting them to kind of ensure that they
will<00:02:59.650> come<00:02:59.860> up<00:03:00.069> but<00:03:00.400> all<00:03:00.849> we<00:03:01.090> can<00:03:01.239> do<00:03:01.360> is<00:03:01.390> hope

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
will come up but all we can do is hope

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.360 
will come up but all we can do is hope
and<00:03:03.849> these<00:03:04.030> buckets<00:03:04.420> are<00:03:04.600> different<00:03:04.989> too<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
and these buckets are different too you

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.129 
and these buckets are different too you
can<00:03:06.519> see<00:03:06.700> they're<00:03:06.880> square<00:03:07.299> and<00:03:07.600> they're

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
can see they're square and they're

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:13.370 
can see they're square and they're
smaller<00:03:09.510> these<00:03:10.510> buckets<00:03:10.980> are<00:03:11.980> supposedly

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
smaller these buckets are supposedly

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.840 
smaller these buckets are supposedly
somewhere<00:03:14.380> about<00:03:14.590> three<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.100> half<00:03:15.130> gallons

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
somewhere about three and a half gallons

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.780 
somewhere about three and a half gallons
and<00:03:17.609> I<00:03:18.660> got<00:03:19.660> them<00:03:19.930> from<00:03:20.680> my<00:03:20.829> brother<00:03:21.160> he<00:03:21.549> gave

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
and I got them from my brother he gave

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.930 
and I got them from my brother he gave
them<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:21.940> me<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.269> free<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:23.290> I<00:03:23.760> figured<00:03:24.760> why<00:03:24.910> not

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
them to me for free so I figured why not

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.809 
them to me for free so I figured why not
use<00:03:25.359> them<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.750> I<00:03:28.989> i<00:03:29.290> decided<00:03:30.099> i<00:03:30.280> would<00:03:30.430> put

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
use them then I i decided i would put

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.259 
use them then I i decided i would put
another<00:03:31.030> tomato<00:03:31.420> plant<00:03:31.870> in<00:03:31.989> here<00:03:32.319> because<00:03:32.620> i

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
another tomato plant in here because i

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.470 
another tomato plant in here because i
wanted<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.389> have<00:03:34.569> an<00:03:34.690> italian<00:03:35.260> plum<00:03:35.950> tomato<00:03:36.480> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
wanted to have an italian plum tomato I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.970 
wanted to have an italian plum tomato I
like<00:03:38.230> to<00:03:38.260> make<00:03:38.530> spaghetti<00:03:38.980> sauce<00:03:39.989> so<00:03:40.989> I<00:03:41.019> did<00:03:41.859> it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
like to make spaghetti sauce so I did it

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.360 
like to make spaghetti sauce so I did it
that<00:03:42.190> way<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:43.799> don't<00:03:44.799> know<00:03:44.950> why<00:03:45.160> exactly

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
that way and I don't know why exactly

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.879 
that way and I don't know why exactly
but<00:03:46.060> that<00:03:46.269> tomato<00:03:46.630> plant<00:03:46.989> just<00:03:47.169> took<00:03:47.380> off<00:03:47.620> big

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:47.889 
but that tomato plant just took off big

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:50.940 
but that tomato plant just took off big
time<00:03:47.919> because<00:03:48.579> I<00:03:49.049> only<00:03:50.049> planted<00:03:50.500> that<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.709> few

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
time because I only planted that a few

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.520 
time because I only planted that a few
days<00:03:51.130> ago<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.819> way<00:03:52.060> bigger<00:03:52.510> I<00:03:52.870> need<00:03:53.440> to

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
days ago and it's way bigger I need to

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.699 
days ago and it's way bigger I need to
put<00:03:53.709> it<00:03:53.829> tomato<00:03:54.099> cage<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.639> that<00:03:54.849> one<00:03:55.060> and<00:03:55.709> then

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
put it tomato cage on that one and then

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.539 
put it tomato cage on that one and then
this<00:03:56.950> last<00:03:57.220> one<00:03:57.519> here<00:03:57.579> is<00:03:58.739> kohlrabi

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 
this last one here is kohlrabi

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:08.449 
this last one here is kohlrabi
and<00:04:03.230> I'll<00:04:04.230> call<00:04:04.560> Robbie<00:04:04.890> and<00:04:06.709> you<00:04:07.709> know<00:04:07.829> I<00:04:07.859> put

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
and I'll call Robbie and you know I put

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.199 
and I'll call Robbie and you know I put
some<00:04:08.670> in<00:04:08.849> there<00:04:09.469> a<00:04:10.469> same<00:04:11.249> thing<00:04:11.549> I<00:04:11.670> planted<00:04:12.060> it

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
some in there a same thing I planted it

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.729 
some in there a same thing I planted it
from<00:04:12.359> seed<00:04:12.629> so<00:04:12.989> it's<00:04:13.170> hard<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.409> say<00:04:13.499> exactly

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
from seed so it's hard to say exactly

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.509 
from seed so it's hard to say exactly
how<00:04:14.569> well<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.719> going<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:15.989> do<00:04:16.229> I<00:04:16.560> looked<00:04:17.370> in

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
how well it's going to do I looked in

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.159 
how well it's going to do I looked in
there<00:04:17.729> earlier<00:04:18.030> today<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.840> course<00:04:19.019> it

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
there earlier today and of course it

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.219 
there earlier today and of course it
wasn't<00:04:19.349> sprouted<00:04:19.949> but<00:04:20.190> it's<00:04:20.310> only<00:04:20.519> then<00:04:21.229> it's

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
wasn't sprouted but it's only then it's

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.189 
wasn't sprouted but it's only then it's
only<00:04:22.349> been<00:04:22.620> three<00:04:22.919> or<00:04:22.949> four<00:04:23.190> days<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:24.389> I'm<00:04:24.960> not

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:25.199 
only been three or four days so I'm not

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.990 
only been three or four days so I'm not
too<00:04:25.259> worried<00:04:25.680> about<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.919> yet<00:04:26.220> if<00:04:26.550> nothing

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
too worried about it yet if nothing

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.020 
too worried about it yet if nothing
sprouts<00:04:27.509> up<00:04:27.720> there<00:04:27.930> pretty<00:04:28.139> soon<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:29.070> guess

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
sprouts up there pretty soon I I guess

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:34.939 
sprouts up there pretty soon I I guess
I'll<00:04:30.270> go<00:04:31.169> get<00:04:31.380> some<00:04:32.960> seedling<00:04:33.960> and<00:04:34.229> put<00:04:34.740> that

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
I'll go get some seedling and put that

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.520 
I'll go get some seedling and put that
in<00:04:35.130> there<00:04:35.340> instead<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.840> same<00:04:37.080> for<00:04:37.259> the<00:04:37.380> other

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
in there instead the same for the other

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.689 
in there instead the same for the other
two<00:04:37.770> would<00:04:37.919> have<00:04:38.099> these<00:04:38.310> lids<00:04:38.550> on<00:04:38.789> them<00:04:39.560> so

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
two would have these lids on them so

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.719 
two would have these lids on them so
that's<00:04:41.699> my<00:04:41.940> bucket<00:04:42.330> garden<00:04:42.690> for<00:04:42.870> now<00:04:43.099> I<00:04:44.099> have

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
that's my bucket garden for now I have

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:51.100 
that's my bucket garden for now I have
plans<00:04:45.060> to<00:04:45.949> build<00:04:46.949> some<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:48.889> something

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
plans to build some kind of something

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.719 
plans to build some kind of something
something<00:04:52.110> that'll<00:04:52.380> just<00:04:52.800> hold<00:04:53.099> these<00:04:53.280> up<00:04:53.310> off

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
something that'll just hold these up off

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.310 
something that'll just hold these up off
the<00:04:53.910> ground<00:04:54.060> and<00:04:55.610> also<00:04:56.610> if<00:04:56.940> you<00:04:57.120> notice<00:04:57.320> I'm

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
the ground and also if you notice I'm

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.270 
the ground and also if you notice I'm
watering<00:04:58.680> these<00:04:58.889> from<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.250> top<00:04:59.520> and

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
watering these from the top and

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.770

according to my brother and also grant
that's<00:05:06.780> not<00:05:07.020> really<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.320> very<00:05:07.530> good<00:05:07.770> way<00:05:07.919> to<00:05:07.949> do

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
that's not really a very good way to do

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.339 
that's not really a very good way to do
it<00:05:08.490> because<00:05:10.520> they're<00:05:11.520> okay<00:05:11.880> now<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:13.050> know<00:05:13.199> the

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
it because they're okay now you know the

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.080 
it because they're okay now you know the
only<00:05:13.560> water<00:05:13.919> once<00:05:14.310> every<00:05:14.580> two<00:05:14.729> or<00:05:14.880> three<00:05:14.909> days

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
only water once every two or three days

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.990 
only water once every two or three days
but<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:16.560> once<00:05:16.770> the<00:05:16.889> plants<00:05:17.220> start<00:05:17.460> to<00:05:17.580> get<00:05:17.729> big

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
but but once the plants start to get big

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.620 
but but once the plants start to get big
they<00:05:18.570> need<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> whole<00:05:19.050> lot<00:05:19.080> more<00:05:19.409> water<00:05:20.599> so<00:05:21.599> I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
they need a whole lot more water so I

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.649 
they need a whole lot more water so I
