00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.089
 I 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.760
 I do not like them anymore, I hope they are super good 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.410
 I am a Kim reader and this is another of the 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.840
 that you place or txiki that you place 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.270
 commented on plants against zombies and 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.300
 well this time it's time to comment about 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:37.030
 this zombie that I took out recently 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.250
 I think it 's the zombie aviator or zombie from 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.309
 aviation something like that to do with 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.970
 planes ok and good practically this is 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.129
 one of the zombies that I said zombie wow 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.780
 because if they can be set shoots 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.540
 pretty father 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.129
 and if it does a lot of damage just that good 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.989
 if you have to try to give all the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.570
 bullets to the enemy so that you reach 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.600
 kill him or in his case it is a robbery 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.120
 death is as I say and good is 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.430
 his special power is that his weapon is 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.560
 called dangerous zone and basically it's 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.110
 that 's a pretty automatic weapon 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.080
 powerful I do not know if they listen to it there and 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.000
 good at first I was good we started 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.280
 to kill like loquitos aside because I 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.420
 I was defending good rather not 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.740
 defending me stay 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.540
 and still doing good sincere champion 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.759
 because if he left, they're going to kill me then 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.110
 there was no case anyway 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.570
 plants were defending quite 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.000
 well and that kept me from moving forward 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.840
 so what I usually do is 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.970
 first to be able to secure my future by killing 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.039
 to my enemies and already once having the 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.439
 free space then I can then go 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.119
 advancing is also that the others are 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.189
 The ones who have to put their batteries in 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.289
 It's like one can only do everything 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.350
 so if there has to be like a 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.210
 team and good is to tell them that we do not win 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.600
 this game but I leave them because 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.250
 I think that individually I did well 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.440
 I think I managed to kill like 20 more or 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.119
 less something like that and the truth is that I think 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.759
 that the clicks were pretty fathers 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.459
 there was one that has a projectile flying 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.670
 and it fell to a pea was pretty 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.799
 pro and really is that with this zombie and 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.330
 with what is in pea plants me 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.060
 it's going pretty good because they're both 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.110
 fast are agile and above all can 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.210
 go up and look at this bean 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.980
 I also said it and this and I do not know the 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.050
 pea and he and this one are and I like them 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.480
 very much because they are quite agile 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.950
 I say the two can run away from any 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.110
 very fast thing and let's say that this is a 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.910
 aviator I liked that link pretty much 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.100
 remember a little the mechanical engineer 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.860
 I do not know if you remember that that too 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.810
 like I think what he throws are bombs 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.720
 of air something like that look there was 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.580
 when I told you the most, it was 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.910
 very good samur you had never made a 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.010
 death like that until just now I saw 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.670
 that death and well I do not know what other zombie 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.380
 They want me to teach them the truth 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.330
 I do not know much about how much they are 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.140
 they dress there because good 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.239
 I have not played, I do not remember quite well 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.250
 and good in this game I also have to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.989
 tell them that one of the things that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.330
 they influenced so that we could not win 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.360
 is that I do not know if they realize that the 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.920
 teleporter or practically the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.890
 engineer who had him worth 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.569
 peanut because I think that if we have 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.400
 an engineer 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.579
 since when the game started if 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.560
 we had a teleporter put 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:38.530
 then I think so but the truth 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.620
 I do not have a backpack, so if they do 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.109
 account with this zombie for example there is the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.230
 sunflower had already fled sunflower and was 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.760
 more than saved but with and that is the one 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.760
 throw a projectile so he can continue 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.379
 flying I chased him and that's how I 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.180
 I reached pitifully then of good 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.340
 was I think all the zombies or 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.829
 leaving just going to separate because 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.379
 had responded or were already on base 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.299
 capturing the truth I do not remember but 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.069
 there I was the peas against me 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.169
 and then I could not live with 18 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.060
 do a lot no but you guys 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.620
 tell me if you are liking these 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.239
 company the truth is that I love 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.069
 up are chiki and emplace goes to 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.900
 vary as much as you touch will last 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.269
 one I think it's eight minutes and that 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.250
 it's quite simply because as they 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.530
 I have commented we like to leave you 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.509
 the basics or what can really 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.300
 interest them I do not think they are interested 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.729
 who answers today in what came from the 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.800
 base for here I do not think they're interested 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.840
 much that to me so well we lost 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.810
 but as I say 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.430
 I think it went well so, so with 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.320
 I say goodbye, do not forget to leave the 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.570
 super like for more plants against 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.290
 zombies chiki gameplays and see you 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.290
 goodbye
