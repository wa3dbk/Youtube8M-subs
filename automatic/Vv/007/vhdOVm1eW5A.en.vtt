00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
this one I used two different zippers to

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.400 
this one I used two different zippers to
get<00:00:55.890> two<00:00:56.129> different<00:00:56.250> colors<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.379> I

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
get two different colors and here I

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.930 
get two different colors and here I
glued<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> two<00:00:59.070> together<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> rolled<00:00:59.789> it

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
glued the two together and rolled it

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.099 
glued the two together and rolled it
around<00:00:59.969> ahead<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.359> little<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.750> trouble<00:01:01.050> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
around ahead a little bit of trouble I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:08.330 
around ahead a little bit of trouble I
would<00:01:01.260> try<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.620> fix<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.540> then<00:01:07.159> it<00:01:08.159> did

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
would try to fix that and then it did

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
would try to fix that and then it did
this<00:01:08.549> one<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.360> bigger<00:01:09.780> zipper<00:01:10.320> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
this one with a much bigger zipper I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.420 
this one with a much bigger zipper I
mean<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.210> pole<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> zipper

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
mean that is the pole for that zipper

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.990 
mean that is the pole for that zipper
it's<00:01:14.729> huge<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.890> couldn't<00:01:17.610> get<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.850> many

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it's huge so I couldn't get as many

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.179 
it's huge so I couldn't get as many
petals<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.689> there<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.530> didn't<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
petals on there and I didn't do the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.950 
petals on there and I didn't do the
spiral<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.820> center<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.840> was

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
spiral in the center but I think it was

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.520 
spiral in the center but I think it was
cute

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
cute

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.230 
cute

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
and this one I didn't do the spiral in

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.380 
and this one I didn't do the spiral in
the<00:01:27.270> center<00:01:27.360> either<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.590> did<00:01:29.070> these<00:01:29.700> little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
the center either but I did these little

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.990

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
shine it's very pretty and then this one

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.290 
shine it's very pretty and then this one
instead<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.590> using<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.190> wire<00:02:24.370> this<00:02:24.760> time<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
instead of using the wire this time to

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.600 
instead of using the wire this time to
hold<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.660> beads<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.380> used<00:02:27.220> little<00:02:29.250> head<00:02:30.250> pins

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
hold the beads I used little head pins

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.460 
hold the beads I used little head pins
and<00:02:32.819> assemble<00:02:33.819> each<00:02:33.970> one<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.720> then<00:02:34.930> glue<00:02:35.319> to

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
and assemble each one and then glue to

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.780 
and assemble each one and then glue to
mine<00:02:35.650> and<00:02:35.860> then<00:02:35.950> just<00:02:36.100> put<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.340> button<00:02:36.610> there

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
mine and then just put the button there

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.090 
mine and then just put the button there
on<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.090> top<00:02:37.300> so<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.840> think<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.680> turned<00:02:38.890> out

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100
