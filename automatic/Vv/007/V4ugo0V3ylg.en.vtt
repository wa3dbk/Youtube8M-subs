00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 and then we're back here in the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.330
 GTA 5 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 this time in the before the actual village wants 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.760
 say no 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.300
 You understand they are not in the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.519
 angeles we are here in santa monica 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.449
 we passed by this broken bridge is 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.850
 very like our rockstar always 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.830
 Do not say it, congratulations, always, for this. 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.710
 game so well done right 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.730
 imitating so well the reality that is that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 the opposite 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.520
 finally show a good read for you 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.380
 here called Itans between via're with but 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.899
 Before I go take a look here. 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.960
 In this trailer you know what this is. 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.579
 here is the negative trainer that makes him 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.710
 modifies the game in real time using 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.649
 everything the game offers all that people 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.920
 here is the game itself that offers 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.140
 therefore the word native to all 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.710
 stops here of course you can not have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.910
 transporting the whole time but sometimes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.739
 and side is playing with a player 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.120
 then suddenly this player after 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.830
 democracy and will stop somewhere else 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.790
 so the game used a teleportation 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.369
 understood to keep the tip and the snow yesterday 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.900
 in vince ball or activate the invincible 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 to not have any more headaches for him 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 now it's supposed to be gian you already 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 You know it's not the southern one, right? 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.140
 finally our highest now things that 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.840
 gives to do in game theory then okay 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.210
 where you have this stop here for him 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.340
 beauty what I want to show you 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.829
 it's a neighbor mold that a guy did that 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 serves to attract repel or explode 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.350
 vehicles understood then I came here in a 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 very busy place to see how this 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.640
 It works first, I'm going to 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 little to activate the business is close 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.509
 the and key changes between the modules 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.979
 to explode anything to nothing it turns off right 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.409
 to repel attract to explode has only one 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.630
 detail do not know if the guy did not 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.060
 Not business rights but here it is 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.880
 invested in repelling vehicles 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.409
 truth is attracting them and vice versa 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.229
 in the act he is repeating the role 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:13.069
 then it will let it repel you 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:16.110
 actually it will attract beauty 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.700
 he warned that it does not work with 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.080
 all cars 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.040
 Ok let's see if it made a good 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.060
 work and I, our sensational hand 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.200
 come here carts 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.950
 Come here, carts. Look, I think it has. 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 that having a distance 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.599
 I rolled this old man the distance he 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.159
 active is the following let me explain the 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.500
 success 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.019
 when we get close to the vehicle and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.970
 press to enter it 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:50.129
 Look, it did not work out there. 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.959
 distance at which the enter button goes 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.700
 working grandson has to be near the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.769
 sufficient vehicle to operate 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.599
 I think this is the distance that works 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.730
 to attract or repel the vehicle comes with 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.840
 a fire condition your car 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:08.549

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:12.120
 our our leaves fall and not Uendel 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:16.440
 unglued is a magnet is this 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:20.489
 fucking tap for it it comes out 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.769
 I just changed to attract and he went to 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:26.849
 repel an inverted granddaughter or see how 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:31.819
 It will be the people not repel works 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:36.120
 fire truck powered 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:41.160
 Come on, everybody, what a crazy man, man. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:47.470

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:55.630
 oak that shall my hand and 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:59.080
 Nighttime already looks like this could not train 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:01.530
 do not run people face that crazy 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:09.360
 They'll blow everything up now. 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.360

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.760
 quit fashion demand is very crazy and 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.400
 sic k such was the following now let's see 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.860
 if it works inside the vehicle 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:47.730
 vote here to attract our 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:51.570
 soapbox cart O our peaceful calm 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.570

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:08.980
 Oh my God, dude, it was invincible. 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:11.200
 My old god the police that good not 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.160
 It was my police intention I'm just 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.560
 Playing like you said here, it's our face. 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:24.940
 How crazy will it work? 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.910
 so get out go out then the staff then 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.810
 are these three options explode to attract 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.190
 repel let me do it again now do 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.130
 right 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.750
 I'm going to get into the fire truck here. 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.400
 choke repeat works vehicles 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.120
 I think inside the vehicle there is no 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.120
 it works 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.520
 that 's where it works so look at that 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:54.650
 Soon it comes 20 but it does not work like that 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.380
 to 100 percent is the guy warned Carlos 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:00.110
 area note that it is not 100% operational 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:02.449
 Let's do the following what led to the 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:06.729
 first for the business 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:08.539
 Let's disable this stop here ok. 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.509
