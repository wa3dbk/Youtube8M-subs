00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 it 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.710
 and 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.880
 hello everyone here anthony so 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:42.879
 today I present you and the mini 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:47.199
 governed 6 channels at home so 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:50.350
 reference and manu drawn from the fixed medium 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:57.050
 so it's a simple controller if channel 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:02.500
 tiken to forgiveness so there you go 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:05.000
 rule the channel 1 the t3 so if finder 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:10.850
 what did the six channels find at 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.700
 masters in the end to this side right there 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.539
 interesting there either I miss it when 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.560
 even more interesting so our output 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:34.690
 mixes one plugs so the turn off 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.690
 there we have for his 2 if we want to put the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:44.959
 feeding or otherwise me what I 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.770
 would rather because I use that a 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.240
 friend lends me 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.020
 it's just when I'm going to make 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.920
 messadine i need the khaled epa 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.569
 so when I do a little trick of 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.470
 account because ok I need to control 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.470
 3par of using 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.039
 I even go are the same canals and wells 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:05.530
 so I like and I put it on batteries yes 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:10.880
 I know how to do this not picard and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:17.950
 Montcenis how will already 9 to you 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.950
 seek more karin devalte talk 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:29.660
 home heavens we push is normal 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:34.580
 to light this peace must be dead 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:43.070
 I'm unlucky I ask you as 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:44.300
 it's more convenient for - at the pump 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.850
 the kinds of stuff that's needed 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:53.120
 nails have as I always say I'm 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:55.610
 I cut my nails before that I admit 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.140
 is archi boring so I actually 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.850
 I matured sense there and deceivers and 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.560
 still managed to deceive me 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:06.830
 for a long time here is a yes 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 but here we are 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.180
 usually because when but a 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.060
 light when mx so have already read the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.400
 do I put bridge or red and that one 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.670
 normally turns off the light stays in 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.050
 red 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.300
 apparently it's the said me like 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.820
 it is addressed to the last state we have 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.650
 said so I'm going to show you with a 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.600
 same how does it so that everything to 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.630
 time 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.520
 so here I connected the mini control 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:36.380
 light are a parallel there so 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.760
 you will see when I go up to 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.820
 our are separated using the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.880
 parallel if cannon plus pile hair 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:47.209
 so I ride red 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:50.740
 so we want it to work 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:57.200
 even very well hop tac focus 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.450
 yes it works very well 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.420
 the pincer lierse has for name I know 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.430
 could not still there these blues do not care 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:15.200
 also our fashion we saw that it works 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.060
 nick accompany u to take her blue so 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.070
 when you explain for example if I 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.750
 the purpose is clear 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.250
 during so when if I put blue I 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.080
 can control with the master so 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.080
 general de acts mans 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.790
 finally it's like a control room are it's 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:41.590
 like the exit masters it's the same I 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:45.830
 put everything with eg hop to the point 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.570
 drop objects here are these masters it's 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.700
 all con 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:55.160
 So here it was on the board contests 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.440
 my night 6 x 6 channels who knows very well 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.870
 frankly for matches for 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.490
 settings like that this is good man because 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.860
 that I have another allegro diet that's 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.289
 all this and that 5 japan you see had 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 in there it's a bass drum and 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:11.450
 signoret j24 kent 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.560
 it's useless because when we are 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.250
 in cargo ships that plays a few 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.970
 some colors not really very 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:22.850
 happy no it's not me but shows 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.889
 that we lend it so that's it so I want 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.900
 advice for those who you against 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.139
 parallel or just an azer for 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.210
 control a laser that's enough, that's it 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.460
 so you say goodbye and next 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.760
 for a next video did not see 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.870
 to do a gem and subscribe to the 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.870
 chain go we're going
