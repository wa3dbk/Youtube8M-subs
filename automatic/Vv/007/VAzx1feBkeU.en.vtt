 only the buttocks he will have led or on the 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.240
 real shape tip as I give some 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.890
 practice tips on training 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.960
 could have a healthy weight and well 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.269
 in your skin today I'm talking about 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.950
 foods that have 100 calories so 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 which portions of food will give 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.910
 100 calories I find it interesting 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.410
 because I wanted to give you a little 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.210
 it gives you a grain of perspective 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.430
 take at the same time if voices 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.590
 harvested the same sense of calories in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.080
 does every German and see 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 how do we eat I go when 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.140
 same and that just as an example does it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:40.440
 eat three and a half of broccoli 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:43.950
 in a year or 2,300 united I like to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.829
 the initiative of shades that narrow years 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.340
 Ã©mile is all that broccoli bercy 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.000
 made to eat anyway it's fifteen 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.430
 members 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.250
 channel that is really not huge for 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.890
 100 calories just to see the dance of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.109
 caloric is still interesting 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.850
 I came out hard to have this contract 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.570
 by which I will but I 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.060
 feel a little bit of food that equals 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 5 and therefore made it a lot in 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.299
 ali tight codes for the first 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.979
 capsule and after that maybe I'll 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.740
 will go more in my watches 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:24.390
 avalanche is here so I still 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.850
 as an example not to what saint pie x he 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.040
 there is a little less and brian bread is 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.880
 a little less calories the water about 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.100
 85 calories a little bit more this 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
 will be just the latch calories one is talking about 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.470
 no bed nutrients in it because 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.689
 that's really something else with noah 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.000
 you have quinoa couscous white rice you 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.360
 go sell white rice actually ya 110 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.060
 calories for 125 1000th so a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.290
 half-ton are the Chinese noodles 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.610
 there are 70 love the very amount of a 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:04.890
 small 2 1/2 cup for 60 calories 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.550
 quinoa 70 calories for half an hour 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.800
 still interesting then obviously 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.350
 brown rice the same principle 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.290
 these strands the eye everything is to be screaming 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.290
 there was not much of the boats 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.320
 make the chocolate network small 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.110
 fight in the tiny 100 calories 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:31.900
 for that just sad it's beautiful huh 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.120
 coffee latte drinks so take 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.400
 a cup of coffee with milk without 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.840
 calories it's here me it really 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.370
 struck because I'm someone who 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.210
 like crim my coffee 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.940
 it's like my only dada I swear I 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.010
 have never changed hollow but it's crazy 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.600
 how can it make a difference 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.370
 just to replace my maximum by the 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.860
 lets automatically see different 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.320
 some made the point that to change 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:01.960
 little things I see the effect long 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.340
 term a share a cup of pepsi 110 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.120
 calories that's not something that 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.260
 I start again 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.700
 why am I saying to myself because 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.750
 technically price to eat this 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.360
 theme is probably a bottle 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.570
 without calories it is light at 4 % 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.750
 of alcohol 5 guillaume same thing a half 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.370
 cup of mythos from his holtz grid and 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.740
 understand sangria as a martyr in 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.950
 same time it's twenty-two thousand 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.190
 tons even more it's already his cap 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:36.010
 villa white wine mitards 85 calories 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.140
 but where I have half a cup 99 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.900
 a lady time it's nothing that's a 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.750
 friend get me a lot because the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.760
 portions of the day it's very far not the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.950
 same time it is that it is not much 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.950
 but normally understand it 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.120
 how to do patience I just want 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:58.610
 show examples but do 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.340
 attention to the level of quantities of 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.530
 times the ticket vegetables all that fruits 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.950
 it's amazing how much is closing 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.540
 g versus everything that transforms and that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.489
 take no time without calories on 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.989
 look like nothing but what are you 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.730
 covering I have the strange of pez 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.010
 normally we eat more than one 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.070
 slice tech slicing late in the game 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.120
 strange in the morning and two slices 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.650
 light up in the mass and quickly 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.510
 and not calories they are very 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.139
 very busy with the goal is to go 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.020
 look for the most nutrients possible 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:33.110
 for the same number of calories as x 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.880
 who have a food basically same principle 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.700
 that girls were the puppy that's the 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.460
 spring the biggest but at the same 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.770
 time is that for 67 calories you 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.770
 have 4 g of protein 7 grams of 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.690
 omega-3 fiber 5 so it's really 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.370
 hard to beat this hollow easy to try 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:53.000
 to get the most terminals 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.990
 minerals but nutrients by calories 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.389
 you are going to eat 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.639
 so I was taking a bit on the second 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.500
 capsule with a little more ideas 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.789
 concrete also how for one can 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.630
 change these elements there in our 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.660
 food 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.340
 and then sit down drastically who certainly 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.919
 a little tournament trust because the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:12.320
 the biggest I think it's really 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.979
 make changes without really 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.690
 realize 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.240
 if we do not realize the warehouses 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:18.680
 this film is easy to apply it's 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.570
 when we want to change everything from day to 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.380
 next day I board three the two voices 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.630
 broken I eat all chocolate I 'm naked 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.430
 everything but lucid we do everything backwards 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.620
 I would have forgotten that you in writing 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.010
 table like never and you do not have 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.330
 net minimoys channel change 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.039
 gradually you're going to give it 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.039
 usually then you will not even 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.840
 need to be a little alone principle to the 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.479
 moral of the story leaves its 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.610
 bulletins to make these changes the 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.610
 day with the music is stupid
