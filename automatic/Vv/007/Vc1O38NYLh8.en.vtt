00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to give it a good blend next we go with

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.469 
to give it a good blend next we go with
rubble<00:01:08.520> mix<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:08.970> I'm<00:01:09.030> going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> do<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
rubble mix now I'm going to do the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.289 
rubble mix now I'm going to do the
recipe<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.170> rubble<00:01:10.500> mix<00:01:10.710> okay<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.760> rubble<00:01:12.090> mix

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
recipe for rubble mix okay so rubble mix

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
recipe for rubble mix okay so rubble mix
is<00:01:12.540> another<00:01:12.930> thing<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.350> have<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> whole<00:01:13.950> bunch

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
is another thing we have a whole bunch

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
is another thing we have a whole bunch
of<00:01:14.340> filters<00:01:14.820> broken<00:01:15.150> off<00:01:15.240> buildings<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of filters broken off buildings so this

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.620 
of filters broken off buildings so this
is<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> rural<00:01:16.979> rubble<00:01:17.759> mix<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.150> have<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.299> city

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is a rural rubble mix we have a city

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.820 
is a rural rubble mix we have a city

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
but this rural Rubby make the rubble mix

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.520 
but this rural Rubby make the rubble mix
is<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.200> simple<00:01:25.880> it's<00:01:27.530> premium

what<00:01:41.189> was<00:01:41.340> gonna<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.759> core<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.090> our<00:01:42.299> rubble

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
what was gonna be the core of our rubble

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.319 
what was gonna be the core of our rubble
mix<00:01:42.840> once<00:01:43.740> we<00:01:43.920> got<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> coral<00:01:44.430> rubble<00:01:44.579> mix<00:01:44.909> we

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
mix once we got the coral rubble mix we

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.060 
mix once we got the coral rubble mix we
picked<00:01:45.570> out<00:01:45.780> some<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.290> stones<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.860> color

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
matched them to particular paints and
that<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:49.860> gives<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.280> color<00:01:50.460> scheme<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.939> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that then gives the color scheme for the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.670 
that then gives the color scheme for the
buildings<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.840> we<00:01:51.960> could<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.409> color

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
buildings so that we could kind of color

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
buildings so that we could kind of color
much<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.100> rubble<00:01:53.369> mix<00:01:53.520> -<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
much the rubble mix - this is the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
much the rubble mix - this is the
buildings<00:01:55.380> into<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> walls<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:57.240> Roma<00:01:57.420> mix<00:01:57.659> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
buildings into the walls the Roma mix is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.910 
buildings into the walls the Roma mix is
then<00:01:58.049> mixed<00:01:58.560> with<00:02:00.350> broken-off<00:02:01.350> coffee

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
then mixed with broken-off coffee

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.190 
then mixed with broken-off coffee
stirrers<00:02:02.570> which<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.840> give<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
stirrers which I will give to the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.679 
stirrers which I will give to the
Italian<00:02:04.770> hey<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> go<00:02:05.579> Italian<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.450> will<00:02:06.570> know

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
Italian hey you go Italian you will know

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.820 
Italian hey you go Italian you will know
what<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:08.610> coffee<00:02:08.970> stirrers<00:02:09.830> are

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
what that is so the coffee stirrers are

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.260 
what that is so the coffee stirrers are
you<00:02:11.760> just<00:02:11.970> break<00:02:12.450> them<00:02:12.599> up<00:02:12.720> with<00:02:12.840> your<00:02:12.959> hand

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
you just break them up with your hand

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.750 
you just break them up with your hand
you<00:02:13.630> get<00:02:13.840> lots<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.410> nice<00:02:14.620> little<00:02:14.950> irregular

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
you get lots of nice little irregular

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.240 
you get lots of nice little irregular
putt<00:02:16.120> planks<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.020> break<00:02:17.500> off<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.830> rind<00:02:17.980> adds

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
putt planks so break off the rind adds

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.210 
putt planks so break off the rind adds
edges<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.330> then<00:02:19.450> break<00:02:20.110> them<00:02:20.230> up<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.590> scatter

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
edges and then break them up and scatter

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.940 
edges and then break them up and scatter
them<00:02:21.780> don't<00:02:22.780> put<00:02:23.020> them<00:02:23.140> into<00:02:23.260> your<00:02:23.440> rubble<00:02:23.740> mix

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
them don't put them into your rubble mix

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.980 
them don't put them into your rubble mix
keep<00:02:24.610> them<00:02:24.760> all<00:02:24.910> separate<00:02:25.360> once<00:02:25.720> you've<00:02:25.840> got

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
keep them all separate once you've got

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.070 
keep them all separate once you've got
them<00:02:26.080> separate<00:02:27.510> time<00:02:28.510> to<00:02:28.630> wipe<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:28.930> your

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
them separate time to wipe out your

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.890 
them separate time to wipe out your
model<00:02:29.410> mates<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:30.640> you<00:02:31.000> blast<00:02:31.300> them<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.720> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
model mates if you blast them with a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.540 
model mates if you blast them with a
combination<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.500> sound<00:02:32.740> brown<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.190> mud<00:02:33.340> Brown

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
combination of sound brown and mud Brown

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.830 
combination of sound brown and mud Brown
and<00:02:33.760> shaking<00:02:34.120> them<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.330> whole<00:02:34.450> time<00:02:34.660> while

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
and shaking them the whole time while

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.140 
and shaking them the whole time while
you're<00:02:34.990> blasting<00:02:35.170> them<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:36.010> get<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.910> kind

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
you're blasting them you get that kind

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.650 
you're blasting them you get that kind
of<00:02:37.210> uneven<00:02:38.220> weathered<00:02:39.220> kind<00:02:39.640> of<00:02:39.730> plank<00:02:40.120> tight

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
of uneven weathered kind of plank tight

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.930 
of uneven weathered kind of plank tight
look<00:02:40.930> it'll<00:02:41.680> take<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> fair<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.400> time<00:02:42.700> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
look it'll take a fair bit of time and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.020 
look it'll take a fair bit of time and
it<00:02:43.000> takes<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.270> fair<00:02:43.420> bit<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.690> spray<00:02:44.460> but<00:02:45.460> the

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
it takes a fair bit of spray but the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.850 
it takes a fair bit of spray but the
effect<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.420> very<00:02:46.630> good<00:02:46.810> when<00:02:47.230> you're<00:02:47.410> finished

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
effect is very good when you're finished

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.940 
effect is very good when you're finished
leave<00:02:48.580> them<00:02:48.820> all<00:02:48.970> kind<00:02:49.420> of<00:02:49.480> spread<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.290> but

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
leave them all kind of spread out but

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.580 
leave them all kind of spread out but
not<00:02:51.280> completely<00:02:51.850> spread<00:02:52.210> out<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.230> spread<00:02:53.500> them

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
not completely spread out so spread them

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.480 
not completely spread out so spread them
out<00:02:53.680> in<00:02:53.800> the<00:02:53.860> group<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:55.000> then<00:02:55.920> dusting<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.040> very

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
out in the group and then dusting a very

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.250 
out in the group and then dusting a very
light<00:02:57.730> dusting<00:02:57.760> cuz<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.750> strongest

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
light dusting cuz this is the strongest

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.350 
light dusting cuz this is the strongest
pigment<00:02:59.800> in<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.100> entire<00:03:00.460> range<00:03:00.820> of<00:03:01.060> model

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
pigment in the entire range of model

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.650 
pigment in the entire range of model
mates

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
mates

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.320 
mates
this<00:03:02.110> stuff<00:03:02.320> is<00:03:02.440> all<00:03:02.590> basically<00:03:03.010> dies<00:03:03.400> so<00:03:04.210> it

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
this stuff is all basically dies so it

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.960 
this stuff is all basically dies so it
just<00:03:04.510> sucks<00:03:04.990> right<00:03:05.410> into<00:03:05.710> the<00:03:05.800> wood<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.130> dries

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
just sucks right into the wood and dries

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.560 
just sucks right into the wood and dries
almost<00:03:07.740> instantaneously<00:03:08.740> but<00:03:09.430> this<00:03:09.730> one<00:03:10.000> here

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
almost instantaneously but this one here

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.950 
almost instantaneously but this one here
is<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:10.900> really<00:03:11.500> heavy<00:03:11.950> on<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.220> pigment<00:03:12.430> so

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
is really really heavy on the pigment so

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.450 
is really really heavy on the pigment so
with<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.080> suit<00:03:14.290> light<00:03:14.590> from<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.920> great<00:03:15.190> height

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
with the suit light from a great height

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.220 
with the suit light from a great height
give<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.240> couple<00:03:16.420> of<00:03:16.540> blasts<00:03:16.870> from<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.020> couple

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
give it a couple of blasts from a couple

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.200 
give it a couple of blasts from a couple
of<00:03:17.350> different<00:03:17.590> angles<00:03:17.710> that's<00:03:18.430> it<00:03:18.700> when<00:03:19.120> you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
of different angles that's it when you

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.170 
of different angles that's it when you
shake<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:19.450> up<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.870> then<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.410> some<00:03:21.090> bits<00:03:22.090> of

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
shake it up you then have some bits of

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.910 
shake it up you then have some bits of
the<00:03:22.300> plank<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.870> little<00:03:23.470> burnt<00:03:23.710> edges

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
the plank that have little burnt edges

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.210 
the plank that have little burnt edges
then<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.630> just<00:03:25.840> want<00:03:26.020> to<00:03:26.110> mix<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.620> up<00:03:26.800> into

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
then you just want to mix it all up into

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.400 
then you just want to mix it all up into
a<00:03:27.460> big<00:03:27.910> rubble<00:03:28.510> mix<00:03:28.720> box<00:03:29.140> which<00:03:29.890> just<00:03:30.460> then

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
a big rubble mix box which just then

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.890 
a big rubble mix box which just then
just<00:03:32.410> then<00:03:32.790> stopped<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.030> twat<00:03:34.270> come<00:03:34.780> in

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
just then stopped in the twat come in

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.940 
just then stopped in the twat come in
here<00:03:35.050> and<00:03:35.140> get<00:03:35.230> me<00:03:35.350> the<00:03:35.440> rubble<00:03:35.680> mix<00:03:35.860> box

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
here and get me the rubble mix box

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.950 
here and get me the rubble mix box
standing<00:03:38.950> there<00:03:39.100> being<00:03:39.280> a<00:03:39.460> human<00:03:39.760> mirror<00:03:40.060> so

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
standing there being a human mirror so

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.810 
standing there being a human mirror so
that<00:03:45.210> then<00:03:46.470> becomes<00:03:47.470> your<00:03:47.770> rubble<00:03:48.220> mix<00:03:48.400> you

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
that then becomes your rubble mix you

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.950 
that then becomes your rubble mix you
got<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.710> right<00:03:51.030> we're<00:03:52.030> nearly<00:03:52.210> done<00:03:52.330> I<00:03:52.720> think
