00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
we'll go summer just so you can see the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.479 
we'll go summer just so you can see the
actual<00:00:30.570> functionalities<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:32.219> we'll<00:00:32.369> go

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
actual functionalities of it so we'll go

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.020 
actual functionalities of it so we'll go
through<00:00:32.520> some<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.090> them<00:00:33.180> right<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:35.030> testing

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
through some of them right here testing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.610 
through some of them right here testing
I<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.329> mention<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.600> this<00:00:36.899> top<00:00:37.320> post

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
I want to mention about this top post

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
I want to mention about this top post
important<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> block<00:00:39.270> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
important thing is this is a block for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
important thing is this is a block for
so<00:00:40.200> you're<00:00:40.350> basically<00:00:40.440> got<00:00:40.860> four<00:00:41.250> cores<00:00:41.670> on

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
so you're basically got four cores on

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.170 
so you're basically got four cores on
there<00:00:42.059> it's<00:00:42.120> an<00:00:42.239> NVIDIA<00:00:42.660> Tegra<00:00:42.870> 3<00:00:43.170> processor

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:44.180 
there it's an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.330 
there it's an NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor
so<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.239> got<00:00:45.420> four<00:00:45.840> course<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.559> got<00:00:46.710> four

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
so you got four course but you got four

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.069 
so you got four course but you got four
plus<00:00:47.550> one<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.180> calling<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.660> expert

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
plus one which we're calling the expert

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.439 
plus one which we're calling the expert
core<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:50.430> basically<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.910> phone<00:00:51.239> that

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
core and it's basically a phone that

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
core and it's basically a phone that
will<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> thinking<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:53.129> device

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
will do the thinking for you this device

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.720 
will do the thinking for you this device
most<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.360> get<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.570> perception<00:00:55.170> being<00:00:56.100> 44

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
most people get the perception being 44

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.740 
most people get the perception being 44
is<00:00:56.879> you're<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> drain<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> lot<00:00:57.629> of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
is you're going to drain a lot of

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
is you're going to drain a lot of
battery<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.770> devices<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.699> things<00:00:59.730> for

battery with this devices and things for
you<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.600> those<00:01:01.050> cores<00:01:01.469> are<00:01:01.649> not<00:01:01.770> being

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you and those cores are not being

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.920 
you and those cores are not being
utilized<00:01:02.190> unless<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.390> meet<00:01:03.750> them

extra port which is a fifth floor which
is<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.180> battery<00:01:24.630> consumption<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.409> which<00:01:25.979> would

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is a battery consumption for which would

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.760 
is a battery consumption for which would
generate<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> 500<00:01:27.270> megahertz<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.780> power<00:01:28.020> if
