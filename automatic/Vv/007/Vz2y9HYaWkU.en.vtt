00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.020
 everyone coming to the gym will find out 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.619
 about the usefulness of chicken breasts 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.460
 And also about the fact that it is unnecessary to eat fried 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:31.060
 they need to eat or boiled or 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.690
 of course try boiled 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.680
 not at all tasty with baked in me 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.910
 it turns out pad because I do not have 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.760
 the oven 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.160
 Well, I live like that in the oven 3 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.260
 full of the year somewhere in general all live in 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.910
 spirits somehow got me but 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:53.949
 a year ago my colleagues gave me 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.960
 multicooker you so I learned to cook 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:03.579

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.250

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.660
 tell you how to cook 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.870
 chicken breast in a slow cooker 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:19.350

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:24.460

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.979
 can naturally use any 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.130
 Spice the essence is that no onion 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:37.700
 carrots so that nothing was needed 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:40.909
 brush and cut go 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.750
 I washed the chicken fillet and tore off 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.880
 You know such cranes here. 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.549
 fat in general to keep it as low as possible 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.179
 there was and now bravo naturally butter 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:02:03.619
 I do not add a slow cooker 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:10.849
 knock over these pieces it is very fast 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:12.410
 and conveniently their next salute and here's another 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.599
 once I say that I have about the team 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 the last is enough 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:21.489
 no way not to be honored 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:26.299
 special castor for this whole and 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.829
 pepper are places where there will be a lot of pepper they 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.010
 you know will be just like 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:35.030

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.829
 little fork 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.780
 such a special plastic to not 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.730
 to spoil the slow cooker before that I had 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.620
 such a wooden spoon was very comfortable 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:55.010
 in general mixing it right here can 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:03.150
 This is of course and not very well. 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:05.840
 it will turn out very very very very so 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.290

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.670

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:17.430
