00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:10.870
 her opponent 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.870
 he throws failed 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:23.000
 he could not flip you throw 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:26.750
 you also could not pass the proteus so 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:32.569
 he then turned it, he picks up 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:36.469
 her children give this to you because their children 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:38.979
 did not work you give it to the enemy 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:44.630
 well, in short 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:51.220
 the one who wins ucoz 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:55.789
 who will not have who the game continues 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:02:00.640
 until the moment when any 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.640
 and the circle all the chips will not be transferred 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.840
 and I also want to tell you how to cheat 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.840
 here 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.860
 Yes 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.870
 if you have a stack of chips not 2 it is not 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.290
 help example 3 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:30.030
 you take here so here it is in the middle 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 let's think about it like this 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.280
 turn over here 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.790
 but two are not them 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.930
 the news she turned over well of course not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.120
 turned over okay 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.110
 by the way this is my first rule 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:59.380
 And do not judge the first video strictly 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:05.440

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:11.400
 It turned out he asked for all bye and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.400
 it turned out short but very
