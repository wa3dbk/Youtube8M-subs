00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.950
 and then gang beauty that is already felipe 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.290
 bringing you another video gameplay 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.139
 mended this mission does not align play 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.900
 the black ops of europe and eminem efe met 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.720
 that I did a solo victory or beats 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.210
 the starting tdm without dying any time 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.699
 already in the spoiler on the final score was 1 26 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.179
 Utah bazaar and I was throwing a clear 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.189
 loss of 57 with an attractive 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.860
 game play that looks pretty bad 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.930
 are using it might be that someone likes 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 this mira but my friends do not like 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.290
 I talked to some of them and they 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.239
 They said they think it's really annoying. 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 they do not even use it and I never had 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.809
 I used it for the first time. 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.030
 To give a test I ended up taking this test. 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.190
 gameplay cool, right but I really 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.010
 I did not like it, I did not like it very much. 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 in my opinion she is very close if I 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 have a red dot in the sights 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.500
 itself was a vw website that would be 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.730
 out even better than I could myself 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.979
 leave in this gameplay but of any 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.409
 personally we are already there for two 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 weeks without posting videos, sorry, it's 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.250
 gathered several things and went to the 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.840
 The beach has now returned to my classes now. 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.479
 I'm in the second year of high school 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.610
 school too pull together ne ii ii together 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.810
 other things like soccer academy 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 etc 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.619
 and I'm out of time 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.330
 himself is playing taking place and 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 is recording the videos 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.380
 For you guys, we're there for a long time. 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.600
 without posting I count on the help of 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.850
 You're right, because I stayed two months. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.100
 almost without posting videos now two 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.079
 weeks without posting videos and end half 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.570
 which is complicated in terms of 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.850
 views likes né who wants to go back 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 yes posting videos again have a 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.939
 rhythm nice on youtube 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.009
 It's complicated, but now I go. 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.780
 trying to return without knowing that I always 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.689
 I give priority to my personal life not 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.880
 fill talked about this other times 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.130
 but I'm now trying to keep a 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.530
 legal rhythm of postcards then 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.110
 You can be helping this will be 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.719
 easier to happen beauty 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.180
 sorry for a possible stutter 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.970
 or failed dictioning because I'm pretty 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.400
 time there without posting videos then the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.040
 comment does not stay much on pic is very 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.280
 right so much 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.280
 Good to bet on a video then 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.120
 Sorry, or my comment is more 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.099
 so the staff 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.010
 The subject matter of today's video is about 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.060
 headsets headsets were banished from 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.489
 black ops 2 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.989
 some of you may not understand much 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.670
 well what I'm talking about is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.769
 title so it must be okay finding means 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.170
 strange but quiet there since you will 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:39.170
 to understand is the following with 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.810
 part of the game black ops 2 with 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.209
 sound part of modern warfare 2 game 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.340
 model code was 2 which was the code that 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.319
 I think you have is that the sound part 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.540
 his is best of all 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.129
 it is very easy to make a sound of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.409
 rock for those who do not know how to make rock sound 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.510
 it's basically you hear the steps of 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.049
 enemy players and I think who 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.299
 buy a headset is to buy with and with 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:06.109
 order edit hear the footsteps of 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.510
 enemies and people who have a star or 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.700
 acted as hotel beach until a pendant 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.939
 Um, you know what I'm talking about. 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.549
 in backoffice 2 you do not have as I saw 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.739
 footsteps, so let's go 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.409
 leaving aside the mw2 or that for me was 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.729
 the code has the best sound part is not 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.769
 set aside because he's already well 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:26.690
 did not we get the three emílio 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.430
 rooms was not 3 was the previous code 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.129
 to the blackout both ne 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.299
 and gives a compared with the two is in the mode 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.979
 f3 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.500
 You could hear the steps very well. 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:38.720
 of enemies without some light 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.819
 had because if he had pronep did with 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.919
 that would increase the volume of the facts 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.290
 enemies equal has in the backoffice disease 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:46.849
 none because that's what the air in this 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.129
 Sunday is so pronounced all 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.530
 ages is that the game in English is then 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:53.000
 It may be different from your game. 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.430
 which is probably life in 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.319
 Portuguese then who imposes 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.970
 increases the volume of enemy countries 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.669
 it does not work in two backoffice 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.579
 so in backoffice 2 you 're using 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:06.409
 or organs with headset let's say 5.1 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.680
 that is a trailer you are using 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:12.650
 against the will in mw3 without using the software 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.540
 own is better than you are using 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.159
 awards in the backoffice two then the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.109
 staff really is a mean thing 

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:22.430
 revolting by some because it has a 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:24.860
 people who bought r only 7.42 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.910
 listening to the footsteps of enemies and 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.700
 contradictory even in a way because 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.850
 own ttp arc own activision 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.850
 they launch black ops two headsets 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.410
 knows with all opus 2 design that is 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.960
 basically you are playing and 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.050
 listening to the enemy people and they do is 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.660
 a game with the audible portion as bad as 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.550
 weakened then personal meaning 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.440
 do not buy headsets in the place the two 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.420
 wait a little to buy at the next 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.360
 Infinity ward game is going to be 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.280
 released is always the games of infinity 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.610
 ward are better on the soundtrack in 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.440
 partition horn than those of your haiti mas 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.020
 the black ops 2 for the love of god was 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.600
 champion was trash even until nuno 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.760
 lopes 1 with the ninja prona 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.770
 people are listening well to the steps of 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.050
 enemies in block 2 is 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.550
 practically impossible in just one 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.070
 game mode is that you 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.080
 Troicki chances mode calmer right 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.000
 that does not have much noise that stays 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.440
 enough times you alone on the map 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 against other players you end up 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.700
 able to hear footsteps from enemies 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.890
 very low but there was now if you have 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.900
 playing that pipe form of tim neff net 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.610
 or domination this ends up being 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.980
 impossible because this 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.920
 mode of play you hear a lot 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.350
 shooting noise cars exploding or I know 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.990
 there the own affection the own 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.300
 narrator of the game saying he suffers yes or 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.790
 if not the fifth form of thing of the type e 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.590
 It turns out that there was no way 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.990
 Space of enemies then to close 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.240
 It's personal is a very 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.880
 contradictory on its own account 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.510
 Game producer producing headsets 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:02.220
 producer to produce you 're playing and 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.200
 make a match with partizan is so bad 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.120
 and it is a means for those revolting thing 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.580
 is now buying these headsets in the 

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.230
 backoffice 2 and can not hear the 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.390
 parents of boys then one thing well 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:14.640
 Strange a boring thing that is 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:18.060
 left to wish enough still bancoop 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.710
 the two then review their concepts where 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.570
 is buying a headset in place the 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.340
 two wait a bit to launch the next 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.690
 code of the infinity ward that I think 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.340
 it will be better beauty 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.710
 so this is what everyone's sorry and any 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:30.480
 thing for my diction to give some failed 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.100
 My comment is not very cool, I 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.570
 I have a clue about this 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.430
 But it's that personal, we 're trying. 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.729
 back and pace of portals and I 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.000
 I hope you will help me there, right? 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:42.310
 evaluation and dissemination 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.050
