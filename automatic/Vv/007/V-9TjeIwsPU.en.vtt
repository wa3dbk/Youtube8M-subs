00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 you guys want to know something 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.940
 the other night I went to the cinema a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.660
 I see everything very nice movie 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:14.219
 paolo ruffini is really all very much 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:21.720
 beautiful is fantastic is a masterpiece from 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:24.449
 zynga did not believe us true hello 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 guys welcome to this new video 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.019
 in this new blog 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.300
 in this new chat because it is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.040
 what I want this video to be 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 as you have seen from the title below 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.770
 playstation 4 and xbox one is worth 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.649
 buy her a kind of video of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 summary of this first year a little less 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.660
 and the next generation in which we will look 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
 somehow going to comb through 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.550
 in detail more or less what they are 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.840
 the aspects that have characterized 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.210
 these two new consoles 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.770
 indeed this new sony console because 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 it's the one I own. I have one 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.629
 playstation 4 currently more or less a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.820
 year ago so around November 2013 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.710
 if I'm not mistaken and there is a video there 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.650
 I'll link here where he was talking about 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.540
 my choice of my choice of mine 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 console that he had purchased of the next 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.100
 generation that I would have embraced or 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.350
 the playstation 4 a video that was 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.150
 loaded after that deleted all 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.400
 old videos of the channel due to problems with 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.340
 copyright and that can be said to be the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.840
 my first honeycomb channel 2.0 video 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.850
 so in short we try in some way 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.350
 also to close the circle and from this 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 point of view therefore since I have 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.390
 bought the playstation 4 have passed 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.509
 about 11 months then almost a year one 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.159
 it's not what I bought so many games 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.130
 I have to be honest 4 watts and all 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.360
 list of those I bought and yes 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.579
 treats more or less than 65 70 percent of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.280
 all video games released 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.320
 actually on playstation 4 between 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.439
 exclusive and multi-platform so yes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.479
 can say that I have a good luggage here 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.250
 regarding the next generation 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.619
 as for the titles released 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.930
 on new consoles however always 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.119
 referring to this list not 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 there is no title no video game e 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.780
 no triple that made me say 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.930
 cabbage I bought from playstation 4 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.140
 spent 400 and passes the euro and is worth the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.060
 penalty if you knew if you knew it existed 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.640
 I would do this game again 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.260
 in short, looking ahead, I really am 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.990
 glad to have bought playstation 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.209
 4 no does not exist there is no game of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.880
 this list and truly worthwhile 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.480
 to buy a next gen console 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.010
 and this thing is very very serious at least 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.770
 from my point of view because anyway 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.989
 I have always been convinced that 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.400
 in short, videogames make them video games 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.380
 one thing cannot be as beautiful as 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 I wanted to be as powerful as I was 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.390
 you want but without video games does not go 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.220
 their gasoline is nowhere 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.080
 in short, to give a striking example 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.510
 to the playstation life and a console 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.760
 with enormous potential and have been 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.610
 outdated and true, however, when they came out 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.410
 a truly fantastic console with 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.010
 this touchscreen this power 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.410
 hardware 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.100
 however without games it did not go to 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.900
 no part 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.360
 here is the same for playstation 4 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.030
 without games that are really worth it 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.769
 being bought a console can not 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 however, it is very far to go 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.209
 admit that I wouldn't say it would be from 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.730
 country hypocrites there is a 4 of the specific 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.590
 has sold a bang even xbox one ha 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.769
 sold a lot it is 10 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.360
 millions of copies sold of the console 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.880
 regarding the shaun 4 thesis which 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.829
 they will have also become 11 12 and of many 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.209
 millions also the xbox one then from 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:35.980
 this point of view from the point of view 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.170
 commercial can be said that the two 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.840
 consoles went just fine though 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.670
 objectively I would say that there is none 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.560
 title that is really worth the effort 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.190
 spend so much money on one 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.320
 consul 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.329
 here I see killzone charlot folk e 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:53.010
 was my first assassin's creed title 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:57.549
 4 black flag infamous if console tim 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.980
 walsh dorks destiny outlast okay that one 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.530
 it was still a port with many others 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.590
 the land of a very recent drive 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.660
 a club that drive club is not 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.690
 still gone in place after all these 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.160
 truly scandalous days here is none 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.870
 of these titles none of these 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.269
 video games are really worth it 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.130
 can say that between this list that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.900
 which convinced me the most I think 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.310
 may be the middle ground the shadow of 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.830
 mordor even if it is not 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.840
 indeed of a true masterpiece e 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.680
 just as it was of the blocked up 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.650
 playstation 3 is a discreet good game 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.740
 above average compared to others though 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.050
 still not that killer app that 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.729
 really makes it look ok 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.430
 I have to buy the new console here 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.590
 so at this point I just have to 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.409
 wait and hope for the future because 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.050
 this 2014 is full of titles from here 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:52.030
 in the end, however, 2015 is something 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.860
 fantastic probably for how long 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.990
 it's about video games hopefully 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.610
 expectations in this regard do not come 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.830
 disappointed as for the most part 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.090
 unfortunately I have to admit it of the titles 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.159
 come out on next gen 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.800
 so far so hype to the stars and 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.250
 then actually the results don't 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.220
 they see 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.780
 we hope that in 2015 the thing is reversed 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.400
 so guys to get to one 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.659
 conclusion of this video that 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.550
 probably did not lead to anything 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.050
 because it is a chat 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.000
 so without having written anything 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.490
 indeed so just so 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.890
 spontaneous I can say that in these first 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:26.080
 eleven twelve months I was disappointed 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.710
 disappointed by this new generation of 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.380
 consul 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.539
 I was expecting a lot more also 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.640
 that there are still so many cross gen 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.470
 that there are still so many portings 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:38.380
 are other reasons why really 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:40.599
 guys worth going to 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.909
 so if you do it right now 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.890
 that based playstation 3 or xbox 360 

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.450
 not both of you feel guilty in 

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:48.310
 some way of not having been yet 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.169
 a next gen console changed its mind 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.360
 unfortunately one of them has it 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.760
 try that is living every day 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.490
 the new consoles are not worth not 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.700
 it is not convenient to pass next time 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.700
 January 

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:05.110
 I thank the boys as usual 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:06.460
 for following me I remind you not even 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.680
