00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
I've done because it's one of the most

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.950 
I've done because it's one of the most
interesting<00:00:22.619> applications<00:00:23.519> developed<00:00:24.449> by

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
interesting applications developed by

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.050 
interesting applications developed by
one<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.380> most<00:00:25.560> amazing<00:00:25.859> developers<00:00:26.490> Erica

saloon now this is extremely interesting

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.620 
saloon now this is extremely interesting
because<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.660> utilizes<00:00:31.669> what<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.450> be

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
because it utilizes what I think to be

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.450 
because it utilizes what I think to be
one<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> most<00:00:34.290> impressive<00:00:34.710> features<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
one of the most impressive features of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.119 
one of the most impressive features of
line<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.420> unfortunately<00:00:37.410> Apple<00:00:37.829> didn't

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
line but unfortunately Apple didn't

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.979 
line but unfortunately Apple didn't
really<00:00:38.399> develop<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> its<00:00:39.390> full<00:00:39.629> potential

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
really develop it to its full potential

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.590 
really develop it to its full potential
and<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> resumed<00:00:41.070> now<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:42.149> resume

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
and that is resumed now what resume

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.799 
and that is resumed now what resume
allows<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:44.149> it<00:00:45.149> being<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.539> part

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
actually close an application to go out

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.160 
actually close an application to go out
an<00:00:50.460> application<00:00:50.610> all<00:00:51.059> together<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.539> when<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
an application all together and when you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.959 
an application all together and when you
reopen<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.800> application<00:00:53.340> all<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.850> your

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
reopen the application all of your

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.279 
reopen the application all of your
windows<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> all<00:00:54.660> of<00:00:54.809> your<00:00:54.930> previous

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
windows and all of your previous

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.350 
windows and all of your previous
sessions<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.070> restored<00:00:56.460> so<00:00:57.059> for<00:00:57.239> example

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sessions are restored so for example

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.510 
sessions are restored so for example
let's<00:00:57.690> say<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:57.960> was<00:00:58.230> writing<00:00:58.500> an<00:00:58.710> email<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.280> mail

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
let's say I was writing an email in mail

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760 
let's say I was writing an email in mail
and<00:00:59.910> rather<00:01:00.719> than<00:01:00.870> having<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.230> save<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> draft

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
and rather than having to save a draft

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.380 
and rather than having to save a draft
and<00:01:02.010> remember<00:01:02.430> where<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> draft<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.180> saved

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
and remember where that draft was saved

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.329 
and remember where that draft was saved
I<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.080> quit<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> application<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
I can just quit the application and the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.340 
I can just quit the application and the
next<00:01:05.519> time<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> open<00:01:06.119> mail<00:01:06.299> boom<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
next time I open mail boom I'm in the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.160 
next time I open mail boom I'm in the
exact<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:07.950> spot<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.640> before<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.720> problem

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
exact same spot I was before the problem

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.570 
exact same spot I was before the problem
with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> presume<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.220> a<00:01:11.310> lot<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
with the presume is there's a lot of

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.060 
with the presume is there's a lot of
applications<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.420> use<00:01:12.869> resume<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.890> i

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
applications that use resume that i

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
applications that use resume that i
really<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:14.820> want<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.420> use<00:01:15.570> resume<00:01:15.960> and

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
really don't want to use resume and

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
really don't want to use resume and
unfortunately<00:01:16.710> resume<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.280> only<00:01:17.520> opt-in<00:01:18.090> or

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
unfortunately resume is only opt-in or

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.190 
unfortunately resume is only opt-in or
opt-out<00:01:18.390> by<00:01:19.080> default<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.299> what<00:01:21.299> resume<00:01:21.930> inator

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
opt-out by default so what resume inator

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
opt-out by default so what resume inator
allows<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.130> select<00:01:24.060> exactly<00:01:24.990> which

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
allows you to do is select exactly which

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
allows you to do is select exactly which
applications<00:01:25.860> can<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.549> cannot<00:01:26.939> use<00:01:27.210> resume

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
applications can and cannot use resume

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
applications can and cannot use resume
so<00:01:28.170> i<00:01:28.200> will<00:01:28.650> talk<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
so i will talk to you about the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.980 
so i will talk to you about the
application<00:01:29.640> but<00:01:29.939> again<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> rather<00:01:30.630> very

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
application but again it's rather very

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.620 
application but again it's rather very
simple<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.890> let's<00:01:32.400> say<00:01:32.490> textedit<00:01:33.240> always<00:01:33.869> uses

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
simple so let's say textedit always uses

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
simple so let's say textedit always uses
always<00:01:36.630> uses<00:01:37.009> resume<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.130> i<00:01:38.430> never<00:01:38.579> want<00:01:39.030> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
always uses resume and i never want it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.310 
always uses resume and i never want it
to<00:01:39.150> use<00:01:39.390> resume<00:01:39.689> i<00:01:39.780> don't<00:01:39.960> care<00:01:40.110> about<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to use resume i don't care about the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
to use resume i don't care about the
last<00:01:40.590> documents<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> are<00:01:41.310> open<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.939> use

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
last documents that are open i only use

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.690 
last documents that are open i only use
text<00:01:42.600> edit<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.960> view<00:01:43.200> pdfs<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
text edit to view pdfs and the like and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.940 
text edit to view pdfs and the like and
you<00:01:45.270> know<00:01:45.360> previews<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.810> same<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.229> i<00:01:46.259> say<00:01:46.500> no
