00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
which one it is by no comply but it is a

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.740 
which one it is by no comply but it is a
great<00:04:38.130> tape<00:04:38.400> and<00:04:38.670> is<00:04:38.760> perfectly<00:04:39.240> worked<00:04:39.540> in

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
great tape and is perfectly worked in

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.010 
great tape and is perfectly worked in
and<00:04:40.730> there's<00:04:41.730> also<00:04:41.880> a<00:04:42.000> no<00:04:42.180> comply<00:04:42.450> sticker<00:04:42.810> on

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
and there's also a no comply sticker on

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.140 
and there's also a no comply sticker on
here<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:43.800> why<00:04:44.010> I<00:04:44.040> kind<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.550> wanted<00:04:45.000> to

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
here and that's why I kind of wanted to

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.580 
here and that's why I kind of wanted to
give<00:04:45.330> him<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.720> mixed<00:04:46.020> matched<00:04:46.260> wheels

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
give him the mixed matched wheels

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.830 
give him the mixed matched wheels
because<00:04:46.980> the<00:04:47.220> yellow<00:04:47.430> and<00:04:47.610> green<00:04:47.850> kind<00:04:48.690> of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
because the yellow and green kind of

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.930 
because the yellow and green kind of
matched<00:04:49.080> the<00:04:49.590> sticker<00:04:49.890> right<00:04:50.160> there<00:04:50.430> so<00:04:50.910> I

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
matched the sticker right there so I

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.050 
matched the sticker right there so I
thought<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.150> would<00:04:51.330> look<00:04:51.480> pretty<00:04:51.690> cool<00:04:53.060> so

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
thought that would look pretty cool so

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.340 
thought that would look pretty cool so
yeah<00:04:54.210> so<00:04:54.360> basically<00:04:54.510> I'm<00:04:54.840> sending<00:04:55.170> him<00:04:55.320> a

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.040 
yeah so basically I'm sending him a
complete<00:04:55.800> as<00:04:55.980> an<00:04:56.220> extra<00:04:56.610> because<00:04:57.480> he<00:04:57.810> said<00:04:58.020> the
