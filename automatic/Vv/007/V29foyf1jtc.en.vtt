00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 day by day ethnic cuisine 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.089
 vegan leaves me pleasantly without 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.490
 words I enjoy experimenting with new ones 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 recipes from the hemp seeds 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.780
 sativa we got a milk 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 vegetable and this will be our subject 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.570
 before leaving to get tofu 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.560
 of carp also known as it is 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 let's see how to prepare this 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.560
 particular vegetable cheese for about 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.560
 100 grams of hemp mice a liter of 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.560
 hemp seed milk 4 grams of 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.160
 ingari or a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.140
 rice vinegar 100 milliliters of water a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.700
 pinch of salt 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.059
 we said that the raw material of the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.829
 hemp tofu emphoux is the milk in of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.829
 hemp seeds that I have already provided 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.629
 to prepare the realization is 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.850
 very simple it takes 100 grams of seeds 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 hemp I took the whole ones 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.350
 so not peeled I left them in 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.660
 soak in 200 milliliters of water per 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.309
 two hours after which it offers him a sides 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.829
 in the same soaking water and I have 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.320
 gradually added another 800 thousand liters 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.740
 of water after which or filtered throughout 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.860
 divided locara by the liquid and this is the 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:15.320
 our home milk to make tofu 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 Now let's go ahead and pour all the milk 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.619
 inside a saucepan I have 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.619
 chose a stone casserole 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.189
 now we have to bring hemp milk 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.360
 at 80 85 degrees and you will see that at 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.720
 reaching this temperature 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.820
 proteins also begin to coagulate 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.740
 without adding other substances 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.009
 but as I want to increase to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.380
 maximum tofu yield I add a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.390
 let's call it a coagulating agent 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 or what remains after having 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.659
 extract sodium chloride from water 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.460
 marina then how to do it 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.420
 in a saucepan I poured 100 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.280
 milliliters of water hot gas a little later 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.280
 of which I will go to dissolve ours 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.229
 deny as an alternative to the races you can 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.930
 put a tablespoon of lemon juice 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.280
 or a tablespoon of apple vinegar or 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.250
 rice vinegar 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.140
 I told you, let's put the mini races on 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.140
 purchased online but you can find it 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.290
 even in organic stores or to whom 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.000
 you can request a pharmacy 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.730
 maybe melt with a stick of 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.550
 wood and practically melts 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.120
 instantly 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:39.910
 we move into the casserole we see the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 then we are 50 degrees temperature 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.810
 we wait a little longer 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.360
 we are now at 78 degrees and you can see 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.970
 already has the formation of clots like vi 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.330
 I said before to increase the yield 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.519
 we also join in garhi a little at a time 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.870
 thus continuing to stir for about 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.870
 30 seconds a minute 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.320
 I'm doing these operations on one 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.060
 stone pan though if used 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 those of steel I recommend before 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.310
 pour the hot liquid on a bowl 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.310
 of glass 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 this to prevent the clots 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.720
 fall unevenly 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.150
 at this point we can also turn off the 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.340
 fire 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.710
 and leave it in about 10 minutes so 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.890
 that the curd is formed to perfection 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.480
 after ten minutes we can add to 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:47.350
 like a pinch of salt 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:50.650
 ok we move into a bowl I prepare 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:56.260
 a colander with a cloth I am 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:00.570
 also moistened among other things and then with 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:06.030
 a skimmer before we live the curd 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.030
 il and settle inside the pigtail 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.859
 this is the result clearly below 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.270
 there is also a part of the is a part 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:25.270
 because the rest I kept inside 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.400
 in the saucepan you can also avoid 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.650
 throw it away which was a thought because in 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.410
 kitchen you can reuse everything 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.389
 and you can use it as a liquid for 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.650
 to knead the bread or to make 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.570
 meatballs 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.050
 if you move forward you can also give a drink 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.960
 to the plants to give the best shape 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.990
 to our hemp mouse we can also 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:52.449
 fill a stencil the fuscella 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:54.160
 in short, if you like soft, avoid 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.360
 crush it too much otherwise it more 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.840
 crush it so the more you do it 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.530
 Drip more will remain compact and solid 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.889
 from these doses 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:06.520
 you will get about 100 120 g of touch of 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.520
 hemp let it drip about 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.770
 an hour maybe with a weight on it and then it 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:16.300
 we can taste fraction prepare the 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.610
 true hemp tofu 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.220
 this is the result after an hour of 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.139
 drip after which I left in 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.300
 fridge so it was take a lot 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.460
 well I also show insulted 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.199
 you see soft and compact to the point 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.020
 just my presentation idea 

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.130
 with a bit of vegetables a goccino of oil 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.130
 extra virgin olive oil on top 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:40.300
 better yet if you find seed oil 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.110
 of hemp you can use it 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.610
 as is done with a certain amount of soy then for 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.830
 make desserts or like 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:50.940
 appetizer unleash your imagination 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.940
 have fun in the kitchen
