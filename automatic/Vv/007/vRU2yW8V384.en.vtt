00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:15.389
 slide with you and today we'll talk about 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.060
 new premium machine m4a 3rd 8 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.050
 sherman fury do you think that this is normal 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.960
 m4a 3 and 8 sherman but with no fury sign 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.120
 it's not at all so sit back 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 now tell you what kind of car and where 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.789
 it can be purchased and of course others 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.170
 Interesting also tell many love 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.530
 call a different technique 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 proper names and Americans don't 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.800
 exception so the proper names for 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.769
 Tank order of things 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.420
 m4 fury existed in reality I 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.829
 spent several hours searching 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.929
 information about this tank 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.659
 his adventures but you are nothing 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.249
 heroic could not find about this tank 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.889
 it is known that he was assigned 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.229
 66 tank regiment and participated in 

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:01.909
 operations cobra in normandy which 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:04.199
 held from July 25 to July 31, 1944 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.180
 perhaps this information 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.070
 inspired script writer and director 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.049
 david eyre movie 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.960
 and largely thanks to him in the world of 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.360
 tanks appeared yuri in the fury game is 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.390
 modification of the linear tank m4 a three d 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 8 I also again which part of the strength 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 both tanks 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.850
 equally 750 units first what 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.859
 striking when watching tth 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 fury is that its mass is about 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.649
 four tons more linear mass 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.899
 machine that is 34 tonnes compared to 30 n 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.880
 learning it while booking is not 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.210
 changed although it has such a mass 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.189
 assault tank m4 sherman jumbo frontal 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 body armor 100 millimeters and armor 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.049
 towers up to one hundred fifty two millimeters 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.329
 fury 63 frontal armor 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.939
 millimeter with a slope of 48 degrees it 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.340
 about 100 millimeters is given to the board and 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.770
 feed significant more vulnerable there are only 38 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.869
 millimeters without tilt were with a little 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.770
 tilt feed tower booking 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.259
 circular 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.659
 63 mm with minimal slopes 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.560
 I think you understand that this is not the tank 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.689
 the best candidate for getting staked 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.520
 walls however such level reserves 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.390
 typical of medium machines of the sixth level 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 in our game 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 engine on both machines remains 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.860
 he gives the same no uri on 20 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.930
 horsepower less than 500 they are 502 of these 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.310
 data is easy to bring the load of machines 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.280
 14 horses per ton 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.950
 fury and 17 horses per tonne and linear 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.380
 part by the way the maximum speed ahead fury 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.390
 stabbed to 42 kilometers ahead against 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.970
 48 fate a ago 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 both tanks travel at the same speed 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.170
 18 kilometers per hour 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.739
 perspektivka the dark as I can see no 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.260
 worry 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.000
 go further good growth rate 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.970
 turning the chassis and fury by 10 percent 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.459
 higher than u part of 44 degrees second 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.110
 against forty on the fury set the radio 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.120
 typical for American straight 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.310
 she hits at 570 meters in the playroom 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.400
 reality reviews have tanks match up 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.519
 370 meters for both tanks installed 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.349
 gun m 12 caliber 76 millimeters 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.120
 characteristics of the gun one hundred and twenty 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.330
 eight millimeters breakdown on armor piercing 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.310
 and 177 and liters breakdown on the subcaler on 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.579
 damage on these types of projectile is 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.980
 115 units of extinct 85 damage 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.549
 with a penetrating power of 38 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.670
 items 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.290
 accuracy of the gun is low scatter 0 4 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.170
 meters for every 100 meters distance 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.780
 but decent rate of fire more 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.579
 18 shots per minute that is dpm on i 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.459
 the characteristic of both tanks exceeds 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:31.720
 2000 and there is no information but two integers 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.420
 three tenths of a second 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.090
 angle of declination of guns and thousands of degrees 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.690
 elevation angles of 25 degrees over these 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.519
 indicators 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.730
 both tanks are equal if you look at 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.230
 identical towers although the gun m1a 2 in 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.069
 linear tanks put only on 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.920
 top 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.319
 the tower is such a trick from the developers we 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.400
 dismantled all the important tth fury and now 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:53.439
 it's time to talk about 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.329
 additional acquisition of this 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.819
 I recommend taking a car without modules 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.639
 rammer stabilizer and enlightened 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.829
 optics principle if the crew you are very 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.930
 experienced then you can replace after confusion on 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.489
 fan in the equipment bar 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.019
 sticking a set consisting of 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.780
 big set of small 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:13.750
 repair kit and first aid kit though no one 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.579
 prevents from replacing a small repair on a box of cola 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.750
 let's not forget that fury is 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.000
 premium tank 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.340
 which means in the individual crews are not 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.080
 needs a number of vacancies on the tank 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.300
 5 that matches most 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.400
 crew numbers on american 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.440
 medium tanks that is , we have all the members 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.120
 crews line eats with moms hard 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.099
 pump on this tank 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.710
 due to the bonus recently introduced for 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.780
 all premium device remains to add 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.789
 that fury fall into fights sixth 8 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.820
 levels as well as line brother 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.979
 it's time to take stock of the fury tank 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.270
 will be interesting first of all 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.639
 a collector like me and many 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.500
 others and in the second topic who like 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:53.080
 film rage thanks to which 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.449
 actually it appeared in the game 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.310
 Well, in the third tank is amazing 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:00.130
 Detail and wait for the model of the device 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.620
 hung with helmets gas mask and other 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.990
 mounted elements I think this is the 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.000
 detailed tank model in our game on 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.400
 October 2014 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.550
 sherman fury will be sold 17 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.009
 October to November 17, 2014 in two 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.919
