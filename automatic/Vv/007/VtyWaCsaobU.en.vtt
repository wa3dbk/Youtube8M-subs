00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
angle measured in radians so for the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.490 
angle measured in radians so for the
earth<00:00:31.140> R<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.769> equal<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.250> three<00:00:32.820> thousand<00:00:33.500> nine

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
earth R is equal to three thousand nine

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.420 
earth R is equal to three thousand nine
hundred<00:00:34.649> sixty<00:00:35.070> miles<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.070> problem

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
hundred sixty miles and for this problem

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.119 
hundred sixty miles and for this problem
the<00:00:38.550> central<00:00:38.910> angle<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.480> four<00:00:39.960> minutes<00:00:40.140> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the central angle is four minutes so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.020 
the central angle is four minutes so
theta<00:00:41.370> equals<00:00:41.790> four<00:00:42.270> minutes<00:00:43.670> which<00:00:44.670> must<00:00:44.940> be

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
theta equals four minutes which must be

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.869 
theta equals four minutes which must be
converted<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.780> radians<00:00:46.500> let's<00:00:47.399> first<00:00:47.640> convert

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
converted to radians let's first convert

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.590 
converted to radians let's first convert
to<00:00:48.120> degrees<00:00:48.829> since<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:50.070> minute<00:00:50.390> equals<00:00:51.390> one

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
to degrees since one minute equals one

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.290 
to degrees since one minute equals one
sixtieth<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.230> degree<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> four<00:00:54.030> minutes

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
sixtieth of a degree so four minutes

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930 
sixtieth of a degree so four minutes
would<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.480> equal<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.960> four<00:00:55.489> times<00:00:56.489> one

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
would be equal to four times one

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.680 
would be equal to four times one
sixtieth<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.930> degree<00:00:59.390> notice<00:01:00.390> we<00:01:00.510> write

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
sixtieth of a degree notice we write

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
sixtieth of a degree notice we write
four<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.739> will<00:01:01.949> simplify<00:01:02.480> there's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
four over one this will simplify there's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.260 
four over one this will simplify there's
one<00:01:04.019> four<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.320> four<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.070> fifteen<00:01:05.280> fours<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.710 
one four and four and fifteen fours and
sixty<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> where<00:01:07.920> angle<00:01:08.189> theta<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.790> equal<00:01:09.540> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
sixty so where angle theta is equal to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.120 
sixty so where angle theta is equal to
one<00:01:10.080> fifteenth<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:11.030> a<00:01:12.030> degree<00:01:12.979> but<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.070> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
one fifteenth of a degree but now we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.219 
one fifteenth of a degree but now we
need<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> convert<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.210> angle<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.540> degrees<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
need to convert the angle and degrees to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.160 
need to convert the angle and degrees to
radians<00:01:16.340> so<00:01:17.340> our<00:01:17.460> angle<00:01:17.700> theta<00:01:18.110> would<00:01:19.110> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
radians so our angle theta would be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.130 
radians so our angle theta would be
equal<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.650> one<00:01:19.979> fifteenth<00:01:20.610> of<00:01:20.880> degree<00:01:21.630> times

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
equal to one fifteenth of degree times

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.130 
equal to one fifteenth of degree times
to<00:01:23.070> convert<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.490> degrees<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> radians<00:01:24.140> we

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
to convert from degrees to radians we

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.920 
to convert from degrees to radians we
multiply<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:25.920> pi<00:01:26.750> divided<00:01:27.750> by<00:01:27.780> 180<00:01:28.439> degrees

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
multiply by pi divided by 180 degrees

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.210 
multiply by pi divided by 180 degrees
notice<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> units<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.619> degrees<00:01:31.979> would

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
notice how the units of degrees would

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
notice how the units of degrees would
simplify<00:01:32.549> out<00:01:32.909> leaving<00:01:33.270> us<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.049> pi<00:01:35.630> divided

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
simplify out leaving us with pi divided

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.399 
simplify out leaving us with pi divided

thousand seven hundred and this would be
radians

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.760 

which<00:01:47.140> means<00:01:47.439> your<00:01:47.619> arc<00:01:47.799> length<00:01:48.070> s<00:01:48.430> is<00:01:49.770> equal

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
seven hundred radians and now we'll go

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.800 
seven hundred radians and now we'll go
the<00:02:03.310> calculator<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.640> we<00:02:06.670> have<00:02:06.880> three<00:02:07.240> thousand

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
the calculator so we have three thousand

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.290 
the calculator so we have three thousand
nine<00:02:08.020> hundred<00:02:08.140> sixty<00:02:08.880> times<00:02:09.880> pi<00:02:12.180> divided<00:02:13.180> by

two thousand seven hundred to three

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.199 
two thousand seven hundred to three
decimal<00:02:20.560> places<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.670> arc<00:02:21.850> length<00:02:21.940> would<00:02:22.150> be

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
decimal places the arc length would be

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.050 
decimal places the arc length would be
approximately<00:02:22.769> four<00:02:23.769> point<00:02:24.130> six<00:02:24.670> zero<00:02:24.790> eight

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
approximately four point six zero eight

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.710 
approximately four point six zero eight
and<00:02:25.569> because<00:02:26.470> your<00:02:26.650> radius<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.100> in<00:02:27.220> miles<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
and because your radius is in miles the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.690 
and because your radius is in miles the
arc<00:02:28.900> length<00:02:28.959> is<00:02:29.200> in<00:02:29.319> miles<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.370> arc<00:02:30.610> length

arc length on the surface of the earth

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.830 
arc length on the surface of the earth
this<00:02:49.079> length<00:02:49.409> here<00:02:49.799> would<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.849> approximately

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
this length here would be approximately

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.559 
this length here would be approximately

course one fifteenth of the degree is a
very<00:02:56.340> small<00:02:56.639> angle<00:02:56.840> would<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.900> much<00:02:58.139> smaller

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
very small angle would be much smaller
