00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
actually I want to share one more thing

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.330 
actually I want to share one more thing
I<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.630> really<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:13.079> and<00:03:13.319> this<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I really really like and this is just a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.740 
I really really like and this is just a
feature<00:03:14.579> that<00:03:14.730> they<00:03:14.970> added<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.360> think<00:03:15.599> it's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
feature that they added but I think it's

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.809 
feature that they added but I think it's
just<00:03:15.810> makes<00:03:16.290> such<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.590> difference<00:03:16.709> so<00:03:17.579> if<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.730> go

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
just makes such a difference so if we go

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.509 
just makes such a difference so if we go
to<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.120> PC<00:03:18.480> here<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.530> click<00:03:19.799> you<00:03:20.489> see
