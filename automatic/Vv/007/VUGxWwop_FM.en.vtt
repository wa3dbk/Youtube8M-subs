00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
than it is on xbox so that's the reason

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.830

a<00:00:21.270> pretty<00:00:21.570> interesting<00:00:21.900> wrote<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.859> start<00:00:23.100> off

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
a pretty interesting wrote to start off

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.920 
a pretty interesting wrote to start off
the<00:00:23.250> round<00:00:23.609> even<00:00:24.240> though<00:00:24.480> it's<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:24.689> very

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the round even though it's not very

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
the round even though it's not very
practical<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.830> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.699> novelty

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
practical it's kind of more of a novelty

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320 
practical it's kind of more of a novelty
route<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:28.189> it<00:00:29.189> ends<00:00:29.460> up<00:00:29.550> costing<00:00:29.820> me<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.119> life

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
route but it ends up costing me a life

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
route but it ends up costing me a life
and<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> guess<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.460> I<00:00:32.489> probably

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
and I guess right here I probably

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.799 
and I guess right here I probably
shouldn't<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.180> been<00:00:33.329> shooting<00:00:33.660> so

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
shouldn't have been shooting so

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.600 
shouldn't have been shooting so
recklessly<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.010> guy<00:00:35.130> knew<00:00:35.340> exactly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
recklessly because the guy knew exactly

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.069 
recklessly because the guy knew exactly
where<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:36.000> was<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> he<00:00:36.420> knifed<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> back

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
where I was and he knifed me in the back

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.500 
where I was and he knifed me in the back
if<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.040> played<00:00:38.489> more<00:00:38.700> sneekly<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.149> probably

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
if I played more sneekly I probably

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.150 
if I played more sneekly I probably
could<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.870> gotten<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.230> few<00:00:40.379> kills<00:00:40.649> at<00:00:40.890> round

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
could have gotten a few kills at round

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.700 
could have gotten a few kills at round
and<00:00:41.489> had<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> better<00:00:42.059> game<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.629> anyways<00:00:43.500> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and had a better game but anyways that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.400 
and had a better game but anyways that
was<00:00:43.739> my<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.879> last<00:00:45.000> death<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.140> this

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
was my first and last death of this

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.029 
was my first and last death of this
match<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.950> end<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.059> getting<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.450> 17<00:00:48.960> k<00:00:49.289> d<00:00:49.350> which<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
match I end up getting a 17 k d which is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.639 
match I end up getting a 17 k d which is
pretty<00:00:50.460> good<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:51.030> search<00:00:51.899> and<00:00:51.960> destroy<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.500> my

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pretty good for search and destroy in my

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.630 
pretty good for search and destroy in my
opinion<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.210> think<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.620> two<00:00:56.190> aces<00:00:56.610> in

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
opinion I think that I get two aces in

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.610 
opinion I think that I get two aces in
this<00:00:56.850> game<00:00:56.940> play<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.809> one<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.079> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
this game play the first one is this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
this game play the first one is this
round<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> other<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.789> is<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.149> a

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
round and I think the other one is in a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.439 
round and I think the other one is in a
round<00:01:00.629> or<00:01:00.809> two<00:01:00.840> after<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.100> I'll<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:03.329> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
round or two after this so I'll if you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
round or two after this so I'll if you
guys<00:01:03.570> watch<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.080> round<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.470> can<00:01:04.500> probably

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
guys watch this round you can probably

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.320 
guys watch this round you can probably
learn<00:01:05.010> something<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.850> rush<00:01:06.090> route

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
learn something about this rush route

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.120 
learn something about this rush route
it's<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> pretty<00:01:06.840> good<00:01:06.990> rush<00:01:07.200> route<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.650> works

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
it's a pretty good rush route that works

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.190 
it's a pretty good rush route that works
a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> time<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.720> don't<00:01:09.750> want<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> use

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
a lot of the time you don't want to use

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.260 
a lot of the time you don't want to use
it<00:01:10.229> too<00:01:10.500> much<00:01:10.650> in<00:01:10.920> one<00:01:11.280> game<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.000> people

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it too much in one game because people

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.330 
it too much in one game because people
will<00:01:12.360> start<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.659> figure<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.080> but<00:01:13.470> that's

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
will start to figure you out but that's

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
will start to figure you out but that's
I<00:01:14.640> guess<00:01:14.700> universal<00:01:15.689> rule<00:01:15.840> for<00:01:16.140> all<00:01:16.350> Call<00:01:16.650> of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I guess universal rule for all Call of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.730 
I guess universal rule for all Call of
Duty<00:01:16.950> games<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:17.850> all<00:01:18.720> games<00:01:19.080> app<00:01:19.500> search

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
Duty games or all all games app search

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.649 
Duty games or all all games app search
and<00:01:19.890> destroy<00:01:20.009> in<00:01:20.250> them<00:01:20.369> or<00:01:20.490> whatever<00:01:20.659> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and destroy in them or whatever so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.469 
and destroy in them or whatever so
anyways<00:01:22.590> um<00:01:22.860> I'll<00:01:23.549> point<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
anyways um I'll point out when the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.120 
anyways um I'll point out when the
second<00:01:24.780> aces<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.560> watch<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> too

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
second aces and you can watch that too

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.480 
second aces and you can watch that too
so<00:01:27.409> something<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.590> have<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> mention<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so something that I have to mention is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
that my world at war montage came out

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.539 
that my world at war montage came out
about<00:01:32.850> five<00:01:33.270> days<00:01:33.509> ago<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.810> think<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.340> just<00:01:35.340> my

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
war montage was the same day that

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.560 
war montage was the same day that
YouTube<00:01:41.369> sub<00:01:41.640> boxes<00:01:41.970> started<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> fail<00:01:42.540> so

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
YouTube sub boxes started to fail so

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.330 
YouTube sub boxes started to fail so
apparently<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.590> bunch<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> my<00:01:44.130> subscribers

montage<00:02:11.800> I'd<00:02:12.099> really<00:02:12.520> mean<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> lot<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.880> me

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
montage I'd really mean a lot to me

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.100 
montage I'd really mean a lot to me
because<00:02:13.360> it's<00:02:13.870> kind<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.440> high<00:02:15.190> effort<00:02:15.400> video

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
because it's kind of a high effort video

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.059 
because it's kind of a high effort video
compared<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.140> what<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.319> usually<00:02:17.470> post<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.040> a

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:18.069 
compared to what I usually post like a

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.559 
compared to what I usually post like a
commentary<00:02:18.550> obviously<00:02:19.000> doesn't<00:02:19.330> take<00:02:19.420> as

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
commentary obviously doesn't take as

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.449 
commentary obviously doesn't take as
much<00:02:19.599> work<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:19.989> put<00:02:20.260> out<00:02:20.380> compared<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.430> a

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
much work to put out compared to a

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.040 
much work to put out compared to a
montage<00:02:21.849> because<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.300> montage<00:02:22.630> can<00:02:22.870> take

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
montage because the montage can take

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.710 
montage because the montage can take
months<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.440> recording<00:02:23.920> well<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:25.239> was<00:02:25.420> kind<00:02:25.660> of

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
months of recording well it was kind of

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.630 
months of recording well it was kind of
a<00:02:25.870> special<00:02:26.349> situation<00:02:26.739> with<00:02:27.190> this<00:02:27.310> world<00:02:27.519> at

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
a special situation with this world at

a special situation with this world at
war<00:02:27.760> montage<00:02:28.090> because<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:29.470> way<00:02:29.590> that

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
war montage because of the way that

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.979 
war montage because of the way that
world<00:02:29.950> at<00:02:30.069> war<00:02:30.190> got<00:02:30.370> hacked<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.970> wasn't<00:02:31.569> able<00:02:31.660> to

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
play as long as I wanted to which is why

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.370 
play as long as I wanted to which is why
the<00:02:33.610> montage<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.450> short<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.900> wanted<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.260> to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
the montage is so short I wanted it to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.110 
the montage is so short I wanted it to
be<00:02:35.500> wait<00:02:35.739> longer<00:02:36.010> than<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:36.610> because

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
be wait longer than that but because

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.940 
be wait longer than that but because
World<00:02:37.540> War<00:02:37.780> got<00:02:37.930> hacked<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.290> couldn't<00:02:38.560> play<00:02:38.739> all

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
summer or before that most of the clips

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.500 
summer or before that most of the clips
are<00:02:42.010> actually<00:02:42.310> from<00:02:42.459> last<00:02:42.700> spring<00:02:42.970> break<00:02:43.120> so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
are actually from last spring break so

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.210 
are actually from last spring break so
they're<00:02:44.049> really<00:02:44.200> old<00:02:44.380> clips<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:44.890> that's<00:02:45.010> why

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
they're really old clips and that's why

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.890 
they're really old clips and that's why
they're<00:02:45.400> unhacked<00:02:45.790> on<00:02:45.940> xbox<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:47.580> about<00:02:48.900> two

weeks<00:02:50.049> ago<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.410> think<00:02:50.530> world<00:02:51.010> at<00:02:51.130> war<00:02:51.160> was

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
weeks ago I think world at war was

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.580 
weeks ago I think world at war was
unhacked<00:02:51.819> for<00:02:52.030> like<00:02:52.150> two<00:02:52.330> days<00:02:52.360> and<00:02:52.810> I<00:02:52.900> got<00:02:53.319> one

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
unhacked for like two days and I got one

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.550 
unhacked for like two days and I got one
clip<00:02:53.890> which<00:02:54.580> was<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.150> single<00:02:55.989> single<00:02:56.410> single

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
triple that was on upheaval I think I

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.270

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
considering how much work went into it

Darth to Zeus and he added it and it

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.050 
Darth to Zeus and he added it and it
takes<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> lot<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.130> work<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.430> know<00:03:18.549> compared<00:03:18.940> to

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
takes a lot of work you know compared to

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.819 
takes a lot of work you know compared to
a<00:03:19.090> commentary<00:03:19.480> anyways<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.049> some<00:03:20.680> of<00:03:20.739> my

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
a commentary anyways and some of my

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.289 
a commentary anyways and some of my
commentaries<00:03:21.370> have<00:03:21.519> a<00:03:21.549> lot<00:03:21.820> more<00:03:21.970> views<00:03:22.269> than

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
commentaries have a lot more views than

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.470 
commentaries have a lot more views than
the<00:03:22.720> montage<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:24.000> probably<00:03:25.000> gone<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.359> about

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
the montage so probably gone on about

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.630 
the montage so probably gone on about
that<00:03:25.720> too<00:03:25.870> long<00:03:26.019> went<00:03:26.290> up<00:03:26.410> by<00:03:26.560> now<00:03:26.769> but<00:03:27.070> anyways

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
that too long went up by now but anyways

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.970 
that too long went up by now but anyways
if<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.480> guys<00:03:28.570> just<00:03:28.989> saw<00:03:29.350> how<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> got<00:03:29.769> on<00:03:29.890> this

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
if you guys just saw how I got on this

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.770 
if you guys just saw how I got on this
roof<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.459> kind<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.000> strategic<00:03:31.480> thing<00:03:31.660> to

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
roof it's kind of a strategic thing to

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.740 
roof it's kind of a strategic thing to
do<00:03:32.609> unfortunately<00:03:33.609> you<00:03:33.700> can't<00:03:33.940> do<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.269> on<00:03:34.480> the

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
do unfortunately you can't do it on the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.479 
do unfortunately you can't do it on the
modern<00:03:34.989> warfare<00:03:35.079> 2<00:03:35.440> version<00:03:35.829> of<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.040> map<00:03:36.250> I

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
modern warfare 2 version of this map I

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.160 
modern warfare 2 version of this map I
don't<00:03:37.000> know<00:03:37.060> why<00:03:37.239> they<00:03:37.420> take<00:03:37.690> stuff<00:03:37.930> like<00:03:38.140> that

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
don't know why they take stuff like that

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.440 
don't know why they take stuff like that
out<00:03:38.440> because<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:39.160> think<00:03:39.310> its<00:03:39.670> strategic<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.359> it

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
out because I think its strategic and it

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.550 
out because I think its strategic and it
it<00:03:40.630> adds<00:03:40.900> another<00:03:41.380> like<00:03:42.150> element<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.560> thinking

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
it adds another like element of thinking

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.259 
it adds another like element of thinking
to<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.799> game<00:03:44.980> when<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.519> do<00:03:45.970> stuff<00:03:46.209> like

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
to the game when you can do stuff like

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.140 
to the game when you can do stuff like
that<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.690> it's<00:03:46.780> kind<00:03:46.959> of<00:03:47.019> cool<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.910> be<00:03:49.060> in

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
that and it's kind of cool to to be in

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.670 
that and it's kind of cool to to be in
unexpected<00:03:49.720> places<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.109> wouldn't<00:03:50.470> really<00:03:50.560> call

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
unexpected places I wouldn't really call

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.309 
unexpected places I wouldn't really call
it<00:03:50.859> a<00:03:51.010> glitch<00:03:51.280> even<00:03:51.970> though<00:03:52.120> I<00:03:52.359> guess<00:03:53.049> that's

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 
it a glitch even though I guess that's

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.540 
it a glitch even though I guess that's
what

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
what

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.850 
what
activision<00:03:55.510> or<00:03:55.720> sorry<00:03:56.080> Infinity<00:03:56.650> Ward

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:56.860 
activision or sorry Infinity Ward

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.980 
activision or sorry Infinity Ward
considered<00:03:57.400> it<00:03:57.520> because<00:03:57.850> they<00:03:58.330> fixed<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.810> from

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 
considered it because they fixed it from

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.050 
considered it because they fixed it from
one<00:03:59.140> more<00:03:59.320> for<00:03:59.470> two<00:03:59.620> but<00:03:59.890> I<00:04:00.130> think<00:04:00.730> they<00:04:00.880> should

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
one more for two but I think they should

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.400 
one more for two but I think they should
leave<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.540> kind<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.810> stuff<00:04:02.020> in<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.260> game

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
leave that kind of stuff in the game

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.710 
leave that kind of stuff in the game
because<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:02.890> it<00:04:03.100> in<00:04:03.880> my<00:04:04.030> opinion<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.450> makes<00:04:04.600> it

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
because it it in my opinion it makes it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.090 
because it it in my opinion it makes it
better<00:04:04.870> it<00:04:05.050> takes<00:04:05.230> more<00:04:05.380> thinking<00:04:05.770> makes<00:04:05.980> it

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
better it takes more thinking makes it

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.060 
better it takes more thinking makes it
more<00:04:06.190> fun<00:04:06.250> more<00:04:07.090> options<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:07.750> know<00:04:08.070> anyways

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
more fun more options you know anyways

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.770 
more fun more options you know anyways
right<00:04:09.220> here<00:04:09.490> is<00:04:09.610> the<00:04:09.640> second<00:04:10.210> ace<00:04:10.330> of<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.600> game

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
right here is the second ace of the game

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.800 
right here is the second ace of the game
so<00:04:11.440> if<00:04:11.650> you<00:04:11.830> want<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.760> watch<00:04:12.970> what<00:04:13.390> happens

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
so if you want to watch what happens

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.930 
so if you want to watch what happens
it's<00:04:14.200> pretty<00:04:14.470> cool<00:04:14.590> I<00:04:14.830> actually<00:04:15.250> really<00:04:15.730> like

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
it's pretty cool I actually really like

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.640 
it's pretty cool I actually really like
the<00:04:16.150> way<00:04:16.180> that<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:16.810> do<00:04:16.870> kill<00:04:17.230> streaks<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
the way that they do kill streaks and

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.340 
the way that they do kill streaks and
cod4<00:04:18.040> because<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.610> can't<00:04:18.850> get<00:04:19.120> an<00:04:19.989> attack

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
cod4 because you can't get an attack

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.170 
cod4 because you can't get an attack
helicopter<00:04:20.530> in<00:04:21.160> Search<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.489> Destroy<00:04:21.519> because

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
helicopter in Search and Destroy because

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.450 
helicopter in Search and Destroy because
the<00:04:23.050> killstreaks<00:04:23.530> don't<00:04:23.740> stack<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.190> because

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
the killstreaks don't stack and because

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.980 
the killstreaks don't stack and because
there's<00:04:24.550> only<00:04:24.790> six<00:04:25.150> guys<00:04:25.300> on<00:04:25.360> the<00:04:25.630> other<00:04:25.660> team

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
there's only six guys on the other team

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.470 
there's only six guys on the other team
you<00:04:26.350> can<00:04:26.500> only<00:04:26.650> get<00:04:26.800> airstrikes<00:04:27.310> and<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:28.210> really

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
you can only get airstrikes and I really

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.390 
you can only get airstrikes and I really
don't<00:04:28.630> like<00:04:29.050> helicopters<00:04:29.950> and<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.190> kind<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
don't like helicopters and that kind of

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.650 
don't like helicopters and that kind of
stuff<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.760> searching<00:04:31.060> asteroid<00:04:31.360> like<00:04:31.510> they

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
stuff in searching asteroid like they

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.040 
stuff in searching asteroid like they
have<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:32.170> black<00:04:32.980> ops<00:04:33.220> and<00:04:33.580> add<00:04:34.300> modern<00:04:34.930> warfare

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
have in black ops and add modern warfare

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.620 
have in black ops and add modern warfare
2<00:04:35.350> because<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:36.460> makes<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.910> other<00:04:37.000> team<00:04:37.300> play

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
2 because it makes the other team play

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.420 
2 because it makes the other team play
differently<00:04:38.050> like<00:04:38.560> they<00:04:38.860> have<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.190> stay

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
differently like they have to stay

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.220 
differently like they have to stay
inside<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.850> hide<00:04:40.180> from<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.510> helicopter<00:04:40.660> all

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
inside and hide from the helicopter all

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.500 
inside and hide from the helicopter all
around<00:04:41.440> and<00:04:41.680> that<00:04:42.370> that<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:42.910> ruins<00:04:43.240> it<00:04:43.360> like

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
around and that that just ruins it like

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.540 
around and that that just ruins it like
for<00:04:43.750> both<00:04:43.900> teams<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:44.470> my<00:04:44.620> opinion<00:04:44.860> because<00:04:45.280> you

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
for both teams in my opinion because you

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.130 
for both teams in my opinion because you
have<00:04:45.670> to<00:04:45.850> go<00:04:46.060> run<00:04:46.270> into<00:04:46.450> the<00:04:46.540> buildings<00:04:46.870> to<00:04:46.960> try

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
have to go run into the buildings to try

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.360 
have to go run into the buildings to try
and<00:04:47.260> find<00:04:47.410> them<00:04:47.590> they're<00:04:48.040> going<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.280> be

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
and find them they're going to be

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.470 
and find them they're going to be
sitting<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.760> corners<00:04:49.090> they<00:04:49.330> obviously

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
sitting in the corners they obviously

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.880 
sitting in the corners they obviously
don't<00:04:49.840> like<00:04:50.080> sitting<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> corners

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
don't like sitting in the corners

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.410 
don't like sitting in the corners
because<00:04:51.100> there's<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.490> helicopter<00:04:51.820> above<00:04:52.270> their

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
because there's a helicopter above their

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.770 
because there's a helicopter above their
head<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.070> yeah<00:04:54.070> anyways<00:04:54.460> oh<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.910> my<00:04:55.540> last

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
head so yeah anyways oh and my last

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.290 
head so yeah anyways oh and my last

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
commentary if you guys saw it it was a

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.830

cod5 search and destroy or just caught
five<00:05:16.630> in<00:05:16.810> general<00:05:17.169> there's<00:05:17.440> this<00:05:17.560> thing

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
five in general there's this thing

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.890 
five in general there's this thing
called<00:05:17.800> sneaking<00:05:18.520> which<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.300> when<00:05:19.510> you

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
called sneaking which is when you

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.050 
called sneaking which is when you
basically<00:05:20.230> like<00:05:20.620> run<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.160> lay<00:05:21.400> down<00:05:21.430> and<00:05:21.880> run

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
basically like run and lay down and run

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.950 
basically like run and lay down and run
and<00:05:22.300> lay<00:05:22.480> down<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.680> go<00:05:24.160> to<00:05:24.220> prone<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.960> your

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
and lay down I like go to prone and your

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.780 
and lay down I like go to prone and your
guide<00:05:26.140> just<00:05:26.560> kind<00:05:26.860> of<00:05:26.919> like<00:05:27.100> slithers<00:05:27.580> around

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
guide just kind of like slithers around

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.360 
guide just kind of like slithers around
the<00:05:28.090> ground<00:05:28.330> and<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:29.680> can't<00:05:29.980> shoot<00:05:30.220> them

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
the ground and you can't shoot them

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.370 
the ground and you can't shoot them
because<00:05:30.669> the<00:05:30.790> hitbox<00:05:31.210> is<00:05:31.480> lagging<00:05:32.260> behind

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
because the hitbox is lagging behind

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.200 
because the hitbox is lagging behind
them<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:32.950> you<00:05:33.430> can't<00:05:33.700> predict<00:05:34.030> where<00:05:34.180> the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
them and you can't predict where the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.140 
them and you can't predict where the
hitboxes<00:05:35.070> the<00:05:36.070> hitbox<00:05:36.460> by<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.700> way<00:05:36.850> is<00:05:36.970> where

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
hitboxes the hitbox by the way is where

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.400 
hitboxes the hitbox by the way is where
you<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.510> shoot<00:05:37.720> for<00:05:37.960> the<00:05:38.050> shot<00:05:38.260> to

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:38.410 
you have to shoot for the shot to

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.159 
you have to shoot for the shot to
actually<00:05:38.860> register<00:05:39.010> and<00:05:39.780> there's<00:05:40.780> a<00:05:40.870> glitch

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
actually register and there's a glitch

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:43.050 
actually register and there's a glitch
in<00:05:41.200> world<00:05:41.590> at<00:05:41.680> war<00:05:41.830> where<00:05:41.860> you<00:05:42.070> can<00:05:42.220> just<00:05:42.250> run

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
in world at war where you can just run

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.490 
in world at war where you can just run
and<00:05:43.210> lay<00:05:43.360> down<00:05:43.390> run<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:43.960> lay<00:05:44.050> down<00:05:44.080> really

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
and lay down run and lay down really

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.770 
and lay down run and lay down really
quickly<00:05:44.800> and<00:05:45.100> people<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.060> basically<00:05:46.450> can't

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
quickly and people like basically can't

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.600 
quickly and people like basically can't
shoot<00:05:47.020> you<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.410> it's<00:05:47.919> really<00:05:47.980> really<00:05:48.430> cheap

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
shoot you and it's really really cheap

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:49.980 
shoot you and it's really really cheap
especially<00:05:48.790> if<00:05:49.240> they're<00:05:49.480> using<00:05:49.630> like

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
especially if they're using like

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.590 
especially if they're using like
juggernaut<00:05:50.500> MP<00:05:50.919> 40s<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.430> stuff<00:05:51.610> like<00:05:51.730> that<00:05:51.790> so

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
juggernaut MP 40s and stuff like that so

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.860 
juggernaut MP 40s and stuff like that so
for<00:05:53.470> that<00:05:53.560> that<00:05:54.250> reason<00:05:54.550> alone<00:05:54.640> and<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.510> kind

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
for that that reason alone and and kind

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.150 
for that that reason alone and and kind
of<00:05:56.020> bouncing<00:05:56.350> Betties<00:05:56.650> I<00:05:56.740> really<00:05:56.950> don't<00:05:57.100> like

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
of bouncing Betties I really don't like

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.500 
of bouncing Betties I really don't like
bouncing<00:05:57.610> Betties<00:05:57.910> even<00:05:58.180> though<00:05:58.270> you<00:05:58.330> can

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
bouncing Betties even though you can

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.070 
bouncing Betties even though you can
just<00:05:58.720> run<00:05:58.990> bomb<00:05:59.200> squad<00:05:59.500> but<00:06:00.660> still<00:06:01.660> I<00:06:01.690> just

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
just run bomb squad but still I just

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.890 
just run bomb squad but still I just
think<00:06:02.640> sneaking<00:06:03.640> completely<00:06:04.150> ruins<00:06:04.450> cod5

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900 
think sneaking completely ruins cod5

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.230 
think sneaking completely ruins cod5
Search<00:06:05.200> and<00:06:05.320> Destroy<00:06:05.350> for<00:06:05.740> me<00:06:05.860> I<00:06:06.010> think<00:06:06.310> cod4

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
Search and Destroy for me I think cod4

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.310 
Search and Destroy for me I think cod4
search<00:06:07.539> n<00:06:07.660> destroy<00:06:07.720> is<00:06:08.020> the

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
search n destroy is the

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.480 
search n destroy is the
Search<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.710> Destroy<00:06:08.800> you'll<00:06:09.130> ever<00:06:09.250> get<00:06:09.430> and

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
Search and Destroy you'll ever get and

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.240 
Search and Destroy you'll ever get and
that's<00:06:09.640> exactly<00:06:09.910> how<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:10.960> main<00:06:11.560> point<00:06:11.830> of<00:06:11.980> my

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
that's exactly how the main point of my

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.800 
that's exactly how the main point of my
last<00:06:12.490> column<00:06:12.790> Terry<00:06:13.000> sorry<00:06:13.210> if<00:06:13.480> I'm<00:06:13.660> being

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
repetitive but even my last column Terry

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:17.190 
repetitive but even my last column Terry
didn't<00:06:16.150> get<00:06:16.240> that<00:06:16.360> many<00:06:16.510> views<00:06:16.780> so<00:06:16.960> I<00:06:16.990> don't

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790 
yeah anyways that's the end of the game
