00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
a cool idea I came up when I thought

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
apologize for that but hopefully it was

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
apologize for that but hopefully it was
all<00:03:19.740> worth<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.310> because<00:03:20.520> I<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:21.150> just<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
all worth it because I was just so

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.600 
all worth it because I was just so
excited<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:22.110> drop<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> trailer<00:03:22.950> but<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.430> just

let me know what you think of it so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.340 
let me know what you think of it so
pretty<00:03:29.730> far<00:03:30.030> into<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.390> recording<00:03:30.780> stages<00:03:31.230> you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
pretty far into the recording stages you

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.870 
pretty far into the recording stages you
could<00:03:31.530> say<00:03:31.800> I'm<00:03:32.100> not<00:03:32.430> sure<00:03:32.550> when<00:03:32.700> it's<00:03:32.790> going

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
could say I'm not sure when it's going

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.160 
could say I'm not sure when it's going
to<00:03:32.940> be<00:03:33.060> out<00:03:33.090> if<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.690> want<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.930> know<00:03:34.020> who's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
to be out if you want to know who's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.080 
to be out if you want to know who's
editing<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.890> montage<00:03:35.280> you<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:35.910> probably

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
editing the montage you could probably

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:37.640 
editing the montage you could probably
figure<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.540> out<00:03:36.660> it's<00:03:36.900> all<00:03:37.020> too<00:03:37.170> obvious<00:03:37.200> I'm

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
figure it out it's all too obvious I'm

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.810 
figure it out it's all too obvious I'm
not<00:03:37.740> gonna<00:03:37.830> say<00:03:38.070> who<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.370> but<00:03:38.580> if<00:03:38.700> you've

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
not gonna say who it is but if you've

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.970 
not gonna say who it is but if you've
wants<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.210> recent<00:03:39.570> examples<00:03:40.110> I<00:03:40.350> mean<00:03:40.860> you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
wants the recent examples I mean you

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.320 
wants the recent examples I mean you
could<00:03:41.100> probably<00:03:41.160> figure<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:41.640> one<00:03:41.910> out<00:03:42.030> but

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
could probably figure that one out but

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.900 
could probably figure that one out but
it's<00:03:42.900> gotta<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:43.560> cool<00:03:43.830> it's<00:03:44.460> got<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.700> be<00:03:44.790> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
it's gotta be so cool it's got to be a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.640 
it's gotta be so cool it's got to be a
good<00:03:45.240> way<00:03:45.390> to<00:03:45.450> go<00:03:45.720> out<00:03:45.750> with<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.990> bang<00:03:46.230> because

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
good way to go out with a bang because

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.050 
good way to go out with a bang because
I'm<00:03:46.800> not<00:03:46.980> gonna<00:03:47.100> be<00:03:47.250> playing<00:03:47.490> this<00:03:47.640> game<00:03:47.820> ever

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
I'm not gonna be playing this game ever

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.790 
I'm not gonna be playing this game ever
again<00:03:48.390> I<00:03:48.600> know<00:03:49.110> I've<00:03:49.200> said<00:03:49.350> that<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.620> past

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
again I know I've said that in the past

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.620 
again I know I've said that in the past
but<00:03:50.070> literally<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.640> game<00:03:50.850> is<00:03:51.060> on<00:03:51.330> its<00:03:51.570> last

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
but literally this game is on its last
