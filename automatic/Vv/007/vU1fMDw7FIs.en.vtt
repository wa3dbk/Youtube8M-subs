00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.050
 colorado durango 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.570
 town of 18 thousand inhabitants located in the margin of the river that make up the 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.940
 geographical cultural world between the provinces of río negro and la pampa 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.360
 if I create the access portal to the black river and all of patagonia 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.780
 was the 1950s when it 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.780
 an immigration current 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.330
 the Basque and Spanish Italian filled these lands very far from theirs 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.470
 looking for a future 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.580
 the increase in the production of sheep heads and the expansion of livestock 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.750
 produced a remarkable growth for the region 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.810
 year 1960 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.350
 a series of unfortunate events brought out the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.300
 total state of defenselessness and that were the neighbors of the locality 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.960
 this reality mobilized a group of neighbors 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.600
 united by disinterest and solidarity 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.460
 determining in this way the creation of a volunteer fire department 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.470
 founded on September 30, 1960 the volunteer river fire association 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.479

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.890
 solidarity vocation and spirit of serving the first installations of the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.740
 that later would be constituted in the headquarters of the central barracks 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.490
 They were located in the brown street of the Spanish republic where 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.720

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.820
 personal testino of the fire ladder to cover the guard service 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.820
 permanent in the first steps has 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.129
 the beginnings 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.219

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:56.469
 followed this first vehicle the acquisition of a chevrolet truck

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.969
 of the institution 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.589
 from that time and up to the present 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:11.259
 they happened to these two first operational units various vehicles 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:15.659

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.499

 cadet corps guards 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.779

 and with the desire to provide each day 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.729
 as a service to the community 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.219

 that was initially placed in the central barracks 

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:51.789
 and before leaving 

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:56.539

 First detachment of firefighters in the province

 the demographic and economic development of our people and the region at 

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:15.029
 same as the saying of forming a region 

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:16.469

 to the neighbors of that colony 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.500
 in this way 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.930
