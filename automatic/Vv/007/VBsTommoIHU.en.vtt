00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:12.440
 Hello, My name is Maziar Yeshurun ​​and I invite you today to accompany me to a series of demos on jewelry and placement. 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.100
 Our first demonstration will be on melting gold. 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:26.260
 Melting of gold is one of the major issues in the manufacture of handmade jewelry. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.100
 In fact, it is impossible to manufacture handmade jewelry without melting, so-called iron molds. 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.240
 In this case we have a pattern of sheets that can be adjusted in an orderly manner across the desired plate. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.120
 Also, we use a pot made of stone names 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.880
 Which is fireproof 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:56.040
 And we use Brenner, who feeds on gas and oxygen at the same time, creating a very hot flame 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.780
 And in fact allows us continuous and good melting of metals in general and precious metals in particular. 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:20.160
 In order to get a good solid gold bar it is necessary to heat the mold first for long minutes so that the gold can flow inwards 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.680
 And will not sink at the top of the mold. 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.080
 The more oxygen I put in, the flame gets stronger 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.880
 I have pieces of gold scraps from the previous pieces that I put into the stove. 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.760
 For proper and professional melting we use mud for casting 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:52.480
 Which accelerates the process and removes all kinds of slag from the gold. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.220
 Here comes a graphite bar that will help us. 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.520
 You can already see that gold is actually becoming molten 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 I mix the gold that is currently in a completely liquid state so that all the elements of the alloy reach a homogeneous state within the liquid. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.320
 I put beeswax in the mold 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:43.060
 And now I'll pour it into my pattern in an orderly fashion. 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.840
 We have a gold bar that we cast into the mold 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.840
 And he was ready to roll in an electric trolley 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.400
 And of course before that we dip it in sulfuric acid to remove the borax chips. 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:15.560
 Then we can actually create plates from which to create rings, earrings, bracelets, or anything else. 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.340
 In fact, all the handicrafts in the world are manufactured from such types of missiles 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.540
 Or from wires or lumps or pipes there are only four types of raw materials in the world and this is one of them. 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.380
 Now the gold bar is ready for the rolling. 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:46.520
 It has been diluted for a few minutes with diluted sulfuric acid and this is a bit old fashioned but it is excellent. 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.100
 Here they thread wires, here are cans. 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.920
 I adjust the needlework to what I need 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:05.720
 And I am very mildly each time I reduce the space between the wheels like pasta dough 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.020
 And I got a tin of gold more and more thin until I got the thickness I needed. 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:22.340
 As you can see the barbed wire becomes longer and longer and this of course comes at the expense of the thickness of the barber that we will become increasingly narrow. 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:33.760
 After a few times I transfer the metal is very cramped and she refuses to continue to pass through Waltz without breaking. 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.100
 And it was necessary to give it relaxation in the heat, and then it is possible to continue the process more and more. 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:52.460
 In fact, it is possible to keep rolling in this machine until the gold bar here reaches a thickness of one hundredth of a millimeter 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.740
 Without rupture and without rupture as long as I keep the healings in an orderly manner during work.
