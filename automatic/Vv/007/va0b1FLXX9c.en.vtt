00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 I don't know how to cook and you know it or 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
 better not know how to cook serious things but 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.220
 annoyed to mess or do things 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.260
 strange and then I also put of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.360
 commitment 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.520
 then to do this thing there 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:23.939
 obviously strawberries will serve one 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:28.320
 very snow-white apple style of 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.090
 very leda style salt chocolate e 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.269
 of colored sugars in the shape of 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269
 heart 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.460
 Let's start with our apple thriller TVs 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.800
 in two parts helping us with a digger 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.489
 we are going to carve spheres of the 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.710
 our apple 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.670
 maybe with a little strength because it was 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.670
 really very hard 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.100
 carved many spheres part are the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 your strawberries and if they don't come out 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 perfectly help that arrange them with 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 a knife or with the same digger the 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.140
 kiss tuna water fin put some 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 of salt and then go and put our own 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.660
 apple balls so they don't lose the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660
 their color 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.960
 we are therefore at our strawberries then 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.630
 that same dig we provide to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.520
 dig this our strawberries too 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.530
 time it will be much simpler but we will have to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.530
 be much more careful not to break them 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:45.320
 we should get a result more or 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.329
 let us go back to this less 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.909
 to our apples and drain the spheres of 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:56.780
 so let's take the sugars 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:59.329
 colored and put a little heart to the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.909
 center of each face so get 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.020
 a kind of beak infants the tip of the 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.520
 heart will go outward 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.599
 you will have to keep something like this less 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.650
 this we repeat the same thing for 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.650
 each sphere of apples 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.170
 this should be more or less the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.170
 final result 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:32.170
 so let's dissolve ours 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.239
 chocolate helping us with one 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.650
 toothpick let's go and draw i 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.280
 our eyes obviously those 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.280
 loose chocolate 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:56.500
 but look how nice we repeat the 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.780
 same procedure for all averages e 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.700
 final result should be more or 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:05.889
 let us take our minus 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.590
 strawberries and let's insert an apple 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:15.420
 inside each we do 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.420
 a little pressure for those who were fine 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.270
 and look how cute 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:42.550
 obviously we repeat the same procedure 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:53.530
 for all the strawberries and here is the 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:55.600
 final result and I said I don't know 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.940
 cook but if between doing strange things 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.940
 yes i put of effort hello guys
