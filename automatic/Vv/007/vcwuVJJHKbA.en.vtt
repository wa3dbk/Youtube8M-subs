00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
power users get ready for a hard gasp
I'm going to show you a tiny PC with so

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.179
much computing power you'll need a
two-hour refractory period just to

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:23.400
recover guess how many CPU courses tiny
little PC hazard 4 6 8 you better keep

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.990
on counting all the fracking way to 18
Timmy because believe it or not this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.489
council size Falcon Northwest Tiki has a
single CPU with 18 cores in it bluetooth

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.239
digital hearing aids buy beats not
turned on I'll shout it again

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.129
hardcore and No don't insult me by
thinking those pores are noisy little

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
ARM chips using tablets the Tiki is
powered by none other than a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.550
liquid-cooled
Intel Xeon e5 $26.99 CPU what that means

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.059
18 house will port it and yes it has
hyper-threading so we're talking 36

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.890
threads a compute power enter trembling
little fingers if that doesn't get your

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.729
attention
Falcon Pierce at 18 core CPU with none

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.560
other than the single fastest GPU
available an NVIDIA GeForce Titan X

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.670
that's 12 gigabytes of RAM 3008 our
engines and 4k gaming capability in one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.150
car if you're not already crying tears
of joy I'm gonna hit you with another

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.079
one for storage
the cheeky packs in none other than a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.159
1.2 terabyte Intel 750 series SSD yes
we're talking two point seven gigabytes

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.520
per second of read speed and there's
even a six terabyte hard drive it's two

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.560
birds how does all this perform like
you'd expect

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170
it's frakking fast a typical quad-core
has little machine scores 800 in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780
Cinebench
and the tea

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:08.270
hits 2,400 the negatives most people
just don't eat this I don't you but I do

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.280
want and if I work that Pixar I would
want this machine you need an

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.220
application that really hammers 36 CPU
threads to make it pay for the second

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.470
obvious problem is cost Intel charges
forty three hundred dollars for the city

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.260
and the tight necks it's another grand
and that SSD and ain't cheap either

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.450
that means this Tiki with all the extras
including the tangerine paint job rings

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.450
in at nine thousand one hundred and
ninety six dollars cut ching and that's

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.390
not even counting the 64 gig memory of
break this machine it only has 32 gigs

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.820
of ram image that may seem insane and
over-the-top but if this hard work

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.060
doesn't get your pulse racing and give
you a nerd rection

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.170
you're probably dead already or a
matthews hardcore
