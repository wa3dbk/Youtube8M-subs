00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you can then remove the able proper and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.039 
you can then remove the able proper and
it's<00:01:25.469> a<00:01:26.090> it<00:01:27.090> becomes<00:01:27.420> super<00:01:27.780> stressful

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
it's a it becomes super stressful

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.600 
it's a it becomes super stressful
basically<00:01:28.710> you've<00:01:29.189> only<00:01:29.310> got<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> certain

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
basically you've only got a certain

basically you've only got a certain
number<00:01:29.789> of<00:01:29.909> lives<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.659> when<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> ball

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
number of lives to so when the ball

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200 
number of lives to so when the ball
bounces<00:01:31.229> back<00:01:31.799> beyond<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> dotted<00:01:33.090> line

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bounces back beyond this dotted line

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.460 
bounces back beyond this dotted line
that's<00:01:33.780> there<00:01:34.020> you'll<00:01:34.770> also<00:01:34.950> lose<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.280> life<00:01:36.470> so

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
that's there you'll also lose a life so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
that's there you'll also lose a life so

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
zen-like at the same time and yet you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.240

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
is sort of odds with its tone in terms

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039 
is sort of odds with its tone in terms
of<00:01:52.470> its<00:01:52.619> gameplay<00:01:52.850> but<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.149> quite<00:01:54.840> rewarding

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
of its gameplay but is quite rewarding

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.510 
of its gameplay but is quite rewarding
and<00:01:56.569> quite<00:01:57.569> meditative<00:01:58.229> when<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.009> really<00:01:59.369> get

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
rather than straight up the screen and

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.969 
rather than straight up the screen and
also<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.849> it's<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.989> makes<00:02:10.229> more<00:02:10.440> sense<00:02:10.739> for

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
also that it's it makes more sense for

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.180 
also that it's it makes more sense for
me<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.370> quickly<00:02:12.269> fire<00:02:12.930> another<00:02:13.200> shot<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.920> move

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
me to quickly fire another shot to move

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.449 
me to quickly fire another shot to move
a<00:02:14.459> ball<00:02:14.790> like<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:17.099> know<00:02:17.130> that<00:02:17.370> it's

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
a ball like that you know that it's

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.800 
a ball like that you know that it's
coming<00:02:17.610> backwards<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.239> makes<00:02:18.420> more<00:02:18.540> sense<00:02:18.599> for

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
coming backwards it makes more sense for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.690 
coming backwards it makes more sense for
me<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.349> than<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.829> is<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.160> fire<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.579> at

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
me to do that than it is to fire it at

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.220 
me to do that than it is to fire it at
one<00:02:20.910> of<00:02:21.000> these<00:02:21.120> stationary<00:02:21.660> balls<00:02:21.959> because

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
one of these stationary balls because

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.620 
one of these stationary balls because
obviously<00:02:22.319> they<00:02:23.310> are<00:02:23.610> they're<00:02:24.209> stationary

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
obviously they are they're stationary

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.259 
obviously they are they're stationary
and<00:02:24.840> they<00:02:24.959> bounce<00:02:25.440> your<00:02:25.680> ball<00:02:25.769> back<00:02:26.340> meaning

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
and they bounce your ball back meaning

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.789 
and they bounce your ball back meaning
that<00:02:27.299> you're<00:02:27.540> more<00:02:27.720> likely<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.200> lose<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.590> lot

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
that you're more likely to lose a lot

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:29.960 
that you're more likely to lose a lot
quicker<00:02:29.010> you'll<00:02:29.280> also<00:02:29.400> notice<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.760> you've

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
quicker you'll also notice that you've

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.340 
quicker you'll also notice that you've
got<00:02:30.090> these<00:02:30.209> sort<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.450> skull<00:02:30.810> figures<00:02:31.230> at<00:02:31.319> the

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
got these sort of skull figures at the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.410 
got these sort of skull figures at the
top<00:02:31.590> there<00:02:31.799> that's<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.940> now<00:02:33.090> can't

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
top there that's because I now can't

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.789 
top there that's because I now can't
remove<00:02:33.720> those<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.170> at<00:02:34.230> least<00:02:34.380> I<00:02:34.440> haven't

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
remove those or at least I haven't

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.380 
remove those or at least I haven't
figured<00:02:35.100> out<00:02:35.160> a<00:02:35.220> way<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.489> removing<00:02:36.120> those

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
figured out a way of removing those

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.940 
figured out a way of removing those
maybe<00:02:36.690> there's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.959> special<00:02:37.170> bonus<00:02:37.470> power<00:02:37.829> up

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
maybe there's a special bonus power up

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:38.990 
maybe there's a special bonus power up
or<00:02:38.069> something<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:38.579> you've<00:02:38.670> seen<00:02:38.850> it

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
or something on that but you've seen it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.729 
or something on that but you've seen it
there<00:02:39.329> my<00:02:39.600> ball<00:02:40.019> is<00:02:40.170> just<00:02:40.260> bouncing

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
there my ball is just bouncing

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.440 
there my ball is just bouncing
harmlessly<00:02:41.160> off<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.519> and<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.150> what's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
harmlessly off of it and that's what's

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.170 
harmlessly off of it and that's what's
going<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.630> lead<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:43.160> ultimately<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.430> me<00:02:44.549> losing

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
going to lead to ultimately to me losing
