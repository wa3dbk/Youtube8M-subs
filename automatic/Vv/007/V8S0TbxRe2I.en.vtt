like Roy Jones here some guys you simply

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:07.300 
like Roy Jones here some guys you simply
cannot<00:05:04.300> judge<00:05:05.300> by<00:05:05.690> normal<00:05:06.110> metrics<00:05:06.620> I<00:05:06.889> believe

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
cannot judge by normal metrics I believe

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.629 
cannot judge by normal metrics I believe
this<00:05:07.789> guy<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.569> one<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.620> them<00:05:09.889> and<00:05:10.159> he's

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
this guy is one of them and he's

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:12.969 
this guy is one of them and he's
talented<00:05:11.240> enough<00:05:11.539> we're<00:05:11.930> at<00:05:12.169> different<00:05:12.680> times

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
talented enough we're at different times

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.129 
talented enough we're at different times
in<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.759> fight<00:05:14.120> he'll<00:05:14.479> switch<00:05:14.870> between

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
in the fight he'll switch between

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.240 
in the fight he'll switch between
southpaw<00:05:16.039> and<00:05:17.080> Orthodox<00:05:18.080> and<00:05:18.349> what<00:05:18.949> I<00:05:18.979> like

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
southpaw and Orthodox and what I like

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.209 
southpaw and Orthodox and what I like
the<00:05:19.490> most<00:05:19.520> about<00:05:20.000> him<00:05:20.719> is<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.830> he<00:05:21.979> has<00:05:22.190> a

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
the most about him is that he has a

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.300 
the most about him is that he has a
sense<00:05:22.669> of<00:05:22.940> balance<00:05:23.240> to<00:05:23.780> him<00:05:24.050> where<00:05:24.409> he<00:05:25.280> can

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
sense of balance to him where he can

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.469 
sense of balance to him where he can
lead<00:05:25.759> with<00:05:26.719> power<00:05:27.020> shots<00:05:27.460> right<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.729> so<00:05:28.969> there

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
lead with power shots right and so there

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.659 
lead with power shots right and so there
is<00:05:29.659> a<00:05:29.690> fight<00:05:30.050> on<00:05:30.229> YouTube<00:05:30.740> it's<00:05:31.039> him<00:05:31.250> against

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
by KO in the eighth rosca can also work

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.459 
by KO in the eighth rosca can also work
the<00:05:56.300> body<00:05:56.800> DK<00:05:57.800> out<00:05:57.979> a<00:05:58.009> guy<00:05:58.279> named<00:05:58.520> Joe<00:05:58.789> Raya<00:05:59.120> on

00:05:59.459 --> 00:05:59.469 
the body DK out a guy named Joe Raya on

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:02.619 
the body DK out a guy named Joe Raya on
body<00:06:00.469> shots<00:06:00.620> I<00:06:01.250> think<00:06:01.909> this<00:06:02.090> guy<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.360> a

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
body shots I think this guy is a

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:05.019 
body shots I think this guy is a
big-time<00:06:02.870> talent<00:06:03.409> I<00:06:03.770> think<00:06:04.129> this<00:06:04.310> is<00:06:04.580> a

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
big-time talent I think this is a

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:07.149 
big-time talent I think this is a
high-risk<00:06:05.509> fight<00:06:05.840> because<00:06:06.229> he's<00:06:06.469> fighting<00:06:06.979> a

00:06:07.149 --> 00:06:07.159 
high-risk fight because he's fighting a

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:09.879 
high-risk fight because he's fighting a
defensive<00:06:07.340> master<00:06:08.330> who<00:06:09.020> has<00:06:09.229> more<00:06:09.440> experience

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
defensive master who has more experience

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.629 
defensive master who has more experience
than<00:06:10.370> him<00:06:10.750> but<00:06:11.750> I<00:06:11.990> do<00:06:12.139> feel<00:06:12.740> pro<00:06:13.099> Scott<00:06:13.400> at<00:06:13.580> a

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:13.639 
than him but I do feel pro Scott at a

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.290 
than him but I do feel pro Scott at a
minimum<00:06:14.000> is<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:15.680> to<00:06:15.740> take<00:06:16.039> this<00:06:16.310> fight<00:06:16.370> into

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:17.300 
minimum is going to take this fight into

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.019 
minimum is going to take this fight into
the<00:06:17.539> later<00:06:17.779> rounds<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.620> if<00:06:19.370> he<00:06:19.580> wins<00:06:19.849> this

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:20.029 
the later rounds and if he wins this

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.200 
the later rounds and if he wins this
fight<00:06:20.389> we're<00:06:21.199> gonna<00:06:21.319> have<00:06:21.650> a<00:06:21.860> new<00:06:22.250> player<00:06:22.699> at
