seven to four project is the new

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.459 
seven to four project is the new
Lamborghini<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> design<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.200> follow

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
Lamborghini with the design that follow

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.290 
Lamborghini with the design that follow
the<00:00:15.560> the<00:00:16.560> progress<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> design<00:00:17.730> already

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
the the progress of the design already

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.439 
the the progress of the design already
traced<00:00:18.630> by<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.830> Aventador<00:00:20.279> now<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
traced by the Aventador now we have a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.230 
traced by the Aventador now we have a
new<00:00:21.720> car<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.619> totally<00:00:23.130> different

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.240 
new car with a totally different

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.920 
new car with a totally different
approach<00:00:24.619> where<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.949> using<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.210> DNA<00:00:27.779> of

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
approach where we are using the DNA of

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.810 
approach where we are using the DNA of
our<00:00:28.109> company<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.949> our<00:00:29.660> iconic<00:00:30.660> cars<00:00:31.820> to

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
our company of our iconic cars to

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.510 
our company of our iconic cars to
express<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.480> completely<00:00:34.350> new<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> modern

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
express a completely new and modern

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.810 
express a completely new and modern
concept<00:00:36.420> we<00:00:37.290> have<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> car<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.980> following

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
concept we have a car that is following

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.020 
concept we have a car that is following
the<00:00:39.059> mono<00:00:39.300> body<00:00:39.570> design<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:41.030> kind

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the mono body design so we have a kind

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.479 
the mono body design so we have a kind
of<00:00:42.290> solid<00:00:43.940> body<00:00:44.989> with<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.430> really<00:00:47.430> strong

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
of solid body with a really strong

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.350 
of solid body with a really strong
element<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.780> clean<00:00:49.079> surfaces<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.890> precise

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
element with clean surfaces and precise

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.590 
element with clean surfaces and precise
lines<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.620> design<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.329> build<00:00:54.329> around

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
lines so the design is a build around

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
lines so the design is a build around
the<00:00:54.960> package<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:56.280> model<00:00:56.789> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the package that is a very model that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.069 
the package that is a very model that
it's<00:00:58.410> able<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.890> combine<00:00:59.149> the<00:01:00.149> daily<00:01:00.449> usability

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it's able to combine the daily usability

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's able to combine the daily usability
with<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:02.000> state-of-the-art<00:01:03.290> level<00:01:04.290> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
with a state-of-the-art level of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.810 
with a state-of-the-art level of
performances<00:01:05.189> every<00:01:06.560> design<00:01:07.560> proposal<00:01:08.400> was

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
performances every design proposal was

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.090 
performances every design proposal was
tested<00:01:09.360> since<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.930> beginning<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.770> have<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
tested since the beginning to have the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.890 
tested since the beginning to have the
perfect<00:01:11.810> performance<00:01:12.860> in<00:01:13.860> drag<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
perfect performance in drag and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.940 
perfect performance in drag and
downforce<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:17.240> very<00:01:18.740> interesting<00:01:19.740> how

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
downforce it's a very interesting how

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.940 
downforce it's a very interesting how
the<00:01:20.610> design<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> car<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.810> be<00:01:22.020> extreme

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the design of this car can be extreme

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.940 
the design of this car can be extreme
and<00:01:23.450> usable<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.200> scaring<00:01:25.560> because

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
and usable so it's not scaring because

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.280 
and usable so it's not scaring because
of<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.090> clean<00:01:27.390> surfaces<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.259> of

of the of the clean surfaces because of

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.069 
of the of the clean surfaces because of
the<00:01:28.530> precise<00:01:28.890> line<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.880> are<00:01:29.970> using<00:01:30.180> we<00:01:31.049> have

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the precise line we are using we have

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.399 
the precise line we are using we have
tried<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.740> hide<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.720> opening<00:01:34.110> they<00:01:34.350> are

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
tried to hide all the opening they are

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.649 
tried to hide all the opening they are
necessary<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:34.979> our<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> cooling<00:01:36.240> system

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
necessary for our for the cooling system

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.480 
necessary for our for the cooling system

shape and clean volume for example you
can<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> side<00:01:46.950> we<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> really

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
can see in the side we have a really

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.429 
can see in the side we have a really
small<00:01:48.659> opening<00:01:49.380> hidden<00:01:49.950> by<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.640> surfaces<00:01:51.439> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
small opening hidden by the surfaces we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.280 
small opening hidden by the surfaces we
have<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.590> strong<00:01:52.950> feature<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.520> terms<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:54.140> style

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
have a strong feature in terms of style

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.490 
have a strong feature in terms of style
it's<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.799> Zygon<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.930> design<00:01:57.930> around

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's the Zygon that is the design around

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.999 
it's the Zygon that is the design around
the<00:01:58.850> side<00:01:59.850> opening<00:02:00.060> it's<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> feature<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.619> we

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the side opening it's a feature that we

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.050 
the side opening it's a feature that we
like<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:03.030> kind<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.590> DNA<00:02:04.590> arriving<00:02:05.250> also

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
like it's a kind of DNA arriving also

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.199 
like it's a kind of DNA arriving also
from<00:02:06.240> from<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> Aventador<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.729> we<00:02:08.729> love<00:02:08.940> to
