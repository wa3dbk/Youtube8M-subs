 Hi everyone today, I will introduce (forget) guide you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.880
 How to fix error 23 46 during file import 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 import file into After Effects project 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.300
 And this is an example when you guys 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.580
 when you have a file you want to import and this is an example when you guys 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.340
 when you have a file you want to import 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.020
 for example, this file 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.120
 I have a link 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:40.700
 As above :) 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.020
 and I import it here 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.760
 Currently, your work window is still imported normally 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.600
 I will import this file 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 its name in english 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.160
 The import process will fail 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.960
 that is, error 23 46 cannot convert Unicode characters 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.400
 So how do I fix this? 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.480
 I discovered a cause 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.720
 That is very simple 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.680
 It is very simple because of your lead name 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.120
 For example, you change the strange character name on the path 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.840
 Rename the folder and the name of the file you entered 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.400
 in Vietnamese characters, it may be imported 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.980
 I'll take the example 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.340
 curious dot en en 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.360
 and import test 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.360
 any file 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.880
 and the import process will be done successfully 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.540
 And if you still get this error 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:19.880
 I will change the name of tomo.vn folder to Vietnamese characters 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.380
 and I import it again 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.800
 It will definitely corrupt your path 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.920
 and when you double click it will continue to fail to import 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.140
 any file and when you double-click it will continue to fail to import 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 any file 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:40.820
 Even if your path is very simple, just drive C and point right away 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.300
 Your image file 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000
 For example, I import this file 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.600
 So it still works 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.480
 In general, this tutorial is good, so it still works 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.500
 generally this tutorial 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.860
 will help you fix 23 :: 46 errors during the import process 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.660
 of After Effects 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.520
