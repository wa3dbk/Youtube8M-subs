00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 go welcome to firmly lodge 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.710
 my name is free i may show today 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.400
 we half-finished with the v6 other system 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.929
 The city â€‹â€‹makes connections 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.429
 Here I have an example so looks 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.670
 the half-finished of writing 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.490
 connection sz 15 from the signs above 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.869
 conclusion and / or benefit 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 Liechtenstein is on the way to education 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.460
 this one on one side 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 Connection axis is not different 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.009
 optimal course inserts at 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.759
 For example, drawers have guests 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.850
 you too 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.700
 I need the basic unit here 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.820
 and the danes blew town for months to 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 this template is used in this 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 basic unit when using this 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.780
 Template in the basic unit is on it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.579
 to pay attention to being here in this window 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:59.190
 the arrows clean ali so i here 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.399
 always the right distance to mine 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.890
 Can I have that bag after I go here 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.320
 is already settled and here 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.990
 also in these examples on mine 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 basic unit concerns we screw 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.500
 the border was the whole template with 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.590
 this pain clip show now I can 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.810
 the whole unit upwards 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.970
 Pan and now have the free view 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.770
 to the attacks 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.579
 also here if I think the right one 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.409
 stop on sz 14 and again it is 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.570
 in france are the group hold 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.829
 the a4 area was reduced to it 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.350
 sprinkle prehistory 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.049
 is attached 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 after her hero's dark wood that one 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.720
 the contrast how does it look like? 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 here on top I do it before 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 already with my angular sign the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 Mark speak federal others put 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.689
 I am here in the claim to you 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.119
 she can now be tense with that 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.629
 do not mask yourself from pulling up 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.879
 both sides are pure so I 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:19.260
 accordingly cuddles right here 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:21.120
 additional ones have other woods in particular 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.000
 his one sees now I know that me 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 two strokes have the slightly offset 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:43.190
 Practical are in black clothes where 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:43.190
 the whole thing attached and afterwards here 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.739
 coordinated and aligned 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.819
 as soon as the local ones are glued 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.859
 aligned with each other 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.709
 Stops were quickly the whole 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:18.019
 Unit mark as in the cookie 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:23.180
 and can now work with a router 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.239
 in the 2010 we have a burr here 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.819
 cutters fitted specifically on this 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.790
 half projects dovetail system 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:35.239
 now tuned here at almost 600 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.569
 the eat through suspended we drive 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.810
 down to the surface of the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.019
 understand and now it is important the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.150
 exact depth of 12 mm 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:49.780
 that means I was here with mine 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.459
 conception down revolt stop 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:04:00.969
 and animals, the fine adjustment at exactly 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:04.250
 12 because of negative can not in ten 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:07.540
 millimeter range here still the exact ones 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.540
 adjust the adjustment 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:21.070
 oh so comment and the 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:21.070
 also connect the power supply 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.879
 so that it travels in the front area 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.840
 is very minimized 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:41.469
 really in the beginning the people themselves one 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.960
 I have an incentive to for one 

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:46.620
 most just built around a better one 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.250
 to have guidance with my grandma freese 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.949
 here from right to left and pinion 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:57.539
 here send the factory so I them 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.539
 just so well-known 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.990
 once created when I can do the wood 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:22.529
 now the individual left-out travel 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.629
 of course , this template with mine 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.629
 Copy along 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:01.110
 really that really relax and 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:20.430
 glue the whole something together here 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:23.229
 wonderful fit 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.629
 here it is so if those 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.370
 do not piggish just run everything 

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:30.189
 I have the possibility later 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:35.590
 still here with the three saw the tines 

00:06:30.189 --> 00:06:38.439
 so to cut that's what we 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:39.879
 here at festo tv i hope you have it like that 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.389
 a little bit fun the world over 

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:43.560
