00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.230 
stats and frankly I could get a sub up
this<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.350> actually<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.640> much<00:01:53.880> good

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
this thing actually is not much good

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.230 
this thing actually is not much good
without<00:01:55.310> three<00:01:56.310> layers<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.610> spike<00:01:56.909> stealth

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
without three layers of spike stealth

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.270 
without three layers of spike stealth
rocks<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.780> toxic<00:01:58.170> spikes<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.680> play<00:01:58.860> because

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
rocks and toxic spikes and play because

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490 
rocks and toxic spikes and play because
without<00:01:59.759> those<00:02:00.360> um<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.960> thing<00:02:01.170> kind<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
without those um this thing kind of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.560 
without those um this thing kind of
blows<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.399> he<00:02:02.520> gets<00:02:02.700> his<00:02:02.820> stealth<00:02:03.060> rocks<00:02:03.360> up

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
blows so he gets his stealth rocks up

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.880 
blows so he gets his stealth rocks up
and<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:04.700> got<00:02:05.700> my<00:02:05.880> seeds<00:02:06.149> up<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:07.140> I've<00:02:07.500> seated

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
and I got my seeds up and I've seated

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.760 
and I got my seeds up and I've seated
him<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:09.030> I<00:02:09.119> go<00:02:09.330> ahead<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.629> substitute<00:02:10.200> I

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
him and then I go ahead and substitute I

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.730 
him and then I go ahead and substitute I
think<00:02:11.459> he<00:02:11.580> I<00:02:11.760> believe<00:02:11.819> he<00:02:12.180> dragon<00:02:12.780> claws

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
think he I believe he dragon claws

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.520 
think he I believe he dragon claws
those<00:02:14.070> new<00:02:14.250> goes<00:02:14.370> blam<00:02:14.900> yeah<00:02:15.900> and<00:02:16.140> that's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
those new goes blam yeah and that's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500 
those new goes blam yeah and that's
could<00:02:16.890> obviously<00:02:17.250> break<00:02:17.610> my<00:02:17.790> sub<00:02:18.030> very<00:02:18.270> easily

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
could obviously break my sub very easily

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.390 
could obviously break my sub very easily
so<00:02:20.030> solids<00:02:21.500> in<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:22.680> good<00:02:22.830> position<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.250> I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
so solids in a good position here I

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.110 
so solids in a good position here I
guess<00:02:23.640> right<00:02:23.880> now<00:02:24.000> he<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.890> easily<00:02:25.940> take<00:02:26.940> out

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
guess right now he can easily take out

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.530 
guess right now he can easily take out
and<00:02:27.590> take<00:02:28.590> anything<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.520> chomp<00:02:29.970> those<00:02:30.180> at<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
and take anything that chomp those at it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.400 
and take anything that chomp those at it
and<00:02:31.100> substitute<00:02:32.100> up<00:02:32.310> till<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:33.780> break<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.110> day

matches<00:03:26.670> me<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:27.060> obviously<00:03:27.540> got<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.780> kill<00:03:28.020> I

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830

matches me it obviously got a kill I
wasn't<00:03:29.790> sure<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.630> kind<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:31.200> meta<00:03:31.770> grossest

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
wasn't sure what kind of meta grossest

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.300 
wasn't sure what kind of meta grossest
was<00:03:32.460> and<00:03:32.820> but<00:03:33.660> still<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.260> figured<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.190> would

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
was and but still I figured that I would

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.610 
was and but still I figured that I would
be<00:03:35.520> able<00:03:35.550> to<00:03:35.730> take<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> mash<00:03:36.300> if<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:37.110> was<00:03:37.200> banded

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
be able to take a mash if it was banded

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.670 
be able to take a mash if it was banded
or<00:03:37.770> something<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.600> in<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.200> Fire<00:03:40.470> Blast

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
or something and in the Fire Blast

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.580 
or something and in the Fire Blast
missed<00:03:41.100> those<00:03:41.250> craft<00:03:41.700> Fire<00:03:41.910> Blast<00:03:42.120> missed<00:03:42.590> but

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
missed those craft Fire Blast missed but

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.010 
missed those craft Fire Blast missed but
really<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:43.980> didn't<00:03:44.790> matter<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.660> at<00:03:45.960> all

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
really that didn't matter like at all

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.500 
really that didn't matter like at all
because<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.830> may<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.370> not<00:03:47.580> killed<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.270> if<00:03:48.360> it

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
because it may have not killed and if it

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.380 
because it may have not killed and if it
did<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.260> would<00:03:49.740> have<00:03:49.830> been<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:49.980> 40<00:03:50.700> instead<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.330> a

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
did it would have been a 40 instead of a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.150
