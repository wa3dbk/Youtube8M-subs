00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
what wish I won't show you all part of

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.020 
what wish I won't show you all part of
the<00:02:20.079> oil<00:02:20.349> no<00:02:20.620> we<00:02:21.010> don't<00:02:21.129> want<00:02:21.280> to<00:02:21.340> ruin<00:02:21.849> the

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
the oil no we don't want to ruin the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.679 
the oil no we don't want to ruin the
surprises<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.189> uh<00:02:24.220> there's<00:02:25.090> also<00:02:25.329> chest

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
surprises what but uh there's also chest

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:26.970 
surprises what but uh there's also chest
scattered<00:02:26.019> around<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.260> place<00:02:26.439> but<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.709> think

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
scattered around the place but I think

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.160 
scattered around the place but I think
since<00:02:27.129> this<00:02:27.340> was<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.629> intentional<00:02:28.629> spawn<00:02:28.930> right

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
since this was a intentional spawn right

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.259 
since this was a intentional spawn right
here<00:02:29.379> which<00:02:30.310> made<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.609> down<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.060> y'all

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
here which made it down there so y'all

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:34.800 
here which made it down there so y'all
can<00:02:31.299> spawn<00:02:31.599> there<00:02:31.810> oh<00:02:32.189> I<00:02:33.239> think<00:02:34.239> right<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.450> we

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
can spawn there oh I think right here we

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.660 
can spawn there oh I think right here we
should<00:02:34.870> teleport<00:02:35.409> all<00:02:35.739> the<00:02:35.920> dead<00:02:36.129> people<00:02:36.159> like

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
should teleport all the dead people like

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.880 
should teleport all the dead people like
that<00:02:37.420> our<00:02:37.569> sponsors<00:02:38.019> we<00:02:38.170> should<00:02:38.349> teleport<00:02:38.620> him

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that our sponsors we should teleport him

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.599 
that our sponsors we should teleport him
here<00:02:39.189> and<00:02:39.689> then<00:02:40.689> like<00:02:41.129> when<00:02:42.129> we're<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.400> here

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
here and then like when we're in here

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:46.229 
here and then like when we're in here
then<00:02:42.879> we<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.180> dropping<00:02:43.659> items<00:02:44.760> out<00:02:45.760> yeah<00:02:46.030> but

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
then we like dropping items out yeah but

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.270 
then we like dropping items out yeah but
how<00:02:46.389> would<00:02:46.450> they<00:02:46.690> give<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.379> people<00:02:47.889> items

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
how would they give the people items

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.890 
how would they give the people items
like<00:02:49.079> so<00:02:50.079> oh<00:02:50.319> yes<00:02:51.040> you're<00:02:51.430> doing<00:02:51.700> like<00:02:52.629> they

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
like so oh yes you're doing like they

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.780 
like so oh yes you're doing like they
could<00:02:53.079> teleport<00:02:53.409> and<00:02:53.769> watch<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.370> person

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
could teleport and watch the person

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.039 
could teleport and watch the person
around<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.510> stuff<00:02:55.870> give<00:02:56.709> them<00:02:56.859> items

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
around there and stuff give them items

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.149 
around there and stuff give them items
yeah<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.230> i'm<00:02:59.319> still<00:02:59.349> trying<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.769> think<00:02:59.980> of<00:03:00.069> a

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
yeah but i'm still trying to think of a

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:02.099 
yeah but i'm still trying to think of a
way<00:03:00.310> because<00:03:00.879> that<00:03:01.359> could<00:03:01.480> be<00:03:01.689> kind<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.049> a

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
way because that could be kind of a

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.220 
way because that could be kind of a
little<00:03:02.200> bit<00:03:02.439> powered<00:03:03.780> but<00:03:04.780> you<00:03:04.900> can't<00:03:05.079> give

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
little bit powered but you can't give

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.990 
little bit powered but you can't give
them<00:03:05.349> like<00:03:05.530> tons<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.010> diamonds<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.790> stuff

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
them like tons of diamonds and stuff

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.099 
them like tons of diamonds and stuff
like<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.439> yeah<00:03:08.439> like<00:03:08.829> to<00:03:09.010> overpower<00:03:09.519> them

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
like that yeah like to overpower them

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.539 
like that yeah like to overpower them
because<00:03:11.109> i<00:03:11.200> mean<00:03:11.379> if<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.620> also<00:03:12.069> if<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.400> gave

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
because i mean if you also if you gave

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.160 
because i mean if you also if you gave
them<00:03:12.670> like<00:03:12.849> four<00:03:13.180> pieces<00:03:13.359> of<00:03:13.599> up<00:03:13.810> sitting<00:03:14.139> in

give like basic equipment and then uh to
their<00:03:46.389> people<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.319> their<00:03:47.560> sponsoring<00:03:47.949> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
their people of their sponsoring and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.969 
their people of their sponsoring and
then<00:03:48.280> like<00:03:48.459> this<00:03:48.639> in<00:03:49.479> like<00:03:49.659> expand<00:03:50.319> yeah<00:03:50.799> I

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:50.979 
then like this in like expand yeah I

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.689 
then like this in like expand yeah I
guess<00:03:51.329> also<00:03:52.329> uh<00:03:52.629> don't<00:03:53.560> try<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.859> just<00:03:54.220> run

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
guess also uh don't try to just run

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.339 
guess also uh don't try to just run
straight<00:03:54.940> out<00:03:55.299> and<00:03:55.510> think<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.109> can<00:03:56.290> get

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
straight out and think that you can get

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:58.199 
straight out and think that you can get
really<00:03:56.620> far<00:03:56.829> away<00:03:56.949> because<00:03:57.250> there<00:03:57.579> is<00:03:57.729> a<00:03:57.760> glass
