be<00:01:25.170> using<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.710> class<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.530> because<00:01:28.530> I

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
be using that class to get it because I

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.410 
be using that class to get it because I
got<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.130> couple<00:01:29.369> knife<00:01:29.700> takedowns<00:01:30.150> with

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
got a couple knife takedowns with

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.780 
got a couple knife takedowns with
different<00:01:30.810> classes<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.530> added<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:32.340> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
different classes and it added to that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.280 
different classes and it added to that
so<00:01:34.460> so<00:01:35.460> yeah<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> also<00:01:36.390> spot<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.200> don't

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
so so yeah you can also spot you don't

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.429 
so so yeah you can also spot you don't
have<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> sniper<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.250> spot<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.030> I

scoping at them right away and press Q
it's<00:04:31.180> really<00:04:31.600> important<00:04:32.050> that<00:04:32.260> you're<00:04:32.650> not

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
it's really important that you're not

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.520 
it's really important that you're not
focused<00:04:33.280> on<00:04:33.460> killing<00:04:33.730> people<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.530> well

basically if you kill all the people you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.760 
basically if you kill all the people you
spot<00:04:37.270> you're<00:04:37.450> not<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.810> get<00:04:37.990> bonuses<00:04:38.500> so<00:04:38.680> you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
spot you're not gonna get bonuses so you

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.450 
spot you're not gonna get bonuses so you

don't want to kill them but you know I
end<00:04:42.940> up<00:04:43.030> killing<00:04:43.270> people<00:04:43.570> anyway<00:04:43.780> because

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
end up killing people anyway because

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.170

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.700 
it's fun and and I think I get it right
here<00:04:47.790> but<00:04:48.790> it's<00:04:48.940> it's<00:04:49.630> pretty<00:04:49.870> basic<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.470> takes

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
here but it's it's pretty basic it takes

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.570 
here but it's it's pretty basic it takes
some<00:04:50.920> time<00:04:50.950> it's<00:04:51.880> one<00:04:52.000> of<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.150> harder<00:04:52.420> ones

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
some time it's one of the harder ones

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.040 
some time it's one of the harder ones
but<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.670> know<00:04:54.760> 50<00:04:55.060> head<00:04:55.180> jobs<00:04:55.450> is<00:04:55.630> basically

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
mean that's it's a pretty basic but it

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.140 
mean that's it's a pretty basic but it
takes<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> little<00:05:47.380> bit<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.590> time<00:05:48.150> really

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150
