00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.450
 Hi, I have not seen you for a long time 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:14.170
 excretory keep talking about 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.110
 new buildings 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.730
 today it is a residential complex sunny from 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.360
 largest developer in this 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.700
 locations 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.980
 arsenal real estate complex 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.710
 located next to the metro in the west 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.619
 pieces of murino walk about five minutes and 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.899
 just under 500 meters here is the panel 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.899
 represents 12 houses plus a school 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.780
 by tradition I want 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 demonstrate how it will look 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.000
 complete construction project 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.050
 total 12 houses and 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.940
 secondary school which 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.390
 deserves a separate word but about this 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.810
 benefit 1 2 home can be rented and settled 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.190
 House 4 also passing but not yet inhabited it 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.800
 finishing work 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.840
 all apartments are ready to be finished in 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.149
 the end of the video, I will show what is complete 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 finish from the developer who did 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.989
 right in front of me the complex represents 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.590
 sixteen storey houses 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.020
 which is not 26 as in cds and not 12 as leader 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.450
 groups that good at home does not look like 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.939
 massive building like here and 12 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.069
 pieces 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.719
 The complex is divided into Mendeleev Boulevard in 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.639
 all houses are underground 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.980
 parking lots which playgrounds 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:26.830
 I think it's time to see everything with your own 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.990
 after you walked away from the subway 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.090
 200 meters appears like this 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.410
 signpost and behind him a new big city 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.560
 we are now on the top floor 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.240
 first given home and the view from here on 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.670
 houses built from the moment 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.710
 or rather residential complex Victoria here 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.820
 all you see is planned Cossack 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.820
 to house at home 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.350
 Further, I want to show a well-coordinated work 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.280
 team of workers get rid when not 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280
 need to go down-up 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.390
 Now in the case we are on the top floor already 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.290
 2 houses on the right children's sports 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.440
 further parking areas the same boulevard 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:43.849
 Mendeleev and the whole territory 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:47.190
 this is also the future sunny quarter 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:49.530
 gray residential complex in the distance 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.660
 these are three whales from the group leader review on 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.780
 which is already ready look for the link in 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.670
 The description on the site has clocked the land under 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:03.450
 building the sixth and ninth house and 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.500
 visible edge of the house 7 and 11 next frame 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 and already in the courtyard 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.970
 I want to note that it is simple and pleasant 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.950

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.269
 neat lampposts and children 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.299
 bench bench 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.769
 houses in high-tech style dark light colors 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.670
 plus all houses are built by 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.230
 brick-monolithic technology 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.650
 I want to show an example of the hall on the first 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.170
 house 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.450
 light transparent mailboxes 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.609
 the color scheme of the hall repeats the look 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.549
 the houses in the parade set for two 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:39.079
 elevator company alex elevator can also go out 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.079
 and enter from both sides of the house 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.050
 Now we are already in the fourth house 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.870
 which is commissioned 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.910

 With regards to school, this is a complete 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.800
 secondary school I calculated 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.709

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.630
