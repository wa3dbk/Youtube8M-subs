00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
wiring of the board some of the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.070 
wiring of the board some of the
questions<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.189> come<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.730> you<00:00:09.450> know<00:00:09.599> Pula

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
man do you do the wiring or what I send

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.860 
man do you do the wiring or what I send
you<00:00:12.780> my<00:00:12.809> pedals<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.940> some<00:00:14.940> other<00:00:15.089> board

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
you my pedals like some other board

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.540 
you my pedals like some other board
builders<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.590> know<00:00:16.710> of

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
builders that you know of

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.480 
builders that you know of
no<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.330> don't<00:00:18.750> go<00:00:18.930> at<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.289> point<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
no I don't go at that point and the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
no I don't go at that point and the
reason<00:00:20.580> why<00:00:20.880> is<00:00:20.939> I'm<00:00:21.210> just<00:00:21.420> one<00:00:21.600> guy<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> I

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
reason why is I'm just one guy and I

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.230 
reason why is I'm just one guy and I
couldn't<00:00:22.350> keep<00:00:22.500> up<00:00:22.710> with<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.010> orders<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:24.029> all

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
if I had to do wiring as well plus I'm

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.150 
if I had to do wiring as well plus I'm
not<00:00:26.849> any<00:00:27.090> good<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.570> yeah<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.470> wouldn't<00:00:28.920> trust

not any good at it yeah I wouldn't trust
my<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.789> soldering<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:31.199> well<00:00:31.529> as<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:32.130> tole

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
my my soldering as well as I do my tole

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.880 
my my soldering as well as I do my tole
that's<00:00:32.579> in<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.910> everything<00:00:33.450> else<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.809> do<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
anyway whenever you have new tricks you

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.440 
anyway whenever you have new tricks you
can<00:00:37.770> figure<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.640> will<00:00:38.910> be<00:00:39.059> responsible

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
can figure that you will be responsible

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.709 
can figure that you will be responsible
for<00:00:40.100> soldering<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.850> wires<00:00:42.210> of

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
for soldering your into your wires of

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
for soldering your into your wires of
your<00:00:42.870> first<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.320> last<00:00:43.350> pedals<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.129> chain

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
your first and last pedals in the chain

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.810 
your first and last pedals in the chain
or<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.860> effects<00:00:46.860> loop<00:00:47.070> if<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
or in the effects loop if that be the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.990 
or in the effects loop if that be the
case<00:00:48.230> so<00:00:49.230> new<00:00:49.469> tricks<00:00:49.770> plan<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.670> doing<00:00:50.940> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
case so new tricks plan on doing a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
case so new tricks plan on doing a
little<00:00:51.210> bit<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.449> soldering<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.079> just<00:00:52.260> two

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
little bit of soldering it's just two

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130 
little bit of soldering it's just two
connections<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.420> pretty<00:00:54.660> simple

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
connections it's it's it's pretty simple

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.610 
connections it's it's it's pretty simple
deal<00:00:55.730> as<00:00:56.730> far<00:00:57.000> as<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> patch<00:00:57.390> cord<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.350> if

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
deal as far as the patch cord this if

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.139 
deal as far as the patch cord this if
you<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.010> patch<00:00:59.219> cord<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.030> your

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
you get a patch cord going from your

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
you get a patch cord going from your
socket<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> your<00:01:00.960> power<00:01:01.289> supply<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:02.010> install

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
socket to your power supply I install

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.579 
socket to your power supply I install
that<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> real<00:01:04.049> simple<00:01:04.229> deal

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that for you it's a real simple deal

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.149 
that for you it's a real simple deal
it's<00:01:04.830> all<00:01:04.979> screwed<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.729> color-coded<00:01:06.360> and

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
it's all screwed in and color-coded and

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:14.260 
it's all screwed in and color-coded and
so<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:08.310> happy<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.760> do<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.540> again

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.550 

talking<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:16.080> whether<00:01:16.380> or

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
talking a little bit about whether or

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.289 
talking a little bit about whether or
not<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> run<00:01:17.310> your<00:01:17.460> cables<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.970> through<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
not to run your cables up through the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.100 
not to run your cables up through the
hole<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.290> in<00:01:19.380> run<00:01:19.799> them<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:20.070> individual

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
hole or or in run them up individual

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.440 
hole or or in run them up individual
it's<00:01:22.110> totally<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:23.150> it<00:01:24.150> can<00:01:24.299> be<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's totally up to you it can be a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.999 
it's totally up to you it can be a
little<00:01:24.720> bit<00:01:24.840> cleaner<00:01:25.110> looking<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.740> think

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little bit cleaner looking but I think

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.030 
little bit cleaner looking but I think
it's<00:01:26.159> really<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:27.200> pain<00:01:28.200> in<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> ass<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.950> be

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's really a pain in the ass to be

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.030 
it's really a pain in the ass to be
honest<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:30.540> drill<00:01:30.780> individual<00:01:31.380> holes<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.920> all

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
honest to drill individual holes for all

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.100 
honest to drill individual holes for all
your<00:01:32.250> pedals<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.759> then<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.689> before<00:01:33.900> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
your pedals and then and then before you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.080 
your pedals and then and then before you
know<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.409> usually<00:01:35.159> happens<00:01:35.310> sooner<00:01:35.790> than<00:01:35.970> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
know it usually happens sooner than you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
know it usually happens sooner than you
expect<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.659> decide<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> change<00:01:37.320> your<00:01:37.439> pedals

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
expect you decide to change your pedals

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.789 
expect you decide to change your pedals
in<00:01:38.220> some<00:01:38.970> way<00:01:39.150> or<00:01:39.299> form<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.900> you've<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.590> holes

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
in some way or form and you've got holes

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.789 
in some way or form and you've got holes
where<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:42.000> want<00:01:42.210> them<00:01:42.360> although<00:01:43.259> if

where you don't want them although if

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you do keep the holes small they don't

show too bad under the velcro if you do

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.600 
show too bad under the velcro if you do
do<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:52.409> grommet<00:01:52.799> you've<00:01:53.310> got<00:01:53.460> two

different<00:01:53.729> sides<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.270> Ron<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:55.049> these

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
different sides of Ron it's all these

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.660 
different sides of Ron it's all these
boards<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:55.740> happen<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> small

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
boards here happen to have the small

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
boards here happen to have the small
grommets<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.210> three-quarter<00:01:57.750> inch<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
grommets a three-quarter inch there's a

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
grommets a three-quarter inch there's a
larger<00:01:59.430> grommet<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.750> and

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
larger grommet that's one and

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.609 
larger grommet that's one and
three-quarters

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
three-quarters

three-quarters
this<00:02:02.040> one<00:02:02.219> works<00:02:02.430> good<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.820> smaller<00:02:03.180> boards

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
this one works good on smaller boards

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.740 
this one works good on smaller boards
where<00:02:03.840> you're<00:02:03.990> running<00:02:04.290> basically<00:02:04.950> just<00:02:05.310> your

a couple of george'll cables since
they're<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.570> small<00:02:10.900> diameter<00:02:11.490> I'm<00:02:12.490> a<00:02:12.580> fan<00:02:12.880> of

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
they're a small diameter I'm a fan of

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.900 
they're a small diameter I'm a fan of
Georgia<00:02:13.330> l<00:02:13.480> myself<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:15.550> because<00:02:15.790> of

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
Georgia l myself that just because of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.310 
Georgia l myself that just because of
the<00:02:16.000> small<00:02:16.240> footprint<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.840> they<00:02:16.900> can<00:02:17.050> be<00:02:17.200> made

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
the small footprint and they can be made

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.830 
the small footprint and they can be made
to<00:02:17.470> look<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:17.680> very<00:02:18.190> clean<00:02:18.760> when<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.600> do<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
to look very very clean when you do the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.900 
to look very very clean when you do the
wiring<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:21.340> there's<00:02:21.490> a<00:02:21.580> lot<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.820> other

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
wiring but there's a lot of other

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.550 
wiring but there's a lot of other
options<00:02:22.390> that<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.570> can<00:02:22.840> use<00:02:22.960> for<00:02:23.170> cables

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
options that you can use for cables

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.950 
options that you can use for cables
myself<00:02:24.460> I<00:02:24.610> kind<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:24.880> think<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.870> rather

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
myself I kind of think I would rather

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.810 
myself I kind of think I would rather
have<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.440> cables<00:02:26.800> up<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.280> top<00:02:27.460> where

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
have the cables up on the top where

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.580 
have the cables up on the top where
they're<00:02:27.970> easy<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.330> get<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.690> you<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.140> track<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
they're easy to get to you can track the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.040 
they're easy to get to you can track the
problem<00:02:30.390> it's<00:02:31.390> easy<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.840> swap<00:02:32.080> pedals<00:02:32.470> around

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
problem it's easy to swap pedals around

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.680 
problem it's easy to swap pedals around
again<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.260> it<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.770> me<00:02:35.920> all<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.180> advantages<00:02:37.630> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
again is it to me all the advantages of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.040 
again is it to me all the advantages of
having<00:02:37.840> everything<00:02:38.470> up<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.770> top<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.130> this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
having everything up on top like this

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.290 
having everything up on top like this
far<00:02:41.050> outweigh<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.500> advantage<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.300> individual

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
far outweigh the advantage of individual

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.910 
far outweigh the advantage of individual
holes<00:02:43.540> and<00:02:43.810> maybe<00:02:43.990> looking<00:02:44.320> a<00:02:44.410> little<00:02:44.800> bit

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
holes and maybe looking a little bit

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.730 
holes and maybe looking a little bit
cleaner<00:02:45.900> also<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.110> of<00:02:47.170> think<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
cleaner also kind of think like the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.020 
cleaner also kind of think like the
George<00:02:48.010> L's<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.580> know<00:02:48.670> you<00:02:48.760> can<00:02:48.940> get

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
George L's you know you can get

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.300 
George L's you know you can get
different<00:02:49.240> colors<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.660> cables<00:02:50.110> now<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.890> you

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
different colors of cables now and you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.220 
different colors of cables now and you
know<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.640> on<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:51.940> blue<00:02:52.120> board<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:53.080> red

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
know like on this blue board the red

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.220 
know like on this blue board the red
cables<00:02:53.680> would<00:02:53.830> look<00:02:53.950> pretty<00:02:54.160> cool<00:02:54.480> so<00:02:55.480> that's

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
cables would look pretty cool so that's

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
cables would look pretty cool so that's
my<00:02:56.380> thinking<00:02:56.620> there<00:02:56.980> too<00:02:59.220> so<00:03:00.220> that's<00:03:00.430> not<00:03:00.640> all

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
my thinking there too so that's not all

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.240 
my thinking there too so that's not all
I'm<00:03:00.970> going<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.210> talk<00:03:01.420> about<00:03:01.570> I<00:03:01.720> think<00:03:01.990> on<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
I'm going to talk about I think on the

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.050 
I'm going to talk about I think on the
wiring<00:03:03.520> again<00:03:03.850> as<00:03:04.660> far<00:03:04.900> as<00:03:05.640> where<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:06.790> want<00:03:07.000> to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
wiring again as far as where you want to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.880 
wiring again as far as where you want to
put<00:03:07.240> your<00:03:07.360> Jack's<00:03:07.720> in<00:03:07.960> your<00:03:08.080> outlets<00:03:08.470> it's<00:03:08.740> all

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
put your Jack's in your outlets it's all

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.520 
put your Jack's in your outlets it's all
a<00:03:08.920> very<00:03:09.010> personal<00:03:09.760> thing<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:10.320> keep<00:03:11.320> coming

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
a very personal thing I keep coming

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.699 
a very personal thing I keep coming
trying<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.950> come<00:03:12.100> up<00:03:12.130> with<00:03:12.280> one<00:03:12.640> that<00:03:12.850> would

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
trying to come up with one that would

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.240 
trying to come up with one that would
probably<00:03:14.709> benefit<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:15.820> most<00:03:16.060> people<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
probably benefit the most people be the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.130 
probably benefit the most people be the
the<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.520> type<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.910> layout<00:03:19.090> that<00:03:19.540> most<00:03:19.780> people

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
the the type of layout that most people

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.720 
the the type of layout that most people
would<00:03:20.320> be<00:03:20.350> happy<00:03:20.800> with<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.340> think<00:03:21.400> I've

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
would be happy with and I think I've

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.699 
would be happy with and I think I've
found<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:22.450> one<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.050> what<00:03:23.440> I've<00:03:23.560> done

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
found it in this one and what I've done

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.949 
found it in this one and what I've done
with<00:03:23.920> this<00:03:24.100> one<00:03:24.160> is<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.520> got<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> one<00:03:25.150> out<00:03:25.390> on

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
with this one is you got the one out on

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.640 
with this one is you got the one out on
the<00:03:26.320> side<00:03:26.620> for<00:03:27.130> your<00:03:27.220> guitar<00:03:28.020> my<00:03:29.020> thinking<00:03:29.440> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
the side for your guitar my thinking is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.010 
the side for your guitar my thinking is
is<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:30.100> most<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.940> us<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.180> right-handed<00:03:31.750> plant

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
is that most of us a right-handed plant

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.710 
is that most of us a right-handed plant
and<00:03:32.830> if<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.160> have<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.489> cable<00:03:33.880> over<00:03:34.030> here<00:03:34.300> all

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
and if you have that cable over here all

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.030 
and if you have that cable over here all
the<00:03:34.930> other<00:03:35.050> cables<00:03:35.470> should<00:03:35.650> be<00:03:35.800> on<00:03:35.950> the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
the other cables should be on the

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.040 
the other cables should be on the
opposite<00:03:36.580> side<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.030> you're<00:03:37.330> not<00:03:37.480> having

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
opposite side so that you're not having

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.600 
opposite side so that you're not having
your<00:03:38.290> cables<00:03:38.680> laying<00:03:38.890> across<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.370> top<00:03:39.580> of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
your cables laying across the top of

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.390 
your cables laying across the top of
each<00:03:40.150> other<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.860> put<00:03:41.860> everything<00:03:41.980> on

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
each other and you put everything on

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.860 
each other and you put everything on
this<00:03:42.610> side<00:03:42.820> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.180> you've<00:03:43.330> got<00:03:43.480> your<00:03:43.660> power

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
this side and then you've got your power

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.840 
this side and then you've got your power
coming<00:03:44.230> out<00:03:44.380> and<00:03:44.590> then<00:03:45.250> you're<00:03:45.370> out<00:03:45.400> from<00:03:45.760> the

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
coming out and then you're out from the

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.520 
coming out and then you're out from the
amp<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.209> then<00:03:46.270> the<00:03:46.390> effects<00:03:46.690> loop<00:03:46.930> if<00:03:47.380> you

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
amp and then the effects loop if you

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.350 
amp and then the effects loop if you
have<00:03:47.680> an<00:03:47.800> effects<00:03:48.100> loop<00:03:48.160> if<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.580> don't<00:03:48.850> then

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
have an effects loop if you don't then

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.810 
have an effects loop if you don't then
they're<00:03:49.750> there<00:03:49.959> you<00:03:50.860> know<00:03:50.980> we<00:03:51.130> change<00:03:51.310> amps

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
they're there you know we change amps

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.000 
they're there you know we change amps
just<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.360> change<00:03:52.600> pedals<00:03:53.050> so<00:03:53.739> if<00:03:53.860> you're

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
just like we change pedals so if you're

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.100 
just like we change pedals so if you're
gonna<00:03:54.100> buy<00:03:54.310> a<00:03:54.340> board<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.450> me<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.840> makes

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
gonna buy a board it to me it makes

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.870 
gonna buy a board it to me it makes
sense<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.590> have<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:57.220> might<00:03:57.370> not<00:03:57.550> be<00:03:57.670> running

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
sense to have you might not be running

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.310 
sense to have you might not be running
an<00:03:58.000> effects<00:03:58.270> loop<00:03:58.360> right<00:03:58.690> now<00:03:58.870> but<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.140> makes

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
an effects loop right now but it makes

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.199 
an effects loop right now but it makes
sense<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.709> spend<00:03:59.800> a<00:04:00.010> little<00:04:00.100> extra<00:04:00.310> have<00:04:01.180> a

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
sense to spend a little extra have a

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.390 
sense to spend a little extra have a
couple<00:04:01.600> of<00:04:01.690> jacks<00:04:01.959> put<00:04:02.230> in<00:04:02.380> so<00:04:02.950> that<00:04:03.160> when<00:04:03.280> you

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
couple of jacks put in so that when you

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.180 
couple of jacks put in so that when you
do<00:04:03.580> try<00:04:04.120> an<00:04:04.540> amp<00:04:04.750> with<00:04:04.930> an<00:04:05.019> effects<00:04:05.320> loop<00:04:05.410> you

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
do try an amp with an effects loop you

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.110 
do try an amp with an effects loop you
have<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.550> option<00:04:06.760> available<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.600> you<00:04:09.120> so

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
have that option available to you so

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.420 
have that option available to you so
again<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.420> think<00:04:10.570> in<00:04:11.260> my<00:04:11.500> opinion<00:04:11.590> this<00:04:12.010> is<00:04:12.070> this

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
again I think in my opinion this is this

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.470 
again I think in my opinion this is this
is<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.880> V<00:04:13.480> setup<00:04:13.959> but<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:15.220> know<00:04:15.480> everybody's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
is the V setup but you know everybody's

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.250 
is the V setup but you know everybody's
different

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
different

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.650 
different
and<00:04:17.380> that's<00:04:18.010> what<00:04:18.190> makes<00:04:18.310> this<00:04:18.520> custom<00:04:19.360> and

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
and that's what makes this custom and

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.300 
and that's what makes this custom and
fine<00:04:21.210> check<00:04:22.210> them<00:04:22.360> out

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
fine check them out

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.360 
fine check them out
