00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
doing this little progression it's going

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.639 
doing this little progression it's going
to<00:01:43.960> strums<00:01:44.320> on<00:01:44.500> a<00:01:44.740> two<00:01:45.340> on<00:01:45.550> D<00:01:45.850> two<00:01:46.420> on<00:01:46.600> e<00:01:46.780> and<00:01:47.140> two

slow<00:02:22.480> down<00:02:22.750> rather<00:02:22.989> dressing<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.680> but<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.250> is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
slow down rather dressing it but this is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.250 
slow down rather dressing it but this is
the<00:02:24.550> kind<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.790> thing<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.209> start<00:02:25.569> off<00:02:25.720> with<00:02:25.989> I

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the kind of thing to start off with I

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
the kind of thing to start off with I
would<00:02:26.739> recommend<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.550> get<00:02:27.700> into<00:02:27.970> doing

would recommend that you get into doing
just<00:02:28.450> playing<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.840> chords<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.620> real<00:02:29.860> simple

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
just playing the chords with real simple

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
strumming making sure you keep the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.410 
strumming making sure you keep the
strumming<00:02:32.230> kind<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.470> evenly<00:02:32.890> spaced<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.550> 1<00:02:33.790> 2

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
strumming kind of evenly spaced like 1 2

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.680 
strumming kind of evenly spaced like 1 2
3<00:02:34.739> 4<00:02:35.739> but<00:02:36.220> nice<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.580> slow<00:02:36.849> make<00:02:37.450> sure<00:02:37.599> that

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
3 4 but nice and slow make sure that

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.150 
3 4 but nice and slow make sure that
you're<00:02:37.840> getting<00:02:37.900> your<00:02:38.080> chord<00:02:38.500> changes<00:02:38.620> right

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160

chord on lifting it off then put it back
on<00:04:32.080> again<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:36.030> think<00:04:37.030> I'll<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:39.479> just

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
on again that's it think I'll of just

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.150 
on again that's it think I'll of just
use<00:04:40.600> again<00:04:40.900> all<00:04:41.110> down<00:04:41.380> strums<00:04:41.710> for<00:04:41.889> this<00:04:42.010> one

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
use again all down strums for this one

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.350 
use again all down strums for this one
don't<00:04:42.340> worry<00:04:42.460> about<00:04:42.550> getting<00:04:42.760> any<00:04:42.970> anything

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
don't worry about getting any anything

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.990 
don't worry about getting any anything
fancy<00:04:43.870> going<00:04:44.080> on<00:04:44.229> just<00:04:46.860> on<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.070> eighth<00:04:48.220> now<00:04:48.400> in

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
fancy going on just on the eighth now in

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000 
fancy going on just on the eighth now in
the<00:04:49.300> pork<00:04:49.510> I've<00:04:49.690> said<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.320> G<00:04:50.500> C<00:04:50.710> scored

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
the pork I've said for the G C scored

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.710 
the pork I've said for the G C scored
really<00:04:51.160> should<00:04:51.520> strum<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.060> thinnest<00:04:52.479> four

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
really should strum the thinnest four

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.140 
really should strum the thinnest four
strings<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.289> I<00:04:53.350> guess<00:04:53.560> that's<00:04:53.830> the<00:04:54.669> preferred

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
strings and I guess that's the preferred

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.700 
strings and I guess that's the preferred
option<00:04:55.449> it<00:04:55.720> will<00:04:55.810> probably<00:04:56.050> sound<00:04:56.380> slightly

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
option it will probably sound slightly

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.080 
option it will probably sound slightly
better<00:04:57.010> if<00:04:57.190> you<00:04:57.310> strum<00:04:57.550> the<00:04:57.639> thinnest<00:04:57.910> four

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
better if you strum the thinnest four

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.150 
better if you strum the thinnest four
strings<00:04:58.389> but<00:04:58.810> if<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.080> hit<00:04:59.260> the<00:04:59.410> a<00:04:59.440> string<00:04:59.979> -

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
strings but if you hit the a string -

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.950 
strings but if you hit the a string -
which<00:05:00.310> is<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.580> fifth<00:05:00.880> string<00:05:01.300> or<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.600> second

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
which is the fifth string or the second

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.930 
which is the fifth string or the second
thickest<00:05:02.320> string<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:03.039> one's<00:05:03.220> okay<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.610> slowly

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
thickest string that one's okay a slowly

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.000 
thickest string that one's okay a slowly
hit<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.539> it<00:05:04.630> you<00:05:04.870> know<00:05:05.110> maybe<00:05:05.620> not<00:05:05.860> quite

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
hit really it you know maybe not quite

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.650 
hit really it you know maybe not quite
as<00:05:06.220> perfect<00:05:06.370> but<00:05:06.699> it<00:05:06.789> you<00:05:07.120> know<00:05:07.240> no<00:05:07.449> one<00:05:07.600> will

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
as perfect but it you know no one will

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.560 
as perfect but it you know no one will
notice<00:05:07.870> I'm<00:05:08.139> sure<00:05:08.350> so<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.430> lot<00:05:10.090> of<00:05:10.180> people<00:05:10.479> would

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
notice I'm sure so a lot of people would

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.600 
notice I'm sure so a lot of people would
beginners<00:05:10.870> find<00:05:11.080> it<00:05:11.169> easier<00:05:11.470> just<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.860> think

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
beginners find it easier just to think

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.890 
beginners find it easier just to think
of<00:05:12.729> getting<00:05:13.030> from<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.270> fifth<00:05:13.510> string<00:05:13.720> or

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
of getting from the fifth string or

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.020 
of getting from the fifth string or
another<00:05:14.710> little<00:05:14.979> trick<00:05:15.160> for<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.460> if<00:05:15.669> you're

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
another little trick for you if you're

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.610 
another little trick for you if you're
not<00:05:16.060> worrying<00:05:16.479> about<00:05:16.539> muting<00:05:17.080> the<00:05:17.229> thickest

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
not worrying about muting the thickest

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:18.570 
not worrying about muting the thickest
string<00:05:17.650> because<00:05:17.979> you'll<00:05:18.099> probably<00:05:18.130> notice

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
string because you'll probably notice

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.879 
string because you'll probably notice
sometimes<00:05:18.940> my<00:05:19.630> thumb<00:05:19.990> sneaks<00:05:20.410> around<00:05:20.590> the

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
sometimes my thumb sneaks around the

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.440 
sometimes my thumb sneaks around the
back<00:05:21.070> there<00:05:21.099> and<00:05:21.310> mutes<00:05:21.849> the<00:05:21.970> thickest<00:05:22.419> string

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
back there and mutes the thickest string

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.029 
back there and mutes the thickest string
something<00:05:23.229> else<00:05:23.380> that<00:05:23.560> we<00:05:23.650> can<00:05:23.770> get<00:05:23.889> onto

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 
something else that we can get onto

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:25.529 
something else that we can get onto
later<00:05:24.370> but<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.789> shouldn't<00:05:25.120> be<00:05:25.240> worrying

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
later but you shouldn't be worrying

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.560 
later but you shouldn't be worrying
about<00:05:25.660> at<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.050> beginner<00:05:26.320> stages<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:26.979> a<00:05:27.580> good

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:28.570 
about at the beginner stages and a good

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.060 
about at the beginner stages and a good
trick<00:05:28.840> can<00:05:29.020> be<00:05:29.169> with<00:05:29.320> this<00:05:29.410> kind<00:05:29.680> of<00:05:29.770> tune<00:05:29.950> is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
trick can be with this kind of tune is

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.190 
trick can be with this kind of tune is
to<00:05:30.280> think<00:05:30.789> about<00:05:31.060> aiming<00:05:31.479> for<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.810> fourth

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
to think about aiming for the fourth

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.830 
to think about aiming for the fourth
string<00:05:32.880> consistently<00:05:33.880> and<00:05:34.090> sometimes<00:05:34.690> you're

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
string consistently and sometimes you're

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.120 
string consistently and sometimes you're
going<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.020> hit<00:05:35.139> the<00:05:35.229> 5th<00:05:35.440> string<00:05:35.620> anyway<00:05:35.919> but

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
going to hit the 5th string anyway but

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.550 
going to hit the 5th string anyway but
that's<00:05:36.340> ok<00:05:36.760> you<00:05:37.330> know<00:05:37.479> so<00:05:37.510> rather<00:05:38.229> than<00:05:38.380> trying

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
that's ok you know so rather than trying

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.260 
that's ok you know so rather than trying
to<00:05:38.620> aim<00:05:38.800> for<00:05:39.130> perfection<00:05:39.190> you<00:05:39.849> aim<00:05:40.000> for<00:05:40.150> the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
to aim for perfection you aim for the

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.850 
to aim for perfection you aim for the
4th<00:05:40.479> string<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:40.750> just<00:05:40.900> allow<00:05:41.320> yourself<00:05:41.800> that

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
4th string and just allow yourself that

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.740 
4th string and just allow yourself that
little<00:05:42.099> bit<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.370> leeway<00:05:42.639> that's<00:05:43.000> a<00:05:43.090> good<00:05:43.270> you

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
little bit of leeway that's a good you

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.820 
little bit of leeway that's a good you
know<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:43.870> did<00:05:44.139> that<00:05:44.320> a<00:05:44.349> lot<00:05:44.500> when<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:44.740> was

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
know I did that a lot when I was

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.020 
know I did that a lot when I was
learning<00:05:44.919> guitar<00:05:45.160> and<00:05:45.460> it<00:05:45.520> never<00:05:45.729> seemed<00:05:45.970> to

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
learning guitar and it never seemed to

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.900 
learning guitar and it never seemed to
go<00:05:46.180> too<00:05:46.240> wrong<00:05:47.190> yeah<00:05:48.190> not<00:05:48.550> that<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.729> can<00:05:48.880> think

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
go too wrong yeah not that I can think

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.230 
go too wrong yeah not that I can think
of<00:05:49.150> anyway<00:05:49.539> I<00:05:49.750> digress<00:05:50.550> uh<00:05:51.550> that's<00:05:52.090> pretty

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
of anyway I digress uh that's pretty

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.490 
of anyway I digress uh that's pretty
much<00:05:52.360> the<00:05:52.599> whole<00:05:52.750> tune<00:05:52.960> if<00:05:53.080> you<00:05:53.169> follow<00:05:53.410> along

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500 
much the whole tune if you follow along

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.589 
much the whole tune if you follow along
with<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.919> record<00:05:54.280> now<00:05:54.460> this<00:05:54.610> is<00:05:54.760> a<00:05:54.789> kind<00:05:55.570> of

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
with the record now this is a kind of

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:56.879 
with the record now this is a kind of
interesting<00:05:55.840> start<00:05:56.200> a<00:05:56.260> bit<00:05:56.410> of<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.560> grower

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
interesting start a bit of a grower

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.529 
interesting start a bit of a grower
because<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.400> can<00:05:57.580> start<00:05:57.880> off<00:05:58.000> with<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.330> just

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
because you can start off with it just

00:05:58.539 --> 00:05:59.260 
because you can start off with it just
doing

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
doing

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.890 
doing
real<00:05:59.510> simple<00:05:59.870> strumming<00:06:00.410> like<00:06:00.680> this<00:06:01.900> then

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
real simple strumming like this then

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:11.530 
real simple strumming like this then
gradually<00:06:03.650> developing<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.340> go<00:06:09.040> and<00:06:10.420> once<00:06:11.420> you

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
gradually developing to go and once you

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.820 
gradually developing to go and once you
can<00:06:11.720> do<00:06:11.810> that<00:06:11.840> if<00:06:12.140> you<00:06:12.170> really<00:06:12.440> want<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.740> get

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
can do that if you really want to get

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.200 
can do that if you really want to get
into<00:06:13.100> it<00:06:13.190> and<00:06:13.280> play<00:06:13.460> along<00:06:13.640> with<00:06:13.700> the<00:06:13.880> record

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
into it and play along with the record

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.210 
into it and play along with the record
the<00:06:14.360> recorded<00:06:14.810> version<00:06:15.110> by<00:06:15.230> the<00:06:15.290> Troggs<00:06:15.680> which

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
the recorded version by the Troggs which

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.550 
the recorded version by the Troggs which
is<00:06:16.340> the<00:06:16.460> one<00:06:16.580> we've<00:06:16.730> based<00:06:16.940> this<00:06:17.120> one<00:06:17.330> off

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:17.560 
is the one we've based this one off

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.410 
is the one we've based this one off
there's<00:06:18.560> a<00:06:18.650> few<00:06:18.890> tiny<00:06:19.280> little<00:06:19.640> variations<00:06:20.240> on

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
there's a few tiny little variations on

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.240 
there's a few tiny little variations on
it<00:06:20.450> where<00:06:20.720> it<00:06:20.990> kind<00:06:21.260> of<00:06:21.320> misses<00:06:21.530> out<00:06:21.860> a<00:06:21.890> chord

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
it where it kind of misses out a chord

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:29.170 
it where it kind of misses out a chord
like<00:06:22.490> right<00:06:22.760> at<00:06:22.910> the<00:06:23.000> beginning<00:06:23.120> it<00:06:23.450> goes<00:06:28.180> and

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
like right at the beginning it goes and

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.970 
like right at the beginning it goes and
then<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:29.450> song<00:06:29.960> stops<00:06:30.260> so<00:06:30.440> that<00:06:30.620> that<00:06:30.770> little

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
then the song stops so that that little

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.430 
then the song stops so that that little
intro<00:06:31.310> there<00:06:31.490> is<00:06:31.610> very<00:06:31.880> very<00:06:32.630> a<00:06:32.810> tiny<00:06:33.140> bit

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 
intro there is very very a tiny bit

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.810 
intro there is very very a tiny bit
different<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:33.950> the<00:06:34.070> strumming<00:06:34.460> pattern<00:06:34.760> and

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:34.820 
different in the strumming pattern and

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:43.870 
different in the strumming pattern and
it's<00:06:35.180> missing<00:06:35.540> a<00:06:35.630> chord<00:06:35.960> change<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:43.430> that

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 
it's missing a chord change and that

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:45.790 
it's missing a chord change and that
little<00:06:44.480> variation<00:06:45.020> happens<00:06:45.200> a<00:06:45.440> little<00:06:45.680> bit

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
little variation happens a little bit

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.910 
little variation happens a little bit
later<00:06:46.040> in<00:06:46.310> the<00:06:46.340> record<00:06:47.030> a<00:06:47.120> solo<00:06:47.590> might<00:06:48.590> be<00:06:48.740> the

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
later in the record a solo might be the

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.320 
later in the record a solo might be the
lick<00:06:49.100> the<00:06:49.250> further<00:06:49.490> link<00:06:49.760> actually<00:06:49.940> that<00:06:50.210> that

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
lick the further link actually that that

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.910 
lick the further link actually that that
wouldn't<00:06:50.570> happen<00:06:50.690> to<00:06:50.840> record<00:06:51.200> a<00:06:51.260> song<00:06:51.410> who

with the records really good idea which

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.770 
with the records really good idea which

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:26.780 
is why I went in the bulk of putting the

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.750 
is why I went in the bulk of putting the
cap<00:07:26.960> loads<00:07:27.200> and<00:07:27.380> stuff<00:07:27.590> on<00:07:27.800> there<00:07:27.980> so<00:07:28.160> that<00:07:28.370> you

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:28.760 
cap loads and stuff on there so that you

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.130 
cap loads and stuff on there so that you
can<00:07:28.910> play<00:07:29.090> along<00:07:29.210> with<00:07:29.450> the<00:07:29.540> recordings<00:07:30.020> even

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140 
can play along with the recordings even

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.660 
can play along with the recordings even
if<00:07:30.560> you're<00:07:30.710> playing<00:07:30.920> a<00:07:31.070> bit<00:07:31.220> simpler<00:07:31.610> than

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.670 
if you're playing a bit simpler than

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.570 
if you're playing a bit simpler than
what<00:07:32.060> I<00:07:32.090> you<00:07:32.510> know<00:07:32.630> the<00:07:32.750> real<00:07:33.170> recording<00:07:33.800> you

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
what I you know the real recording you

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.980 
what I you know the real recording you
know<00:07:34.700> you<00:07:34.760> can<00:07:34.940> play<00:07:35.150> a<00:07:35.180> long<00:07:35.420> little<00:07:35.720> sound

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:35.990 
know you can play a long little sound

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.480 
know you can play a long little sound
cool<00:07:36.200> I<00:07:36.350> think<00:07:36.410> that's<00:07:36.710> a<00:07:36.800> really<00:07:37.340> valuable

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:37.490 
cool I think that's a really valuable

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.390 
cool I think that's a really valuable
experience<00:07:38.420> in<00:07:38.510> it<00:07:38.660> but<00:07:38.870> and<00:07:39.080> and<00:07:39.740> develops

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:40.400 
experience in it but and and develops

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.740 
experience in it but and and develops
you<00:07:40.580> to<00:07:40.760> the<00:07:40.880> point<00:07:41.090> where<00:07:41.240> you<00:07:41.300> can<00:07:41.450> play<00:07:41.600> in<00:07:41.660> a

you to the point where you can play in a

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.710 
you to the point where you can play in a
band<00:07:41.960> which<00:07:42.230> is<00:07:42.910> super<00:07:43.910> cool<00:07:44.030> and<00:07:44.090> kind<00:07:44.540> of<00:07:44.630> the
