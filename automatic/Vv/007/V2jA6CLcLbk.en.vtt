00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
difference I wish we had thought to put

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:19.500 
difference I wish we had thought to put
salt<00:05:18.460> in<00:05:18.670> the<00:05:18.760> computer<00:05:19.150> in<00:05:19.240> that<00:05:19.330> whatever

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
salt in the computer in that whatever

salt in the computer in that whatever
that<00:05:19.840> would<00:05:19.990> have<00:05:20.110> helped<00:05:20.490> we<00:05:21.490> would<00:05:21.850> have

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
that would have helped we would have

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.580 
that would have helped we would have
been<00:05:22.030> done<00:05:22.240> two<00:05:22.450> years<00:05:22.480> earlier<00:05:23.140> that's<00:05:23.410> all

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
been done two years earlier that's all

at the top but building that environment

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.840 
at the top but building that environment
was<00:05:34.480> probably<00:05:34.810> the<00:05:34.960> hardest<00:05:35.340> thing<00:05:36.340> we<00:05:36.520> did<00:05:36.700> in

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
was probably the hardest thing we did in

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:45.060

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 
stars twinkling and it felt right out of

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
trying to do with CG computers which is

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.140 
trying to do with CG computers which is
yeah<00:06:00.500> almost<00:06:01.160> impossible<00:06:01.760> because<00:06:02.030> the

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
yeah almost impossible because the

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.390 
yeah almost impossible because the
computer<00:06:02.600> does<00:06:02.750> everything<00:06:02.960> perfectly<00:06:03.400> and
