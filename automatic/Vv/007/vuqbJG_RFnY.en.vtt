okies oh oh baby so glad i'm not sure
but<00:06:27.460> it<00:06:27.520> paid<00:06:28.330> off<00:06:28.360> yeah<00:06:28.810> there<00:06:29.260> you<00:06:29.380> go<00:06:29.410> there

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
but it paid off yeah there you go there

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:30.840 
but it paid off yeah there you go there
you<00:06:29.680> go<00:06:29.800> you<00:06:30.010> know<00:06:30.100> you<00:06:30.160> get<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.430> crumpled<00:06:30.760> on

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:30.850 
you go you know you get the crumpled on

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.190 
you go you know you get the crumpled on
double<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:32.550> when<00:06:33.550> it<00:06:33.669> hits<00:06:33.850> so<00:06:34.270> it<00:06:34.900> has<00:06:34.960> the

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.200 
double to when it hits so it has the

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.560 
double to when it hits so it has the
same<00:06:35.410> susceptibility<00:06:36.250> with<00:06:36.460> armor<00:06:37.240> breakers

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
same susceptibility with armor breakers

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.480 
same susceptibility with armor breakers
right<00:06:37.810> like<00:06:38.020> if<00:06:38.200> ya<00:06:38.470> okay<00:06:38.860> it's<00:06:39.040> definitely

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
right like if ya okay it's definitely

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:40.950 
right like if ya okay it's definitely
you<00:06:39.760> can<00:06:39.790> definitely<00:06:40.030> armor<00:06:40.389> break<00:06:40.570> it<00:06:40.750> just

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
you can definitely armor break it just

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.650 
you can definitely armor break it just
like<00:06:41.080> those<00:06:41.530> elements<00:06:41.950> okay<00:06:42.490> but<00:06:42.790> it<00:06:43.180> crumbles

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:43.660 
like those elements okay but it crumbles

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:50.490 
like those elements okay but it crumbles
that<00:06:43.870> much<00:06:44.020> easier<00:06:48.210> so<00:06:49.210> that's<00:06:49.419> it<00:06:49.600> for<00:06:49.630> snake

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.500 
that much easier so that's it for snake

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.780 
that much easier so that's it for snake
eyes<00:06:50.680> alright<00:06:51.130> so<00:06:51.280> now<00:06:51.370> we're<00:06:51.490> going<00:06:51.580> to<00:06:51.669> the

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:51.790 
eyes alright so now we're going to the

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.190 
eyes alright so now we're going to the
second<00:06:52.060> round<00:06:52.150> we're<00:06:52.360> almost<00:06:52.510> there<00:06:52.660> guys<00:06:52.900> we
