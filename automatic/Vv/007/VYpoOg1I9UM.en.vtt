but set all of the faders to unity gain

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.650

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
so the mix is just the same as the in

so the mix is just the same as the in
the<00:04:04.750> box<00:04:04.930> 1<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:07.510> great<00:04:07.930> feature<00:04:08.260> of<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.560> X
