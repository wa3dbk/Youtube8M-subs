00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello everyone is slim 314 so we 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.870
 is found today for a tp of 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.900
 redstone 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.200
 so that's a trap then already 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.490
 sorry the tp is not centered at all 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.719
 on the area but it's just that I had 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.240
 neither of the size he would do 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.859
 and from which side would he evolve from 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.330
 it ended like that and I did not get 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.430
 want to do it again 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.640
 so we'll have to do with that I'm 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.130
 sorry if not so down right now we 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.469
 will go to the explanations you go 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.360
 to see it is rather simple in the genre 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 then you may have known what 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.960
 so it's the walls that are going to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.430
 shrink to crush you and 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.270
 I already hear you say it's 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:51.850
 archi boat is simple affair already seen 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.110
 all that then and I brought three 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.110
 modifications 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.200
 and solve all the problems he 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.000
 could there be but in most 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.720
 videos we do not raise these problems 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.670
 precisely to avoid having to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.140
 explain how solves them so bah 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.590
 here I go right away 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.660
 explain so the system is separated into 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.530
 differing subsystems so everything 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.720
 first the pistons that will be used to 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.120
 move the walls I fed them 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 that way so I ride everything from 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.060
 following how the elements I use the 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.210
 same system for doors 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.210
 automatic 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.700
 basically I take three pistons I pose 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:36.369
 a block there no matter 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.170
 a torch there and a block there and so the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.399
 blow it feeds the three so 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.970
 I use the same system 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.810
 so of course that can be compacted 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.190
 but there it was not at all 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.680
 the goal there I just thought that this 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.660
 either it's pretty behind I find is 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.850
 easy to understand so you doubt 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.530
 well how does it work 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.360
 the three rows of pistons are 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.610
 powered and so you can do it 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.290
 as wide as you want at least 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.460
 thought to put a repeater if they ever 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.380
 become a bit too far so 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.780
 right now I explained you a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.369
 little detail that has tired that I 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.630
 the fed with pressure plates 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.209
 after you can feed it with this 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.910
 that you want it can be plates 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.170
 wooden buttons even if I do not think so 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.390
 the person in question press 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.130
 the buttons but no matter it will work 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.590
 as a wire or anything there 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.900
 has no piston behind this block there is 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 behind this block so it suddenly 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.670
 will not destroy and the trap will remain 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.959
 reusable directly after so 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.430
 it's not a worry a bath I'm going all 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.070
 right away explain you the second under 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.370
 system so it's very simple it's the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.600
 signal recovery from the plates of 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 pressure so there's the two plates of 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.660
 pressure just above these two 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.370
 blocks there and so we get the signal 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:55.000
 here that happens directly in a 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.380
 memory cell to feedback so if 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.030
 you are not familiar with 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.660
 memory cells with feedback made 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.270
 it's just setting up signals 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.250
 and so I did a whole tutorial on it 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.420
 and I do not really want to explain again 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.470
 because it can be a bit of a hassle 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.460
 especially if you do not know the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.260
 principle of the memory cell 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.430
 so suddenly I encourage you to go 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 see the video that I add to you in link 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.510
 on the top of your screen for 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.600
 understand how it works 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.970
 in any case what it does is that it 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.830
 so send here and there it's both 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.400
 wires that will feed the pistons a 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.590
 signal much longer than a 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.170
 pulse of pressure plates then 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.400
 why is it because he simply 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.140
 takes a while to die in 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.900
 a wall so suddenly it takes a signal 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.340
 longer to feed the pistons and 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.810
 the advantages of this system is that 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.010
 you can adjust how many lives 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.400
 wanted him to stay at the person in 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.560
 question 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.360
 so suddenly could couple with a 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.820
 another trap a trap with furniture 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.010
 for example so that the person has little 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.610
 of life and still has to fight 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.440
 monsters so 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.060
 all this can be quite interesting so 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.760
 in any case you can change everything 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.260
 just life he'll stay at the 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.980
 person simply trapped in 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.600
 changing the repeater duration so 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.620
 more is short more it will say here 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.049
 so next to you to place the 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.940
 inverters the right way so that the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.910
 signal is identical on both sides and 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.770
 the good especially so there suddenly in 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.440
 my system must be turned on 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.490
 so that the trap is inactive so the 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.200
 blow I make sure that it is lit 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.410
 on both sides here putting nothing here 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.780
 by putting an inverter and it's going 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.840
 feed the system directly there 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.419
 with vertical transmission 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.740
 ok pretty famous so with a torch a 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.380
 block a torch a block a torch a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.750
 block and so suddenly it feeds the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.550
 system and the trap then works 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.830
 immediately a little demonstration - 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.830
 there it is settled on it remains to me I believe 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.120
 of heart and so the effect of this 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.750
 length has it simply because 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.180
 he may even run with the 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.940
 double click it can still not 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.200
 escaped the trap however 8 who can 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.790
 did happen there did not even 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.040
 where and I got trapped he can not 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.850
 he could have jumped over but there 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.010
 I did not succeed 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.920
 after you to add plates of 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:18.710
 pressure if you want it to stay 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.960
 not trap or who are going on 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.070
 automatically take part of which or 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.540
 anything finally to you from the 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.790
 custom there it's just the principle enough 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.230
 simple and really in detail every 

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:29.780
 problems that could have him and who 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:34.820
 have been settled there I'm going to show you 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.900
 in version 100 go of fashion I do not like 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.720
 see a full inventory because after 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.890
 it's going to fuck shit everywhere 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.350
 so suddenly that's it I go through the 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:46.210
 trap I get trapped and there 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.210
 normally it will stay my heart 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:52.550
 if the calculations but but but but three 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.910
 good quarters you see everything is adjustable 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.350
 so it's up to you to do what you want 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.680
 of course if they are several he is 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.970
 to take to several that's the interest 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.300
 so that's it I think we did the 

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.470
 tower 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.270
 so of course to prevent me from being 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.699
 reproach in comments or whatever 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.350
 either the system can of course be 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:16.910
 compact and it's really not compact there 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:19.250
 you can customize it for example 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.990
 for the walls here to close in 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.030
 first ones of the last medium is 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:28.250
 really slowly so that the person 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:30.410
 feel completely trapped and do not 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.740
 can do anything and yet by train 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.479
 to watch his death slowly come back 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:38.090
 so that's up to you custom I'm going 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:40.039
 not there I 'll just explain the 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.370
 principle is he detailing how that 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.289
 market 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.490
 so here I think I answered 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:45.949
 all the possible questions we 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.680
 could land on system so bah 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.960
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:52.910
 go use it and the custom and if you 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.220
 have some castes or bet shown the 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.979
 the less it interests me my costume ise 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.389
 it does just that effect two to 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.169
 the outside it closes first 

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:04.940
 then inside last and so 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.889
 I hope you put it on your 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.620
 servers on your maps about what you 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.210
 want and so of course here here it's 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.060
 leave mountain walls or whatever 

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.979
 you want a house 

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.320
 wall and so I hope I hope that 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.710
 you liked it and we will meet again 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:23.919
 next time for the next tp hi 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:23.919
 to all
