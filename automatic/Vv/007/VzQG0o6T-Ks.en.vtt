low as 200 DPI and you basically just a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.800 
low as 200 DPI and you basically just a
chain<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.190> on-the-fly<00:02:36.700> DPI<00:02:37.210> switching<00:02:37.570> you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.110 
chain as on-the-fly DPI switching you
just<00:02:37.930> go<00:02:38.050> like<00:02:38.350> that<00:02:38.830> and<00:02:38.980> just<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.400> one<00:02:39.730> two

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
just go like that and just like one two

really<00:03:11.440> played<00:03:11.620> around<00:03:11.860> with<00:03:11.980> this<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.720> I'm

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
really played around with this so I'm

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.840 
really played around with this so I'm
sure<00:03:13.930> there<00:03:14.140> is<00:03:14.170> an<00:03:14.530> optimal<00:03:15.130> wafer<00:03:15.520> but<00:03:15.730> I

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
sure there is an optimal wafer but I

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.840 
sure there is an optimal wafer but I
just<00:03:16.030> decided<00:03:16.360> just<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.170> go<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:18.040> like

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
just decided just to go with the like

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.340 
just decided just to go with the like
this<00:03:19.000> just<00:03:19.390> put<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.690> in<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:20.080> can<00:03:20.200> actually

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
this just put it in you can actually

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.290 
this just put it in you can actually
didn't<00:03:20.680> even<00:03:20.860> take<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.130> out<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.400> to<00:03:21.880> be<00:03:22.000> honest

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
didn't even take it out and to be honest

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.660 
didn't even take it out and to be honest
the<00:03:22.570> balance<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.170> it<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.500> alright<00:03:23.920> but<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.550> can

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
the balance of it is alright but you can

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.190 
the balance of it is alright but you can
just<00:03:24.700> play<00:03:24.940> around<00:03:25.060> with<00:03:25.330> that<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.600> nifty

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
just play around with that this nifty

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500 
just play around with that this nifty
feature<00:03:26.560> in<00:03:27.490> my<00:03:27.610> opinion<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:28.120> doesn't<00:03:28.330> really

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
feature in my opinion it doesn't really

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.230 
feature in my opinion it doesn't really
make<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.750> that<00:03:29.080> big<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.410> difference<00:03:30.240> that's

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
make it that big of a difference that's

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.940 
make it that big of a difference that's
it<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.350> I'm<00:03:32.470> going<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.620> move<00:03:32.770> on<00:03:32.920> to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
it for that so I'm going to move on to

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.720 
it for that so I'm going to move on to
the<00:03:33.430> comfort<00:03:34.030> mouse<00:03:34.420> definitely<00:03:35.050> it's<00:03:35.350> a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
the comfort mouse definitely it's a

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.170 
the comfort mouse definitely it's a
resemblance<00:03:36.730> of<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.270> g5<00:03:37.750> g7<00:03:38.410> shape<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.730> has

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
resemblance of the g5 g7 shape it has

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.940 
resemblance of the g5 g7 shape it has
when<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.900> put<00:03:41.080> your<00:03:41.110> hand<00:03:41.410> on<00:03:41.530> it<00:03:41.590> it

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
when you put your hand on it it

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.010 
when you put your hand on it it
definitely<00:03:42.510> feels<00:03:43.510> very<00:03:43.810> comfortable

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
definitely feels very comfortable

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.220 
definitely feels very comfortable
however<00:03:44.800> it's<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.820> different<00:03:46.600> kind<00:03:46.690> of<00:03:46.810> feeling

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
however it's a different kind of feeling

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.030

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
use the cloth pad i guess because of the

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.500 
use the cloth pad i guess because of the
main<00:06:08.680> reason<00:06:09.040> that<00:06:09.070> you're<00:06:09.670> you're<00:06:10.120> putting

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
main reason that you're you're putting

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.780 
main reason that you're you're putting
your<00:06:10.630> entire<00:06:10.690> this<00:06:11.380> part<00:06:11.650> of<00:06:11.740> your<00:06:11.830> hand<00:06:12.250> onto

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
your entire this part of your hand onto

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:15.480 
your entire this part of your hand onto
the<00:06:13.120> onto<00:06:13.660> the<00:06:14.080> mat<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:14.650> for<00:06:14.950> example<00:06:15.040> if<00:06:15.370> I

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the onto the mat so for example if I

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.310 
the onto the mat so for example if I
promise<00:06:15.970> it<00:06:16.420> won't<00:06:16.660> be<00:06:16.810> as<00:06:16.900> comfort<00:06:17.200> because

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
promise it won't be as comfort because

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.200 
promise it won't be as comfort because
it's<00:06:17.650> just<00:06:17.800> gonna<00:06:18.010> keep<00:06:18.520> my<00:06:18.640> slightly<00:06:18.940> it's

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
it's just gonna keep my slightly it's

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.880 
it's just gonna keep my slightly it's
gonna<00:06:19.360> spice<00:06:19.930> she's<00:06:20.140> gonna<00:06:20.290> like<00:06:20.590> start

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890 
gonna spice she's gonna like start

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.170 
gonna spice she's gonna like start

to<00:06:23.020> wearing<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.650> skin<00:06:23.919> off<00:06:24.039> I<00:06:24.160> guess<00:06:24.220> but<00:06:24.580> with

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
to wearing the skin off I guess but with

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.629 
to wearing the skin off I guess but with
the<00:06:25.000> clock<00:06:25.120> my<00:06:25.360> guess<00:06:25.600> that<00:06:25.870> is<00:06:26.110> just<00:06:26.680> gives<00:06:27.490> a

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
the clock my guess that is just gives a

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.120 
the clock my guess that is just gives a
little<00:06:27.699> bit<00:06:28.000> more<00:06:28.449> comfort<00:06:28.990> overall<00:06:29.830> like

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
little bit more comfort overall like

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.719 
little bit more comfort overall like
however<00:06:30.729> I<00:06:30.850> how<00:06:31.479> I<00:06:31.509> compared<00:06:32.500> it<00:06:32.650> to<00:06:32.710> the<00:06:33.220> Kauri

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:33.729 
however I how I compared it to the Kauri

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 
deathadder dzai I I can't I guess it's
