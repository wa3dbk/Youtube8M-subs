00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.460
 meditated and rose above the floor there 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.920
 Photo 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 one with an object that depicts a flight 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.840
 using any support and the second 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.690
 Photo background application will help 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.280
 combine these two images and erase 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.640
 used foot 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.989

 hp and it costs $ 2 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 just don't come up now earlier we 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.859
 studied on film filmed by the way I thought 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.050
 so much this film would be overlooked 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.570
 throw everything out now on the figure 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.270
 need to throw out is not worth the memory 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.850
 that did to her cabin ponesesh hunting 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 no, no, I donâ€™t know the numbers at home 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.290
 myself like that but that's about it my 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.290
 next story 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.960
 the days of amateur soap trays are over 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.270
 The era of digital technology has begun. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.990
 however sometimes looking old 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.450
 Photo 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.460
 we still stumble upon the unmanifested 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.460
 negatives and what to do with them 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.969
 We have a lot of people working on our editorial board. 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.399
 each of them had at least a home 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.530
 one is not a digitized film we 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.420
 decided to digitize the whole thing in office 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 conditions so i think at your home 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.509
 It will do the same thing might have 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.750
 someone the question arises why all 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.020
 it does not take and en masse do not carry the photo in 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.609
 Salon really why to be honest 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.599
 I really have no time and do not know 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:10.599
 where and who could help me and once 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:13.030
 laziness and really why go somewhere 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:15.640
 if at home or at work you can 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.430
 use an ordinary scanner any 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.480
 firms and absolutely free to overtake 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.910
 photo to figure 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.040
 no longer looked under the cover of his 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.840
 scanner take a look see what 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.180
 in almost all the latest models 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.700
 there is such a compartment for 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.700
 scanning film and transfer 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.129
 photos to computer 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.680
 So we insert the film and close the lid 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.870
 scanner on computer open 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.290
 the program through which you usually 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.459
 scan documents here choose 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.739
 item to scan the film then press 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.130
 button to scan negatives 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:57.209
 and send them a file at the bottom of the window 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:00.150
 there is a button to change the parameters 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:04.060
 click and select item 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.790
 additional parameters and rm here 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.780
 I choose the quality of the input resolution 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:13.450
 the more the better and set 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.590
 checkmarks opposite functions that will help 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.169
 improve picture ok 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.209
 the scanner started scanning after 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.790
 image will be displayed 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.540
 necessary to correct it directly 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.700
 in a programme 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.379
 and then click finish 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.629
 Of course the picture is far from ideal and with him 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.040
 still need to work 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.900
 photo editors but the usual scanner is not 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.430
 than all you can use is, 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.000
 special scanners for 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:45.640

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.480
 millimeter film 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.909
 the device immediately comes with 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.349
 software that will help 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.349
 edit pictures 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:05.980

 330 to 600 dollars if not at hand 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.569
 proved no scanner is not 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.299
 be upset you can digitize photos with 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.590
 using a smartphone is possible thanks to 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.500
 helmut program

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.610
 tips on how to use 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.599
 the program here I am straight to the negative and 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.610
 put it on some 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:44.520
 illuminated surface in my case 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:48.849
 this will be the phone screen in order to 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:55.080
 the film was evenly highlighted better 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:58.830
 use tape fix the film 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.520
 on the surface of the phone either on 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.979
 the surface is highlighted to you not to glass 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:08.610
 choose the color option for the program itself 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:14.159
 negative and then press the captcha button 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:16.800
 Your camera is now starting to shoot here. 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.469
 the main thing is to fix the frame correctly 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.650
 so that your hands do not shake because otherwise 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:26.449
 everything will turn out blurred effect you don't 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:30.449
 get here we got a frame 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.729
 now press the button is ready now 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:36.090
 the application offers us to install 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:36.690
 the borders of the image while in the frame should not 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.639
 get there 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.020
 perforation of the film that is these white 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:46.319
 squares on the side press the ok button and 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:50.610
 here we have the initial 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:52.969
 picture further with photos 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.259
 will need a little work 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.699
 adjust brightness and contrast 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.590
 adjust color balance 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.659
 tone saturation 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.029
 and light to those who are in it 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:03.690
 understands the special labor settings not 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.240
 will make up 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.770
 However, for people like me who is nothing in this 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.060
 doesn't have to understand 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.969
 to experiment 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.490
 how to make a photo better after all 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:15.029
 settings click in the center of the screen button 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.610
 scan 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.000
 and the photo is saved in your gallery 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.990
 smartphone and one more tip 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.180
 experimentally , we found out that 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.940
 for best effect is better 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.379
 shoot a negative in a dark room than 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.930
 less light will be around 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:33.949
 so much the better but the developers advised 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:37.050
 another option 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:39.839
 put your light source in a box 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:44.759
 with a small hole for the camera 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:47.319
 phone on top like this 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:49.529
 This will allow to do better 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:49.529
 Photo 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.969
 By the way, right after the photo is digitized 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:57.909
 they can share with all your 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:07:00.519
 friends on facebook or throw in 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:03.519
 cloud storage dropbox right from 

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:10.029
 the program itself catch the crust from on 

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:11.080
 the application download did not have time 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.139
