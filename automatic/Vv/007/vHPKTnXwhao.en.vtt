00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.309
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.110
 I presented you the website 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.969
 jailbreak for dummy dot com which has 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.139
 was created by ipod touch the pros that 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.580
 you must surely know who is a 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.099
 very good youtuber on all that 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.689
 regards the jailbreak and the iphone 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.760
 so here is the homepage of the site 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.109
 so in fact this site is fully 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.689
 guided to show you how 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.880
 jailbreak any iphone ipod 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.760
 Touch or iPad in any 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.110
 so firmware to know that this site 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.360
 regroups only I have the break 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 under so little jailbreak booster 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.409
 untethered it is very convenient since 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.879
 can restart our iphone so 

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:42.519
 normal so we turn it off again 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.589
 unlike jailbreak tedder on 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.449
 which one must connect the iphone to 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.519
 the computer open a software all that 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:49.299
 to restart the iphone so it's not 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.129
 very convenient 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:52.629
 that's why this site brings together 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:56.710
 only the devils ryan tedder 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.900
 available so first step choose 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.379
 its operating system so mac or 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.970
 windows 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.330
 I'm on windows so I choose 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.490
 windows then so there we have all 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.040
 apple devices so ipod touch iphone 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.450
 or ipad that came out like you 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.950
 see there is no iphone 5 since no 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.420
 jailbreak but available at the time 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.660
 I speak for the iphone 5 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.010
 nor even for the bones 6.0 there I'm talking about 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.680
 untethered jailbreak as I was 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.970
 say I'm going to select iphone 4s 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.120
 for example if I want to jailbreak my 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 iphone 4s then we choose if it is 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.080
 activated or not 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.490
 so when it's not activated it's up to 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.050
 to say that we must restore it 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.390
 you have logo itunes that are displayed 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.530
 like this and when they activated it's 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.570
 when you can use it sailing 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.950
 to install applications but who 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.980
 is not jailbroken so me mine there 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.360
 is like these is activated so he 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.550
 is already jailbroken suck me for you 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.710
 show and so here we have the versions 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.140
 available so it goes from 5 points 0 to 5 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.960
 points 1.5.1 point this is the last 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.510
 cable jailbreak version on iphone 4s 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.880
 not jailbroken too much if we say finally brief 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.790
 since justice still can not 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.770
 to be jailbroken and that's why 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 starts from 5.0 because the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.030
 iphone 4s 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 the first ones that existed they were 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.800
 minimal 5.0 there is that will ever exist a 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.080
 iphone 4s with garlic bone 4 for example 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.650
 so I will choose for example go 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.569
 5.0 points and so here we have the software 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.870
 available so that's the na 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.510
 that 1 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.069
 these absences so I click on it and there 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.080
 we have a completely detailed tutorial and 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.959
 so the word can click here to 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.060
 to download absinthe so I click on 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.560
 sees the zip file that is downloading 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.230
 after that there will be more than zips and 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.180
 and open the software so here at 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.160
 when we need zips and we would have 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.620
 the software after we click on 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.769
 jailbreak and here we connect in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.330
 wifi and after we go to cydia if the tutorial 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.040
 which is still well detailed 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.140
 does not help you or you do not 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.790
 do not understand you also have links 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.360
 for the videos that explain this 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.250
 jailbreak 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.450
 so here we see a video of ipod touch 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.630
 the pros so on the jailbreak 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.060
 untethered as I meant from 5.0 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.519
 or 5.0.1 with wormwood so who is 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.810
 compatible with iphone 4s 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.730
 according to the criteria we have selected 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.290
 previously so there as you see 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 not many firms were available 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.850
 for iphone 4s so we will take a 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.570
 older iphone for example the iphone 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.010
 3g is active and so we see that we have 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.880
 still many more world 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.859
 available doping iphone 3gs exists 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.109
 in version 3.0 so the first ones that have 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.090
 been done so here's the iphone 3gs 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:29.280
 we can jailbreak version 3.0 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.739
 at five point points is so always 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 not bones 6 at the time I'm talking to you 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.780
 so do not go back to version 3.0.1 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.920
 we see that we have redsnow software so 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.150
 again with a tutorial 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.109
 detailed and a link to download it 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.480
 if I take another version as 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:49.109
 parent the 4.2.1 that comes from the ios 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.480
 4 we have the software greenpoison so 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.910
 the device we download it we have a 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.220
 tutorial with screenshots so 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.440
 very complete tutorial and then we have 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.090
 again the link for the video if 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.950
 never did we understand the text 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.870
 so that's normally you should 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.700
 now know how to jailbreak 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.500
 Any iphone ipod touch or ipad 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.250
 to any version of way 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.660
 untethered
