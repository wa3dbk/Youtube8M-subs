00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:13.539 
inverted so that it looks the same as

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:15.449 
inverted so that it looks the same as
the<00:00:13.719> tablature<00:00:14.109> as<00:00:14.410> you<00:00:14.619> normally<00:00:14.799> read<00:00:15.219> on<00:00:15.430> a

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459

the tablature as you normally read on a
page<00:00:15.760> or<00:00:16.090> on<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.080> internet<00:00:17.410> or<00:00:17.529> whatever<00:00:17.859> okay

single notes or many notes at the same
time<00:00:30.670> okay<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:31.510> you<00:00:32.079> can<00:00:32.259> never<00:00:32.379> know<00:00:32.649> just<00:00:33.039> by

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
time okay and you can never know just by

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.709 
time okay and you can never know just by
reading<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.550> tablature<00:00:33.940> unless<00:00:34.569> it

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:34.719 
reading the tablature unless it

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.259 
reading the tablature unless it
specifically<00:00:35.170> marked<00:00:35.589> on<00:00:35.710> top<00:00:35.980> how<00:00:36.670> long<00:00:36.999> each

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
specifically marked on top how long each

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.910 
specifically marked on top how long each
note<00:00:37.600> should<00:00:37.839> be<00:00:37.929> played<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.440> always<00:00:38.620> have

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
note should be played so you always have

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.950 
note should be played so you always have
to<00:00:39.039> listen<00:00:39.339> to<00:00:39.370> the<00:00:39.550> original<00:00:39.670> recording<00:00:40.569> to

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
to listen to the original recording to

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.729 
to listen to the original recording to
determine<00:00:41.499> the<00:00:42.129> length<00:00:42.309> okay<00:00:43.229> so<00:00:44.229> on<00:00:44.530> my

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
determine the length okay so on my

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.549 
determine the length okay so on my
website<00:00:45.039> have<00:00:45.219> three<00:00:45.579> examples<00:00:45.999> and<00:00:46.600> they're

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
website have three examples and they're

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
website have three examples and they're
going<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.829> show<00:00:48.010> them<00:00:48.039> to<00:00:48.489> you<00:00:48.639> now<00:00:49.499> figure<00:00:50.499> 1

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
going to show them to you now figure 1

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.919 
going to show them to you now figure 1
it's<00:00:52.239> two<00:00:52.510> chords<00:00:52.899> and<00:00:53.159> because<00:00:54.359> all<00:00:55.359> of<00:00:55.420> the

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
it's two chords and because all of the

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.919 
it's two chords and because all of the
numbers<00:00:56.350> on<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.920> strings<00:00:57.219> are<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:58.749> same

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
numbers on the strings are in the same

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.729 
numbers on the strings are in the same
vertical<00:00:59.350> axis<00:01:00.069> so<00:01:00.969> in<00:01:01.539> the<00:01:01.749> first<00:01:01.929> chord<00:01:02.440> that

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
vertical axis so in the first chord that

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.200 
vertical axis so in the first chord that
we're<00:01:02.920> going<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.309> play<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.729> going<00:01:03.940> to<00:01:04.089> sound

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
we're going to play is going to sound

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.929 
we're going to play is going to sound
like<00:01:04.330> this<00:01:04.449> for<00:01:04.780> example<00:01:05.399> that's<00:01:06.399> an<00:01:06.579> E<00:01:06.759> major

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 
like this for example that's an E major

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:08.880 
like this for example that's an E major
it<00:01:07.299> doesn't<00:01:07.630> say<00:01:07.810> E<00:01:07.869> major<00:01:08.200> and<00:01:08.560> it<00:01:08.649> doesn't

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
it doesn't say E major and it doesn't

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
it doesn't say E major and it doesn't
tell<00:01:09.009> you<00:01:09.039> what<00:01:09.250> fingers<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.880> put<00:01:10.090> on<00:01:10.299> which

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
tell you what fingers to put on which

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.569 
tell you what fingers to put on which
frets<00:01:10.899> but<00:01:11.140> it<00:01:11.229> does<00:01:11.350> tell<00:01:11.590> you<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:12.310> you're

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
frets but it does tell you that you're

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:18.840 
frets but it does tell you that you're
gonna<00:01:12.820> play<00:01:13.619> 02

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.250 

because<00:01:19.150> they're<00:01:19.330> all<00:01:19.510> in<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:19.780> same<00:01:19.960> vertical

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
because they're all in the same vertical

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.050 
because they're all in the same vertical
axis<00:01:20.860> though<00:01:21.159> all<00:01:21.340> those<00:01:21.460> notes<00:01:21.729> should<00:01:21.880> be<00:01:21.970> at

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
axis though all those notes should be at

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.840 
axis though all those notes should be at
the<00:01:22.119> same<00:01:22.330> time

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.190 

vertical<00:01:27.850> axis

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.649 

so<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.369> time<00:01:34.610> should<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.119> play<00:01:35.299> like<00:01:35.329> this

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.039 

okay<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:38.719> that's<00:01:39.049> figure<00:01:39.320> one<00:01:39.530> figure<00:01:39.770> two

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:41.049 
okay so that's figure one figure two

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.039 
okay so that's figure one figure two
shows<00:01:42.049> you<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.530> chromatic<00:01:43.009> ascent<00:01:43.880> and<00:01:44.060> sm<00:01:44.810> just

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
shows you a chromatic ascent and sm just

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.300 
shows you a chromatic ascent and sm just
means<00:01:45.259> that<00:01:45.350> it's<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:45.649> chromatic<00:01:46.159> line

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
means that it's a chromatic line

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.410 
means that it's a chromatic line
chromatic<00:01:46.909> needs<00:01:47.119> all<00:01:47.380> notes<00:01:48.549> okay<00:01:49.549> just<00:01:50.179> all

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
chromatic needs all notes okay just all

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.559 
chromatic needs all notes okay just all
colors<00:01:50.929> almost<00:01:51.200> okay<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:53.149> should<00:01:53.420> be

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
colors almost okay and it should be

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.370 
colors almost okay and it should be
played<00:01:53.689> like<00:01:53.810> this<00:01:54.429> so<00:01:55.429> zero<00:01:56.119> on<00:01:56.780> this<00:01:57.079> pity

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
played like this so zero on this pity

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.770 
played like this so zero on this pity
string<00:01:57.799> 0<00:01:58.090> 1<00:01:59.090> 2<00:01:59.659> 3<00:01:59.929> 4<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.979> then<00:02:01.759> zero<00:02:02.179> on<00:02:02.569> the<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
string 0 1 2 3 4 and then zero on the a

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.339 
string 0 1 2 3 4 and then zero on the a
string<00:02:02.929> of<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.409> one<00:02:04.720> so<00:02:05.720> altogether<00:02:05.929> it

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
string of that one so altogether it

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.190 
string of that one so altogether it
should<00:02:06.560> be<00:02:06.679> something<00:02:06.920> like<00:02:07.039> this<00:02:11.019> again<00:02:12.019> you

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
should be something like this again you

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.780 
should be something like this again you
would<00:02:12.349> not<00:02:12.500> know<00:02:12.799> how<00:02:13.010> fast<00:02:13.280> or<00:02:13.519> slow<00:02:13.579> you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
would not know how fast or slow you

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.819 
would not know how fast or slow you
should<00:02:14.030> play<00:02:14.239> each<00:02:14.420> individual<00:02:14.989> notes<00:02:15.410> but

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
should play each individual notes but

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.530 
should play each individual notes but
I'm<00:02:16.069> playing<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:16.790> you<00:02:16.880> now<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.390> just
