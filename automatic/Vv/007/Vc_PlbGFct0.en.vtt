00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 hello to all welcome to this 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.660
 video that aims at you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.769
 present the sherco 2,90 ester model 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.519
 2011 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.400
 in this video is simple I would have 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.770
 could call that the trial bike for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 Dummies is zero like me so here I go 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 introduce you briefly this bike of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.349
 2.90 st then I will introduce you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 on everything but the impressions on the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.610
 motorcycle I have a very low level all the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.200
 motorcycle for dummies but I will you 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.120
 show how we can use 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 this bike and especially the sensations that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.600
 I have when I wanted to buy it I had 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.540
 a lot of trouble finding precisely 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.670
 sensations of two draws like 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 me there was only pro a and all 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.670
 makes a presentation of a motorcycle so 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:57.449
 dropped appeal 2011 is and 2.90 this is a 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:01.300
 2 172 cm cube exactly it is 65 kg 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.030
 you have a tank it makes 2.7 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.720
 liters a good capacity it consumes 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 not so much so yes well rolled you 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.869
 have a saddle height of 65 cm you 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.229
 have an injection by the tribute 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.640
 electronic 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 then suspensions 165 at the front 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.990
 175 back liquid cooling 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.330
 box 5 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.540
 and then with that that's enough it's a 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:35.500
 small specificity then on various 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.899
 motorcycle like this you have 2 2 maps to 1 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.090
 ap 2 which allows you to change the 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.190
 engine mapping so that's a 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.460
 specialist would say that it's great 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.660
 it changes everything by cons for me it's 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.179
 not great it does not change everything because 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:53.080
 I sing I feel pretty little 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.090
 the gap under the edige and and a draw 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.860
 what more can you say about this bike down 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.929
 now it's going to be more about the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.149
 sensations how to use this bike 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.680
 then you will see it on the few 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.070
 pictures that I'm going to m after you 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.229
 there is enough to make crossings 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:13.020
 there is a frame that is terrible we feel 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.150
 the modern frame a tubular frame 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.730
 then the sherco are passed in frame 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.680
 tubular since 2010 and it's a 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.990
 big change we see in the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.830
 motorcycles if you are looking for a motorcycle and you 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:29.220
 do not know too much to take as 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.050
 capabilities like 2010 2009 2010 this is a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.910
 big evolution in the trial bike 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.890
 before with big cat if you 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.800
 want tubular chassis that's fine 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.620
 a lot more will help correct 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.120
 mistakes when we are when we have a 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.690
 little piloting yourself when you have a 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.020
 big steering so in sensations these 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.730
 motorcycles that is relatively powerful 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.520
 when I took 2.90 I was afraid of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.110
 this power precisely against the 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.390
 power and the relatively controlled 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.060
 and although it may be down there is 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.800
 possibility of largely being done 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.360
 pleasure and then two we do not have to 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.390
 to go like a madman like 1 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.910
 bourdin whose good enough to last 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.640
 what do you cash to turn it to 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.950
 others and let's go calmly and then everything 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.900
 goes on and not everything especially at the net not 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.900
 need to speed up like crazy 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.870
 really really good everything at the gas net 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.570
 gas twice and then all the little ones 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:28.350
 the small obstacles we pass enough 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.410
 easily the shock absorbers part I you 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.000
 said 165 at the front 175 at the back 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.000
 it's bluffing you have 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.730
 shock absorbers that are super super 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.700
 capacities and there with dampers 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.560
 like to mate with the frame you 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.070
 will really go easy on 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.530
 obstacles that with other motorcycles would 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.090
 would be impossible to pass is valid 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.200
 or over obstacles you feel good 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.280
 finally and it's the bike that is you 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.030
 so now I'm going to talk to you about 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.890
 settings at the time this bike is this 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.270
 kind of bike it's super simple I'm 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.340
 not due 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.400
 all mechanical and well it's really 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.350
 easy by changing to anjou in 2 3 bis 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.530
 there is enough to do but in a few 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.550
 minutes or totally boning 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.250
 the interview there is almost no 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.560
 maintenance almost no maintenance he 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.959
 there is a very regular interview but it's going 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.970
 you take a few minutes each 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.150
 exit and then from time to time drain 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.000
 and drain the box drain the box 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.580
 it depends we do just about all 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.490
 the 20 hours against each exit 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.550
 cd cleaning it seems logical but 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.070
 that's how we guarantee the duration 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.490
 of one of a motorcycle cleaning and 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.139
 after greasing the wd 40 this is a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.080
 product that is magical we put two 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:52.139
 everywhere that avoids the squeaks his life 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.600
 all hyper important on this kind of 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.180
 motorcycle the air filter and then there the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.949
 flesh counts precisely 2000 2011 by 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.320
 report to the advanced model a lot more 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.050
 simple the air filter housing is 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.630
 here and in a few seconds you can 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.310
 access to air filters so that's 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.930
 really in just a few seconds 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.430
 whereas before it was a little more 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.560
 complicated on others all of us a little 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:18.630
 more complicated and that's really the b 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:20.400
 to ba for the bike well well 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.120
 be careful with each at each 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.550
 exit from to use to thoroughly clean the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.410
 motorcycle so I wanted to say just now 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.690
 it's a motorcycle that's relatively 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.340
 powerful yet quite easy to 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:34.470
 master but still there is when 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.150
 even you still have to 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.000
 fork is the same there is easily 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.789
 possibility of modifying the a dream of 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.860
 modify the settings by adding more 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.949
 or less oil and with a small screw 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.090
 by forcing the fork more or less 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:49.260
 that can be done in just 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.240
 a few minutes 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.620
 although being novice in trial quickly 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.940
 you can see that 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:58.680
 making some adjustments but some 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.750
 simple settings with each output you 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.490
 change your settings a bit 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.849
 and quickly you can 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.800
 to see that we will arrive on safe 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.199
 use pretty cool and quickly goes 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.740
 see that finally eh ben we acquire 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.380
 a small level 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.940
 the same for the tire pressure hyper 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.990
 important then tire pressure 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.470
 it's years 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.350
 11 04 bar at the front and back one 

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:23.760
 advocates for competitions 0.37 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.000
 bar then there must be more one 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.520
 falls into in the precision that me 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.860
 exceeds by cons it is true that between 0 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.540
 4 barred 06 bar you really feel 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.490
 really the difference and that's 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:36.510
 something you can do at 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.850
 daily 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.460
 the same when you prepare the bike before 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.750
 to come out well have a manometer at 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.510
 departure I do not know but our masters 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.980
 I was doing that at random and then 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.060
 finally it does not work at all it takes 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.060
 do this mano m 

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.900
 time is time 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.110
 6
