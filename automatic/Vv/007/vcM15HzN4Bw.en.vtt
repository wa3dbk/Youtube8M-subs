00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
can then inspect the rear wiper blade on

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:23.890 
can then inspect the rear wiper blade on
this<00:04:22.070> fan<00:04:22.300> we're<00:04:23.300> going<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.480> looking<00:04:23.720> for<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
this fan we're going to looking for the

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.060 
this fan we're going to looking for the
same<00:04:24.080> things<00:04:24.290> that<00:04:24.350> we<00:04:24.500> were<00:04:24.590> looking<00:04:24.680> for<00:04:24.860> up

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
same things that we were looking for up

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.620 
same things that we were looking for up
on<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.280> front<00:04:25.490> although<00:04:26.000> everything<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
on the front although everything the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.730 
on the front although everything the
characteristic<00:04:27.170> would<00:04:27.230> be<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.410> same<00:04:27.620> that

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
characteristic would be the same that

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.960 
characteristic would be the same that
the<00:04:27.860> blade<00:04:28.040> itself<00:04:28.310> is<00:04:28.490> going<00:04:28.640> to<00:04:28.700> need<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.880> be

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
the blade itself is going to need to be

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:29.650 
the blade itself is going to need to be
replaced

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
replaced

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.720 
replaced
now<00:04:30.050> due<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.770> fact<00:04:30.800> that<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.250> rear<00:04:31.490> wiper

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
now due to the fact that the rear wiper

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.030 
now due to the fact that the rear wiper
blade<00:04:31.940> on<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:32.240> van<00:04:32.480> is<00:04:32.750> a<00:04:32.930> serviceable<00:04:33.620> unit

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
blade on this van is a serviceable unit

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.710 
blade on this van is a serviceable unit
meaning<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.730> blade<00:04:35.000> assembly<00:04:35.180> stays

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
meaning the blade assembly stays

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.270 
meaning the blade assembly stays
attached<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.350> wiper<00:04:36.500> arm<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:37.010> you<00:04:37.070> just

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
attached to the wiper arm and you just

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.160 
attached to the wiper arm and you just
replace<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.760> wiper<00:04:37.910> strip<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:38.870> first

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
replace the wiper strip so the first

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.360 
replace the wiper strip so the first
thing<00:04:39.290> that<00:04:39.410> we're<00:04:39.530> going<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.680> want<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.920> do<00:04:40.010> is

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
thing that we're going to want to do is

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.620 
thing that we're going to want to do is
remove<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.850> blade<00:04:41.000> from<00:04:41.180> the<00:04:41.300> assembly

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
remove the blade from the assembly

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.540 
remove the blade from the assembly
itself<00:04:41.930> here<00:04:42.650> is<00:04:42.680> going<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.920> be<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.070> compression

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550
