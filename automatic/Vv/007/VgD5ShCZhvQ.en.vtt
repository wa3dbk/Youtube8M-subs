2 gigabytes of ddr3 RAM now as you know
octa<00:00:34.380> means<00:00:34.590> 8<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> Samsung<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.510> eight

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
octa means 8 so the Samsung has eight

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
octa means 8 so the Samsung has eight

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
one point 3 gigahertz now we will be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
one point 3 gigahertz now we will be
using<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.539> geek<00:00:45.719> bench<00:00:45.930> tool<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.829> measure<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
using the geek bench tool to measure the

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.819 
using the geek bench tool to measure the
processor<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.239> memory<00:00:48.390> performance<00:00:48.829> between

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
processor and memory performance between

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.750 
processor and memory performance between
the<00:00:50.399> two<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:51.149> let's<00:00:51.390> dive<00:00:51.780> right<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.579> okay<00:00:53.579> so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
the two so let's dive right in okay so

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.910 
the two so let's dive right in okay so
before<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.270> launch<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.840> benchmarking<00:00:55.620> tool

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
before we launch the benchmarking tool

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
before we launch the benchmarking tool
let's<00:00:56.370> make<00:00:56.640> sure<00:00:56.670> nothing<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.239> running<00:00:57.510> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
let's make sure nothing is running in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.060 
let's make sure nothing is running in
the<00:00:57.660> background<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.199> iPad<00:00:58.530> air<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.800> clear

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the background the iPad air is clear

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.970 
the background the iPad air is clear
let's<00:00:59.879> clean<00:01:00.570> all<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.079> running<00:01:01.260> programs<00:01:01.770> off

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
let's clean all the running programs off

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.130 
let's clean all the running programs off
of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> Samsung<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.940> let's<00:01:03.660> also<00:01:03.840> clear<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
of the Samsung and let's also clear the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.200 
of the Samsung and let's also clear the
RAM<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.769> Samsung<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.430> we<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.060> that

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
RAM on the Samsung because we have that

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
RAM on the Samsung because we have that
option<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.350> cleared<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> memory<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
option here so cleared the memory and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.480 
option here so cleared the memory and
now<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.750> two<00:01:09.990> clean<00:01:10.320> slates<00:01:10.710> ready<00:01:11.310> to

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
now we have two clean slates ready to

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
now we have two clean slates ready to
run<00:01:11.670> some<00:01:11.880> benchmarks<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.600> so<00:01:12.869> let's<00:01:13.049> launch

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
run some benchmarks on so let's launch

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
run some benchmarks on so let's launch
Geekbench<00:01:14.869> let's<00:01:15.869> go<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.549> Geekbench<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
Geekbench let's go to Geekbench on the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.179 
Geekbench let's go to Geekbench on the
Samsung<00:01:18.360> Tab<00:01:18.570> pro<00:01:18.770> 2<00:01:19.770> bottom<00:01:20.070> right<00:01:20.250> there<00:01:20.460> and

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
Samsung Tab pro 2 bottom right there and

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.960 
Samsung Tab pro 2 bottom right there and
let's<00:01:23.189> run<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.790> benchmarks<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:25.640> like<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.759> said

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
let's run the benchmarks and like I said

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.030 
let's run the benchmarks and like I said
this<00:01:27.119> benchmark<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.350> measure<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
this benchmark is going to measure the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.340 
this benchmark is going to measure the
processor<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> memory<00:01:30.150> performance<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
processor and the memory performance and

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.149 
processor and the memory performance and
it<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.579> use<00:01:33.320> real-world<00:01:34.320> scenarios

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
it is going to use real-world scenarios

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.830 
it is going to use real-world scenarios
to<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> some<00:01:36.030> numbers<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.720> can

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to get you some numbers that you can

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
to get you some numbers that you can
compare<00:01:37.259> at<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> end

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.399 

you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.169 

okay<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:54.469> the<00:01:54.649> iPad<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.069> done<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.579> the<00:01:55.789> Left<00:01:55.999> we

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
okay so the iPad is done on the Left we

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.910 
okay so the iPad is done on the Left we
have<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.359> single<00:01:56.719> core<00:01:57.079> performance<00:01:57.319> and<00:01:57.829> on

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
have the single core performance and on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.260 
have the single core performance and on
the<00:01:58.009> right<00:01:58.219> we<00:01:58.399> have<00:01:58.549> the<00:01:58.640> multi<00:01:59.030> core

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
the right we have the multi core

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.990 
the right we have the multi core
performance<00:01:59.899> so<00:02:00.469> let's<00:02:00.679> uh<00:02:00.920> wait<00:02:01.640> till<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
performance so let's uh wait till the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.520 
performance so let's uh wait till the
Samsung<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.600> done<00:02:02.810> as<00:02:02.929> well<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.289> then<00:02:03.380> we'll

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
Samsung is done as well and then we'll

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.499 
Samsung is done as well and then we'll
look<00:02:03.679> at<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:03.920> numbers<00:02:04.250> really<00:02:04.759> quickly<00:02:05.329> and

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
look at the numbers really quickly and

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:14.530 
look at the numbers really quickly and
analyze<00:02:06.439> what<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:06.859> can<00:02:12.910> okay<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.150> Samsung

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
analyze what we can okay so the Samsung

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.449 
analyze what we can okay so the Samsung
is<00:02:14.690> done<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.019> well<00:02:15.170> so<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.860> single<00:02:16.190> core

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
is done as well so the single core

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.280 
is done as well so the single core
performance<00:02:16.640> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> Samsung<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.720> less<00:02:18.049> than

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
performance on the Samsung is less than

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.350 
performance on the Samsung is less than
the<00:02:18.500> iPad<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:19.489> multi<00:02:19.910> core<00:02:20.150> performance

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
the iPad but the multi core performance

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.960 
the iPad but the multi core performance
which<00:02:20.989> is<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.140> number<00:02:21.470> on<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.680> right<00:02:21.950> is<00:02:22.220> more

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
which is a number on the right is more

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.420 
which is a number on the right is more
than<00:02:23.360> the<00:02:23.540> iPad<00:02:23.660> air<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.799> this<00:02:25.069> means
