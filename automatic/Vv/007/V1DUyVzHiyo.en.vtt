00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.730
 and welcome to this eighth video 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.660
 dedicated to the bra 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.170
 let's suppose that we realize a 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.210
 classic bra like the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.090
 first thing to get is a 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.900
 correct frame pair ie to 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.570
 the right size 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.440
 I insist the frames are not 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.839
 that an accessory 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.879
 they are decisive for success 

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:40.850
 and the comfort of your bra 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.730
 a frame too large would not bring 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.010
 nothing good around do not put one 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:49.840
 frame too small for is bruised 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.190
 this dream that did not want either 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.640
 the weather channel 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.660
 you also need a tape measure a 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.960
 make-up pencil a rule is to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.960
 log on 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.310
 the measures we will use will be 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:18.120
 the following through the breast finally 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.720
 both the hollow between the breasts the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:27.140
 height under the breast the turn of the 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.140
 salient and the under-chest 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 see how to use the frames 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.950
 to properly measure the saints of the doctor 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.100
 zhu start by positioning a 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.990
 frame aisles of the make-up pen 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.970
 draw a mark on the skin just to 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.890
 the outside of the frame under the arm 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.980
 and between the breasts 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:57.140
 do the same for the other st now 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 that benchmarks exist took the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.170
 measures start by measuring the across 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.230
 of your breasts yes both of them often 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.740
 differences the same thing seen from 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:15.800
 above then measure the hollow between 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:18.470
 both breasts savas ulu to measure the 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:21.620
 height under the breast position your 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.990
 rule just at the birth of the breast and 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.990
 rotate it upwards by plating the 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.959
 rule against removing one centimeter to 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.150
 measure up 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.629
 then measure the bust or 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.909
 the turn of the years and then the turn 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.090
 under chest ie from the cage 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:40.090
 thoracic 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.110
 let's do a brief reminder in beige we 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.470
 have the cups in fuchsia the plate 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.989
 central in blue the bands towards the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.989
 suspenders and in red the serious 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.840
 to put a perfect square having to quote 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.500
 through the saint marc and his center 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:11.400
 and its two middle axes lay at in the 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.640
 bottom right corner posed b which places the 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.280
 height under the breast trace the line 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.519
 mark well perpendicular to the base of the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.360
 square prince and another benchmarks line 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.900
 three centimeters under the bus is 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.989
 asked is who is the center of the breast 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.299
 ask soon to the plant of this is in 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.760
 starting from the center of the square drawn on 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.010
 circle that corresponds to him for 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.579
 determine the width of the forceps or 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.910
 chest 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:45.450
 we will do the following calculation round of 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.349
 salient - divided chest tricks 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.660
 by two and any re halved 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.019
 to distribute on both sides of 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.440
 point 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.440
 d 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:05.070
 then extend the trait cf 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:10.340
 just when I laid hh and at a 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.340
 twelfth of g salient rounds 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:20.850
 relayed h enough connect h 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:24.000
 ab on the red circle put their father there 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.960
 three and a half centimeters above 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.740
 central landmark 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.320
 this is a fixed value starting 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.930
 from the center of the square grace and the circle of 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.600
 Cash frame here in red dashed 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.630
 it is a small centimeter wider 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:42.360
 that the bag the previous one extend the 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.520
 lines of the hand under chest up 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.460
 the dotted line of the cash frames 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.919
 at the central level of the plate thanks and 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.050
 a gentle curve between the red circle 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:56.820
 and the line of the cash armatures 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.890
 extend horizontally to draw 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.350
 the plaque 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:03.280
 this little line measures 1.2 me digs 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:06.580
 between the breasts 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.030
 before the right to lower a vertical 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:13.529
 who stops at the height of the point at this 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:22.399
 will be the point to premium 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:26.779
 because in europe ask here the point j pose 

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:29.759
 kjk is the length of the band 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:31.159
 for a fabric that does not stretch and it 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:34.679
 will have to take the bust 

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:36.329
 divided by four of course this formula 

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:39.749
 could vary considerably in 

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:41.819
 depending on the nature of the fabric but for 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:44.729
 today are doing simple and using 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:49.409
 simply this formula in line with 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:54.719
 that she put the point m is at a 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:57.899
 third of jcs put the n point to a 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:06.589
 centimeter just above m breaststroke 

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:06.589
 and gum nigeriasat-2 6 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:18.750
 put the high point to 1 case of kahel 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:22.010
 connect no1 a gentle curves like this 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.510
 Then you plot the country 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.850
 corresponding to the width of the graph 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.020
 and well perpendicular to the high point 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:30.020
 like this 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.660
 then always with the parrot we 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.170
 let's trace the district braces we 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.630
 let's extend the line this and we pose 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.220
 the point the premium we extend 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.080
 then the line cf 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:48.080
 and let's get the point ready 

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.940
 it is now time to refine 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:07:02.780
 the rounded under the plate like this and 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:04.970
 here is a gorilla in the next 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.430
 part we'll see how to edit 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.040
 cup orientation the length of the 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:13.210
 suspenders stapling and many more 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.210
 things still 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:20.050
 1 yeah yeah we do is starting to 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:20.050
 a good month
