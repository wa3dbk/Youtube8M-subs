with<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:17.480> thousands<00:00:18.020> of<00:00:18.080> types<00:00:18.289> of<00:00:18.529> glassware

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
with the thousands of types of glassware

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.350 
with the thousands of types of glassware
out<00:00:19.130> there<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:19.460> can<00:00:19.550> be<00:00:19.610> very<00:00:19.699> confusing

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:20.360 
out there it can be very confusing

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.939 
out there it can be very confusing
trying<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.840> figure<00:00:21.050> out<00:00:21.080> what<00:00:21.349> type<00:00:21.590> of<00:00:21.619> glass

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
trying to figure out what type of glass

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.490 
trying to figure out what type of glass
to<00:00:22.189> use<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.730> always<00:00:23.630> suggest<00:00:23.810> that<00:00:24.169> although

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
to use I always suggest that although

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.170 
to use I always suggest that although
you<00:00:24.710> don't<00:00:24.980> have<00:00:25.220> to<00:00:25.369> have<00:00:25.490> one<00:00:25.820> particular

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
you don't have to have one particular

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.999 
you don't have to have one particular
glass<00:00:26.539> for<00:00:26.840> every<00:00:27.140> different<00:00:27.439> type<00:00:27.619> of<00:00:27.650> wine

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:28.009 
glass for every different type of wine

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:29.769 
glass for every different type of wine
it's<00:00:28.699> really<00:00:29.000> good<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.300> have<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.599> best

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
it's really good to have the best

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.269 
it's really good to have the best
quality<00:00:29.900> glass<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:30.500> you<00:00:30.529> can<00:00:30.710> afford<00:00:30.980> a

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
quality glass that you can afford a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.090 
quality glass that you can afford a
glass<00:00:31.939> like<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:32.390> isn't<00:00:33.260> really<00:00:33.620> useful<00:00:33.950> for

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
glass like this isn't really useful for

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.299 
glass like this isn't really useful for
much<00:00:34.280> it's<00:00:34.670> incredibly<00:00:35.120> durable<00:00:35.829> but<00:00:36.829> other

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
much it's incredibly durable but other

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.740 
much it's incredibly durable but other
than<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:38.000> really<00:00:38.180> doesn't<00:00:38.480> give<00:00:38.600> you<00:00:38.690> a

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
than that it really doesn't give you a

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.139 
than that it really doesn't give you a
wonderful<00:00:38.989> experience<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:40.460> top<00:00:40.700> of<00:00:40.879> it<00:00:41.000> is

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
wonderful experience the top of it is

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.910 
wonderful experience the top of it is
rolled<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:41.840> so<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.050> doesn't<00:00:42.289> feel<00:00:42.469> very<00:00:42.739> nice

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
rolled and so it doesn't feel very nice

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.459 
rolled and so it doesn't feel very nice
against<00:00:43.309> your<00:00:43.460> lips<00:00:44.050> this<00:00:45.050> one's<00:00:45.289> a<00:00:45.379> little

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
against your lips this one's a little

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.169 
against your lips this one's a little
bit<00:00:45.649> better<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.980> has<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.129> very<00:00:46.399> nice<00:00:46.579> thin<00:00:46.850> edge

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
bit better it has a very nice thin edge

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.200 
bit better it has a very nice thin edge
it's<00:00:48.019> led<00:00:48.289> crystal<00:00:48.800> but<00:00:49.339> again<00:00:49.579> this<00:00:49.760> holds

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
it's led crystal but again this holds

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.849 
it's led crystal but again this holds
very<00:00:50.420> little<00:00:50.719> wine<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.199> it's<00:00:51.589> not<00:00:51.710> just

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
very little wine and it's not just

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.229 
very little wine and it's not just
because<00:00:52.129> I<00:00:52.219> want<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.429> drink<00:00:52.640> more<00:00:52.850> it's<00:00:53.089> really

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
because I want to drink more it's really

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.899 
because I want to drink more it's really
about<00:00:53.719> being<00:00:54.499> able<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:54.920> have<00:00:55.309> enough<00:00:55.579> wine<00:00:55.789> in

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
about being able to have enough wine in

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.059 
about being able to have enough wine in
the<00:00:55.999> glass<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.510> allowing<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.440> aromatics

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069 
the glass and allowing the aromatics

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:59.950 
the glass and allowing the aromatics
from<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:58.370> wine<00:00:58.550> to<00:00:58.819> sit<00:00:59.120> above<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.539> wine<00:00:59.719> in

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
from that wine to sit above the wine in

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.719 
from that wine to sit above the wine in
the<00:01:00.079> glass<00:01:00.109> that's<00:01:01.039> why<00:01:01.219> the<00:01:01.280> front<00:01:01.579> of<00:01:01.640> the

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
the glass that's why the front of the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:03.340 
the glass that's why the front of the
glass<00:01:01.879> is<00:01:02.120> tapered<00:01:02.510> to<00:01:02.629> hold<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.079> all<00:01:03.199> those

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
glass is tapered to hold in all those

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.719 
glass is tapered to hold in all those
beautiful<00:01:03.739> aromas<00:01:03.829> so<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.370> you<00:01:04.460> can<00:01:04.580> put

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
beautiful aromas so that you can put

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.960 
beautiful aromas so that you can put
your<00:01:04.850> nose<00:01:05.030> in<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.449> smell<00:01:06.110> them<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:07.670> prefer

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
your nose in and smell them so I prefer

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.450 
your nose in and smell them so I prefer
a<00:01:08.180> glass<00:01:08.330> that<00:01:08.659> has<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> little<00:01:09.020> bit<00:01:09.110> more<00:01:09.460> room

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
a glass that has a little bit more room

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.580 
a glass that has a little bit more room
so<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.390> you<00:01:11.450> can<00:01:11.600> fill<00:01:11.810> it<00:01:11.930> a<00:01:12.020> little<00:01:12.260> bit<00:01:12.409> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
so that you can fill it a little bit and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.340 
so that you can fill it a little bit and
allow<00:01:13.159> those<00:01:13.610> aromas<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.240> dissipate<00:01:14.900> from<00:01:15.140> the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
allow those aromas to dissipate from the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.469 
allow those aromas to dissipate from the
wine<00:01:15.530> these<00:01:16.100> glasses<00:01:16.790> these<00:01:16.940> o-series

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
wine these glasses these o-series

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:18.850 
wine these glasses these o-series
glasses<00:01:18.020> are<00:01:18.140> great<00:01:18.350> they<00:01:18.530> don't<00:01:18.650> have<00:01:18.830> a

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
glasses are great they don't have a

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.370 
glasses are great they don't have a
handle<00:01:19.310> though<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.090> if<00:01:20.390> you're<00:01:20.540> at<00:01:20.750> a<00:01:20.780> party

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
handle though so if you're at a party

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.500 
handle though so if you're at a party
and<00:01:21.560> you're<00:01:21.980> standing<00:01:22.400> talking<00:01:22.640> very<00:01:23.210> quickly

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
and you're standing talking very quickly

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.960 
and you're standing talking very quickly
your<00:01:24.020> drink<00:01:24.290> will<00:01:24.440> become<00:01:24.770> warm<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.340> even<00:01:25.910> a

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
your drink will become warm and even a

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.640 
your drink will become warm and even a
red<00:01:26.150> wine<00:01:26.360> that's<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.870> warm<00:01:27.110> is<00:01:27.260> not<00:01:27.440> very

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
red wine that's to warm is not very

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.500 
red wine that's to warm is not very
pleasant<00:01:27.860> so<00:01:28.550> I<00:01:28.610> prefer<00:01:28.850> these<00:01:29.150> for<00:01:29.420> the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
pleasant so I prefer these for the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.660 
pleasant so I prefer these for the
dinner<00:01:29.630> table<00:01:30.080> that's<00:01:31.010> the<00:01:31.130> reason<00:01:31.430> that<00:01:31.490> most

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
dinner table that's the reason that most

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.750 
dinner table that's the reason that most
glasses<00:01:32.180> have<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.750> stem<00:01:33.440> so<00:01:34.070> you<00:01:34.220> can<00:01:34.370> hold<00:01:34.610> on

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
glasses have a stem so you can hold on

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.150 
glasses have a stem so you can hold on
to<00:01:34.790> it<00:01:34.970> not<00:01:35.570> get<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.930> wine<00:01:36.110> warm<00:01:36.410> and<00:01:36.650> not<00:01:36.920> get
