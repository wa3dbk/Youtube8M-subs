read today I'd like to share with you
all<00:00:05.279> my<00:00:05.670> pumpkin<00:00:06.299> tree<00:00:06.569> that's<00:00:06.779> growing

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:07.280 
all my pumpkin tree that's growing

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.339 
all my pumpkin tree that's growing
that's<00:00:08.280> right<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> have<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> pumpkin<00:00:09.210> growing<00:00:10.050> up

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
that's right I have a pumpkin growing up

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.919 
that's right I have a pumpkin growing up
a<00:00:10.590> tree<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.480> eventually<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.570> the<00:00:12.809> whole

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a tree and eventually I think the whole

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.480 
a tree and eventually I think the whole
tree<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.139> gonna<00:00:13.380> become<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.679> big<00:00:13.980> old<00:00:14.160> pumpkin

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
tree is gonna become a big old pumpkin

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.519 
tree is gonna become a big old pumpkin
vine<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.540> let's<00:00:15.750> start<00:00:16.049> where<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.289> pumpkin

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
vine so let's start where the pumpkin

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.630 
vine so let's start where the pumpkin
vine<00:00:16.850> originates<00:00:17.850> from<00:00:20.689> about<00:00:21.980> right<00:00:22.980> here

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
vine originates from about right here

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.019 
vine originates from about right here
the<00:00:24.330> pumpkin<00:00:24.750> vine<00:00:24.960> starts<00:00:25.590> somewhere<00:00:26.029> you

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the pumpkin vine starts somewhere you

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.620 
the pumpkin vine starts somewhere you
can<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.510> there's<00:00:27.720> leaves<00:00:28.019> everywhere

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
can see that there's leaves everywhere

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.120 
can see that there's leaves everywhere
but<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.230> where<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.619> starts<00:00:31.980> from

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
but this is about where it starts from

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
but this is about where it starts from
now<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.430> we<00:00:32.579> follow<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.000> along<00:00:33.500> along<00:00:34.500> this

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
now if we follow it along along this

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.220 
now if we follow it along along this
raised<00:00:34.980> bed<00:00:35.270> we'll<00:00:36.270> eventually<00:00:36.540> get<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.079> where

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
raised bed we'll eventually get to where

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.940 
raised bed we'll eventually get to where
the<00:00:37.350> tree<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:38.360> so<00:00:39.360> as<00:00:39.750> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.559> see<00:00:40.800> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
the tree is so as you can see the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.240 
the tree is so as you can see the
pumpkin<00:00:41.219> vine<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.640> closer<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:43.250> keep

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
pumpkin vine is closer to the back keep

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.540 
pumpkin vine is closer to the back keep
going<00:00:44.700> keep<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.500> we're<00:00:46.500> gonna<00:00:46.590> swoop<00:00:47.309> in

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
going keep going we're gonna swoop in

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.459 
going keep going we're gonna swoop in
now<00:00:48.020> and<00:00:49.640> look<00:00:50.640> at<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.449> pumpkin<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.289> white

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
now and look at one pumpkin it's a white

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.740 
now and look at one pumpkin it's a white
pumpkin<00:00:52.980> that's<00:00:53.160> along<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.489> way<00:00:53.789> this

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
pumpkin that's along the way this

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.299 
pumpkin that's along the way this
pumpkin<00:00:55.199> will<00:00:55.320> probably<00:00:55.649> stay<00:00:55.860> white<00:00:56.100> its

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
pumpkin will probably stay white its

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
pumpkin will probably stay white its
entire<00:00:56.670> time<00:00:57.090> even<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> reaches<00:00:58.469> full

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
entire time even when it reaches full

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.000 
entire time even when it reaches full
maturity<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.430> won't<00:00:59.640> turn<00:00:59.910> orange<00:01:01.010> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
maturity and it won't turn orange so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.050 
maturity and it won't turn orange so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
alright I have to go around this tree

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.279 
alright I have to go around this tree
now

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.639 

and<00:01:16.880> here<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.149> where<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.929> pumpkin<00:01:19.289> vine

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
and here is where the pumpkin vine

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.380 
and here is where the pumpkin vine
leaves<00:01:20.429> the<00:01:20.759> ground<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:22.819> starts<00:01:23.819> ascending

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
leaves the ground and starts ascending

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.849 
leaves the ground and starts ascending
this<00:01:25.319> tree<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.749> if<00:01:30.749> we<00:01:30.929> look<00:01:31.140> here<00:01:31.439> we<00:01:31.469> can<00:01:31.679> see

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
this tree so if we look here we can see

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.980 
this tree so if we look here we can see
this<00:01:32.009> tendril<00:01:32.640> or<00:01:32.909> whatever<00:01:33.569> it<00:01:33.750> may<00:01:33.929> be

developed and fruit is gonna grow up

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.119 
developed and fruit is gonna grow up
along<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.950> tree<00:01:53.219> -<00:01:53.459> how<00:01:54.209> awesome<00:01:54.539> is<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:55.129> so

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:56.129 
along this tree - how awesome is that so

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:59.539 
along this tree - how awesome is that so
I'll<00:01:57.229> go<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.439> little<00:01:58.770> bit<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.159> try<00:01:59.340> not<00:01:59.489> to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
I'll go out a little bit and try not to

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.479 
I'll go out a little bit and try not to
hit<00:01:59.759> my<00:01:59.909> head<00:02:00.119> too<00:02:00.360> much<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:03.539> we<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.840> see<00:02:04.489> this

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
hit my head too much and we can see this

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:09.650 
hit my head too much and we can see this
pumpkin<00:02:07.160> still<00:02:08.160> crawling<00:02:08.609> up<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.090> tree<00:02:09.450> it's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
pumpkin still crawling up this tree it's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.979 
pumpkin still crawling up this tree it's
reaching<00:02:10.079> its<00:02:10.229> first<00:02:10.470> branches<00:02:11.069> now<00:02:11.989> right

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
reaching its first branches now right

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.300 
reaching its first branches now right
here<00:02:14.450> its<00:02:15.450> grabbed<00:02:15.780> on<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.230> branch<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.950> think

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
here its grabbed on to a branch I think

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.150 
here its grabbed on to a branch I think
once<00:02:17.549> it<00:02:17.700> gets<00:02:17.879> onto<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.319> thick<00:02:19.319> branch<00:02:19.709> we'll

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
once it gets onto a thick branch we'll

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.629 
once it gets onto a thick branch we'll
see<00:02:20.340> some<00:02:20.609> great<00:02:20.910> strength<00:02:21.450> development<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:22.639 
see some great strength development and

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.789 
see some great strength development and
I<00:02:23.639> have<00:02:24.239> no<00:02:24.389> idea<00:02:24.420> where<00:02:24.840> it's<00:02:24.959> gonna<00:02:25.109> go<00:02:25.380> for

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
I have no idea where it's gonna go for

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.610 
I have no idea where it's gonna go for
its<00:02:25.950> final<00:02:26.280> destination<00:02:27.260> right<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:28.410> it's

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
its final destination right now it's

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.240 
its final destination right now it's
just<00:02:28.680> hanging<00:02:29.160> in<00:02:29.280> midair<00:02:29.639> mid-drift<00:02:30.329> it<00:02:30.720> has

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
just hanging in midair mid-drift it has

pumpkin vines started growing into the
grass<00:02:52.980> near<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.519> trees<00:02:53.849> I<00:02:54.209> could<00:02:54.900> tell<00:02:55.139> it<00:02:55.319> was

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
grass near the trees I could tell it was

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.960 
grass near the trees I could tell it was
like<00:02:55.620> aiming<00:02:56.250> for<00:02:56.459> this<00:02:56.579> tree<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.239> was<00:02:57.419> amazing

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
like aiming for this tree it was amazing

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:07.309 
like aiming for this tree it was amazing
so<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.359> up<00:03:01.260> up<00:03:01.609> up<00:03:04.730> up

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
so going up up up up up

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.700 
so going up up up up up
you<00:03:07.889> see<00:03:08.099> that's<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.609> tall<00:03:08.970> tree

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.520 

I<00:03:11.770> have<00:03:12.490> no<00:03:12.730> idea<00:03:13.060> how<00:03:13.240> high<00:03:13.510> this<00:03:13.570> pumpkin<00:03:14.230> can

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
I have no idea how high this pumpkin can

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.410 
I have no idea how high this pumpkin can
climb<00:03:14.890> but<00:03:15.220> if<00:03:15.310> I<00:03:15.430> keep<00:03:15.640> supplying<00:03:16.090> it<00:03:16.240> with<00:03:16.390> a

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
climb but if I keep supplying it with a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.770 
climb but if I keep supplying it with a
homemade<00:03:16.960> nitrogen<00:03:17.620> fertilizer<00:03:18.190> and<00:03:18.780> worm

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
homemade nitrogen fertilizer and worm

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.980 
homemade nitrogen fertilizer and worm
castings<00:03:20.280> tea<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.670> think<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.450> pumpkin<00:03:22.810> can

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
castings tea I think this pumpkin can

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.290 
castings tea I think this pumpkin can
just<00:03:23.200> grow<00:03:23.500> until<00:03:23.920> it's<00:03:24.180> well<00:03:25.180> until<00:03:25.540> it's

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
just grow until it's well until it's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.380 
just grow until it's well until it's
