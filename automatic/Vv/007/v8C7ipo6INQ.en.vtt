this<00:01:35.660> one<00:01:35.929> is<00:01:36.050> actually<00:01:36.229> not<00:01:36.500> nice<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.130> easy

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
this one is actually not nice and easy

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.809 
this one is actually not nice and easy
so<00:01:38.440> if<00:01:39.440> yours<00:01:39.679> are<00:01:39.770> really<00:01:40.039> rusted<00:01:40.429> if<00:01:40.640> you

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:40.819 
so if yours are really rusted if you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.960 
so if yours are really rusted if you
from<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:41.479> did<00:01:41.630> 40<00:01:42.020> awesome<00:01:42.970> penetrating

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
from the we did 40 awesome penetrating

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.820 
from the we did 40 awesome penetrating
flavors<00:01:45.789> so<00:01:46.789> once<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.569> come<00:01:47.750> off<00:01:47.840> you<00:01:48.590> should

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
flavors so once it's come off you should

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.540 
flavors so once it's come off you should
be<00:01:48.950> able<00:01:49.009> to<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:51.039> not<00:01:52.039> that<00:01:52.280> through

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
be able to and not that through

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.180 
be able to and not that through
hopefully<00:01:52.819> we've<00:01:53.630> knock<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:53.959> one<00:01:54.080> out<00:01:54.289> I've

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
hopefully we've knock that one out I've

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.980 
hopefully we've knock that one out I've
got<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> one<00:01:55.640> behind<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:56.119> a<00:01:56.360> little<00:01:56.690> bit<00:01:56.869> as<00:01:56.959> a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
got the one behind it a little bit as a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.010 
got the one behind it a little bit as a
technical<00:01:57.440> years<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:58.160> can<00:01:58.340> do<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:58.640> one<00:01:58.759> now

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
technical years you can do that one now

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.300 
technical years you can do that one now
and<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:00.080> hopefully<00:02:00.560> that<00:02:00.709> one<00:02:00.920> just<00:02:01.130> might

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and then hopefully that one just might

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.919 
and then hopefully that one just might
just<00:02:01.489> as<00:02:01.640> easy<00:02:01.789> we'll<00:02:02.119> find<00:02:02.330> out<00:02:02.450> in<00:02:02.509> a<00:02:02.569> second

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.160 
obviously the bolt off the end there and
see<00:02:33.340> this<00:02:33.520> is<00:02:33.700> really<00:02:33.820> perished<00:02:34.300> compared<00:02:35.080> to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
see this is really perished compared to

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.500 
see this is really perished compared to
the<00:02:35.260> nice<00:02:35.380> new<00:02:35.560> shiny<00:02:35.740> one<00:02:35.980> and<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.450> about

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the nice new shiny one and so it's about

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.690 
the nice new shiny one and so it's about
time<00:02:37.780> we<00:02:37.870> changed<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.800> it's<00:02:39.040> also<00:02:39.280> causes

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
time we changed it and it's also causes

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.770 
time we changed it and it's also causes
a<00:02:39.730> little<00:02:39.940> bit<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.120> knocking<00:02:40.480> on<00:02:40.690> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
a little bit of knocking on the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.780 
a little bit of knocking on the
suspension<00:02:41.230> as<00:02:41.320> well<00:02:41.380> so<00:02:42.220> it<00:02:42.280> will<00:02:42.370> fix<00:02:42.640> that

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
suspension as well so it will fix that

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.780 
suspension as well so it will fix that
too<00:02:43.000> hopefully<00:02:46.920> if<00:02:47.920> you're<00:02:48.070> struggling<00:02:48.430> to
