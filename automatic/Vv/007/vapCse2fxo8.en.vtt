you<00:01:01.359> break<00:01:01.480> it<00:01:01.629> into<00:01:01.749> modules<00:01:02.320> so<00:01:02.710> you<00:01:02.739> never

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
you break it into modules so you never

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.430 
you break it into modules so you never
have<00:01:03.280> more<00:01:03.550> than<00:01:03.879> week<00:01:04.480> a<00:01:04.690> week<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.050> half<00:01:05.260> of

as<00:01:12.550> a<00:01:12.580> short<00:01:12.850> course<00:01:13.060> we<00:01:13.390> do<00:01:13.540> a<00:01:13.570> two-week

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
as a short course we do a two-week

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.110 
as a short course we do a two-week
introduction<00:01:14.710> to<00:01:14.770> flight<00:01:14.980> test<00:01:15.220> course<00:01:15.460> or

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
what we call the fixed-wing short course

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.020 
what we call the fixed-wing short course
so<00:01:17.710> we<00:01:17.800> get<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.950> lot<00:01:18.160> of<00:01:18.190> young<00:01:18.400> engineers<00:01:18.910> that

we<00:02:31.890> put<00:02:32.070> out<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> great<00:02:32.430> graduate<00:02:32.940> who<00:02:33.030> goes

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
we put out a great graduate who goes

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.270 
we put out a great graduate who goes
home<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.050> help<00:02:34.320> out<00:02:34.560> their
