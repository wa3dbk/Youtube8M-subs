was that in the in the end of the day he
really<00:05:27.989> would<00:05:28.169> realize<00:05:28.499> he<00:05:28.949> was<00:05:29.069> just<00:05:29.339> doing

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:29.519 
really would realize he was just doing

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:32.719 
really would realize he was just doing
Petipa<00:05:30.409> so<00:05:31.409> there<00:05:31.589> are<00:05:31.679> similarities<00:05:32.099> for<00:05:32.549> him

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:32.729 
Petipa so there are similarities for him

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.779 
Petipa so there are similarities for him
but<00:05:32.939> but<00:05:33.209> what<00:05:33.599> do<00:05:33.659> you<00:05:33.749> think<00:05:34.399> well<00:05:35.399> first<00:05:35.639> of

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
but but what do you think well first of

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:37.399 
but but what do you think well first of
all<00:05:35.849> the<00:05:36.239> other<00:05:36.360> similarities<00:05:37.079> between<00:05:37.199> all

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
all the other similarities between all

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:39.949 
all the other similarities between all
three<00:05:37.829> styles<00:05:38.309> but<00:05:39.089> the<00:05:39.299> biggest<00:05:39.629> difference

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:39.959 
three styles but the biggest difference

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:41.719 
three styles but the biggest difference
is<00:05:40.259> all<00:05:40.409> three<00:05:40.619> styles<00:05:40.949> of<00:05:41.069> such<00:05:41.249> a<00:05:41.279> different

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
is all three styles of such a different

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.469 
is all three styles of such a different
Porter<00:05:42.299> broth<00:05:42.479> and<00:05:42.959> upper<00:05:43.439> body<00:05:43.649> which<00:05:44.429> is<00:05:45.419> a

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
Porter broth and upper body which is a

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:49.489 
Porter broth and upper body which is a
huge<00:05:45.809> challenge<00:05:46.079> but<00:05:46.709> I<00:05:46.979> love<00:05:47.699> that<00:05:48.259> the<00:05:49.259> head

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
huge challenge but I love that the head

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.679 
huge challenge but I love that the head
in<00:05:49.739> born<00:05:49.979> in<00:05:50.099> Ville<00:05:50.249> if<00:05:50.999> you<00:05:51.329> would<00:05:51.449> do<00:05:51.569> the

00:05:51.679 --> 00:05:51.689 
in born in Ville if you would do the

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:52.909 
in born in Ville if you would do the
three<00:05:51.929> shades<00:05:52.199> I<00:05:52.409> think<00:05:52.589> would<00:05:52.679> be<00:05:52.769> very

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
three shades I think would be very

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.569 
three shades I think would be very
opposite<00:05:53.459> to<00:05:54.269> what<00:05:54.419> we're<00:05:54.539> trying<00:05:54.719> to<00:05:54.839> do<00:05:55.579> so

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:56.579 
opposite to what we're trying to do so

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:57.919 
opposite to what we're trying to do so
I've<00:05:56.669> had<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.939> learn<00:05:57.089> to<00:05:57.269> use<00:05:57.360> my<00:05:57.509> upper<00:05:57.779> back

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:57.929 
I've had to learn to use my upper back

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.859 
I've had to learn to use my upper back
very<00:05:58.469> differently<00:05:58.939> the<00:05:59.939> way<00:05:59.969> you<00:06:00.209> hold<00:06:00.719> your

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:00.869 
very differently the way you hold your

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.929 
very differently the way you hold your
fingers<00:06:01.319> in<00:06:01.589> Balanchine<00:06:02.459> compared<00:06:02.879> to

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:02.939 
fingers in Balanchine compared to

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:05.059 
fingers in Balanchine compared to
pettypaws<00:06:03.239> very<00:06:03.599> different<00:06:03.989> and<00:06:04.229> then<00:06:05.039> the

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
pettypaws very different and then the

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.749 
pettypaws very different and then the
musicality<00:06:06.679> between<00:06:07.679> pettypaws<00:06:08.039> Balanchine

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 
musicality between pettypaws Balanchine

pet<00:06:09.149> soup<00:06:09.299> I<00:06:09.419> want<00:06:09.629> you<00:06:09.779> to<00:06:09.869> start<00:06:10.079> on<00:06:10.139> 8

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:10.379 
pet soup I want you to start on 8

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.909 
pet soup I want you to start on 8
Balanchine<00:06:11.309> tends<00:06:11.669> to<00:06:11.819> go<00:06:11.909> on<00:06:11.999> 1<00:06:12.709> so<00:06:13.709> it's<00:06:13.860> a

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
Balanchine tends to go on 1 so it's a

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.549 
Balanchine tends to go on 1 so it's a
little<00:06:14.249> bit<00:06:14.399> challenging<00:06:15.289> especially<00:06:16.289> if<00:06:16.499> you

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:16.559 
little bit challenging especially if you

00:06:16.559 --> 00:07:18.140 
little bit challenging especially if you
have<00:06:16.649> a<00:06:16.709> mixed<00:06:17.009> Reptar
