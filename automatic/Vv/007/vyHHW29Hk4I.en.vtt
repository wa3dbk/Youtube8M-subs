00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:09.340
 mamore too 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.610
 In your news you say greetings you wish to you the name and the other front of the warehouse it from either everyone 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.410
 Mr. 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.040
 I came from Tokyo's Adachi- ku, and I'm already in the run and I'm already running and I feel like going 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:22.260
 Though 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.260
 Oh Karaa about Netouyo years ago I brake when ｰｰｰｰTsutsu' 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:01:00.310
 Hiarosu 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:01:01.899
 Oh day to be a good erotic because it was Rosa A'Nyodo mode stove Su'tsu'tsu Jomura 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.400
 Understand quite well 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.310
 delan 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.909
 Oh my 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 Well then, I will check Nomura's form 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 At first from the side 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:28.950
 The upper body is completely upright and you can not lean forward correctly 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:28.950
 Because of that, it seems that the energy that was born with arm swinging is not converted to propulsion 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:38.720
 Next, let's check from the front and the back 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:43.030
 There is no flexibility around the founding because the entire back is hard 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.030
 It does not seem to be aware of the body axis 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:51.020
 I 'm landing from toe again 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.170
 This will increase the mountain to the calf 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.170
 Let's fix these bodies in the workout 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.940
 Bach 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.920
 It was Musca like 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:08.760
 It's true that it's a sound thing, it's a toe sand dune, is the second part too unconscious ? 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:13.770
 I say that when you are out of there first rush short-range 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:16.550
 I'm just so early now but I will catch it with my toes 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.300
 I do not either jump if disconnect the power 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:22.680
 Over there or see what buzzing in Dondondon 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 I can not meet again at the meeting 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.250
 It is a period 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.910
 Sound of belly next time when sucking suck next side This side this side this pump is conscious 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.910
 Jump organizer 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.980
 Is it OK to enter? This is the basic of running 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.790
 It was easier if I didn't write too much 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.930
 Maybe the power in this area 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.930
 I feel the power of each 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.450
 Nja jump jump tried in is my my 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.400
 Let's go in and get close 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.300
 Yes please long please 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.810
 Four days 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.110
 It's not right Next time is cherry blossom 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.950
 We will move forward a little 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:12.250
 So oh always please next that this fande soon 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.310
 I'm using the funagi 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.970
 When I try to kick in this way when I go ahead 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.000
 It's not about me 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.830
 I will fall down before something 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.830
 If you fall down, it will come out naturally 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:32.150
 I will not fall down 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.150
躁躁躁躁躁躁躁躁躁躁Whoa manic of 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.980
 Please deal with 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.980
 ampeg you either base 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.170
 Please return to the top of the pitcher's head . 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.120
 It is early so 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:54.019
 While exhaling slowly breath I kinda think that it is not stuck in the foot still Tarazaki-shaped eyes 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.019
 That's right 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.080
 Tomorrow I a bracket or to-one I do mind is not attached 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:05.690
 It really comes to the knee when it gets soft 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.720
 It says that one after another love has come 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.390
 Please try a little more thought knee 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.390
 It's coming a little cage transport and forest 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.189
 Yes please slowly return Please know the preoccupation 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:27.780
 If next 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:27.780
 Oh, I just have to put the pelvis in this place, because I have a little bit of foot in this place. 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.250
 There ze ate 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:38.930
 Please me move health 2 arm swing becomes soft in 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:43.630
 Shake the hips and to do so when the cement 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.630
 It opens of it by its legs no longer enough to 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.949
 So Deita 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.770
 Swore high is put 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:55.979
 Well then jump jump jump jump jump 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.330
 Jump Jump Jump in the Eisen system 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.960
 Nature 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.960
 1 year people 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:10.360
 Yeah now so early awesome smoothly 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.360
 i 'm 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.310
 Let's take a look at the fix form 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:29.169
 Upper body can now lean forward on low orbit 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:33.840
 Was born energy has been kept alive in firmly driving force in the order arm swing 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.840
 Next check from front and back 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:44.270
 The scapula and pelvis work together by the flexibility of the back. 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:51.620
 I became able to be aware of the body axis 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:53.700
 Also it has been able to a good weight shift of the law became the natural heel landing from landing at the toe 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:06:00.580
 I will 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:06.710
 If you compare the screen before and after correction you will see the difference well 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:11.660
 You will see that the upper body compared with the previous correction has been successfully tilted forward 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:14.560
 The energy produced by the Greyfried Perician directly becomes a driving force 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.560
 Connected 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:22.830
 Next let's look from the front and the back 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:26.529
 Improvement in the interlocking of scapula and pelvis 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:33.329
 The axis of the body has become firmly aware 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:33.329
 You can also see that you can land from your head or head from the back 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:44.040
 Nomura who goes to a half marathon once a year 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:46.790
 If you are conscious of this efficient form, you will be able to challenge the full marathon. 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.790
 Please do your best
