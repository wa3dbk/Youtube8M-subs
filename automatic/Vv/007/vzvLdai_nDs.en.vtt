00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 And, folks, it's great that the camera 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.089
 android renault for brazil and today I 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'll talk about a little problem 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.570
 that our galaxy s 6 test model 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.799
 presented yesterday to today without any 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.859
 external influence 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.920
 good the back cover began to take off 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.100
 out of nowhere and I'll show you how 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.080
 device stayed on and I do not want it too 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 alarm nobody also does not mean 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.490
 that this is going to happen to everyone 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.040
 the models well on the contrary I believe 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.920
 that is an isolated case but if you have 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.070
 some kind of problem or defect that the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 your galaxy s 6 is presenting then 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.780
 I would like to know in the comments 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.930
 below this video but a peek at the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.480
 what happened to my galaxy s 6 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.480
 how do you know the galaxy and 6 is it? 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 made of glass and aluminum so this 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:57.239
 carcass is metal, right here I have it 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.129
 a rear is a rear cover of 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.289
 Glass never happens 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.449
 the cover she simply took off like 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.210
 You can see here I really do not 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.350
 I want to pull I do not want to remove remove 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.270
 whole cover but how are you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.720
 here when I do a little bit of 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.659
 effort and you can see that the glue 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.689
 for example appears and appears 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.460
 taking off, then I called the 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.640
 attention is that it took off with a 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.479
 very easily in case 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.479
 and here you can already see the size 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.460
 it 's not that I can remove 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.810
 Is that back cover 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.560
 here you can also see the quantity 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.060
 of glue that I have around 10 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.700
 of this glass is that it will then fix the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.680
 from glass back on na 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.890
 metal casing then strikes me as a 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.740
 little fragile there is really what the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.140
 samsung offered here on galaxy s 6 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.960
 because on the device that I 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.430
 I have xperia z2 for example this ever 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.329
 it would happen because a 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.159
 glass of water 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.950
 but the resistance is much greater 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 including the back on the screen here 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.179
 also you can see that I simply 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.069
 I'm going to put my only here that's 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.409
 A little fulfilled today is a little 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.010
 now I put it and the ease I have 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:23.859
 fairly easy to get her to 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:25.150
 between the screen and the hunt then user has 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:28.389
 at least in this model that I have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.400
 here is very easy to open the 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:32.379
 device this should not happen 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.849
 in my opinion and a device that costs 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.219
 r 4 thousand reais 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.810
 good I believe this is a case 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.269
 isolated but we contacted the 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.359
 samsung here in germany and samsung in 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.599
 informed that this they need to give a 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:49.299
 obviously look at the device for 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.099
 him to make any kind of announcement to 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.280
 respect to what happened to this 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.709
 model on the bottom here is me 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.599
 I have a screen wear what also 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.239
 caught my attention and what seemed to 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:06.219
 yesterday for today so I believe that 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.349
 is really an isolated case 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:10.989
 Good thing this device is not 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:14.980
 fall on the ground he was not in the sun and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.680
 also was not wet so here I 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.509
 I think I do not know if it was not 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.259
 here has not occurred due to an influence 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.449
 external 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:25.180
 even because all publishers really 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:27.009
 summer owner takes a look because it is 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.599
 enough is a surprise for all 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:31.419
 world that we can have this 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.319
 then back access with that 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.849
 facility 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.139
 good this device is still shipped 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.139
 for samsung is that it can make a 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:40.959
 analysis of the reasons why 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:43.209
 this detachment from the back cover is not 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.709
 and this video then doing to know if 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.419
 Do you know someone with your 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.220
 device displays any type of 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.479
 problem, I'd like to know 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.819
 comments below 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.829
 Good staff as I said at the beginning is in the 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.859
 day does not want to alarm anyone but anyway 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.939
 when samsung send us an analysis 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.000
 about what happened 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.859
 device I'll update this video 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.049
 and also the article that I have a 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.909
 android talking about this 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.489
 question of the detachment of the 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.289
 back of the galaxy s 6 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.489
