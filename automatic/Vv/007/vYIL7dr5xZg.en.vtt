00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.210 

60<00:00:13.450> okay<00:00:14.140> so<00:00:14.200> we<00:00:14.530> don't<00:00:14.680> have<00:00:14.920> a<00:00:14.950> roadblock

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
60 okay so we don't have a roadblock

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.460 
60 okay so we don't have a roadblock
here<00:00:15.820> but<00:00:16.090> it's<00:00:16.240> by<00:00:16.450> no<00:00:16.480> means<00:00:16.720> are<00:00:17.170> slow

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
here but it's by no means are slow

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:19.000 
here but it's by no means are slow
they're<00:00:17.800> gone

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
they're gone

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.180 
they're gone
let's<00:00:19.580> see<00:00:19.790> what<00:00:19.940> it's<00:00:20.090> like<00:00:20.210> on<00:00:20.420> the<00:00:20.480> corners

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:21.190 
let's see what it's like on the corners

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:32.700 
let's see what it's like on the corners
around<00:00:22.190> around<00:00:22.850> about<00:00:23.210> now<00:00:24.070> thirty<00:00:25.070> miles

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.670 

the<00:00:33.040> car<00:00:33.309> is<00:00:33.520> going<00:00:33.760> down<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.329> frontal<00:00:34.750> lobes

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.180 

the<00:00:37.980> discovery<00:00:38.460> quite<00:00:38.760> good<00:00:39.180> it's<00:00:40.190> stopped

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the discovery quite good it's stopped

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.400 
the discovery quite good it's stopped
quite<00:00:41.610> squatting<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.540> meaning<00:00:42.870> every<00:00:43.200> does

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
quite squatting it is meaning every does

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.890 
quite squatting it is meaning every does
feel<00:00:43.590> quite<00:00:43.740> top-heavy<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.490> corner<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.780> be

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
feel quite top-heavy on the corner to be

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.820 
feel quite top-heavy on the corner to be
fair

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.320 

it's<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:49.950> difficult<00:00:50.220> one<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.490> review<00:00:50.880> of<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.300> I

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
it's a difficult one to review of that I

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.700 
it's a difficult one to review of that I
think<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.720> would<00:00:51.780> be<00:00:51.930> better<00:00:52.110> if<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.500> but

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
think it would be better if it was but

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.430 
think it would be better if it was but
if<00:00:52.830> it<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.600> raining<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:54.960> probably

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
if it was raining and I think probably

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.650 
if it was raining and I think probably
will<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.650> a<00:00:55.740> lot<00:00:55.950> of<00:00:55.980> understeer<00:00:56.490> I<00:00:56.820> suspect

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
will it's a lot of understeer I suspect

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.090 
will it's a lot of understeer I suspect
there<00:00:57.810> be<00:00:57.900> a<00:00:57.930> live<00:00:58.080> understood<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.830> car

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
there be a live understood with this car

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.590 
there be a live understood with this car
because<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.610> did<00:00:59.790> go<00:00:59.940> down<00:00:59.970> a<00:01:00.210> lot<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.540> the

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
because it did go down a lot of the

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.290 
because it did go down a lot of the
front<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> he<00:01:02.130> did<00:01:02.340> fit<00:01:02.610> other<00:01:02.760> nose<00:01:03.030> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
front and he did fit other nose and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.969 
front and he did fit other nose and
sticking<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.350> all<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.559> weight<00:01:04.770> was

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
sticking in and all the weight was

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.730 
sticking in and all the weight was
really<00:01:05.400> concentrating<00:01:05.940> on<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.090> profiles<00:01:06.740> car

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
really concentrating on the profiles car

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160 
really concentrating on the profiles car
didn't<00:01:08.040> feel<00:01:08.220> particularly<00:01:08.820> balance<00:01:09.330> was

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
didn't feel particularly balance was

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020 
didn't feel particularly balance was
very<00:01:10.470> heavy<00:01:10.740> top-heavy<00:01:11.310> which<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.820> quite

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
very heavy top-heavy which is quite

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.740 
very heavy top-heavy which is quite
surprising<00:01:12.210> really<00:01:13.580> for<00:01:14.580> this<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.180> status

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
surprising really for this is the status

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.620 
surprising really for this is the status
of<00:01:16.020> learns<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.160> the<00:01:17.250> state<00:01:17.490> Saddam<00:01:17.970> car<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
of learns so in the state Saddam car I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.570 
of learns so in the state Saddam car I
wonder<00:01:19.080> why<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.740> heavy<00:01:20.010> there<00:01:20.280> should<00:01:20.460> be

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
wonder why it's so heavy there should be

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.570 
wonder why it's so heavy there should be
quite<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:21.110> balanced<00:01:22.250> central<00:01:23.250> point<00:01:23.490> of

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
quite a balanced central point of

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.969 
quite a balanced central point of
gravity

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
gravity

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.499 
gravity
anyway<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> instrument<00:01:26.460> cluster<00:01:26.550> very<00:01:27.210> clear

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
anyway the instrument cluster very clear

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.600 
anyway the instrument cluster very clear
very<00:01:27.840> precise<00:01:28.290> easy<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.890> decipher<00:01:29.550> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
very precise easy to decipher and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
very precise easy to decipher and
assimilate<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> information<00:01:30.210> while<00:01:30.810> you're

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
assimilate the information while you're

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.020 
assimilate the information while you're
driving<00:01:31.440> it's<00:01:32.190> not<00:01:32.369> obstructed<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
driving it's not obstructed by the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.270 
driving it's not obstructed by the
steering<00:01:33.420> wheel<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.190> it'd<00:01:35.250> be

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
steering wheel and I think it'd be

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.780 
steering wheel and I think it'd be
pretty<00:01:35.460> difficult<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.210> do<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.420> actually

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
pretty difficult to do that actually

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.580 
pretty difficult to do that actually

about<00:02:42.030> this<00:02:42.950> steering<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.670> corners

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.530 

because<00:02:48.110> shops<00:02:48.980> are<00:02:49.310> too<00:02:49.580> soft

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
because shops are too soft

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.050 
because shops are too soft
and<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.439> really<00:02:52.709> does<00:02:53.040> lack<00:02:53.340> balance<00:02:53.610> on<00:02:53.939> the

corner singing in the rain I could see

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.339 
corner singing in the rain I could see
now<00:02:56.939> that<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.269> car<00:02:57.569> would<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:57.930> over<00:02:57.959> the

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.149 
place I just go around the corner again
now<00:03:02.689> there's<00:03:03.689> no<00:03:03.810> talks<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.560> I've<00:03:04.860> lost<00:03:05.010> a
