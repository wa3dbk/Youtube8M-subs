and actually this side has been finished
this<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.930> mostly<00:01:07.439> finished<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.979> should

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
this side is mostly finished I should

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.000 
this side is mostly finished I should
say<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:09.390> process<00:01:09.840> goes<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.380> this

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
say the process goes like this

um I'll start with a piece of 1500 grit
sanding<00:01:14.580> paper<00:01:14.760> 15<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.630> 1000<00:01:16.259> or<00:01:16.350> 1500<00:01:16.680> grit

until all the perfection all the
imperfections<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.649> out<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.520> finish

imperfections are out of the finish

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.429 
imperfections are out of the finish
they've<00:02:06.329> got<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> little<00:02:06.750> thing<00:02:07.079> up<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they've got a little thing up in the

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.430 
they've got a little thing up in the
corner<00:02:07.829> up<00:02:07.979> there<00:02:08.330> right<00:02:09.330> here<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
corner up there right here but that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
corner up there right here but that
really<00:02:10.769> isn't<00:02:11.009> an<00:02:11.190> imperfection<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.180> much<00:02:12.360> it

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
really isn't an imperfection so much it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880 
really isn't an imperfection so much it
might<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> little<00:02:12.989> bit<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.319> ridge<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.739> may

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
might be a little bit of a ridge I may

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.410 
might be a little bit of a ridge I may
work<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.580> try<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.819> just<00:02:15.060> smooth<00:02:15.299> it

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
work on that to try and just smooth it

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.910 
work on that to try and just smooth it
back<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.810> so<00:02:15.959> I<00:02:15.989> have<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.170> perfectly<00:02:16.650> flat

it's<00:02:31.349> no<00:02:31.560> big<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.980> don't<00:02:32.099> have<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.400> go<00:02:32.519> very

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
it's no big you don't have to go very

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.819 
it's no big you don't have to go very
fast<00:02:33.000> sometimes<00:02:33.870> I'll<00:02:34.260> double<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.590> paper

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
fast sometimes I'll double the paper

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.910 
fast sometimes I'll double the paper
paper<00:02:35.430> over<00:02:35.910> as<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.989> edge<00:02:37.200> will<00:02:37.500> allow<00:02:37.709> me<00:02:37.890> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
paper over as that edge will allow me to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.210 
paper over as that edge will allow me to
allow<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.150> paper<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.290> stay<00:02:40.500> stiff<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
allow the the paper to stay stiff a

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.380 
allow the the paper to stay stiff a
little<00:02:41.760> stiffer<00:02:42.000> on<00:02:42.209> this<00:02:42.390> edge<00:02:43.849> your<00:02:44.849> fingers

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
little stiffer on this edge your fingers

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.240 
little stiffer on this edge your fingers
you<00:02:45.989> want<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.590> don't<00:02:46.769> want<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:46.980> go<00:02:47.069> back

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
you want to you don't want to go back

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.009 
you want to you don't want to go back
and<00:02:47.400> forth<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.819> very<00:02:48.000> same<00:02:48.180> spot<00:02:48.359> over<00:02:48.690> and

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
and forth in the very same spot over and

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.229 
and forth in the very same spot over and
over<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.440> over<00:02:49.680> again<00:02:49.799> because<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.849> pads<00:02:51.090> of

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
over and over again because the pads of

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.650 
over and over again because the pads of
your<00:02:51.299> fingers<00:02:51.780> aren't<00:02:52.410> level<00:02:53.359> and<00:02:54.359> you<00:02:54.540> will

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
your fingers aren't level and you will

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.720 
your fingers aren't level and you will
actually<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.319> will<00:02:55.709> actually<00:02:56.069> wear<00:02:56.310> spots

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
actually you will actually wear spots

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.150 
actually you will actually wear spots
you'll<00:02:57.180> actually<00:02:57.540> wear<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.810> deeper<00:02:58.079> here<00:02:58.620> here

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
you'll actually wear a deeper here here

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.789 
you'll actually wear a deeper here here
and<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.819> leave<00:03:00.569> it<00:03:00.720> leave<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.410> shallower

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
and here and leave it leave a shallower

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.500 
and here and leave it leave a shallower
area<00:03:02.160> there<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.609> when<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.760> move<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.239> want<00:03:03.389> to

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
area there so when you move you want to

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.809 
area there so when you move you want to
go<00:03:03.630> back<00:03:04.169> and<00:03:04.500> forth<00:03:04.769> and<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.130> move<00:03:05.340> in<00:03:05.579> a

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
go back and forth and then move in a

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.009 
go back and forth and then move in a
little<00:03:06.060> bit<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.480> move<00:03:07.079> move<00:03:07.650> like<00:03:07.919> this

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
little bit and move move like this

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.420 
little bit and move move like this
okay<00:03:10.340> I'll<00:03:11.340> just<00:03:11.459> take<00:03:11.730> a<00:03:12.440> paper<00:03:13.440> towel<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.769> dry

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
okay I'll just take a paper towel a dry

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.430 
okay I'll just take a paper towel a dry
paper<00:03:14.639> towel<00:03:14.940> I<00:03:15.209> use<00:03:15.780> Bounty<00:03:16.109> paper<00:03:16.139> towels

and I'll sand it I'll stay in it for a
little<00:03:18.989> while<00:03:19.109> because<00:03:19.530> it's<00:03:19.829> hard<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.130> see

this whole machine if not more I'll

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.500 
this whole machine if not more I'll
start<00:04:04.230> with<00:04:04.380> a<00:04:04.440> like<00:04:05.340> a<00:04:05.370> polishing<00:04:05.940> compound<00:04:06.390> I

start with a like a polishing compound I

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.870 
start with a like a polishing compound I
like<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.900> I've<00:04:07.530> used<00:04:07.830> paste<00:04:08.130> before<00:04:08.400> but<00:04:08.849> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
like the I've used paste before but I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.270 
like the I've used paste before but I
like<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.510> liquid<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:09.959> goes<00:04:10.860> on<00:04:11.069> a<00:04:11.099> little

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
like this the liquid it goes on a little

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.460 
like this the liquid it goes on a little
bit<00:04:11.400> easier<00:04:11.760> goes<00:04:12.599> right<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.080> goes<00:04:13.380> you

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
bit easier goes right on it goes you

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.310 
bit easier goes right on it goes you
know<00:04:13.500> goes<00:04:13.560> right<00:04:13.920> on<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:15.780> cotton<00:04:16.109> round

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
know goes right on the the cotton round

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.050

it does leave a bit of a glaze on it but
before<00:06:11.849> it<00:06:11.970> dries<00:06:12.180> I'll<00:06:12.419> wipe<00:06:12.599> it<00:06:12.720> off<00:06:12.870> with<00:06:13.020> a
