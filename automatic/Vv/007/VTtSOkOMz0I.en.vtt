00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Talk to people, beauty, good morning, good morning. 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.400
 Late good night, I 'm just never 28 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 years and this my story with good fps 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.230
 I started playing shooting games a long time ago. 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.150
 for 18 years even though my father did 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.210
 a birthday party made a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.279
 micro lan lan house at home and I called 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.660
 my friends and family is 10 years and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.640
 played a very old game and there already 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.740
 started my passion for fps 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.740
 From here to here, a lot has evolved 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.050
 graphics gameplay equipment everything 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.230
 mainly evolved the head of the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.360
 and my people also obviously 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.200
 When you talk about head evolution 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 the evolution of mentality I say that 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.180
 playing ps is not as easy as 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.640
 people always imagine 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 almost 99% of the time 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 someone who plays better than you and this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.379
 it's up to you to accept it, you see 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.260
 you have to improve and that's why 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.619
 fps shooting games out there are always 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 one thing is passionate about you 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.490
 it evolves it evolves it goes on and on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 evolving and becoming strong or being a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.150
 motivated guy to try his best to 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.110
 some time ago I had a championship that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.820
 I participated 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.470
 The time ago I say ten years is where I 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.979
 was the youngest player on my team and the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.600
 people and the championship and that I 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.790
 was the guy a little more for being more 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.799
 new was one more guy that I can 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:36.869
 talk but there is talent to be shown is 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.790
 team and we got an unprecedented 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.000
 third place lost to teams 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.530
 Giant exit the setting and sao paulo 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 people was a very big improvement 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.500
 because we got together and showed the 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.409
 how strong we are and we have 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 ability to be better we were not 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.070
 the best but we hit the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.290
 better and what did we do? 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.509
 different in this championship we looked 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.590
 to each other's houses where the name can 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.290
 we can 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.450
 Let's cool down. 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.460
 Let's have a head in the place, let's stop. 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.960
 complain to each other how to stop 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.420
 complain about the game 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.530
 Let's stop seeing problems and see 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.510
 solutions instead of people are claimed 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.120
 another player to complain to another of a 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.550
 situation we will try to understand what 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.760
 happened and what happens on no 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.240
 game for us is to always seek to improve 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.760
 So that's it and made us reach this 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.910
 victory is that for us it was an unprecedented 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.870
 third place was a victory yes and 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.770
 This is our overcoming there. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.020
 gigantic 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.580
 from that day on that I really 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.840
 I saw that it is the overcoming and a way of playing 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.270
 the way of playing 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.470
 the evolution of a player depends only on 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:02.450
 ourselves then it is very easy is 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 want to be the best but it's very difficult 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.170
 get there but who said it is 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.989
 impossible is not 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.800
 So I got there and it was a 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.410
 Giant overcoming so I speak looking 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.810
 for your camera in your eyes there that 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.000
 yes it just depends on you have to be a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.610
 best person player better be more 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.030
 strong and have an overrun within the 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.560
 game is do not stay from mimi complaint is 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.330
 try to understand the problems that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.239
 happen to people with level of 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.090
 game with the game everybody this just goes 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.340
 improve you and improve the game improve 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.650
 all for you around from 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.330
 The moment you seek the best you 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.580
 start to be a better person 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:48.140
 we conclude that this only has 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.450
 benefits in a stronger person being 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.060
 a better person than I could here 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.870
 many things happened to me in the arena 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.549
 my store a lot of thing 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.930
 I finally got an income with 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.909
 with games is not mainly the fps 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.209
 and it's something that struck me was 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.609
 just this day is our Victory 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.689
 our third place in the championship where 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:16.400
 I really believe that 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:20.060
 things depend a lot on us a lot 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.370
 more people than other people, right? 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.990
 for things to be better depends on 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.240
 much more of the opinion people of other 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:29.960
 people and achieve all this thanks to 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.630
 talk it is possible if you dream about 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.970
 to have an income dream of living games and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.160
