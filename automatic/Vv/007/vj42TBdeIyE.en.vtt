is the catalytic converter now we had to
pry<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.930> out<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.620> it<00:03:08.769> go<00:03:08.950> that

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
pry the out of it to get it go that

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.890 
pry the out of it to get it go that
way<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:09.700> joke<00:03:10.180> beat<00:03:10.420> on<00:03:10.599> it<00:03:10.750> with<00:03:10.870> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
way and then joke beat on it with a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.920 
way and then joke beat on it with a
hammer<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.410> drove<00:03:11.980> it<00:03:12.129> down<00:03:12.720> because<00:03:13.720> there's

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
hammer and drove it down because there's

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.850 
hammer and drove it down because there's
a<00:03:14.049> connection<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.830> and<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.220> connection<00:03:15.730> here

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
a connection here and a connection here

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.509 
a connection here and a connection here
so<00:03:17.860> now<00:03:18.069> we<00:03:18.970> got<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.269> drive<00:03:19.510> it<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.489> out<00:03:21.489> to

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
so now we got to drive it up and out to

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.759 
so now we got to drive it up and out to
get<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.060> off<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.480> to<00:03:23.079> make<00:03:23.260> it<00:03:23.410> go<00:03:23.560> straight

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
get it off that to make it go straight

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:31.319 
get it off that to make it go straight
back<00:03:24.040> be<00:03:24.819> back<00:03:28.170> alright<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:30.180> sprayed<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.299> with

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
back be back alright I sprayed it with

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.449 
back be back alright I sprayed it with
PB<00:03:31.780> Blaster<00:03:32.319> so<00:03:32.530> we're<00:03:32.680> gonna<00:03:32.769> get<00:03:32.980> plenty<00:03:33.280> o

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
PB Blaster so we're gonna get plenty o

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:39.180 
PB Blaster so we're gonna get plenty o
smoke<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:35.910> then<00:03:36.910> Jill<00:03:37.209> beat<00:03:37.900> on<00:03:38.110> it<00:03:38.290> tried<00:03:39.040> to

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
smoke and then Jill beat on it tried to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.319 
smoke and then Jill beat on it tried to
open<00:03:39.310> it<00:03:39.549> up<00:03:39.700> a<00:03:39.790> little<00:03:39.910> bit<00:03:40.120> with<00:03:40.299> a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
open it up a little bit with a

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.280 
open it up a little bit with a
screwdriver<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:42.480> then<00:03:43.480> I<00:03:43.599> used<00:03:43.840> a<00:03:43.959> pry<00:03:44.260> bar

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
screwdriver and then I used a pry bar

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.710 
screwdriver and then I used a pry bar
from<00:03:44.890> here<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.549> here<00:03:46.260> and<00:03:48.030> Joe<00:03:49.030> was<00:03:49.209> tapping<00:03:49.629> it

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
from here to here and Joe was tapping it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.190 
from here to here and Joe was tapping it
with<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.900> body<00:03:50.140> hammer<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:52.079> magically<00:03:53.079> it

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
with a body hammer and magically it

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.280 
with a body hammer and magically it
popped<00:03:53.440> off<00:03:54.269> but<00:03:55.269> with<00:03:55.420> the<00:03:55.510> panttiere<00:03:55.840> racks

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
popped off but with the panttiere racks

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.270 
popped off but with the panttiere racks
on<00:03:56.590> I<00:03:56.880> can't<00:03:57.880> get<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.209> out<00:03:58.299> of<00:03:58.359> the<00:03:58.540> way<00:04:02.280> we

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
on I can't get it out of the way we

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.129 
on I can't get it out of the way we
don't<00:04:03.459> care<00:04:03.819> we're<00:04:04.359> gonna<00:04:04.480> lift<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.959> straight

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
don't care we're gonna lift it straight

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.470 
don't care we're gonna lift it straight
up<00:04:05.410> and<00:04:05.799> then<00:04:05.920> it'll<00:04:06.160> come<00:04:06.340> loose<00:04:09.299> now<00:04:10.299> to

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
up and then it'll come loose now to

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:24.270 
up and then it'll come loose now to
crossover<00:04:10.930> pipe<00:04:22.710> that'll<00:04:23.710> work<00:04:23.860> just<00:04:24.130> like

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
crossover pipe that'll work just like

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.740 
crossover pipe that'll work just like
that<00:04:24.490> soon<00:04:25.000> as<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.150> flip<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.419> up<00:04:25.599> it'll<00:04:25.780> come<00:04:26.020> on

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that soon as we flip it up it'll come on

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.279 
that soon as we flip it up it'll come on
let<00:04:28.750> it<00:04:28.780> hang<00:04:28.960> right<00:04:29.139> there<00:04:30.810> in<00:04:31.810> your<00:04:31.870> coil

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
let it hang right there in your coil

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.750 
let it hang right there in your coil
pack<00:04:32.590> has<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.039> come<00:04:33.220> off<00:04:33.250> which<00:04:34.210> is<00:04:34.360> under<00:04:34.660> here

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.520 

but<00:04:38.760> we're<00:04:39.000> gonna<00:04:39.150> try<00:04:39.420> and<00:04:39.690> just<00:04:39.900> lay<00:04:40.200> it<00:04:40.350> over

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
but we're gonna try and just lay it over

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.570 
but we're gonna try and just lay it over
to<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.860> side<00:04:42.380> and<00:04:43.380> see<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:43.800> we<00:04:43.980> can<00:04:44.160> make<00:04:44.400> it

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
to the side and see if we can make it

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.070 
to the side and see if we can make it
work<00:04:44.820> there<00:04:45.270> I<00:04:47.420> don't<00:04:48.420> know<00:04:48.570> it<00:04:48.720> looks<00:04:48.930> like

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
work there I don't know it looks like

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.630 
work there I don't know it looks like
that<00:04:49.230> might<00:04:49.530> unplug<00:04:51.470> by<00:04:52.470> pulling<00:04:53.130> these<00:04:53.310> off

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
that might unplug by pulling these off

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.320 
that might unplug by pulling these off
but

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
but

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.330 
but

away
yeah<00:05:15.460> put<00:05:15.699> a<00:05:15.729> screwdriver<00:05:16.000> in<00:05:16.330> pry<00:05:16.870> this<00:05:16.930> fry

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
yeah put a screwdriver in pry this fry

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.300 
yeah put a screwdriver in pry this fry
this<00:05:17.830> out

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.900 

then<00:05:21.940> it<00:05:22.030> unplugs<00:05:22.450> from<00:05:22.660> there<00:05:23.700> and<00:05:24.700> here's

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
then it unplugs from there and here's

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.650 
then it unplugs from there and here's
the<00:05:25.060> coil<00:05:25.300> pack

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.180 

or<00:05:29.490> might<00:05:30.490> be<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.790> friggin<00:05:31.150> computer

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
or might be the friggin computer

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.879 
or might be the friggin computer
don't<00:05:33.460> know

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:35.889 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:38.340 

but

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
but

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.670 
but
that's<00:05:38.950> how<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.160> works

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.330 

a<00:05:43.740> little<00:05:44.340> busted<00:05:44.729> knuckle<00:05:45.060> school<00:05:45.360> one<00:05:46.340> and

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
a little busted knuckle school one and

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.050 
a little busted knuckle school one and
then<00:05:47.520> if<00:05:47.639> you<00:05:47.820> can<00:05:48.060> tell<00:05:48.539> I<00:05:49.550> can<00:05:50.550> lift<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:51.000> right

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
then if you can tell I can lift it right

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.830 
then if you can tell I can lift it right
up<00:05:51.270> and<00:05:52.220> did<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.250> bottom<00:05:53.639> bolts<00:05:54.030> on<00:05:54.570> both

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
up and did the bottom bolts on both

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.760 
up and did the bottom bolts on both
sides<00:05:55.280> loosen<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.460> top<00:05:56.639> ones<00:05:57.320> left<00:05:58.320> them<00:05:58.530> bolt

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
sides loosen the top ones left them bolt

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.080 
sides loosen the top ones left them bolt
it<00:05:58.979> in<00:05:59.660> so<00:06:00.660> then<00:06:00.810> the<00:06:00.960> next<00:06:01.110> thing<00:06:01.259> is<00:06:01.620> we<00:06:02.370> just

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
it in so then the next thing is we just

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.450 
it in so then the next thing is we just
need<00:06:03.389> to<00:06:03.660> figure<00:06:03.870> out<00:06:03.990> a<00:06:04.110> way<00:06:04.229> to<00:06:04.350> moist<00:06:05.009> it<00:06:05.280> up

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
need to figure out a way to moist it up

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.640 
need to figure out a way to moist it up
so<00:06:05.699> I<00:06:05.729> can<00:06:06.000> get<00:06:06.240> to<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:07.160> shock<00:06:09.080> top<00:06:10.080> shock<00:06:10.380> full

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
so I can get to the shock top shock full

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.710 
so I can get to the shock top shock full
it's<00:06:11.220> weightless<00:06:12.259> and<00:06:14.419> we're<00:06:15.419> gonna<00:06:15.539> get
