00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.080
 kitchen today we are going to cook a soup of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.080
 tomato 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.920
 The ingredients we need are 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 ripe tomatoes half onion a little bit of 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.960
 olive oil 2 tablespoons flour 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.920
 wholegrain some black pepper 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.380
 ground some salt half a pill 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.690
 concentrated broth and a little 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.340
 chopped basil and cream 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.340
 finish our soup 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.210
 we wash the tomatoes 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.160
 once we have peeled the tomatoes 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.250
 using our trick to peel 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.270
 tomatoes we cut them into pieces in a 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.510
 large bowl 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.540
 we grate the half onion light a 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.290
 rather loose fire we put our 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.650
 pan and we take a splash of oil 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.370
 olive just a little bit through the bottom of 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.560
 the pan and wait for it to warm up 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.290
 when the oil is hot we add 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.590
 the onion and we give it a little spin 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.479
 so that it is done when the 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.760
 Onion is getting soft and goes 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.820
 taking a transparent color 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.830
 we tossed two tablespoons of flour and 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.170
 we keep stirring so that it is not done 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.610
 I grumble a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.830
 and 2 and we stir well and now that they have 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.890
 passed a couple of minutes and the flour already 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.300
 It does not taste like raw flour. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.070
 our sliced tomatoes 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.580
 here we are the rest of the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 ingredients 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.340
 the tomatoes 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 half tablet of concentrated broth a 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.829
 little crumbled 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.950
 a little salt not much because the 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.399
 concentrated broth already has salt pepper 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 black 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.910
 and we remove well we cover everything with a 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.420
 little water and let it cook for 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.420
 20 minutes 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.170
 good the seeds because when they have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600
 after 20 minutes of cooking is 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.090
 sopita is ready, we only need 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.520
 crush the tomato remains with the 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 minipimer and then pass it by the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.810
 food mill or Chinese in case 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.380
 we will lower our tomato soup by the 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.380
 morning 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.500
 we went through the Chinese or mill for 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.210
 remove the possible nuggets or skins 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.510
 quotes from the tomato that could have 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.250
 stay in our good tomato soup 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.650
 curtains then at the time of serving 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.110
 We will serve our tomato soup with a 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.780
 little bit of cream on top and the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.480
 we will finish decorating with a little 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.420
 of basil 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.760
 and this dish is already ready so nothing 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.760
 as always I say good
