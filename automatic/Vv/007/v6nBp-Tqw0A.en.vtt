00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.379
 hello guys and petits Friday is 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.379
 cooking with year 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
 to the girl species again mine 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 is cooking with friends today can you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.090
 teach how to use the egg whites that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.550
 they have left us of said keep until 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.099
 they remember when we made the plan 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.849
 seven minutes 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.849
 and when we did 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.090
 the critical side some spoke clear 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.220
 of egg then now let's do 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.439
 a mane remember that you can 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.420
 fill the omelette of what you 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.260
 want here they are given the idea and as 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.920
 you apply it 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 that's decision we started 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.579
 what we are going to need are going to be the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.579
 preferably for once 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.330
 between this cited 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.290
 remember that I have here several 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:01:06.190
 because they are the ones that have left over from the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 what we have done and we beat a little 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.220
 much 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:25.150
 since we have beaten it we put it a 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.330
 little bit of salt to give it flavor 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.590
 that we have beaten them we are going to put them 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.470
 in a dish 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.040
 and this is like ceramic 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:43.800
 and since we put it on the plate 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.800
 pottery let's extend our egg 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.500
 Y 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.470
 let's put it in the microwave 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.950
 for a minute and a half 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.950
 to 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.330
 do not 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.189
 as we already have cooked for our 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.189
 million 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.100
 let's take it off on our plate 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.530
 since we take off from our plate we're going 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.130
 to pass it to another plate 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:39.020
 in this case there are two solitos but 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.020

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.220

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:49.810
 filling with salads and with tuna 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.099
 and the only thing they do is 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.099

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.980
