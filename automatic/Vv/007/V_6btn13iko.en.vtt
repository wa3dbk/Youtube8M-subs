breathing cinematic experience rages
stylized<00:02:35.739> realism<00:02:36.690> visually<00:02:37.690> there<00:02:37.870> was<00:02:37.989> the

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
stylized realism visually there was the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.180 
stylized realism visually there was the
idea<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.470> scale<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.830> was<00:02:38.920> really

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
idea of the scale that was really

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.790 
idea of the scale that was really
important<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:39.760> then<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.780> was<00:02:40.930> also<00:02:41.290> like<00:02:41.590> an

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
important and then it was also like an

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.640 
important and then it was also like an
idea<00:02:42.160> of<00:02:42.280> futurism<00:02:42.880> so<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.110> still

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
idea of futurism so it is still

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.190 
idea of futurism so it is still
unbelievable<00:02:45.489> city<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.810> know<00:02:46.900> there<00:02:47.049> was

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
unbelievable city you know there was

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.770 
unbelievable city you know there was
definitely<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.980> lot<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.420> visuals<00:02:49.420> from

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
definitely a lot of visuals from

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.319 
definitely a lot of visuals from
Brutalism<00:02:50.680> that<00:02:51.250> has<00:02:51.430> that<00:02:51.700> feel<00:02:52.000> that<00:02:52.030> kind

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
Brutalism that has that feel that kind

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.819 
Brutalism that has that feel that kind
of<00:02:52.450> relates<00:02:52.780> very<00:02:53.200> strongly<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.799> the

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
of relates very strongly with the

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.560 
of relates very strongly with the
authority<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.760> wanted<00:02:55.120> to<00:02:55.299> go<00:02:55.420> with

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
authority so I wanted to go with

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.910 
authority so I wanted to go with
something<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:55.930> very<00:02:56.290> solid<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:56.860> very

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
something that's very solid and very

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.360 
something that's very solid and very
aggressive<00:02:57.730> looking

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.729 

and<00:03:00.790> also<00:03:01.090> we're<00:03:01.330> trying<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.750> basically<00:03:02.260> make

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
and also we're trying to basically make

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.070 
and also we're trying to basically make
the<00:03:03.040> parts<00:03:03.459> of<00:03:03.580> this<00:03:03.700> universe<00:03:04.120> one<00:03:04.390> cohesive

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
the parts of this universe one cohesive

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.949 
the parts of this universe one cohesive
environment<00:03:05.910> there<00:03:06.910> was<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.060> world<00:03:07.300> before<00:03:07.540> and

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
environment there was a world before and

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.589 
environment there was a world before and
there's<00:03:08.349> a<00:03:08.379> new<00:03:08.620> world<00:03:08.890> after<00:03:09.129> that<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.849> you

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
there's a new world after that and you

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.210 
there's a new world after that and you
have<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.870> think<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.590> layers<00:03:11.800> between

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
have to think of like the layers between

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.050 
have to think of like the layers between
the<00:03:12.519> two<00:03:12.730> eras<00:03:13.599> basically<00:03:14.640> when<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.670> started

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
the two eras basically when I started

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.030 
the two eras basically when I started
this<00:03:16.209> technology<00:03:16.870> I<00:03:16.989> had<00:03:17.230> some<00:03:17.470> image<00:03:17.769> in<00:03:17.920> my

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
this technology I had some image in my

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.490 
this technology I had some image in my
mind<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.400> what<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.730> could<00:03:18.940> do<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:19.959> when<00:03:20.410> the

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
mind of what it could do but when the

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.110 
mind of what it could do but when the
artists<00:03:20.980> get<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.190> hold<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.519> this<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:21.790> they

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
artists get a hold of this and they

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.900 
artists get a hold of this and they
start<00:03:22.480> working<00:03:23.170> their<00:03:23.349> magic<00:03:23.379> on<00:03:23.980> it<00:03:24.069> they

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
start working their magic on it they

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.759 
start working their magic on it they
produce<00:03:25.150> things<00:03:25.540> that<00:03:25.750> when<00:03:26.260> I<00:03:26.290> look<00:03:26.530> at<00:03:26.620> some

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
produce things that when I look at some

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.610 
produce things that when I look at some
of<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:26.950> scenes<00:03:27.220> in<00:03:27.549> rage<00:03:27.879> just<00:03:28.480> wow<00:03:29.260> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
of the scenes in rage just wow that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.199 
of the scenes in rage just wow that
looks<00:03:29.799> better<00:03:30.069> than<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.519> would<00:03:30.879> have<00:03:30.910> thought

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
looks better than I would have thought

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.370 
looks better than I would have thought
this<00:03:31.450> game<00:03:31.690> could<00:03:32.440> look<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.780> technology

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
this game could look the technology

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.009 
this game could look the technology
right<00:03:35.530> now<00:03:35.560> allows<00:03:36.010> us<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.579> paint<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.540> any

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
right now allows us to paint on any

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.940 
right now allows us to paint on any
surfaces<00:03:38.799> at<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.400> pixel<00:03:39.910> level<00:03:40.360> as<00:03:41.260> an<00:03:41.410> artist<00:03:41.739> I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
surfaces at a pixel level as an artist I

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.949 
surfaces at a pixel level as an artist I
like<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.519> possibility<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.180> expressing<00:03:43.540> your

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
like the possibility of expressing your

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.020 
like the possibility of expressing your
vision<00:03:44.590> in<00:03:45.190> the<00:03:45.340> merged<00:03:45.519> higher-fidelity

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
vision in the merged higher-fidelity

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.960 
vision in the merged higher-fidelity
there's<00:03:46.780> no<00:03:47.049> texture<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:48.010> limitation<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.760> big

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
there's no texture of limitation the big

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.729 
there's no texture of limitation the big
challenge<00:03:49.360> is<00:03:49.510> more<00:03:49.690> like<00:03:49.900> when<00:03:50.170> do<00:03:50.349> I<00:03:50.379> stop

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
challenge is more like when do I stop

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.880 
challenge is more like when do I stop
when<00:03:51.160> is<00:03:51.310> it<00:03:51.459> green<00:03:51.849> or<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.079> achieves<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
when is it green or that it achieves the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.770 
when is it green or that it achieves the
goal<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.700> you<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.090> kind<00:03:55.329> of<00:03:55.390> find<00:03:55.629> that

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
goal so you have to kind of find that

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.920 
goal so you have to kind of find that
good<00:03:55.989> balance<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:57.239> wanted<00:03:58.239> her<00:03:58.329> to<00:03:58.360> feel<00:03:58.510> like

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
good balance I wanted her to feel like

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.170 
good balance I wanted her to feel like
he<00:03:59.230> lived<00:03:59.590> through<00:03:59.920> an<00:04:00.099> experience<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:00.970> is

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
he lived through an experience that is

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.650 
he lived through an experience that is
bigger<00:04:01.569> than<00:04:02.049> just<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.860> game<00:04:03.040> itself

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
bigger than just the game itself

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.599 
bigger than just the game itself
everyone<00:04:04.660> who's<00:04:04.810> seen<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.230> game<00:04:05.440> so<00:04:05.799> far<00:04:06.160> has

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
everyone who's seen the game so far has

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.150 
everyone who's seen the game so far has
had<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:07.060> same<00:04:07.269> reaction<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:08.560> like<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.769> visual

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
had the same reaction it's like a visual

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.309 
had the same reaction it's like a visual
shock<00:04:09.459> there's<00:04:10.420> some<00:04:10.600> really<00:04:10.989> breathtaking

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
shock there's some really breathtaking

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.370 
shock there's some really breathtaking
imagery<00:04:12.190> there<00:04:12.430> and<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.329> is<00:04:13.540> better<00:04:14.049> than<00:04:14.319> I

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
imagery there and it is better than I
