00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
but you know at this point I think the

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.189 
but you know at this point I think the
curved<00:05:39.979> screen<00:05:40.340> is<00:05:40.580> maybe<00:05:41.570> a<00:05:41.720> step<00:05:41.990> in<00:05:42.169> the

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
curved screen is maybe a step in the

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.899 
curved screen is maybe a step in the
right<00:05:42.349> direction<00:05:42.409> you<00:05:43.010> know<00:05:43.130> they<00:05:43.310> did<00:05:43.789> the

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
right direction you know they did the

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.969 
right direction you know they did the
curved<00:05:44.419> screen<00:05:44.720> like<00:05:44.870> this<00:05:45.050> for<00:05:45.320> TVs<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.889> they

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
curved screen like this for TVs and they

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:48.219 
curved screen like this for TVs and they
did<00:05:46.099> it<00:05:46.190> for<00:05:46.220> some<00:05:46.460> phones<00:05:46.699> to<00:05:47.030> like<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.870> LG

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:48.229 
did it for some phones to like the LG

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.270 
did it for some phones to like the LG
you<00:05:48.949> know<00:05:49.070> is<00:05:49.250> doing<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.669> the<00:05:49.940> LG<00:05:50.060> flex<00:05:50.479> um<00:05:51.280> but

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
right now I just don't see it being that

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.460 
right now I just don't see it being that
useful<00:05:55.760> it's<00:05:55.909> also<00:05:56.030> hard<00:05:56.419> to<00:05:56.479> get<00:05:56.659> a<00:05:56.810> good<00:05:56.900> case

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
useful it's also hard to get a good case

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.850
