00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
impression was really good for a special

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.670 
impression was really good for a special
bike<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.890> a<00:01:55.520> bike<00:01:55.970> that<00:01:56.270> feels<00:01:56.570> like<00:01:56.690> a<00:01:56.840> lot

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
bike it's a bike that feels like a lot

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.380 
bike it's a bike that feels like a lot
heavier<00:01:57.830> bike<00:01:58.220> so<00:01:58.369> it<00:01:58.430> feels<00:01:58.550> stiff<00:01:58.940> and<00:01:59.210> rigid

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
heavier bike so it feels stiff and rigid

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.130 
heavier bike so it feels stiff and rigid
and<00:01:59.840> fast<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:01.520> in<00:02:02.060> reality<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.750> bike<00:02:02.930> is

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and fast but then in reality the bike is

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.160 
and fast but then in reality the bike is
so<00:02:03.530> much<00:02:03.710> lighter<00:02:03.950> than<00:02:04.070> everything<00:02:04.580> before

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
so much lighter than everything before

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.480 
so much lighter than everything before
so<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.290> was<00:02:06.320> really<00:02:06.410> good<00:02:07.070> right<00:02:07.310> this

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
so that was really good right this

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.880 
so that was really good right this
morning<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.989> bike<00:02:09.200> is<00:02:09.440> very<00:02:09.679> very

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
morning and the bike is very very

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.130 
morning and the bike is very very
responsive<00:02:10.640> but<00:02:10.850> it's<00:02:11.150> very<00:02:11.480> very<00:02:11.810> smooth

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
responsive but it's very very smooth

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.830 
responsive but it's very very smooth
it's<00:02:13.040> difficult<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:14.239> manage<00:02:14.510> those<00:02:14.690> two

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's difficult to to manage those two

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.240 
it's difficult to to manage those two
factors<00:02:15.260> together<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.709> have<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> very<00:02:16.010> very

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
factors together to have a very very

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.340 
factors together to have a very very
stiff<00:02:16.720> responsive<00:02:17.720> fight<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.200> have<00:02:18.290> it

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
stiff responsive fight but to have it

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.140 
stiff responsive fight but to have it
smooth<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.950> road<00:02:19.160> as<00:02:19.370> well<00:02:19.520> but<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:19.880> think<00:02:19.940> a

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
smooth on the road as well but I think a

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.520 
smooth on the road as well but I think a
lot<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.480> standard<00:02:20.690> a<00:02:20.930> new<00:02:21.080> sei

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
lot of that standard a new sei

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.470 
lot of that standard a new sei
technology<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.400> you've<00:02:22.489> incorporated<00:02:22.730> into

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
technology that you've incorporated into

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.479 
technology that you've incorporated into
the<00:02:23.630> frame<00:02:23.870> but<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.530> bike<00:02:24.680> is<00:02:24.709> super<00:02:25.190> bass<00:02:25.340> got

around I used to ride the gentleness
Superleggera<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.549> think<00:02:46.820> that<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.480> new

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
Superleggera and I think that this new

Superleggera and I think that this new
0.7<00:02:49.670> bike<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:51.140> even<00:02:52.010> even<00:02:52.430> better<00:02:52.670> than

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
0.7 bike is even even better than

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.620 
0.7 bike is even even better than
