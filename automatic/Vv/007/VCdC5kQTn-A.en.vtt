best cars that could hold it coming off

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.590

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.380 
were you expecting him to go to the
bottom<00:01:28.070> right<00:01:28.310> at<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.550> L<00:01:28.640> on<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.000> last<00:01:29.180> lap

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
bottom right at the L on the last lap

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.840 
bottom right at the L on the last lap
all<00:01:30.080> right<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:30.350> really<00:01:30.649> didn't<00:01:31.039> know<00:01:31.160> you<00:01:31.729> know

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
all right I really didn't know you know

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.180 
all right I really didn't know you know
either<00:01:32.240> way<00:01:32.509> I<00:01:32.539> was<00:01:32.840> gonna<00:01:32.960> try<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.500> hold<00:01:33.890> in

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
either way I was gonna try and hold in

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.100 
either way I was gonna try and hold in
there<00:01:34.430> when<00:01:34.610> I<00:01:34.880> almost<00:01:35.180> slit<00:01:35.630> him<00:01:35.780> up<00:01:35.930> they're

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
there when I almost slit him up they're

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.960 
there when I almost slit him up they're
coming<00:01:36.140> for<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:36.649> white<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:37.520> thought<00:01:37.789> that

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
coming for the white so I thought that

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.359 
coming for the white so I thought that
might<00:01:38.180> entice<00:01:38.539> him<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.899> go<00:01:39.080> to<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.560> bottom<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
might entice him to go to the bottom and

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.060 
might entice him to go to the bottom and
I<00:01:40.820> was<00:01:41.149> kind<00:01:41.450> of<00:01:41.630> preparing<00:01:42.170> myself<00:01:42.440> for<00:01:42.800> that

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
I was kind of preparing myself for that

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.010 
I was kind of preparing myself for that
to<00:01:43.729> go<00:01:43.880> around<00:01:44.240> and<00:01:44.479> that's<00:01:44.660> what<00:01:44.840> I<00:01:44.869> was

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
to go around and that's what I was

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.719 
to go around and that's what I was
guessing<00:01:45.289> you<00:01:45.890> know<00:01:45.979> he<00:01:46.130> was<00:01:46.250> going<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.459> do<00:01:46.580> and

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
guessing you know he was going to do and

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.460 
guessing you know he was going to do and
it<00:01:46.819> just<00:01:46.849> worked<00:01:47.179> out<00:01:47.360> you<00:01:47.869> pulled<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:48.289> heck

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:08.740 
racing well we got the Mauro night yet
no<00:02:07.729> hopefully<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:08.209> can<00:02:08.330> pull<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.479> off<00:02:08.539> more

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
no hopefully we can pull it off more

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.110 
no hopefully we can pull it off more
sometimes<00:02:09.560> they<00:02:09.739> say<00:02:09.979> running<00:02:10.250> second<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.060> a

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
sometimes they say running second is a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.309 
sometimes they say running second is a
little<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.540> better<00:02:11.630> because<00:02:11.780> you<00:02:11.989> can<00:02:12.110> see

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
little bit better because you can see

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.479 
little bit better because you can see
where<00:02:12.470> everybody<00:02:12.800> else<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.099> running<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.430> you

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
where everybody else is running do you

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.949 
where everybody else is running do you
think<00:02:13.670> he<00:02:13.760> had<00:02:13.880> an<00:02:13.970> advantage<00:02:14.090> running<00:02:14.630> second

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
think he had an advantage running second

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.960 
think he had an advantage running second
to<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.200> where<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.800> weren't<00:02:16.069> going<00:02:16.250> yeah<00:02:16.670> he

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
to see where you weren't going yeah he

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.210 
to see where you weren't going yeah he
was<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.300> where<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.510> didn't<00:02:17.930> go<00:02:18.050> ty<00:02:19.010> wish

there<00:02:19.400> was<00:02:19.520> lap<00:02:19.670> cars<00:02:19.970> but<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.780> know<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:22.069> is

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
there was lap cars but you know it is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.150 
there was lap cars but you know it is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
what it is and we'll take second now at

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.070 
what it is and we'll take second now at
the<00:02:25.280> last<00:02:25.489> lap<00:02:25.819> coming<00:02:26.569> after<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:26.870> got<00:02:26.989> the

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the last lap coming after you got the

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.930 
the last lap coming after you got the
white<00:02:27.200> you<00:02:27.380> went<00:02:27.560> down<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.920> bottom<00:02:28.069> block

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
white you went down to the bottom block

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
white you went down to the bottom block
or<00:02:29.300> just<00:02:29.330> you<00:02:29.540> saw<00:02:29.930> him<00:02:30.050> come<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.470> wanted

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
or just you saw him come in and wanted

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.740 
or just you saw him come in and wanted
to<00:02:30.739> try<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.160> line<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.580> knew<00:02:32.390> he<00:02:32.480> was<00:02:32.599> down

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
to try to that line I knew he was down

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.210 
to try to that line I knew he was down
there<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.319> figured<00:02:33.380> if<00:02:33.739> I<00:02:33.830> could<00:02:33.980> take<00:02:34.099> his

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
there so I figured if I could take his

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.220 
there so I figured if I could take his
line<00:02:34.370> line<00:02:34.940> away<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.239> know<00:02:35.480> maybe<00:02:36.110> you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
line line away you know maybe you

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.050 
line line away you know maybe you
wouldn't<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.470> able<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> get<00:02:36.739> past<00:02:36.950> me<00:02:37.129> but<00:02:37.160> he

wouldn't be able to get past me but he

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.160 
wouldn't be able to get past me but he
was<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.239> good<00:02:38.510> he<00:02:38.629> just<00:02:38.780> rolled<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.050> right

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
was just good he just rolled the right

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.300 
was just good he just rolled the right
rear<00:02:39.319> right<00:02:39.500> past<00:02:39.709> me<00:02:39.890> there<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.069> wanted<00:02:40.280> to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
rear right past me there and wanted to
