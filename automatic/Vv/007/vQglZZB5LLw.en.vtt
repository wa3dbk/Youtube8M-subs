okay<00:00:01.350> I'm<00:00:01.439> still<00:00:01.560> working<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:01.920> efficient<00:00:02.310> ways

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
okay I'm still working on efficient ways

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.910 
okay I'm still working on efficient ways
of<00:00:02.669> driving<00:00:02.850> LED<00:00:03.510> mains<00:00:03.810> bulbs<00:00:04.410> and<00:00:04.560> I<00:00:04.589> came<00:00:04.799> up

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
of driving LED mains bulbs and I came up

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.590 
of driving LED mains bulbs and I came up
with<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.130> serve<00:00:05.370> you<00:00:05.520> today<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.359> I'm<00:00:06.480> going

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
with this serve you today and I'm going

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.880 
with this serve you today and I'm going
to<00:00:06.660> call<00:00:06.810> it<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.990> pizza<00:00:07.200> actually<00:00:07.680> buzzer

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
to call it a pizza actually buzzer

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.919 
to call it a pizza actually buzzer
inverter<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.820> they're<00:00:09.420> calling<00:00:09.780> it<00:00:09.840> that

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
inverter and they're calling it that

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.509 
inverter and they're calling it that
because<00:00:09.990> it<00:00:10.349> uses<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.740> pizza<00:00:11.160> or<00:00:11.250> latching

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
because it uses a pizza or latching

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.520 
because it uses a pizza or latching
buzzer<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.300> is<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.690> these<00:00:12.780> things<00:00:13.139> here

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
buzzer which is one of these things here

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.970 
buzzer which is one of these things here
to<00:00:14.490> pulse<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.880> base<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.330> transistor<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.139> I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
to pulse the base of a transistor and I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.140 
to pulse the base of a transistor and I
think<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.279> got<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.460> built-in<00:00:17.760> oscillator

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
think it's got a built-in oscillator

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.970 
think it's got a built-in oscillator
circuit<00:00:18.570> inside<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.590> tailor-made

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
circuit inside that so it's tailor-made

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.529 
circuit inside that so it's tailor-made
for<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.369> application<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.090> using<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.510> for

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
for the application we're using it for

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
for the application we're using it for
and<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.590> works<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.310> great<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.970> then

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
and it works really great and then

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.000 
and it works really great and then
getting<00:00:24.539> fantastic<00:00:24.960> light<00:00:25.320> output<00:00:25.740> from<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
getting fantastic light output from this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.970 
getting fantastic light output from this

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
base three and five five transistor and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
base three and five five transistor and
this<00:00:45.149> is<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> mains<00:00:45.600> transformer<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.500> we<00:00:46.620> run

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this is a mains transformer which we run

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.619 
this is a mains transformer which we run
in<00:00:46.920> Reverse<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.850> high<00:00:48.000> voltage<00:00:48.420> across

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
in Reverse so we get high voltage across

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.959 
in Reverse so we get high voltage across
the<00:00:48.840> LED<00:00:49.200> bulb<00:00:49.440> here<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.399> that's<00:00:50.520> basically

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
the LED bulb here and that's basically

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.900 
the LED bulb here and that's basically
about<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.649> so<00:00:52.649> I'll<00:00:53.160> show<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> circuit

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
about it so I'll show you the circuit

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
one water mains rated LED bulb and

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.720 
one water mains rated LED bulb and
before<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> put<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> pizza<00:01:02.160> invert<00:01:02.550> I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
before I put it on the pizza invert I

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.280 
before I put it on the pizza invert I
need<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.000> find<00:01:03.180> out<00:01:03.329> how<00:01:03.510> bright<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> from

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
need to find out how bright it is from

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.100 
need to find out how bright it is from
the<00:01:04.409> mains<00:01:04.589> voltage<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.659> use<00:01:07.080> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the mains voltage and to do that I use a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.080 
the mains voltage and to do that I use a
little<00:01:07.409> homemade<00:01:07.770> light<00:01:08.040> meter<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:08.970> is

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
little homemade light meter as all it is

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.870 
little homemade light meter as all it is
is<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.360> LDR<00:01:09.689> light<00:01:10.200> dependent<00:01:10.680> resistor<00:01:11.220> taped

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
is an LDR light dependent resistor taped

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.820 
is an LDR light dependent resistor taped
to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.270> front<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> bulb<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
to the front of the bulb and that I

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.289 
to the front of the bulb and that I
measure<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.280> resistance<00:01:14.670> across<00:01:14.939> an<00:01:15.150> ohms

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
measure the resistance across an ohms

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.270 
measure the resistance across an ohms
meter<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.140> then<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.799> repeat<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
meter and then if I can repeat that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580 
meter and then if I can repeat that
herbs<00:01:17.970> reading<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> pizza<00:01:19.229> inverter

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
herbs reading with the pizza inverter

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.800 
herbs reading with the pizza inverter
and<00:01:20.009> then<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.610> mains<00:01:20.850> brightness<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.600> or

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
and then that mains brightness or or

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
and then that mains brightness or or
above<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.920> that's<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.159> I'll<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.729> I'll

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
above so that's what I'll do now so I'll

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.749 
above so that's what I'll do now so I'll
switch<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:26.060> it's<00:01:27.060> nice<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.509> bright<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
switch it on it's nice and bright and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.109 
switch it on it's nice and bright and
the<00:01:29.759> end<00:01:29.880> reading<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.750> 33<00:01:31.409> point<00:01:31.770> 4<00:01:32.040> ohms<00:01:32.340> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the end reading is 33 point 4 ohms so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.100 
the end reading is 33 point 4 ohms so
that's<00:01:33.540> our<00:01:33.720> control

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
that's our control

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.789 
that's our control
reading<00:01:34.860> so<00:01:35.220> well<00:01:35.509> 33.6<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.290> if<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.470> can<00:01:37.650> get

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
reading so well 33.6 so if I can get

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.260 
reading so well 33.6 so if I can get
back<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.130> reading<00:01:38.280> with<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.820> repeats<00:01:39.119> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
back to reading with the repeats of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.120 
back to reading with the repeats of
inverter<00:01:39.570> without<00:01:40.290> me<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.590> braveness

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.010 
inverter without me and braveness
so<00:01:41.759> I'll<00:01:42.030> move<00:01:42.210> everything<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so I'll move everything over to the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.219 
so I'll move everything over to the
Peter<00:01:43.259> inverter<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:44.810> ok<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.140> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
Peter inverter to know ok so this is the

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.870 
setup on the bench and what you see here
is<00:01:49.649> exactly<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.070> showed<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.520> circuit

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
is exactly how I showed on the circuit

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.460 
is exactly how I showed on the circuit
diagram<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.630> use<00:01:51.780> all<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> clock<00:01:52.200> reads

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
got the led from a bit of the base we've

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.420 
got the led from a bit of the base we've
got<00:02:18.720> an<00:02:18.840> amp<00:02:18.989> meter<00:02:19.080> and<00:02:19.769> then<00:02:20.069> our<00:02:20.190> light

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
got an amp meter and then our light

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.559 
got an amp meter and then our light
meter<00:02:20.819> here<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.870> bulb<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:23.000> I'll<00:02:24.000> switch<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.300> on

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
meter here the bulb so I'll switch it on

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.009 
meter here the bulb so I'll switch it on
now<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.860> adjust<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:29.670> pot<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.330> the

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
now and I just adjust this pot and the

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.039 
now and I just adjust this pot and the
light<00:02:31.200> will<00:02:31.410> come<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.540> that's<00:02:36.720> come<00:02:36.930> on

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
light will come on so that's come on

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.479 
light will come on so that's come on
then<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.260> already<00:02:37.680> looks<00:02:37.890> nice<00:02:38.099> and<00:02:38.310> bright

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
then that already looks nice and bright

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.890 
then that already looks nice and bright
and<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.480> only<00:02:39.629> drawing<00:02:39.810> 27<00:02:40.500> milliamps<00:02:41.900> but

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
and it's only drawing 27 milliamps but

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.809 
and it's only drawing 27 milliamps but
if<00:02:42.959> we<00:02:43.049> look<00:02:43.170> at<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.319> light<00:02:43.500> meter<00:02:44.040> reading<00:02:44.580> we

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
if we look at the light meter reading we

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.030 
if we look at the light meter reading we
know<00:02:44.970> when<00:02:45.120> their<00:02:45.299> mains<00:02:45.569> brightness<00:02:46.200> we've

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
know when their mains brightness we've

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.400 
know when their mains brightness we've
got<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.280> come<00:02:47.430> down<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.849> 33<00:02:48.329> point<00:02:48.599> 6<00:02:48.870> ohms<00:02:49.079> to

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
got to come down to 33 point 6 ohms to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.339 
got to come down to 33 point 6 ohms to
be<00:02:49.500> up<00:02:49.590> mains<00:02:49.829> brightness<00:02:50.459> so<00:02:51.180> it's<00:02:52.049> what<00:02:52.230> I'll

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
be up mains brightness so it's what I'll

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.440 
be up mains brightness so it's what I'll
do<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.590> I'll<00:02:52.709> slowly<00:02:52.980> increase<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.730> but

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
do is I'll slowly increase that but

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.089 
do is I'll slowly increase that but
there's<00:02:54.599> no<00:02:54.750> noise<00:02:55.019> at<00:02:55.290> all<00:02:55.410> coming<00:02:55.799> from<00:02:55.920> this

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
there's no noise at all coming from this

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.479 
there's no noise at all coming from this
and<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.930> put<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.290> hard<00:02:58.560> surface

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
and I put it on a hard surface

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.880 
and I put it on a hard surface
so<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.209> starts<00:03:00.540> vibrating<00:03:00.720> you'll<00:03:01.440> hear<00:03:01.739> it

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
so if it starts vibrating you'll hear it

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.830 
so if it starts vibrating you'll hear it
but<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.000> very<00:03:03.150> quiet

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
but it's very quiet

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.750 
but it's very quiet
so<00:03:04.530> I'll<00:03:04.769> just<00:03:04.950> adjust<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.640> potentiometer

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
so I'll just adjust the potentiometer

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:14.650 
so I'll just adjust the potentiometer
now<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.780> increase<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.319> light<00:03:07.470> output

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.000 

well<00:03:15.200> that's<00:03:15.380> up<00:03:15.590> 34<00:03:16.220> point<00:03:16.820> well<00:03:17.530> 35.6<00:03:18.530> that's

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
well that's up 34 point well 35.6 that's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.370 
well that's up 34 point well 35.6 that's
blazingly<00:03:19.670> right<00:03:19.970> now<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.990> i've<00:03:21.140> still<00:03:21.290> got

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
blazingly right now and i've still got

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.680 
blazingly right now and i've still got
plenty<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.920> go<00:03:22.040> on<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:22.250> pot<00:03:22.550> here<00:03:22.820> so<00:03:23.420> I'll

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
plenty to go on this pot here so I'll

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.940 
plenty to go on this pot here so I'll
just<00:03:23.810> increase<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.380> slightly<00:03:24.590> more<00:03:29.770> so<00:03:30.770> we're

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
just increase it slightly more so we're

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.420 
just increase it slightly more so we're
beyond<00:03:31.250> mains<00:03:31.610> brightness<00:03:32.210> now<00:03:33.070> thirty<00:03:34.070> three

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
beyond mains brightness now thirty three

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.640 
beyond mains brightness now thirty three
point<00:03:34.700> three<00:03:34.850> ohms<00:03:35.540> so<00:03:36.320> that's<00:03:36.500> actually

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
point three ohms so that's actually

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.520 
point three ohms so that's actually
brighter<00:03:37.130> than<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:37.490> mains<00:03:37.670> now<00:03:38.090> and<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
brighter than the mains now and the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.190 
brighter than the mains now and the
control<00:03:40.040> is<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.340> hundred<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.170> seventy<00:03:42.170> eight

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
control is a hundred and seventy eight

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:54.090 
control is a hundred and seventy eight
millions<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:44.630> there's<00:03:45.560> no<00:03:45.740> noise<00:03:46.010> from<00:03:46.910> this

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.530 

if<00:03:55.100> I<00:03:55.190> put<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.460> to<00:03:55.550> my<00:03:55.670> ear<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:56.060> can<00:03:56.270> hear<00:03:56.300> it

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
if I put it to my ear I can hear it

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.230 
if I put it to my ear I can hear it
buzzing<00:03:56.690> away<00:03:56.990> and<00:03:57.440> if<00:03:57.890> I<00:03:58.040> increase<00:03:58.400> the

00:03:59.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
buzzing away and if I increase the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.760 
buzzing away and if I increase the
potentiometer<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.050> its<00:04:00.200> full<00:04:00.440> capacity

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
potentiometer to its full capacity

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.690 
potentiometer to its full capacity
we<00:04:03.770> might<00:04:03.920> get<00:04:04.070> a<00:04:04.130> buzz<00:04:04.310> out<00:04:04.430> of<00:04:04.580> it

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.060 

now<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.820> started<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> buzz<00:04:11.360> now<00:04:11.680> if<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.800> lift<00:04:12.980> it

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
now it started to buzz now if I lift it

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.040 
now it started to buzz now if I lift it
up<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:14.360> can't<00:04:14.570> hear<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> thing

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
up you can't hear a thing

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:26.740 
up you can't hear a thing
the<00:04:15.609> there<00:04:16.609> we<00:04:16.670> go<00:04:19.480> it's<00:04:20.480> quiet<00:04:25.390> so<00:04:26.390> we're<00:04:26.540> over

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
the there we go it's quiet so we're over

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.500 
the there we go it's quiet so we're over
driving<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.290> bulb<00:04:27.560> now<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.160> that's<00:04:28.970> on<00:04:29.240> the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
driving this bulb now and that's on the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.480 
driving this bulb now and that's on the
8<00:04:29.870> volt<00:04:30.290> seeing<00:04:30.680> those<00:04:30.890> on<00:04:31.040> the<00:04:31.160> 6<00:04:31.340> volt

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
8 volt seeing those on the 6 volt

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:40.600 
8 volt seeing those on the 6 volt
setting<00:04:38.500> which<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.530> back<00:04:39.860> the<00:04:40.190> pot<00:04:40.400> off

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
setting which is back the pot off

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:48.730 
setting which is back the pot off
slightly<00:04:44.680> can<00:04:45.680> hardly<00:04:45.890> hear<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:48.560> it's

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
slightly can hardly hear it and it's

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.010 
slightly can hardly hear it and it's
still<00:04:48.950> over<00:04:49.820> driving<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.480> bulb<00:04:52.390> now<00:04:53.390> if<00:04:53.660> I<00:04:53.780> put

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
still over driving the bulb now if I put

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.650 
still over driving the bulb now if I put
my<00:04:54.169> wall<00:04:54.980> adapter<00:04:55.430> up<00:04:55.580> to<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.790> next<00:04:56.090> setting<00:04:56.300> I

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
my wall adapter up to the next setting I

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.370 
my wall adapter up to the next setting I
would<00:04:57.590> probably<00:04:57.770> blow<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.220> bulb<00:04:59.020> and<00:05:00.020> I've

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
would probably blow the bulb and I've

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.360 
would probably blow the bulb and I've
only<00:05:00.530> got<00:05:00.620> one<00:05:00.890> left

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
only got one left

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.150 
only got one left
I<00:05:01.930> did<00:05:02.930> have<00:05:03.050> this<00:05:03.169> one<00:05:03.410> but<00:05:03.590> I<00:05:03.620> dropped<00:05:03.830> it<00:05:04.070> and

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
I did have this one but I dropped it and

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.650 
I did have this one but I dropped it and
this<00:05:05.110> broke<00:05:06.760> well<00:05:07.760> say<00:05:07.970> yeah<00:05:08.210> this<00:05:08.480> light

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
this broke well say yeah this light

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.570 
this broke well say yeah this light
meters<00:05:09.020> made<00:05:09.230> it<00:05:09.380> really<00:05:09.530> easy<00:05:09.680> to<00:05:10.130> see<00:05:10.310> if<00:05:10.460> any

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
meters made it really easy to see if any

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.760 
meters made it really easy to see if any
change<00:05:10.880> to<00:05:11.030> may<00:05:11.150> to<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.360> circuit<00:05:11.840> improve

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
change to may to the circuit improve

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.460 
change to may to the circuit improve
things<00:05:13.010> and<00:05:13.479> I've<00:05:14.479> got<00:05:14.720> mains<00:05:14.960> brightness

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
things and I've got mains brightness

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.150 
things and I've got mains brightness
there<00:05:15.770> on<00:05:16.460> 8<00:05:17.180> and<00:05:17.360> a<00:05:17.390> half<00:05:17.450> volts<00:05:17.810> and<00:05:18.410> 192

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
there on 8 and a half volts and 192

there on 8 and a half volts and 192
milliamps<00:05:19.850> so<00:05:20.680> quite<00:05:21.680> pleased<00:05:21.950> with<00:05:22.130> this<00:05:22.220> and

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
milliamps so quite pleased with this and

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.719 
milliamps so quite pleased with this and
and<00:05:24.740> they<00:05:24.860> use<00:05:25.100> this<00:05:25.280> in<00:05:25.460> some<00:05:25.490> of<00:05:25.700> our

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
and they use this in some of our

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.100 
and they use this in some of our
oscillator<00:05:25.880> circuits<00:05:26.660> because<00:05:26.960> it's

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
oscillator circuits because it's

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.050 
oscillator circuits because it's
tailor-made<00:05:27.530> for<00:05:27.710> pulsing<00:05:28.190> transistor<00:05:28.640> bases

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
tailor-made for pulsing transistor bases

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.850 
tailor-made for pulsing transistor bases
you<00:05:29.750> might<00:05:29.900> be<00:05:30.050> able<00:05:30.140> to<00:05:30.229> do<00:05:30.350> something<00:05:30.590> with

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
you might be able to do something with

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.830 
you might be able to do something with
the<00:05:31.070> exciters<00:05:31.880> or<00:05:32.210> something<00:05:32.479> maybe<00:05:32.630> with

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
the exciters or something maybe with

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.980 
the exciters or something maybe with
that<00:05:32.990> as<00:05:33.110> well<00:05:33.370> but<00:05:34.390> that<00:05:35.390> was<00:05:35.540> the<00:05:35.630> phone<00:05:35.810> for

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
that as well but that was the phone for

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:39.640 
that as well but that was the phone for
today<00:05:36.430> but<00:05:37.430> I'd<00:05:38.030> say<00:05:38.210> this<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.419> the<00:05:38.570> best<00:05:39.470> few

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
today but I'd say this is the best few

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.110 
today but I'd say this is the best few
talks<00:05:39.830> I've<00:05:39.950> had<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.160> date<00:05:40.310> with<00:05:40.580> lighting

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120
