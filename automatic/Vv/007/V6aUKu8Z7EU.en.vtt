00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 video on this topic 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.030
 despite the fact that I'm not kidding if you are right 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.369
 too lazy to steam, then you can look into 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.670
 description of my saw the video and see 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.350
 there is a website where you can easily customize 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.390
 its scope that is there really 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 everything is very well done and will give you 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.729
 right away the team and everything will be cool cool 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.299
 cool 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.619
 it can be there for shit 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.290
 of course if you donâ€™t really want cfg 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.360
 someone really if you really want a cafe 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.790
 up to some famous player or even 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.490
 I have no problem putting it with you 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 no one will be for this but guys and that 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.960
 not the fact that with this CPG you will play 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.159
 like the player you took him from 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.220
 so tune and end to yourself and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.380
 be good if everything is from the first 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.110
 it turned out bad then just don't give up 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 I changed my sight myself his mother 14 times to 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.360
 find my ideal and i'm sure i 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.219
 Yet will I now have a few words down 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 ksg 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.530
 It seems to me that it is like this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.450
 do not do at all at first if 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.069
 You are silver and you started for example yes 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.080
 shanti cola will never play given 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.120
 Kalasha so just to merge the game 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.319
 your teammates and you should be 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.870
 ashamed of it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.209
 and also there are so-called smurves 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.700
 who just play the titles below 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.209
 his and this is very ugly he to me 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.519
 it seems 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.450
 naturally you will play much 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:31.579
 better but what a pleasure to play 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.579
 okay i have all the guys 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.500
 white
