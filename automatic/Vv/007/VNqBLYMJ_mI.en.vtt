00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:28.640 
two weapons with life leech so this is a

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:30.580 
two weapons with life leech so this is a
build<00:07:28.940> for<00:07:29.030> you<00:07:29.450> I<00:07:29.660> hope<00:07:30.080> you<00:07:30.260> got<00:07:30.380> the<00:07:30.440> idea

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320 
the idea of telling high enough damage

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.260 
the idea of telling high enough damage
and<00:07:33.530> surviving<00:07:34.310> solely<00:07:34.640> because<00:07:34.940> of<00:07:35.090> the

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.270 
and surviving solely because of the

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.720 
and surviving solely because of the
amount<00:07:35.480> of<00:07:35.720> damage<00:07:36.050> you<00:07:36.080> deal<00:07:36.410> so<00:07:37.340> give<00:07:37.520> it<00:07:37.550> to

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:37.730 
amount of damage you deal so give it to

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.400 
amount of damage you deal so give it to
go<00:07:37.910> see<00:07:38.510> if<00:07:38.570> you<00:07:38.660> can<00:07:38.810> survive<00:07:39.170> on<00:07:39.230> your

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:39.410 
go see if you can survive on your

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.620 
go see if you can survive on your
current<00:07:39.890> monster<00:07:40.220> power<00:07:40.430> and<00:07:40.760> then<00:07:41.210> ramp<00:07:41.480> it

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:41.630 
current monster power and then ramp it

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.110 
current monster power and then ramp it
up<00:07:41.810> to<00:07:42.260> a<00:07:42.290> level<00:07:42.530> or<00:07:42.740> two<00:07:42.800> above<00:07:42.980> it<00:07:43.490> see<00:07:44.060> if

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 
up to a level or two above it see if

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.180 
up to a level or two above it see if
you're<00:07:44.300> still<00:07:44.480> doing<00:07:44.660> well<00:07:44.960> because<00:07:45.530> your<00:07:45.770> dps

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190 
you're still doing well because your dps

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:47.590 
you're still doing well because your dps
is<00:07:46.370> going<00:07:46.520> to<00:07:46.580> be<00:07:46.670> a<00:07:46.700> lot<00:07:46.880> higher<00:07:47.060> than<00:07:47.120> it<00:07:47.450> is
