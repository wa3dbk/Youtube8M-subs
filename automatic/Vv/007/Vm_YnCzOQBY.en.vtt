obviously and you know we've come back
from<00:00:09.269> South<00:00:09.660> Africa<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.830> few<00:00:11.130> weeks<00:00:11.280> ago

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
from South Africa and a few weeks ago

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.110 
from South Africa and a few weeks ago
and<00:00:12.740> you<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.860> reflecting<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.849> too<00:00:15.089> i

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
and you know reflecting on that too i

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.849 
and you know reflecting on that too i
think<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.599> was<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.960> very<00:00:16.109> good<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.500> her<00:00:16.619> first

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
think it was a very good to her first

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.070 
think it was a very good to her first
and<00:00:17.130> I'm<00:00:17.520> disappointing<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.150> way<00:00:18.270> we<00:00:18.480> we

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
and I'm disappointing the way we we

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.560 
and I'm disappointing the way we we
finished<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> tour<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.100> overall<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.119> think<00:00:21.270> it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
finished the tour but overall I think it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.140 
finished the tour but overall I think it
was<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.590> know<00:00:22.650> an<00:00:23.070> important<00:00:23.670> kind<00:00:23.939> of

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
was a you know an important kind of

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
was a you know an important kind of
stepping<00:00:24.689> stone<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.279> want<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
stepping stone and to what we want to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
stepping stone and to what we want to
achieve<00:00:26.670> in<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.090> future<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.890> we<00:00:28.890> played

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
achieve in the future and we played

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.070 
achieve in the future and we played
against<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> very<00:00:29.609> good<00:00:29.699> side<00:00:30.029> there<00:00:30.240> and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
against a very good side there and

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
against a very good side there and
obviously<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> one<00:00:32.520> day<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.820> out<00:00:33.030> there

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
obviously one the one day is out there

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.440 
obviously one the one day is out there
try<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> draw<00:00:34.649> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> test<00:00:35.040> matches<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.670> we

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
try to draw on the test matches when we

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.150 
try to draw on the test matches when we
paired<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.809> good<00:00:36.989> cricket<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.649> want<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
paired some good cricket so we want to

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.010 
paired some good cricket so we want to
continue<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.910> want<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> keep

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
continue with that I want to keep

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
continue with that I want to keep
winning<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:41.399> much<00:00:41.550> as<00:00:41.610> possible<00:00:41.879> and

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
winning and as much as possible and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.420 
winning and as much as possible and
obviously<00:00:42.420> Bangladesh<00:00:43.280> hopefully<00:00:44.280> give<00:00:44.399> us

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
obviously Bangladesh hopefully give us

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.369 
obviously Bangladesh hopefully give us
that<00:00:44.700> opportunity<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:48.320> listen<00:00:49.320> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
that opportunity to do that listen I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.459 
that opportunity to do that listen I
think<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.710> referral<00:00:50.160> system<00:00:50.520> works<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:51.149> me<00:00:51.480> on

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
think the referral system works on me on

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.020 
think the referral system works on me on
the<00:00:52.620> real<00:00:52.800> shockers<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.640> real<00:00:53.789> bad

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
the real shockers on the real bad

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
the real shockers on the real bad
decisions<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> think<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:56.430> we're<00:00:56.760> all

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
decisions I think and if we're all

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.369 
decisions I think and if we're all
honest<00:00:57.180> week<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.690> you're<00:00:57.870> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.050> use<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
honest week if you're going to use the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
honest week if you're going to use the
referral<00:00:58.800> system<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> better<00:00:59.430> you've<00:01:00.300> got<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
referral system you better you've got to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.759 
referral system you better you've got to
have<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.309> full<00:01:02.309> technology<00:01:03.000> there<00:01:03.650> what<00:01:04.650> I'm

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
have the full technology there what I'm

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
have the full technology there what I'm
talking<00:01:05.070> about<00:01:05.100> has<00:01:05.369> left<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> hot<00:01:05.909> spot

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
talking about has left the hot spot

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.710 
talking about has left the hot spot
technology<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.130> snicker<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.119> because

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
technology and snicker and because

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.520 
technology and snicker and because
obviously<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.740> gone<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:12.530> human

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
obviously you just gone back to human

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
obviously you just gone back to human
error<00:01:13.740> again<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.820> got<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> third<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> phone

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
error again if you got a third on phone

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.530 
error again if you got a third on phone
they<00:01:15.900> haven't<00:01:16.170> got<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> technology<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
they haven't got the technology so and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.810 
they haven't got the technology so and
its<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.750> defeating<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> object<00:01:19.619> of

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
its really defeating the object of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.330 
its really defeating the object of
taking<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.619> decision<00:01:23.070> back

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
taking it and you know the decision back

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
taking it and you know the decision back
to<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> third<00:01:25.229> umpire<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:27.150> forgot<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
to the third umpire so it forgot the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.999 
to the third umpire so it forgot the
technology<00:01:28.140> there<00:01:28.290> we've<00:01:28.500> certainly<00:01:28.680> got<00:01:28.860> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
technology there we've certainly got to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.770 
technology there we've certainly got to
use<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.220> but<00:01:29.430> as<00:01:29.759> long<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:29.939> we've<00:01:30.150> got<00:01:30.180> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
use it but as long as we've got the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.920 
use it but as long as we've got the
whole<00:01:31.159> spectrum<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.750> appliances<00:01:33.750> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
whole spectrum of appliances of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.230 
whole spectrum of appliances of
phenomena

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.270 

the<00:01:38.240> way<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.990> schedules<00:01:39.530> are<00:01:39.770> these<00:01:40.010> diz

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
the way that the schedules are these diz

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.880 
the way that the schedules are these diz
and<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:41.720> know<00:01:41.810> it's<00:01:41.990> pretty<00:01:42.290> much<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.500> streamer

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
and you know it's pretty much a streamer

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.770 
and you know it's pretty much a streamer
football<00:01:43.250> manager<00:01:43.700> because<00:01:44.510> that's<00:01:44.660> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
football manager because that's the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.020 
football manager because that's the
equivalent<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.320> really<00:01:45.920> happen<00:01:46.160> football

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
equivalent to really happen football

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.080 
equivalent to really happen football
manager<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:48.830> monitor<00:01:49.370> football<00:01:49.670> team<00:01:49.880> for

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
manager to to monitor football team for

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.969 
manager to to monitor football team for
12<00:01:50.330> months<00:01:50.479> off<00:01:51.050> the<00:01:51.229> top<00:01:51.440> without<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.680> brick

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
12 months off the top without a brick

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.950 
12 months off the top without a brick
and<00:01:52.220> you<00:01:52.610> can<00:01:52.729> do<00:01:52.880> it<00:01:53.000> year<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.240> year<00:01:53.479> out<00:01:53.540> so

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
and you can do it year in year out so

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.200 
and you can do it year in year out so
you<00:01:54.530> know<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:55.040> is<00:01:55.070> very<00:01:55.490> stressful<00:01:55.850> and

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
you know it is very stressful and

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.830 
you know it is very stressful and
obviously<00:01:57.170> hundreds<00:01:57.619> made<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.040> decision<00:01:58.460> to

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
obviously hundreds made the decision to

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.330 
obviously hundreds made the decision to
have<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.960> break<00:02:00.200> they<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.440> think<00:02:00.770> with<00:02:01.310> a

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
have the break they I think with a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.359 
have the break they I think with a
cricket<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.790> we've<00:02:01.970> got<00:02:02.119> coming<00:02:02.360> up<00:02:03.369> later

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
cricket that we've got coming up later

to do it is a very difficult place or
two<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.989> you<00:02:27.380> obviously<00:02:27.470> haven't<00:02:27.890> got<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
two and you obviously haven't got the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.430 
two and you obviously haven't got the
full<00:02:29.030> luxury<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.690> have<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.989> other

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
full luxury that you have in other

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.280 
full luxury that you have in other
countries<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.270> it's<00:02:32.270> also<00:02:32.450> very<00:02:32.750> exciting

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
countries but it's also very exciting

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.620 
countries but it's also very exciting
it's<00:02:33.890> one<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.130> them<00:02:34.250> too<00:02:34.459> is<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.760> tends<00:02:35.480> to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
it's one of them too is that tends to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.850 
it's one of them too is that tends to
bring<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:35.930> team<00:02:36.140> closer<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.680> closer

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
together because of the I guess their

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.880 
together because of the I guess their
conditions<00:02:39.620> out<00:02:39.800> there<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:40.840> so<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.500> I'm

seen the team a few years ago into the
team<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.940> we've<00:03:38.090> got<00:03:38.299> now<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.810> you<00:03:39.319> know

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
team that we've got now and you know

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.350 
team that we've got now and you know
there's<00:03:39.950> a<00:03:40.010> huge<00:03:40.250> difference<00:03:40.489> is<00:03:40.879> used<00:03:41.120> and

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
there's a huge difference is used and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.149 
there's a huge difference is used and
they've<00:03:41.900> got<00:03:41.930> a<00:03:42.049> lot<00:03:42.140> of<00:03:42.200> class<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.739> quality

00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 
they've got a lot of class and quality

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.490 
they've got a lot of class and quality
in<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.640> side<00:03:43.879> now<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.269> don't<00:03:45.230> think<00:03:45.409> the

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
in the side now I don't think the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.140 
in the side now I don't think the
confidence<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.129> running<00:03:46.459> too<00:03:46.640> high<00:03:46.879> at<00:03:47.060> the

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
confidence is running too high at the

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.250 
confidence is running too high at the
moment<00:03:47.180> that's<00:03:47.480> probably<00:03:47.780> why<00:03:47.930> they're<00:03:48.110> not

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
moment that's probably why they're not

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.330 
moment that's probably why they're not
getting<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.500> results<00:03:48.620> but<00:03:49.010> I'm<00:03:49.129> sure<00:03:49.310> we'll

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
getting the results but I'm sure we'll
