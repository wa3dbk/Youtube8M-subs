so what I'm doing is I am making a
battery<00:00:54.000> hold-down<00:00:54.320> you<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.039> got<00:00:56.430> an<00:00:56.520> extra

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
battery hold-down you see I got an extra

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.080 
battery hold-down you see I got an extra
hole<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.770> was<00:00:58.770> gonna<00:00:58.890> put<00:01:00.440> four<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:02.090> four

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
hole there I was gonna put four of four

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.870 
hole there I was gonna put four of four
of<00:01:03.270> these<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:04.199> two<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.710> right<00:01:05.580> next<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
each other you know like that you know

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.940 
each other you know like that you know
and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.580> then<00:01:08.729> run<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.680> run<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
and then and then run it to run it to

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.170 
and then and then run it to run it to
one<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.960> back<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.140> an<00:01:13.229> angle<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.030> can

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
one of these back to an angle so I can

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.249 
one of these back to an angle so I can
drill<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> hole<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.580> you<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.700> into<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
drill a hole in it you know into that a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.690 
drill a hole in it you know into that a
drill<00:01:19.560> hole<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.520> just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
drill hole in but now I'm going to just

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.289 
drill hole in but now I'm going to just
do<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.720> one<00:01:22.619> half<00:01:22.830> inch<00:01:23.070> strip<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.610> then

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
do the one one half inch strip and then

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.160 
do the one one half inch strip and then
put<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:24.900> angle<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.509> you<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.630> to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
put it to an angle you know you know to

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.859 
put it to an angle you know you know to
an<00:01:28.259> angle<00:01:28.560> there<00:01:29.659> and<00:01:30.659> then<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.799> way<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.610> will

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
an angle there and then that way it will

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
an angle there and then that way it will
this<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:34.049> already<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.880> there<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:41.369> fits<00:01:41.610> it<00:01:41.909> fits

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
really well I need to get my angle what

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.700 
really well I need to get my angle what
do<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.579> mangle<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:52.290> wasn't<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
do they do with mangle that wasn't the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.030

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
this thin angle and drill a hole in it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.510 
this thin angle and drill a hole in it
see<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.850> can<00:02:08.940> see<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.270> yeah<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.950> and

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
the servo arm sit silver well that's a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.240 
the servo arm sit silver well that's a
washer<00:03:04.920> that's<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.489> number<00:03:05.700> six<00:03:06.030> will<00:03:06.239> offer

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
washer that's in number six will offer

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.900 
washer that's in number six will offer
her<00:03:08.250> number<00:03:08.550> eight<00:03:08.730> number<00:03:08.880> six<00:03:09.269> washer<00:03:10.910> that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
her number eight number six washer that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:18.590 
her number eight number six washer that
this<00:03:12.750> was<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.260> loose<00:03:15.019> on<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.440> servo<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:17.600> it

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
this was so loose on the servo that it

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.650 
this was so loose on the servo that it
would<00:03:18.810> just<00:03:18.959> mean<00:03:19.709> we're<00:03:19.830> talking<00:03:20.660> eighth

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
would just mean we're talking eighth

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.800 
would just mean we're talking eighth
inch<00:03:22.370> he<00:03:23.370> would<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.640> flop<00:03:24.060> around<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.600> there

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
inch he would just flop around on there

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.479 
inch he would just flop around on there
I<00:03:24.840> really<00:03:25.320> wasn't<00:03:25.470> happy<00:03:25.860> with<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.160> mean<00:03:26.370> I

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I really wasn't happy with that I mean I

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.970 
I really wasn't happy with that I mean I
paid<00:03:26.670> $400<00:03:27.330> for<00:03:27.360> something<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.860> know

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
paid $400 for something and you know

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.620 
paid $400 for something and you know
this<00:03:29.130> one<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.549> one<00:03:29.730> came<00:03:29.910> with<00:03:30.060> the<00:03:30.120> tqi

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
this one this one came with the tqi

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.390 
this one this one came with the tqi
system<00:03:31.080> so<00:03:31.230> I<00:03:31.290> suppose<00:03:31.530> they<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:31.980> think<00:03:32.130> they

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
system so I suppose they I think they

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.770 
system so I suppose they I think they
could<00:03:32.580> charge<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.910> little<00:03:33.030> more<00:03:33.150> whatever

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
could charge a little more whatever

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.039 
could charge a little more whatever
letters<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:38.180> what<00:03:39.180> else<00:03:39.360> was<00:03:39.600> there

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
letters but what else was there

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:46.070 
letters but what else was there

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
oh not real happy with the the looseness

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
finished to get a couple body washers in

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.850 
finished to get a couple body washers in
there<00:04:10.610> taking<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.060> some<00:04:11.240> of<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.450> space<00:04:11.800> so<00:04:12.800> it

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
there taking up some of the space so it

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:25.910 
there taking up some of the space so it
doesn't<00:04:13.100> flop

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.180
