shadow<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:14.430> am<00:02:15.430> speculated<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:18.269> my<00:02:19.269> reasons

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
shadow I am speculated that my reasons

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.720 
shadow I am speculated that my reasons
to<00:02:19.959> look<00:02:20.800> like<00:02:21.280> a<00:02:22.319> wooden<00:02:23.319> speculated<00:02:24.190> I<00:02:24.370> guess

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
to look like a wooden speculated I guess

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.210 
to look like a wooden speculated I guess
the<00:02:25.420> only<00:02:25.600> thing<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.930> speculated<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.560> be<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.980> far

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
the only thing I speculated to be so far

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.270 
the only thing I speculated to be so far
is<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.790> lamp<00:02:28.360> post<00:02:28.540> type<00:02:29.200> thing<00:02:29.560> which<00:02:30.130> would

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
is a lamp post type thing which would

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.210 
is a lamp post type thing which would
provide<00:02:30.610> light<00:02:30.940> when<00:02:31.269> it's<00:02:31.450> nighttime

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
provide light when it's nighttime

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.720 
provide light when it's nighttime
however<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.850> probably<00:02:34.180> isn't<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.690> because

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
however it probably isn't that because

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.270 
however it probably isn't that because
it's<00:02:36.730> not<00:02:37.060> on<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.450> path<00:02:37.690> area<00:02:38.200> so<00:02:39.100> it'd<00:02:39.250> be

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
it's not on the path area so it'd be

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.770 
it's not on the path area so it'd be
pretty<00:02:39.730> pointless<00:02:42.269> although<00:02:43.269> then<00:02:43.510> if<00:02:43.660> they

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
pretty pointless although then if they

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.479 
pretty pointless although then if they
tried<00:02:43.959> to<00:02:43.989> make<00:02:44.110> the<00:02:44.350> thing<00:02:44.530> look<00:02:44.799> realistic

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
tried to make the thing look realistic

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.880 
tried to make the thing look realistic
then<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.540> guess<00:02:46.840> a<00:02:46.870> professor<00:02:47.440> might<00:02:47.650> have<00:02:47.860> a

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
then I guess a professor might have a

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.180 
then I guess a professor might have a
lamppost<00:02:48.459> next<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.970> his<00:02:49.329> building<00:02:50.190> awesome

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
lamppost next to his building awesome

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.250 
lamppost next to his building awesome
we'd<00:02:51.400> reason

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.920 

also<00:02:58.260> if<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.159> look<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.760> the<00:03:00.090> top<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
also if you look on the top of the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.600 
also if you look on the top of the
buildings<00:03:01.349> the<00:03:02.040> house<00:03:02.280> high<00:03:02.849> buildings<00:03:03.360> is

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
buildings the house high buildings is

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.320 
buildings the house high buildings is
what<00:03:05.610> appears<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.269> be<00:03:06.299> a<00:03:06.750> fish<00:03:07.440> type<00:03:07.739> pokémon

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
what appears to be a fish type pokémon

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.339 
what appears to be a fish type pokémon
now<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.569> don't<00:03:09.629> recognize<00:03:10.500> its<00:03:10.739> Pokemon<00:03:12.349> it

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
easy to notice to decipher I guess the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.069 
easy to notice to decipher I guess the
word<00:03:21.299> would<00:03:21.330> be<00:03:21.799> like<00:03:22.799> if<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.819> came<00:03:24.239> open<00:03:24.420> in

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
screen from left to right now I don't

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:10.910 
screen from left to right now I don't
think<00:04:09.840> this<00:04:09.990> little<00:04:10.140> effect<00:04:10.680> gameplay

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
think this little effect gameplay

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.940 
think this little effect gameplay
anywhere<00:04:12.710> unless<00:04:13.710> it<00:04:14.060> gives<00:04:15.500> some<00:04:16.500> pokémon<00:04:16.769> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
anywhere unless it gives some pokémon a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.050 
anywhere unless it gives some pokémon a
slight<00:04:17.250> boost<00:04:17.870> depending<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.019> what<00:04:20.060> element

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
slight boost depending on what element

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.570 
slight boost depending on what element
type<00:04:21.420> they<00:04:21.630> are<00:04:21.950> example<00:04:22.950> if<00:04:23.070> you're<00:04:23.220> in<00:04:23.280> water

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
type they are example if you're in water

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.940 
type they are example if you're in water
then<00:04:24.120> maybe<00:04:24.780> water<00:04:25.080> pokémon<00:04:25.350> will<00:04:25.770> get<00:04:25.920> a

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
then maybe water pokémon will get a

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.210 
then maybe water pokémon will get a
slight<00:04:26.190> boost<00:04:26.430> da<00:04:27.140> wins<00:04:28.140> then<00:04:31.070> throttle<00:04:32.070> win

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
slight boost da wins then throttle win

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.990 
slight boost da wins then throttle win
Pokemon<00:04:33.650> well<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.920> water<00:04:35.130> wind<00:04:35.400> pokemon
