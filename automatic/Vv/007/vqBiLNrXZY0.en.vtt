00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
think it's like Korean s first they're

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.690 
think it's like Korean s first they're
just<00:02:53.260> really<00:02:53.830> hard<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.310> they'll<00:02:54.490> kill

everybody<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.300> little<00:02:55.450> bit<00:02:55.570> so<00:02:56.230> I<00:02:56.500> think<00:02:56.620> it's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
everybody a little bit so I think it's

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.520
