stand I created him from I just saw him
I've<00:00:24.170> never<00:00:24.410> actually<00:00:24.590> seen<00:00:24.740> the<00:00:25.010> movie<00:00:25.280> but

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
I've never actually seen the movie but

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.150

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
here's magneto from that movie I think

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.650 
here's magneto from that movie I think
I'm<00:00:28.670> pretty<00:00:28.910> sure<00:00:29.060> those<00:00:29.240> movie<00:00:29.510> I've<00:00:29.630> seen

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
I'm pretty sure those movie I've seen

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.770 
stuff sorry about the cake there's
pretty<00:00:40.640> much<00:00:40.700> no<00:00:40.940> way<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.180> get<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.420> cape<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:42.399> you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
pretty much no way to get a cape and you

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.139 
pretty much no way to get a cape and you
he's<00:00:44.780> got<00:00:44.989> all<00:00:45.140> magneto<00:00:45.559> powers<00:00:46.010> this<00:00:46.969> is<00:00:47.120> a

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
he's got all magneto powers this is a

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.610 
he's got all magneto powers this is a
little<00:00:47.450> weird<00:00:47.630> because<00:00:47.870> it<00:00:48.170> doesn't<00:00:48.440> show<00:00:48.590> the

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
little weird because it doesn't show the

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.500 
little weird because it doesn't show the
stuff<00:00:48.950> inside<00:00:49.100> it<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.090> there's<00:00:50.270> just<00:00:50.420> a

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
stuff inside it and so there's just a

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.270 
stuff inside it and so there's just a
big<00:00:50.660> ball<00:00:51.790> but<00:00:52.790> um<00:00:53.000> he's<00:00:53.390> got<00:00:53.570> all<00:00:53.750> the<00:00:53.930> normal

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
big ball but um he's got all the normal

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.930 
big ball but um he's got all the normal
andito<00:00:55.280> powers<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.030> stuff<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:58.070> if<00:00:58.399> you're<00:00:58.550> if

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
andito powers and stuff so if you're if

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.299 
andito powers and stuff so if you're if
you<00:00:59.210> like<00:00:59.510> this<00:00:59.690> character<00:01:00.079> and<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:00.890> want<00:01:01.160> to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
get him I will just quickly show you the

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.040 
get him I will just quickly show you the
code<00:01:05.649> and<00:01:06.820> here's<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.940> code<00:01:08.149> just<00:01:08.630> type<00:01:08.840> in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
code and here's the code just type in

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.830 
code and here's the code just type in
those<00:01:09.380> letters<00:01:09.649> into<00:01:10.399> the<00:01:10.759> code<00:01:11.119> area<00:01:11.569> which

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
those letters into the code area which

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.820 
those letters into the code area which
is<00:01:11.990> this<00:01:12.560> one<00:01:12.800> right<00:01:12.860> here<00:01:13.039> but<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:13.940> is<00:01:13.970> um

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
is this one right here but it is um

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.650 
is this one right here but it is um
capital<00:01:15.830> lower<00:01:16.100> case<00:01:16.340> sensitive<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:17.420> have

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:17.660 
capital lower case sensitive so you have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.960 
capital lower case sensitive so you have
to<00:01:17.810> be<00:01:18.140> careful<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:18.890> those<00:01:19.100> capital<00:01:19.759> or

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
to be careful with those capital or

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.960 
to be careful with those capital or
lowercase<00:01:20.000> letters<00:01:20.720> because<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:21.740> do<00:01:22.250> they

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
lowercase letters because they do they

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.210 
lowercase letters because they do they
are<00:01:23.000> important<00:01:23.599> so<00:01:24.259> that's<00:01:24.830> him<00:01:26.740> that<00:01:27.740> is<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
are important so that's him that is the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.640 
are important so that's him that is the
last<00:01:28.550> standing<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.450> do

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.300 

next<00:01:34.650> we<00:01:34.800> have<00:01:35.100> um<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.470> dark<00:01:37.740> phoenix<00:01:38.010> i

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
next we have um this is dark phoenix i

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.980 
next we have um this is dark phoenix i
think<00:01:38.550> from<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.970> same<00:01:39.270> movie<00:01:39.630> i'm<00:01:39.720> pretty

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
think from the same movie i'm pretty

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.770 
think from the same movie i'm pretty
sure<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.580> she<00:01:41.580> sort<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.030> looks<00:01:42.120> like<00:01:42.240> phoenix

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
sure and she sort of looks like phoenix

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.510 
sure and she sort of looks like phoenix
basically<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:44.220> um<00:01:44.520> kind<00:01:45.330> of<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.810> rugged

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
basically with um kind of this rugged

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.720 
basically with um kind of this rugged
look<00:01:47.520> with<00:01:47.880> black<00:01:48.480> shirt<00:01:49.230> on<00:01:49.410> i<00:01:49.650> just<00:01:50.400> saw<00:01:50.670> a

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
look with black shirt on i just saw a

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.040 
look with black shirt on i just saw a
picture<00:01:50.910> of<00:01:51.060> her<00:01:51.150> and<00:01:51.300> I<00:01:51.570> thought<00:01:51.690> she<00:01:51.750> looked

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
picture of her and I thought she looked

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.320 
picture of her and I thought she looked
cool<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.500> I'm<00:01:53.220> guessing<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.820> our<00:01:53.940> Kleenex

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
cool so I'm guessing this is our Kleenex

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.720 
cool so I'm guessing this is our Kleenex
that<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.200> dark<00:01:55.410> phoenix<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.980> she<00:01:56.400> cannot

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
that was dark phoenix and she cannot

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.810 
that was dark phoenix and she cannot
find<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.330> sorry<00:01:57.690> it's<00:01:57.990> really<00:01:58.710> hard<00:01:58.980> Gator<00:01:59.640> to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
find I'm sorry it's really hard Gator to

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.060 
find I'm sorry it's really hard Gator to
use<00:01:59.940> like<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.750> Phoenix<00:02:01.230> Fire<00:02:01.440> powers<00:02:01.830> because

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
use like the Phoenix Fire powers because

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.680 
use like the Phoenix Fire powers because
it's<00:02:02.190> not<00:02:02.280> possible<00:02:03.740> what<00:02:04.740> she<00:02:04.890> does<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.460> fire
