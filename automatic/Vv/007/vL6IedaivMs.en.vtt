commander I don't know when to playing
it<00:00:27.289> every<00:00:28.070> anytime<00:00:28.609> you<00:00:28.789> can<00:00:28.880> take<00:00:29.119> extra

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
it every anytime you can take extra

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.810 
it every anytime you can take extra
turns<00:00:29.869> and<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:30.590> really<00:00:30.740> upsets<00:00:31.220> people<00:00:31.279> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
turns and that really upsets people and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.049 
turns and that really upsets people and
it's<00:00:32.449> a<00:00:32.599> mythic<00:00:33.129> to<00:00:34.129> obviously<00:00:34.580> a<00:00:34.670> legendary

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
it's a mythic to obviously a legendary

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.820 
it's a mythic to obviously a legendary
creature<00:00:35.300> for<00:00:35.570> commander<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.230> it's<00:00:36.320> a<00:00:36.379> mythic

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
creature for commander but it's a mythic

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.539 
creature for commander but it's a mythic
it<00:00:37.220> is<00:00:38.320> whenever<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:39.559> do<00:00:39.739> is<00:00:39.860> damage<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:40.519> take

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:40.549 
it is whenever you do is damage you take

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:43.240 
it is whenever you do is damage you take
an<00:00:40.850> extra<00:00:41.120> turn<00:00:41.390> so<00:00:42.199> it's<00:00:42.620> gotta<00:00:42.799> be<00:00:42.860> combat

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
an extra turn so it's gotta be combat

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.670 
an extra turn so it's gotta be combat
damage<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:43.790> overall<00:00:44.449> a<00:00:44.479> very<00:00:44.690> interesting

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
damage so overall a very interesting

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.060 
damage so overall a very interesting
speculation<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.640> my<00:00:46.729> opinion<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:48.530> is<00:00:48.589> also<00:00:49.040> a

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
speculation in my opinion this is also a

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.119 
speculation in my opinion this is also a
card<00:00:49.370> I'm<00:00:49.519> ordering<00:00:49.909> a<00:00:50.089> lot<00:00:50.299> of<00:00:50.540> ass<00:00:50.890> zealot<00:00:51.890> I
