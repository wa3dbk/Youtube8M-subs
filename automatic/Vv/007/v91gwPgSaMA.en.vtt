 possible to make pokÃ©mon games 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:34.910

 sapphire is a huge figure but it is not 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.580
 so crazy if we think 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:53.180
 which is one of the most anticipated by the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.890
 fans is also considered that the third 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.329
 generation is the best of the whole saga 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.090
 as they say 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.480

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.090

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.610
