On 17th of March, the young Bulgarian pianist
Evgeny Genchev performed in the hall of our embassy in London.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.700
Born in Plovdiv, he graduated from the National Music School "Dobrin Petkov" and the Royal Academy of Music in London.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.700
"I saw the piano when I was 8 years old and said: "this is what I want!", so it all started.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.329
...with time I became more aware of the difficulties
and competitiveness it brings.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.320
My parents are not musicians and to an extent
the lifestyle I have is something they cannot

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.500
fully relate to... at some point they were
also concerned of me not to over-practice"

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.530
We also asked him what does he thinks of the
social networks:

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.770
"Unfortunately, this is something necessary...
I use it as much as its important having some internet presence."

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.759
I enjoy going to the gym as this also keeps

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.759
me away from injuries and problems with the
posture. I love reading and socializing with my friends

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:30.329
and people I find interesting."
Only 23 of age, Evgeny Genchev already has

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.600
concert appearances on several continents.
"This year I will perform at the City of London Festival.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.450
Also in June I have got 4 concerts
in Bulgaria, for which I am really happy,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.450
as it is always good to have a reason to visit
home. These include 2 solo concerts and 2

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.490
duo concerts with cellist Atanas Krastev for
Sofia Music Weeks and Chamber Music Festival,

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.490
Plovdiv - one of the oldest festivals."
"...I am also going to play in Gdansk, Poland.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.990
It is going to be with Baltic Symphony Orchestra conducted by Massimiliano Caldi."

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.990
He is defined by the critics as one of the brightest phenomena recently, not only within the confines of Europe,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.069
and they predict him thriving future. We wish him success!
