00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 all beaver dear friends with you wendy 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.730
 I recently talked about game theorists 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.670
 suggested that the main character 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.710
 this bite victim 87 after this is not 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.080
 explained scientifically why 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.330
 it cannot be after that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.789
 said that scott should have been held 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.039
 a little more time exploring the question of 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.800
 which he makes the game and this theory 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 scott himself broke kavton under this video in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.949
 comments 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.109
 it was a good mate video poet I always 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.060
 I enjoy them but unfortunately as 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.260
 many of your more intelligent viewers already 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 written in the comments 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.239
 you missed one very important detail in 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 the game, we confirm that the victim does not bite 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.969
 might feel fear and 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.950
 respectively, see nightmares 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.840
 and she would not be able to manifest such 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 concentration level as we see in the game 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.579
 and here we finally come to a conclusion 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 After all, maybe we do not play at all for 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 bite victim but we play for his 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.230
 older brother who feels guilty for 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.910
 the actions that he committed himself in the game 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.070
 there are many details that sheds 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.500
 light on this concept and also make it 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 very likely to begin perhaps with 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.430
 game descriptions there it says that you 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.369
 play for some child judging by 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.650
 mini-games brother from 13 to 16 years 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 but rather somewhere 13 14 because not 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.180
 believe that a 16 year old guy will do 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.130
 such crap even have 16 summer and have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.869
 it’s like it’s considered a child here 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.420
 everything fits the room in which you 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.280
 play specifically different from the room 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.560
 which we see in mini-games 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.659
 Firstly the room in the game opens at 2 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.340
 the halls on the left and on the right each one 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.009
 missing in mini games 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.920
 also the room in the game does not lead us to the hall 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 in which are huge hefty 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.920
 clock 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.409
 but additionally many details of these 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.299
 two rooms do not match in the same room 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.649
 checkered floor while in another 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.149
 no also 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.240
 toys which is in the room 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.790
 different and of course different furniture 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 is in these rooms really 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.840
 we have never seen that mini-games 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.520
 room in which we are in the game but 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.950
 also we have never seen the room on the left 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 from the place where we live as we know 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.040
 older brother regrets the actions 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.170
 which he committed 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.659
 and he apologizes to the bitten right 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.060
 before he dies as we see in 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.250
 game after 6 nights 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.380
 it also explains the appearance of colors 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.840
 tablets and of course the dropper in his 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.090
 nightmares near his bed these items 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.160
 very clearly alluding to us in the hospital 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.560
 victim's elder brother completely 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.170
 absorbed in his guilt now sees 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.530
 animatronics like scary horrible and 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.630
 horrible versions of themselves because of guilt 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.790
 who feels his brother he sees 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.190
 animatronics much more scary and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.769
 deadly because it was he and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.580
 masked friends were the main reason 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.209
 deaths 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.790
 his little brother bitten are in 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.010
 coma and his older brother come to him 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 to the hospital that's why he sees u 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.010
 yourself in nightmares hospital 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.040
 accessories 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.470
 all because of his guilt is one of the biggest 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.319
 Facts can be found in the trailer phrase that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.450
 you brought home many thought it was 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.760
 somehow connected to plushtrap and evil 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.140
 which brought home but new information 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.840
 allows us to assume that it is 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.430
 Metaphor means brother brought 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.760
 home he brought home 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.579
 guilt and injury he brought home death 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.650
 his younger brother sadness overwhelms 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.260
 older and because of this he sees 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.630
 hallucinations about the demons that he made 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.579
 and animatronics who are and in 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.590
 his dreams and attack him 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.650
 and he experiences it from night to night but 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.060
 for him they are much more real than 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.609
 common hallucinations 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.180
 phrase what game do you think you play 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.850
 also 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.850
 addressed to the elder brother who 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.980
 throughout all the mini games loved 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.950
 play with your brother in some kind of full 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.959
 the version is hiding everything for him was no more 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.840
 than a regular game until exactly 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:52.200
 until his younger brother turned up 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.970
 bitten inside fredber as well as this 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.519
 can explain who such a nightmare 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.430
 animatronic whom we see a nightmare this 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.700
 the embodiment of all fears and regrets for 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.010
 what exactly did he bite and fredber 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.650
 was the main personification of what 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.079
 the eldest committed with younger fredber 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.819
 comes for him in nightmares of course he 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.989
 transparent and internal 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.600
 visible frontal lobe of the brain that confirms 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.150
 what sconce 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.910
 seeing in nightmare nightmares feeling guilty 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.340
 for a bitten off frontal lobe which is now 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.200
 and stayed in the french door well, and that's it 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.460
 Dear friends, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.460
 bye bye bye good luck
