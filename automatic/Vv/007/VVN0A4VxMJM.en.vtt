if<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:01.199> don't<00:00:01.469> have<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:02.129> good<00:00:02.879> connector<00:00:03.540> cable

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:04.069 
if you don't have a good connector cable

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.360 
if you don't have a good connector cable
you<00:00:05.069> have<00:00:06.170> an<00:00:07.170> alternative<00:00:07.830> although<00:00:08.220> this

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
you have an alternative although this

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.379 
you have an alternative although this
one<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.610> a<00:00:08.760> little<00:00:08.910> harder<00:00:09.059> so<00:00:11.150> rather<00:00:12.150> than

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
one is a little harder so rather than

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.930 
one is a little harder so rather than
having<00:00:12.719> all<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.259> nice<00:00:13.469> solder<00:00:14.429> points<00:00:14.730> from

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
having all the nice solder points from

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.930 
having all the nice solder points from
that<00:00:15.619> connector<00:00:16.619> cable<00:00:16.980> we're<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> have

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
that connector cable we're going to have

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.980 
that connector cable we're going to have
to<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.150> work<00:00:18.420> directly<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
to actually work directly on the

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
to actually work directly on the
motherboard<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> equivalent<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.990> led<00:00:22.470> a

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
motherboard so the equivalent of led a

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
motherboard so the equivalent of led a
two<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.220> led<00:00:23.609> Oh<00:00:23.640> two<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.750> motherboard<00:00:25.050> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
two and led Oh two on the motherboard is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.689 
two and led Oh two on the motherboard is
actually<00:00:25.710> right<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:26.640> led<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> two<00:00:27.800> led<00:00:28.800> c2

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
actually right here so led a two led c2

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
actually right here so led a two led c2
and<00:00:29.970> again<00:00:30.720> all<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:30.960> would<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.500> is

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
and again all you would have to do is

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.630 
and again all you would have to do is
connect<00:00:31.980> these<00:00:32.130> two<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> for<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.500> Speaker<00:00:37.950> we

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
connect these two and for the Speaker we

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.410 
connect these two and for the Speaker we
have<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.870> speaker<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:41.300> where's<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
have the right speaker and where's the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.160 
have the right speaker and where's the
left<00:00:42.600> speaker<00:00:44.030> yes<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.360> left<00:00:45.570> speaker<00:00:45.809> which

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
left speaker yes the left speaker which

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:54.200 
left speaker yes the left speaker which
is<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:49.340> okay<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.660> that's<00:00:53.210> basically

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
is right there okay and that's basically

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.959 
is right there okay and that's basically
for<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.570> red<00:00:54.960> wires<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.620> speakers<00:00:56.100> now

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
for the red wires of our speakers now

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.639 
for the red wires of our speakers now
where<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.329> connect<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.989> ground<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.559> our

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
where we connect the ground for our

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.830 
where we connect the ground for our
speaker<00:00:58.920> it's<00:00:59.309> not<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.879> any<00:01:00.120> ground<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.660> fact

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
speaker it's not just any ground in fact

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.260 
speaker it's not just any ground in fact
if<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.059> randomly

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
if you do use this and you just randomly

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
if you do use this and you just randomly
connect<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> black<00:01:04.260> wire<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.769> ground<00:01:05.010> wire

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
connect the black wire the ground wire

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.609 
connect the black wire the ground wire
of<00:01:05.430> their<00:01:05.580> speakers<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:06.720> ground<00:01:06.990> some<00:01:07.229> ground

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of their speakers to ground some ground

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
of their speakers to ground some ground
point<00:01:07.920> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> motherboard<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:09.450> actually

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
point on the motherboard you're actually

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
point on the motherboard you're actually
going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:09.990> burn<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.380> your<00:01:10.950> speaker's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
going to burn out your speaker's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to burn out your speaker's
eventually<00:01:11.939> because<00:01:12.500> that's<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.619> direct

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
eventually because that's a direct

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.090 
eventually because that's a direct
connection<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:15.259> power<00:01:16.259> management<00:01:16.619> unit

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
connection to the power management unit

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.460 
connection to the power management unit
and<00:01:17.220> your<00:01:17.880> speaker's<00:01:18.299> actually<00:01:18.689> act<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and your speaker's actually act as a

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.840 
and your speaker's actually act as a
resistor<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> basically<00:01:22.560> just

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
resistor and you know you basically just

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.570 
resistor and you know you basically just
burn<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.570> speaker's<00:01:24.990> over<00:01:25.229> time

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
burn out your your speaker's over time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.010 
burn out your your speaker's over time
so<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.299> need<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.840> need<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so what you need to do is you need to

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.370 
so what you need to do is you need to
properly<00:01:28.470> hook<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:30.000> ground<00:01:30.270> wire<00:01:30.960> for<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
properly hook up the ground wire for the

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.330 
properly hook up the ground wire for the
speakers<00:01:31.880> okay<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.820> point<00:01:35.820> right<00:01:36.750> there

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
speakers okay to this point right there

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.440 
speakers okay to this point right there
so<00:01:38.340> let's<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.570> focus<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.140> zoom<00:01:40.200> in

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
so let's see if I can focus and zoom in

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.870 
so let's see if I can focus and zoom in
okay<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.869> underneath<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.680> upper<00:01:44.009> LCD

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
okay so underneath the upper LCD

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
okay so underneath the upper LCD
connector<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.979> these<00:01:47.659> through-hole<00:01:48.659> points

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
connector are these through-hole points

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
connector are these through-hole points
or<00:01:49.560> hold<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> drill<00:01:50.759> holes<00:01:50.939> here<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.619> here's

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
or hold on drill holes here so here's

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.399 
or hold on drill holes here so here's
the<00:01:52.770> let<00:01:53.700> scene<00:01:53.939> here's<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> first<00:01:54.930> one<00:01:55.200> it's

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the let scene here's the first one it's

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.670 
the let scene here's the first one it's
right<00:01:55.619> by<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.829> 44<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.840> immediate<00:01:58.200> next

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
right by the 44 and the immediate next

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.870 
right by the 44 and the immediate next
one<00:01:58.920> over<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.520> ground<00:02:01.670> these<00:02:02.670> are

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
one over is the ground these are

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.230 
one over is the ground these are
actually<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.329> speaker<00:02:04.250> connectors<00:02:05.250> -<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.880> but

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
actually the speaker connectors - so but

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
actually the speaker connectors - so but
you<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.020> see<00:02:07.170> they're<00:02:07.380> very<00:02:07.409> very

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
you as you can see they're very very

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.380 
you as you can see they're very very
tiny<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.550> don't<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> work<00:02:09.060> with<00:02:09.239> them

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
tiny so we don't want to work with them

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.180 
tiny so we don't want to work with them
they're<00:02:09.989> also<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> other<00:02:10.619> side

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
they're also on the other side

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.660 
they're also on the other side
of<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:13.090> motherboard<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:15.130> there<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.460> also

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
of the motherboard so that there is also

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.370 
of the motherboard so that there is also
ground<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:17.140> problem<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:20.080> can't

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
ground the problem is that you can't

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.340 
ground the problem is that you can't
connect<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.010> wires<00:02:21.310> here<00:02:21.820> because<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:23.260> know

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
connect the wires here because you know

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.370 
connect the wires here because you know
the<00:02:23.560> casing<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.130> sits<00:02:24.850> right<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.660> it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the casing is sits right here and it

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.520 
the casing is sits right here and it
gives<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.920> support<00:02:27.430> to<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:28.090> trigger<00:02:28.360> sorry<00:02:29.230> I

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
gives a support to the trigger sorry I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.240 
gives a support to the trigger sorry I
realize<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.670> was<00:02:30.790> out<00:02:30.880> of<00:02:30.910> focus<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.440> this

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
realize I was out of focus so this

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.910 
realize I was out of focus so this
trigger<00:02:33.550> button<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:34.270> actually<00:02:34.930> rests

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
trigger button here actually rests

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.800 
trigger button here actually rests
against<00:02:36.400> part<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.730> plastic<00:02:37.210> casing<00:02:37.450> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
against part of the plastic casing and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.440 
against part of the plastic casing and
so<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.070> there's<00:02:39.310> no<00:02:39.370> clearance<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.270> use

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
so you know there's no clearance to use

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
so you know there's no clearance to use
these<00:02:40.660> solder<00:02:40.930> points<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.130> you'd<00:02:42.280> have

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
these solder points so what you'd have

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.650 
these solder points so what you'd have
to<00:02:42.460> do<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.820> you'd<00:02:42.970> have<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.210> actually<00:02:43.270> run<00:02:43.600> a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
to do is you'd have to actually run a

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.130 
to do is you'd have to actually run a
wire<00:02:43.900> out<00:02:44.140> through<00:02:44.410> here<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.860> here<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
wire out through here up here and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.310 
wire out through here up here and
clearly<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:48.100> trigger<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:49.420> I<00:02:49.690> think<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
clearly the trigger and I think is the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.840 
clearly the trigger and I think is the
left<00:02:50.620> trigger<00:02:50.740> maybe<00:02:51.190> I<00:02:51.310> might<00:02:51.490> have<00:02:51.520> said<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
left trigger maybe I might have said the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.370 
left trigger maybe I might have said the
right<00:02:51.940> trigger<00:02:52.180> but<00:02:52.510> anyways<00:02:53.050> one<00:02:53.230> of<00:02:53.320> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
right trigger but anyways one of the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.900 
right trigger but anyways one of the
trigger<00:02:53.590> buttons<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.430> have<00:02:54.550> to<00:02:54.640> run<00:02:54.790> it

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
trigger buttons so you have to run it

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.910 
trigger buttons so you have to run it
out<00:02:55.030> out<00:02:55.540> through<00:02:55.930> here<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.320> then<00:02:56.500> up<00:02:56.680> through

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
out out through here and then up through

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.430 
out out through here and then up through
here<00:02:57.250> and<00:02:57.400> then<00:02:57.570> finally<00:02:58.570> once<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:58.930> flip<00:02:59.110> you

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
here and then finally once you flip you

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.590 
here and then finally once you flip you
know<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.680> over<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.700> wire<00:03:01.180> will<00:03:01.360> have<00:03:01.510> to

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
know this over the wire will have to

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500 
know this over the wire will have to
come<00:03:01.840> up<00:03:01.870> through<00:03:02.170> here<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:03.210> this<00:03:04.210> is<00:03:04.390> where

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
come up through here and this is where

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.970 
come up through here and this is where
your<00:03:04.630> battery<00:03:04.810> sits<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:05.500> you're<00:03:05.620> going<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.800> run

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
your battery sits so you're going to run

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.550 
your battery sits so you're going to run
that<00:03:06.070> wire<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.700> way<00:03:06.790> out<00:03:06.880> here<00:03:06.910> as<00:03:07.360> well

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
that wire all the way out here as well

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.230 
that wire all the way out here as well
so<00:03:08.560> that's<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:09.010> pain<00:03:09.220> in<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.430> butt

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.300 

but<00:03:13.240> that's<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:14.050> alternative<00:03:14.830> if<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.100> don't

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
but that's the alternative if you don't

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.270 
but that's the alternative if you don't
have<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.700> nice<00:03:16.000> wire
