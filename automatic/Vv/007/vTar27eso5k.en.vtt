earthquake<00:05:15.879> because<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.150> can<00:05:16.330> get<00:05:16.449> hit<00:05:16.629> by

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
earthquake because I can get hit by

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.320 
earthquake because I can get hit by
flying<00:05:16.960> type<00:05:17.199> Pokemon<00:05:17.620> and<00:05:17.860> we<00:05:18.370> also<00:05:18.520> really

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
flying type Pokemon and we also really

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.240 
flying type Pokemon and we also really
the<00:05:19.449> only<00:05:19.659> powerful<00:05:20.379> move<00:05:20.650> we<00:05:20.800> have<00:05:20.949> by<00:05:21.099> that

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
the only powerful move we have by that

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.879 
the only powerful move we have by that
point<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.639> gyro<00:05:21.909> ball<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.599> only<00:05:22.719> has<00:05:22.960> 8<00:05:23.199> PP<00:05:23.590> so

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
point is gyro ball it only has 8 PP so

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:25.740 
point is gyro ball it only has 8 PP so
if<00:05:24.189> we'd<00:05:24.580> go<00:05:24.699> through<00:05:24.879> this<00:05:24.939> whole<00:05:25.150> setup<00:05:25.449> and

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
if we'd go through this whole setup and

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.390 
if we'd go through this whole setup and
we<00:05:25.810> only<00:05:25.990> burn<00:05:26.319> all<00:05:26.560> of<00:05:26.680> our<00:05:26.770> PP<00:05:27.009> trying<00:05:27.310> to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
we only burn all of our PP trying to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.550 
we only burn all of our PP trying to
knock<00:05:27.550> out<00:05:27.699> one<00:05:27.879> or<00:05:27.969> two<00:05:28.000> Pokemon<00:05:28.560> everything

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
just kind of falls apart

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.399 
just kind of falls apart
other<00:05:31.029> than<00:05:31.150> that<00:05:31.300> bullet<00:05:31.779> punch<00:05:31.960> might<00:05:32.289> be

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
other than that bullet punch might be

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.740 
other than that bullet punch might be
your<00:05:32.500> best<00:05:32.589> option<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.190> has<00:05:33.219> low<00:05:33.490> power<00:05:33.750> which

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
your best option it has low power which

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.600 
your best option it has low power which
means<00:05:34.960> like<00:05:35.139> we<00:05:35.259> we<00:05:35.560> could<00:05:35.830> maybe<00:05:36.069> find<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.460> use

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
means like we we could maybe find a use

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.029 
means like we we could maybe find a use
for<00:05:36.819> technician<00:05:37.330> like<00:05:37.779> we<00:05:37.870> just<00:05:38.050> spam<00:05:38.710> bullet

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
punch you know we have 48 PP on that if

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.719 
punch you know we have 48 PP on that if
we're<00:05:40.900> at<00:05:41.020> max<00:05:41.259> bulk<00:05:41.589> up<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:41.979> our<00:05:42.339> attack<00:05:42.580> is

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
we're at max bulk up and our attack is

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.040 
we're at max bulk up and our attack is
looking<00:05:42.969> pretty<00:05:43.089> good<00:05:43.210> maybe<00:05:43.509> we'll<00:05:43.779> be<00:05:43.900> able

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
looking pretty good maybe we'll be able

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.629 
looking pretty good maybe we'll be able
to<00:05:44.110> whittle<00:05:44.259> them<00:05:44.440> down<00:05:44.740> then<00:05:45.279> you<00:05:45.400> can<00:05:45.550> get

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
to whittle them down then you can get

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.790 
to whittle them down then you can get
out<00:05:45.699> stalled<00:05:46.150> so<00:05:46.719> really<00:05:47.110> him<00:05:47.259> on<00:05:47.409> top<00:05:47.589> doesn't

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
out stalled so really him on top doesn't

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.950 
out stalled so really him on top doesn't
have<00:05:48.069> a<00:05:48.099> lot<00:05:48.430> of<00:05:48.460> reliable<00:05:49.060> follow-up<00:05:49.539> options

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
if it does get set up and that's just

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.629 
if it does get set up and that's just
kind<00:05:52.690> of<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.839> problem<00:05:53.169> unfortunately<00:05:53.490> so<00:05:54.490> if<00:05:54.550> we

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
kind of a problem unfortunately so if we

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:55.950 
kind of a problem unfortunately so if we
look<00:05:54.789> at<00:05:54.879> some<00:05:55.029> other<00:05:55.180> things<00:05:55.389> seismic<00:05:55.810> tell
