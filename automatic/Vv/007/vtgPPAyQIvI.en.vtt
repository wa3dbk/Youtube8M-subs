to start with you've got lots of score
lines<00:03:01.060> which<00:03:01.239> something<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.870> see<00:03:03.000> I'm

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
lines which something can you see I'm

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.400 
lines which something can you see I'm
not<00:03:04.150> sure<00:03:04.330> but<00:03:04.480> there's<00:03:04.630> an<00:03:04.750> arrow<00:03:04.989> engine

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
not sure but there's an arrow engine

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.870 
not sure but there's an arrow engine
then<00:03:05.530> there's<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.739> widens<00:03:06.190> to<00:03:06.280> start<00:03:06.610> with<00:03:06.760> an

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
then there's a widens to start with an

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.289 
then there's a widens to start with an
arrow<00:03:07.000> end<00:03:08.280> because<00:03:09.280> that's<00:03:09.459> gonna<00:03:09.610> best<00:03:09.970> part

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
arrow end because that's gonna best part

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.420 
arrow end because that's gonna best part
and<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:13.320> fold<00:03:14.320> them<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.799> opposite<00:03:15.250> directions

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
and now fold them in opposite directions

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.570 
and now fold them in opposite directions
just<00:03:16.299> keep<00:03:16.480> going<00:03:16.750> opposite<00:03:17.519> so<00:03:18.519> it's

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
just keep going opposite so it's

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.009 
just keep going opposite so it's
backwards<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.150> forwards<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.570> backwards<00:03:19.750> and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.020 

there<00:03:50.210> we<00:03:50.300> go<00:03:50.480> so<00:03:50.750> we'll<00:03:51.320> all<00:03:51.580> fold<00:03:52.580> up<00:03:52.790> quite

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
there we go so we'll all fold up quite

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.950 
there we go so we'll all fold up quite
happily<00:03:53.360> quite<00:03:53.660> nicely<00:03:54.160> like<00:03:55.160> that<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:56.810> you'll

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
happily quite nicely like that so you'll

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.590 
happily quite nicely like that so you'll
end<00:03:57.110> up<00:03:57.230> with<00:03:57.410> that<00:03:57.620> sort<00:03:57.890> of<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.040> shape<00:03:58.540> okay<00:03:59.540> so

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
end up with that sort of a shape okay so

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.300 
end up with that sort of a shape okay so
we<00:03:59.840> want<00:03:59.990> to<00:04:00.050> put<00:04:00.170> some<00:04:00.290> adhesive<00:04:00.410> on<00:04:00.770> in<00:04:01.010> two

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
we want to put some adhesive on in two

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.000 
we want to put some adhesive on in two
places<00:04:01.720> only<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:02.900> that's<00:04:03.080> those<00:04:03.320> two<00:04:03.620> parts

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
places only so that's those two parts

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.920 
places only so that's those two parts
there<00:04:04.220> I'm<00:04:04.850> going<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.120> use<00:04:05.240> my<00:04:05.420> fuse<00:04:05.720> because

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
there I'm going to use my fuse because

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.040 
there I'm going to use my fuse because
it's<00:04:06.200> quick<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:07.820> I<00:04:07.910> love<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.360> you<00:04:08.810> know<00:04:08.900> I've

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
mastered the flick technique falls into

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.990 
mastered the flick technique falls into
the<00:04:15.980> concertina<00:04:16.459> and<00:04:17.590> that<00:04:18.590> one<00:04:18.830> also<00:04:19.250> folds

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
the concertina and that one also folds

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.360 
the concertina and that one also folds
to<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.600> concertina<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:21.860> you're<00:04:22.010> left<00:04:22.220> with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
to the concertina and you're left with

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.670 
to the concertina and you're left with
that<00:04:22.700> shape<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.570> that's<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.230> freestanding

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
that shape and that's the freestanding

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.820 
that shape and that's the freestanding
part<00:04:25.130> so<00:04:25.490> a<00:04:25.790> little<00:04:26.240> bit<00:04:26.450> of<00:04:26.600> trimming<00:04:27.260> my

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
part so a little bit of trimming my

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.480 
part so a little bit of trimming my
corner<00:04:28.220> rounder<00:04:29.650> just<00:04:30.650> around<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.040> top<00:04:31.250> edges

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
corner rounder just around the top edges

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.600 
corner rounder just around the top edges
air<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:35.080> then<00:04:36.080> I've<00:04:36.530> also<00:04:36.740> matched<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.430> down
