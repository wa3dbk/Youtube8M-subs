when<00:05:01.889> it<00:05:02.010> gets<00:05:02.220> down<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.699> 60s<00:05:03.240> and<00:05:03.389> 50s

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
when it gets down to the 60s and 50s

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.960 
when it gets down to the 60s and 50s
you're<00:05:04.289> gonna<00:05:04.470> think<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:04.889> freezing<00:05:05.789> outside

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970

and so it can even jump down when I got
there<00:05:08.639> I<00:05:08.699> think<00:05:08.789> it<00:05:09.000> dropped<00:05:09.210> down<00:05:09.300> to<00:05:09.570> the
