what's really like this helicopter is

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.049 
what's really like this helicopter is
compared<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.920> something<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.250> simul<00:00:14.549> 107

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
compared to something like the simul 107

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.160 
compared to something like the simul 107
which<00:00:15.389> flies<00:00:15.690> fantastic<00:00:16.940> or<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.720> mini<00:00:18.930> wolf

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
which flies fantastic or the mini wolf

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.050 
which flies fantastic or the mini wolf
which<00:00:19.650> also<00:00:19.890> flies<00:00:20.250> really<00:00:20.550> good<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:20.970> if

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
which also flies really good and if

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.779 
which also flies really good and if
you're<00:00:21.180> kind<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> tired<00:00:21.949> of<00:00:22.949> models<00:00:23.460> like<00:00:23.609> this

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
you're kind of tired of models like this

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.179 
you're kind of tired of models like this
and<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.060> fly<00:00:24.420> them<00:00:24.660> well<00:00:24.900> but<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:25.980> kind

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and you can fly them well but you kind

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.160 
and you can fly them well but you kind
of<00:00:26.250> intimidated<00:00:26.939> about<00:00:27.029> getting<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.539> larger

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of intimidated about getting a larger

helicopter<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.730> probably<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> really

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
helicopter this is probably a really

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.130 
helicopter this is probably a really
good<00:00:30.269> idea<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:32.149> am<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.270> slightly<00:00:33.660> above<00:00:33.780> a

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
good idea I am just slightly above a

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.459 
good idea I am just slightly above a
novice<00:00:34.530> flyer<00:00:34.829> myself<00:00:35.450> and<00:00:36.450> I'm<00:00:37.170> interested

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
novice flyer myself and I'm interested

novice flyer myself and I'm interested
in<00:00:37.860> setting<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.309> out<00:00:41.059> I've<00:00:42.059> been<00:00:42.210> flying

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
in setting it out I've been flying

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.779 
in setting it out I've been flying
planes<00:00:42.750> for<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> long<00:00:43.170> time<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.710> i<00:00:44.280> do<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.430> see

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
planes for a long time and i do not see

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.610 
planes for a long time and i do not see
well<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.300> days<00:00:45.539> being<00:00:45.840> older<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.230> not<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
well these days being older and not to

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.529

let's hit charge now and I'm assuming

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.870 
let's hit charge now and I'm assuming
that<00:02:43.490> well<00:02:43.700> there<00:02:43.880> we<00:02:44.000> go<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.400> change<00:02:46.790> the

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
red I'll let that change back to green

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.580 
red I'll let that change back to green
let<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.180> charge<00:02:57.490> under<00:02:58.490> the<00:02:58.790> protective<00:02:59.120> foam

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
flying it I won't try to fly it any

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.150 
flying it I won't try to fly it any
farther<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:54.080> will<00:03:54.290> just<00:03:54.320> put<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.769> battery

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
farther that will just put the battery

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.270 
farther that will just put the battery
and<00:03:55.310> deep<00:03:56.030> discharge<00:03:56.300> and<00:03:56.720> damage<00:03:57.050> it<00:03:57.230> so<00:03:57.980> when

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
and deep discharge and damage it so when

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.040 
and deep discharge and damage it so when
it's<00:03:58.400> pretty<00:03:58.610> much<00:03:58.700> done<00:03:58.760> flying<00:03:59.330> I<00:03:59.630> will<00:03:59.930> let

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.050

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
about a half an hour and then i'll

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.300 
about a half an hour and then i'll
charge<00:04:05.269> it<00:04:05.480> because<00:04:06.380> recharging<00:04:07.070> it<00:04:07.160> and

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310

flying and reach while you're flying

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.470 
flying and reach while you're flying
time<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.799> time<00:04:10.040> like<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:10.310> right<00:04:10.640> away<00:04:10.940> it's

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
time at a time like that right away it's

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:12.880 
time at a time like that right away it's
not<00:04:11.570> really<00:04:11.720> good<00:04:11.989> for<00:04:12.019> it<00:04:12.260> need<00:04:12.530> let<00:04:12.650> it<00:04:12.739> cool

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
not really good for it need let it cool

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.130 
not really good for it need let it cool
down<00:04:12.950> proper<00:04:13.940> maintenance<00:04:14.120> is<00:04:14.570> really<00:04:14.959> good

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
down proper maintenance is really good

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.719 
down proper maintenance is really good
and<00:04:15.350> it<00:04:15.440> makes<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.739> battery<00:04:16.040> lasts<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.459> lot

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
and it makes the battery lasts a lot

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.390 
and it makes the battery lasts a lot
longer<00:04:16.790> I<00:04:17.390> just<00:04:18.380> want<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.620> hover<00:04:18.799> for<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.160> couple
