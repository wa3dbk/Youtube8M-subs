I'm not as high on it as it's me
Morpheus<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.840> think<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.440> probably<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
Morpheus I think this is probably the

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.650 
Morpheus I think this is probably the
second<00:00:12.389> best<00:00:12.690> case<00:00:13.790> it's<00:00:14.790> certainly<00:00:15.360> better

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
second best case it's certainly better

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.290 
second best case it's certainly better
than<00:00:15.809> or<00:00:16.440> equal<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.190> slider<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.940> some<00:00:18.150> ways

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
than or equal to the slider in some ways

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.010 
than or equal to the slider in some ways
it's<00:00:18.480> better<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> some<00:00:19.020> ways<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:20.250> worse

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
it's better in some ways it's it's worse

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.349 
it's better in some ways it's it's worse
but<00:00:22.020> let<00:00:22.439> me<00:00:22.470> just<00:00:22.529> give<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.830> my<00:00:22.859> opinion<00:00:23.359> one

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
but let me just give you my opinion one

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.410 
but let me just give you my opinion one
thing<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:25.439> material<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:26.130> semi<00:00:26.460> semi<00:00:27.240> hard

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
thing is this material is semi semi hard

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.470 
thing is this material is semi semi hard
it's<00:00:27.689> not<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> it's<00:00:28.109> not<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.410> rubber<00:00:28.680> like<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
it's not a it's not a rubber like this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.580 
it's not a it's not a rubber like this
and<00:00:30.480> therefore<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.170> couple<00:00:31.470> issues

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
and therefore there's a couple issues

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.049 
and therefore there's a couple issues
with<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.610> covers<00:00:35.610> on<00:00:35.820> your

a little difficult to push down the
button<00:01:38.580> you<00:01:38.939> can't<00:01:39.149> just<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.450> straight<00:01:39.750> down

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
button you can't just put straight down

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.359 
button you can't just put straight down
you're<00:01:40.110> pushing<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.500> plastic<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.310> of

and<00:01:44.069> the<00:01:44.729> other<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.569> the

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
and the other thing is because of the

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.359 
and the other thing is because of the
hardness<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> plastic<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.979> don't<00:01:47.130> feel

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
hardness of the plastic you don't feel

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.669 
hardness of the plastic you don't feel
that<00:01:47.520> button<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.090> going<00:01:48.360> up<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.899> down<00:01:48.990> you

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
that button really going up and down you

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:51.230 
that button really going up and down you
feel<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.310> bit<00:01:50.520> more<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> rockers

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
feel it a little bit more in the rockers

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240 
feel it a little bit more in the rockers
but<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.569> really<00:01:51.840> lose<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.350> tactile<00:01:52.830> feel

with<00:01:53.520> this<00:01:53.640> case<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.209> little<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.080> bothersome

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
with this case a little bit bothersome

robert cause it's harder they didn't do
a<00:01:59.280> great<00:01:59.520> job<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.149> edges<00:02:00.569> and<00:02:00.750> when<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.080> hold

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
a great job on the edges and when I hold

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
a great job on the edges and when I hold
this<00:02:01.440> case<00:02:01.679> my<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> usually<00:02:02.819> keep<00:02:02.940> a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
this case my you know I usually keep a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.389 
this case my you know I usually keep a
finger<00:02:03.330> on<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> bottom<00:02:03.959> I<00:02:04.110> feel<00:02:04.740> those<00:02:04.920> edges

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
finger on the bottom I feel those edges

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.190 
finger on the bottom I feel those edges
I<00:02:05.640> feel<00:02:06.209> those<00:02:06.390> edges<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.110> they're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I feel those edges here and they're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.309 
I feel those edges here and they're
sharp<00:02:07.500> enough<00:02:07.679> to<00:02:07.920> bother<00:02:08.729> me<00:02:09.049> also<00:02:10.049> the<00:02:10.140> case

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
sharp enough to bother me also the case

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.809 
sharp enough to bother me also the case
is<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.830> bulkier<00:02:11.250> than<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.519> incase

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
is a little bit bulkier than the incase

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.090 
is a little bit bulkier than the incase
slider<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.690> my<00:02:12.930> favorite<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.500> like<00:02:13.680> things<00:02:13.980> a

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
slider not my favorite I like things a

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.670 
slider not my favorite I like things a
little<00:02:14.220> bit<00:02:14.340> thinner<00:02:14.609> but<00:02:15.480> not<00:02:15.840> noticeably<00:02:16.380> so

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
little bit thinner but not noticeably so

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.410 
little bit thinner but not noticeably so
you<00:02:17.670> can<00:02:17.820> see<00:02:18.000> if<00:02:18.120> I<00:02:18.180> put<00:02:18.359> them<00:02:18.510> side<00:02:18.750> by<00:02:18.780> side

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you can see if I put them side by side

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.880 
you can see if I put them side by side
that<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.750> case<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.200> little<00:02:22.470> bit<00:02:22.590> thicker

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that this case is a little bit thicker

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.849 
that this case is a little bit thicker
or<00:02:23.810> wider<00:02:24.810> depending<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.380> look<00:02:25.500> at<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.709> and

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
or wider depending on you look at it and

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:32.150 
or wider depending on you look at it and
it's<00:02:26.190> also<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.459> little<00:02:26.670> bit<00:02:26.790> thicker<00:02:27.170> so<00:02:31.160> this

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
it's also a little bit thicker so this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.830 
it's also a little bit thicker so this
one<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.489> by<00:02:32.700> far<00:02:32.910> thinner<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.480> think<00:02:33.660> gives

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
one is by far thinner and I think gives

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
one is by far thinner and I think gives
just<00:02:34.380> it's<00:02:34.769> by<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.130> way<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.370> gives<00:02:35.640> great

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
just it's by the way this gives great

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.849 
just it's by the way this gives great
drop<00:02:36.359> support<00:02:36.660> I'd<00:02:36.870> have<00:02:37.019> no<00:02:37.200> problem<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.709> my

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
drop support I'd have no problem with my

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:38.990 
drop support I'd have no problem with my
phone<00:02:38.010> drop<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.400> this<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:38.579> think<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.880> is

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
phone drop of this I think this is

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390 
phone drop of this I think this is
probably<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.600> best<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> kind<00:02:41.070> of<00:02:41.100> crush

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
probably the best but the kind of crush

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.690 
probably the best but the kind of crush
ability<00:02:41.880> of<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.480> plastic<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
ability of this this plastic and the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.789 
ability of this this plastic and the
hard<00:02:44.970> corners<00:02:45.630> being<00:02:45.870> protected<00:02:46.380> by<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.530> hard

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
hard corners being protected by the hard

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.300 
hard corners being protected by the hard
plastic<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.549> think<00:02:47.790> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.299> great<00:02:48.510> great

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
plastic I think this is a great great

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.309 
plastic I think this is a great great
solution<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.400> mean<00:02:50.549> it's<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.760> good<00:02:51.090> case<00:02:51.480> you're

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
solution I mean it's a good case you're

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.539 
solution I mean it's a good case you're
going<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> notice<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> back<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.459> this

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
going to notice that the back of this

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.849 
going to notice that the back of this
thing<00:02:53.609> since<00:02:54.000> it's<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.269> hard<00:02:55.079> plastic<00:02:55.680> it's

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
thing since it's that hard plastic it's

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.349 
thing since it's that hard plastic it's
it's<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> get<00:02:56.459> scuffed<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:57.000> if<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> see

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
it's going to get scuffed and if you see

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's going to get scuffed and if you see
on<00:02:57.480> mine<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.780> gorgeously<00:02:58.079> swirls<00:02:58.530> and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
on mine you gorgeously swirls and

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.789 
on mine you gorgeously swirls and
scratch<00:02:59.609> marks<00:03:01.370> so<00:03:02.370> it's<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:03.560> it's<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> good

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
scratch marks so it's not it's a good

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.860 
scratch marks so it's not it's a good
case<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.280> don't<00:03:05.819> give<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.120> 10<00:03:06.329> i<00:03:06.359> give<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.660> may

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
case I don't give it a 10 i give it may

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.789 
case I don't give it a 10 i give it may
be<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:07.049> 9<00:03:08.780> similar<00:03:09.780> i<00:03:09.840> give<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.200> case<00:03:10.500> probably

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
be a 9 similar i give this case probably

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.030
