search<00:01:06.030> destroy<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.600> much<00:01:06.780> it's<00:01:07.080> kind<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.320> a

habit<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:09.390> that's<00:01:09.510> definitely<00:01:09.930> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
habit and I think that's definitely a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.130 
habit and I think that's definitely a
good<00:01:10.020> habit<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.470> pick<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.570> by<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.630> way<00:01:12.869> um

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
good habit to pick up but by the way um

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.080 
good habit to pick up but by the way um
my<00:01:14.070> game<00:01:14.970> controls<00:01:15.960> are<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.320> tactical<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.970> I

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
my game controls are on tactical and I

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
my game controls are on tactical and I
do<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.600> i<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:18.840> drop<00:01:19.020> shot<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.380> go<00:01:19.470> prone

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
do that so i can drop shot and go prone

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.440 
do that so i can drop shot and go prone
really<00:01:19.950> easily<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.460> i<00:01:20.580> can<00:01:20.729> control<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.330> my

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450

really easily so i can control all my
bodily<00:01:21.750> functions<00:01:22.229> extremely<00:01:23.189> easily<00:01:23.720> so<00:01:24.720> as

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
bodily functions extremely easily so as

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100
