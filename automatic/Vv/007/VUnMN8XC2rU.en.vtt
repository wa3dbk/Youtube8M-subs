I've<00:00:07.950> got<00:00:08.160> four<00:00:08.490> old<00:00:08.910> batteries<00:00:09.540> my<00:00:10.290> original

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
I've got four old batteries my original

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.509 
I've got four old batteries my original
power<00:00:10.950> exas<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.509> an<00:00:13.080> old<00:00:13.440> old<00:00:13.769> old<00:00:13.920> energizer

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
power exas and an old old old energizer

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840 
power exas and an old old old energizer
and<00:00:15.480> one<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> newer<00:00:16.230> San<00:00:16.619> Jose<00:00:16.890> which<00:00:17.670> I've

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and one of the newer San Jose which I've

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.750 
and one of the newer San Jose which I've
never<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.390> liked<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.289> hint<00:00:19.500> fully<00:00:20.369> charged

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
never really liked a hint fully charged

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.000 
never really liked a hint fully charged
to<00:00:20.910> capacity<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.630> never<00:00:21.779> used<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.289> and<00:00:22.619> I

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to capacity so I never used them and I

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.519 
to capacity so I never used them and I
want<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.279> enter<00:00:23.490> loops<00:00:23.699> got<00:00:24.570> four<00:00:24.840> more<00:00:24.990> pi<00:00:25.320> we

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
want to enter loops got four more pi we

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.120 
want to enter loops got four more pi we
exit<00:00:25.859> power<00:00:26.189> power<00:00:26.820> X's<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.019> side<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
exit power power X's on the side and

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.560 
exit power power X's on the side and
we'll<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:29.849> happens<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.390> them

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
we'll see what happens when we do them

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.780 
we'll see what happens when we do them
usually<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.619> I<00:00:31.679> grab<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.009> battery<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.430> feel

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
usually when I grab the battery I feel

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.959 
usually when I grab the battery I feel
for<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> tip<00:00:35.210> stick<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:40.410> tips<00:00:40.969> stick

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
for the tip stick it in the tips stick

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.729 
for the tip stick it in the tips stick
them<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:43.730> will<00:00:44.730> plug<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> thing<00:00:45.149> in<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.739> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
them in I will plug the thing in now so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.240 
them in I will plug the thing in now so
you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.010> see<00:00:47.250> what's<00:00:47.430> going<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.829> top

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you can see what's going on and then top

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090 
you can see what's going on and then top
the<00:00:50.370> reflection<00:00:51.320> press<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> hold<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.920> little

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
the reflection press it hold it a little

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.700 
the reflection press it hold it a little
bit<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.329> goes<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.629> recharge<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.530> can

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
bit and it goes up to recharge you can

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.069 
bit and it goes up to recharge you can
see<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.399> press<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.329> one<00:00:57.449> more<00:00:57.600> time<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
see here and press it one more time it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.330 
see here and press it one more time it
goes<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.289> refresh<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.250> then<00:01:00.030> press<00:01:00.329> current

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
goes to refresh and then press current

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.399 
goes to refresh and then press current
100<00:01:02.930> 250<00:01:04.640> 350<00:01:05.640> I'll<00:01:05.970> actually<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> 500<00:01:06.810> so

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
100 250 350 I'll actually go to 500 so

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
100 250 350 I'll actually go to 500 so
the<00:01:07.560> vehicle's<00:01:07.860> faster<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> test<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the vehicle's faster on this test and

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.520 
the vehicle's faster on this test and
basically<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.320> done<00:01:10.580> that's<00:01:11.580> all<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.000> do

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
basically you're done that's all you do

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
basically you're done that's all you do
to<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.650> other<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:19.100> 3/4<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:21.320> plug<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:23.240> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
to the other side 3/4 in plug it in you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
to the other side 3/4 in plug it in you
watch<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.720> lights<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:26.240> see<00:01:27.240> him<00:01:27.360> about<00:01:27.680> 120

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
watch the lights go see him about 120

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.219 
watch the lights go see him about 120
it's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.280> 128<00:01:29.970> 120<00:01:30.659> whatever<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> was<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.189> then

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
it's a 128 120 whatever it was and then

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.100 
it's a 128 120 whatever it was and then
and<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.350> says<00:01:34.560> refresh<00:01:36.799> pump<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.950> power<00:01:38.189> up

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
and it says refresh pump the power up

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.940 
and it says refresh pump the power up
usually<00:01:40.110> I'd<00:01:40.229> let<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.470> go<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.060> 100<00:01:42.060> or<00:01:42.829> 200<00:01:43.829> at

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
usually I'd let that go to 100 or 200 at

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.270 
usually I'd let that go to 100 or 200 at
the<00:01:43.979> most<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> going<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> 500<00:01:46.619> Tesla<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.070> one

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the most but going to 500 Tesla this one

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
the most but going to 500 Tesla this one
won't<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:47.850> all<00:01:48.060> day<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.409> can<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.890> these

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
won't take all day and I can get these

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.899 
won't take all day and I can get these
back<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.579> tonight<00:01:51.110> ok<00:01:52.700> there's<00:01:53.700> your

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
back to you tonight ok there's your

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.109 
back to you tonight ok there's your
charge<00:01:54.240> rate<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:55.579> what<00:01:56.579> it<00:01:56.670> does<00:01:56.909> on<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
charge rate going what it does on the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.440 
charge rate going what it does on the
Refresh<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.899> charges<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> up<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:02:00.299> it

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
Refresh is it charges it up and then it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.319 
Refresh is it charges it up and then it
discharges<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:04.040> these<00:02:05.040> guys<00:02:05.280> here<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.610> 500

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
discharges it these guys here at 500

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.220 
discharges it these guys here at 500
these<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.750> things<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.560> said<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.369> room

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.890 

here's<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.290> refresh<00:02:13.690> both<00:02:14.690> a<00:02:14.870> refresh<00:02:15.290> okay
