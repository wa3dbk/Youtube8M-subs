00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
so he's tripped over the plato car that

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.040 
so he's tripped over the plato car that
was<00:00:26.519> limping<00:00:26.939> back<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.390> pits<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.779> slow

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
was limping back to the pits at slow

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.050 
was limping back to the pits at slow
speed<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.859> Andrew<00:00:29.160> Jones<00:00:29.429> at<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.820> wheel<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
speed that's Andrew Jones at the wheel I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.240 
speed that's Andrew Jones at the wheel I
assume<00:00:30.439> since<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.619> Jones<00:00:32.329> Cleland<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:35.190> I

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
assume since the Jones Cleland so I

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.709 
assume since the Jones Cleland so I
think<00:00:35.340> it's<00:00:35.520> John<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.880> wheel<00:00:36.059> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719
