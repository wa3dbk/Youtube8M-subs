00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.860 

you<00:04:10.580> shouldn't<00:04:10.910> get<00:04:10.970> up<00:04:11.030> Evan<00:04:11.390> easy<00:04:11.540> goodnight

you shouldn't get up Evan easy goodnight

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:38.159 
you shouldn't get up Evan easy goodnight
down<00:04:12.050> what<00:04:12.440> three<00:04:12.800> times<00:04:13.040> I<00:04:13.250> think

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.850 

and<00:04:38.590> there<00:04:39.009> you<00:04:39.099> go<00:04:39.900> complete<00:04:40.900> domination<00:04:41.409> by

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and there you go complete domination by

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.309 
and there you go complete domination by
Roy<00:04:42.129> Jones<00:04:42.520> jr.<00:04:45.629> see<00:04:46.629> what<00:04:46.779> the<00:04:46.870> accuracy

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
Roy Jones jr. see what the accuracy

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:53.159 
Roy Jones jr. see what the accuracy
looks<00:04:47.590> like<00:04:50.370> 15<00:04:51.370> rather<00:04:51.909> than<00:04:52.029> a<00:04:52.090> 50%<00:04:52.389> almost

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
looks like 15 rather than a 50% almost

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.459 
looks like 15 rather than a 50% almost
60%<00:04:53.740> for<00:04:54.159> me<00:04:54.279> I<00:04:54.460> think<00:04:54.969> I'm<00:04:55.629> going<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:56.020> reduce

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:56.469 
60% for me I think I'm going to reduce

00:04:56.469 --> 00:05:00.390 
60% for me I think I'm going to reduce
them<00:04:56.889> punch<00:04:57.729> accuracy<00:04:58.389> a<00:04:58.419> little<00:04:58.689> bit<00:04:59.400> I'd

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
them punch accuracy a little bit I'd

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.879 
them punch accuracy a little bit I'd
like<00:05:00.550> to<00:05:00.639> see<00:05:00.759> that<00:05:00.939> be<00:05:01.060> in<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.210> lower<00:05:01.509> 50s

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
like to see that be in the lower 50s

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.790 
like to see that be in the lower 50s
maybe<00:05:02.889> even<00:05:03.189> some<00:05:03.939> 40s<00:05:04.389> but<00:05:05.229> it's<00:05:05.409> a<00:05:05.499> counter

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
maybe even some 40s but it's a counter

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.140 
maybe even some 40s but it's a counter
punch<00:05:06.009> with<00:05:06.129> you<00:05:06.219> you<00:05:06.490> probably<00:05:06.699> would<00:05:06.969> have<00:05:07.120> a

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
punch with you you probably would have a

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.850 
punch with you you probably would have a
higher<00:05:07.360> connect<00:05:07.689> percentage<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.740> was

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
higher connect percentage and I was

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.290 
higher connect percentage and I was
trying<00:05:09.069> and<00:05:09.490> trying<00:05:09.610> to<00:05:09.759> do<00:05:09.849> some<00:05:10.029> counter

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
trying and trying to do some counter

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.969 
trying and trying to do some counter
punches<00:05:10.569> as<00:05:10.659> much<00:05:10.779> as<00:05:10.900> I<00:05:10.990> could

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
punches as much as I could

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.830 
punches as much as I could
