00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.940 
started so the first thing you want to
do<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.700> cut<00:00:36.300> about<00:00:36.630> three<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.649> four<00:00:37.890> inches

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
do is cut about three to four inches

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.959 
do is cut about three to four inches
into<00:00:38.640> your<00:00:39.270> sheets<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:41.670> should<00:00:41.879> be

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
into your sheets and that should be

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
into your sheets and that should be
enough<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.450> get<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:42.780> started<00:00:42.809> ripping<00:00:43.770> your

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
enough to get you started ripping your

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.479 
enough to get you started ripping your
sheets<00:00:44.579> into<00:00:44.850> strips<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.440> just<00:00:46.649> go<00:00:46.890> ahead<00:00:47.039> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
sheets into strips so just go ahead and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.279 
sheets into strips so just go ahead and
keep<00:00:47.879> ripping<00:00:48.980> once<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.129> get<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.489> strip

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
keep ripping once you get one strip

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.080 
keep ripping once you get one strip
start<00:00:52.289> again<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.739> go<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.370> an<00:00:53.579> inch<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.059> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
start again I go in about an inch and a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.830 
start again I go in about an inch and a
half<00:00:54.379> make<00:00:55.379> my<00:00:55.590> incision<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.030> it'll<00:01:00.600> rip

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
half make my incision and it'll rip

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.479 
half make my incision and it'll rip
that's<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.289> nice<00:01:01.440> thing<00:01:01.469> about<00:01:01.739> bed<00:01:02.160> sheets

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
that's the nice thing about bed sheets

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.939 
that's the nice thing about bed sheets
they<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> ripped<00:01:03.270> really<00:01:03.870> nice<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.769> once

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
they just ripped really nice then once

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.820 
they just ripped really nice then once
you<00:01:05.070> get<00:01:05.220> at<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> end<00:01:05.640> if<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.850> hit<00:01:06.150> an<00:01:06.299> edge

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
you get at the end if you hit an edge

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
you get at the end if you hit an edge
snip<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.010> again<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.270> continue<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> rip<00:01:10.229> your

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
snip it again so continue to rip your

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.770 
snip it again so continue to rip your
sheets<00:01:10.740> into<00:01:10.979> strips<00:01:11.880> until<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:12.510> enough

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
sheets into strips until you have enough

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.050 
sheets into strips until you have enough
material<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.439> make<00:01:13.830> whatever<00:01:14.189> size<00:01:14.520> rag<00:01:14.790> rug

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
material to make whatever size rag rug

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.649 
material to make whatever size rag rug
you<00:01:15.240> want

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you want

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.499 
you want
so<00:01:16.259> once<00:01:16.560> you've<00:01:16.799> ripped<00:01:17.400> your<00:01:17.700> sheets<00:01:18.000> into

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so once you've ripped your sheets into

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.510 
so once you've ripped your sheets into
strips<00:01:18.960> you're<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> separate

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
strips you're going to want to separate

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.960 
strips you're going to want to separate
them<00:01:20.759> between<00:01:21.409> short<00:01:22.409> medium<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.640> long

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
them between short medium and long

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.170 
them between short medium and long
lengths<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> once<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> do<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.400> I've<00:01:26.640> used<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
lengths and once you do that I've used a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.630 
lengths and once you do that I've used a
safety<00:01:27.659> pin<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.229> hold<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> ends<00:01:28.979> together<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
safety pin to hold the ends together and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.649 
safety pin to hold the ends together and
then<00:01:30.360> you'll<00:01:30.540> see<00:01:30.840> you<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.650> short<00:01:32.659> medium

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
then you'll see you have short medium

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.039 
then you'll see you have short medium
and<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.350> long<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:36.030> reason<00:01:36.420> we<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and then long and the reason we do this

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.429 
and then long and the reason we do this
is<00:01:37.290> because<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.979> we're<00:01:38.610> braiding<00:01:39.150> our<00:01:39.439> sheets

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
is because as we're braiding our sheets

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.569 
is because as we're braiding our sheets
as<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:41.610> get<00:01:41.820> down<00:01:43.009> you'll<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.369> start

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
as you get down you'll have to start

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.210 
as you get down you'll have to start
introducing<00:01:44.880> new<00:01:45.479> strips<00:01:45.960> into<00:01:46.649> your<00:01:46.799> thing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
introducing new strips into your thing

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.359 
introducing new strips into your thing
and<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.520> don't<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.380> them<00:01:49.829> all<00:01:50.100> end

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and you don't want to have them all end

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.700 
and you don't want to have them all end
at<00:01:50.549> one<00:01:50.820> point<00:01:51.180> because<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.200> becomes

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
at one point because then it becomes

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.380 
at one point because then it becomes
very<00:01:52.920> obvious<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.729> that's<00:01:53.939> where<00:01:54.149> there's<00:01:54.329> a

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
very obvious that that's where there's a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670 
very obvious that that's where there's a
breaking<00:01:54.659> point<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
breaking point so you want to have a

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.340 
breaking point so you want to have a
gradual<00:01:56.280> breaking<00:01:56.820> point<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.899> why<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
gradual breaking point and that's why so

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.280 
gradual breaking point and that's why so
if<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.850> ends<00:01:59.850> then<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:00.930> next

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
if one ends then you can put your next

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.850 
if one ends then you can put your next
strip<00:02:01.710> start<00:02:02.549> adding<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.829> have<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
strip start adding that in and have a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.199 
strip start adding that in and have a
