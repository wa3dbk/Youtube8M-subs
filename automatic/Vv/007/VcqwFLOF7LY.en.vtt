Shuttle the final night on the launch
pad<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.949> think<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> really<00:01:03.420> good

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
pad and I I think this is a really good

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.469 
pad and I I think this is a really good
candidate<00:01:04.110> for<00:01:04.140> HDR<00:01:04.850> so<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:05.909> gonna<00:01:06.030> say<00:01:06.210> load

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
candidate for HDR so I'm gonna say load

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050 
candidate for HDR so I'm gonna say load
bracketed<00:01:07.049> photos<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> then<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:08.700> going<00:01:08.939> to

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
bracketed photos and then I'm going to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.740 
bracketed photos and then I'm going to
go<00:01:09.210> choose<00:01:09.659> those<00:01:10.320> photos<00:01:11.060> alright<00:01:12.060> these<00:01:12.570> are

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
go choose those photos alright these are

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.410 
go choose those photos alright these are
the<00:01:12.840> five<00:01:13.110> component<00:01:13.710> photos<00:01:14.479> I'll<00:01:15.479> say<00:01:15.689> load

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
the five component photos I'll say load

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.880 
the five component photos I'll say load
okay<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.659> just<00:01:18.750> confirming<00:01:19.229> what<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> chose

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
okay that's just confirming what I chose

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
okay that's just confirming what I chose
I'll<00:01:20.430> say<00:01:20.580> okay<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:23.340> was<00:01:24.090> on<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> tripod<00:01:24.750> in

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'll say okay and I was on the tripod in

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
I'll say okay and I was on the tripod in
this<00:01:24.960> situation<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.950> was<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> little<00:01:26.280> bit

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
this situation but it was a little bit

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
this situation but it was a little bit
shaky<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:26.939> I'm<00:01:27.030> gonna<00:01:27.119> say<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.360> line<00:01:27.750> source

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
shaky so I'm gonna say a line source

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.929 
shaky so I'm gonna say a line source
images<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:30.290> did<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.439> check<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.009> crop<00:01:32.460> because

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
images I did not check this crop because

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.880 
images I did not check this crop because
I<00:01:33.180> often<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.750> go<00:01:33.960> do<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> final<00:01:34.530> crop

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
I often like to go do a final crop

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.840 
I often like to go do a final crop
myself<00:01:35.430> at<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> very<00:01:35.909> end<00:01:37.460> if<00:01:38.460> there<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.820> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
myself at the very end if there was a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.700 
myself at the very end if there was a
lot<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> movement<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> photo<00:01:39.810> which<00:01:40.470> there

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lot of movement in the photo which there

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
lot of movement in the photo which there
wasn't<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.579> but<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> could<00:01:42.570> check

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
wasn't in this one but I could check

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.289 
wasn't in this one but I could check
reduce<00:01:43.350> ghosting<00:01:44.009> artifacts<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> takes

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
reduce ghosting artifacts and that takes

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
reduce ghosting artifacts and that takes
you<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.540> another<00:01:46.140> step<00:01:46.409> or<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.250> take<00:01:47.880> care

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you to another step or you can take care

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.380 
you to another step or you can take care
of<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.490> noise<00:01:50.729> reduction<00:01:51.060> at

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
of that I could do noise reduction at

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.899 
of that I could do noise reduction at
this<00:01:51.540> step<00:01:51.750> if<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.020> wanted<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.759> could<00:01:53.759> also

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this step if I wanted to I could also

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.359 
this step if I wanted to I could also
check<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.350> reduce<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> chromatic

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
check this to reduce the chromatic

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.429 
check this to reduce the chromatic
aberrations<00:01:56.969> if<00:01:57.810> you're<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> sure<00:01:58.229> what<00:01:58.320> all

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
aberrations if you're not sure what all

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.780 
aberrations if you're not sure what all
this<00:01:58.560> stuff<00:01:58.619> means<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.189> you<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.399> mouse<00:01:59.579> over

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this stuff means if you just mouse over

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.429 
this stuff means if you just mouse over
and<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.149> gives<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> tooltip

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
somewhere between zero and plus five

detail<00:04:04.810> contrast<00:04:05.380> this<00:04:05.769> used<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.040> be<00:04:06.160> called

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
detail contrast this used to be called

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.699 
detail contrast this used to be called
micro<00:04:06.640> contrast<00:04:07.150> this<00:04:07.870> allows<00:04:08.200> you<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.560> adjust

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
micro contrast this allows you to adjust

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.150 
micro contrast this allows you to adjust
the<00:04:09.130> detail<00:04:09.610> at<00:04:09.970> the<00:04:10.450> sort<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.320> pixel<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.130> pixel

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
the detail at the sort of pixel to pixel

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.310 
the detail at the sort of pixel to pixel
level<00:04:12.640> okay<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.299> the<00:04:13.540> more<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.870> drag<00:04:14.079> it<00:04:14.200> to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
level okay so the more you drag it to

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.440 
level okay so the more you drag it to
the<00:04:14.350> right<00:04:14.470> more<00:04:15.340> detail<00:04:15.760> you'll<00:04:15.970> see<00:04:16.180> down

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
the right more detail you'll see down

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.360 
the right more detail you'll see down
low<00:04:17.760> lighting<00:04:18.760> adjustments<00:04:20.039> this<00:04:21.039> is<00:04:21.220> how

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
low lighting adjustments this is how

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.059 
low lighting adjustments this is how
natural<00:04:21.760> or<00:04:22.360> HDR<00:04:22.990> II

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:24.069

the<00:04:24.550> photo<00:04:24.789> will<00:04:25.030> look<00:04:25.240> all<00:04:25.689> the<00:04:26.020> way<00:04:26.110> to<00:04:26.169> the

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
the photo will look all the way to the

the photo will look all the way to the
right<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.860> looks<00:04:27.069> most<00:04:27.460> like<00:04:27.689> it's<00:04:28.689> right<00:04:28.840> out

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
right it looks most like it's right out

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.510 
right it looks most like it's right out
of<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.110> camera<00:04:29.319> and<00:04:30.039> then<00:04:30.099> all<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.340> way<00:04:30.460> to

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
of the camera and then all the way to

of the camera and then all the way to
the<00:04:30.759> left<00:04:31.080> especially<00:04:32.080> if<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.259> go<00:04:32.379> into<00:04:32.500> these

let friends do HDR on drugs so I don't
do<00:04:45.849> that<00:04:46.090> I<00:04:46.419> I<00:04:47.110> keep<00:04:47.439> it<00:04:47.530> up<00:04:47.650> around<00:04:47.979> zero<00:04:48.699> to

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
do that I I keep it up around zero to

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
depends on every photo of course I only

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.839 
depends on every photo of course I only
use<00:04:56.259> really<00:04:56.590> three<00:04:56.889> other<00:04:57.009> sliders<00:04:57.370> most<00:04:57.759> of

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:57.849 
use really three other sliders most of

00:04:57.849 --> 00:04:59.540 
use really three other sliders most of
the<00:04:57.909> time<00:04:58.120> I'll<00:04:58.300> show<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.509> what<00:04:58.599> those<00:04:58.750> are

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
the time I'll show you what those are

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.820 
the time I'll show you what those are
now<00:05:00.550> by<00:05:00.699> default<00:05:00.810> black<00:05:01.810> point<00:05:02.139> is<00:05:02.289> down<00:05:02.469> here

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
now by default black point is down here

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.040 
now by default black point is down here
all<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.039> way<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.490> left<00:05:03.669> okay<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.750> don't

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
all the way to the left okay I don't

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.619 
all the way to the left okay I don't
like<00:05:05.199> them<00:05:05.529> I<00:05:05.680> always<00:05:06.310> crank<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.300> up<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.539> little

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
like them I always crank it up a little

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.830 
like them I always crank it up a little
bit<00:05:07.930> because<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:09.129> me<00:05:09.279> having<00:05:09.879> black<00:05:10.509> and<00:05:10.779> the

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:10.840 
bit because to me having black and the

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.659 
bit because to me having black and the
photo<00:05:11.050> is<00:05:11.169> important<00:05:11.650> I<00:05:11.770> think<00:05:11.800> black<00:05:12.219> helps

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
photo is important I think black helps

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.089 
photo is important I think black helps
give<00:05:12.939> other<00:05:13.120> colors<00:05:13.479> their<00:05:13.659> vibration<00:05:14.229> so

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
give other colors their vibration so

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.679 
give other colors their vibration so
make<00:05:15.219> sure<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.490> get<00:05:15.639> that<00:05:15.789> off<00:05:15.969> the<00:05:16.210> backside

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:16.689 
make sure you get that off the backside

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:20.610 
make sure you get that off the backside
their<00:05:17.460> white<00:05:18.460> point<00:05:18.849> also<00:05:19.289> changes<00:05:20.289> based<00:05:20.500> on

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
their white point also changes based on

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.619 
their white point also changes based on
the<00:05:20.740> photo<00:05:20.919> if<00:05:21.039> it's<00:05:21.159> too<00:05:21.400> high<00:05:21.699> you'll<00:05:22.449> get

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
the photo if it's too high you'll get

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.740 
the photo if it's too high you'll get
blown<00:05:23.050> out<00:05:23.259> areas<00:05:23.770> right<00:05:24.219> which<00:05:25.120> sort<00:05:25.629> of

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
blown out areas right which sort of

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.869 
blown out areas right which sort of
defeats<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.199> purpose<00:05:26.409> of<00:05:26.680> HDR<00:05:27.099> in<00:05:27.550> the<00:05:27.669> first

00:05:27.869 --> 00:05:27.879 
defeats the purpose of HDR in the first

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:30.420 
defeats the purpose of HDR in the first
place<00:05:28.500> so<00:05:29.500> I'll<00:05:29.620> drink<00:05:29.800> that<00:05:29.919> I'll<00:05:30.190> drag<00:05:30.400> that

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
place so I'll drink that I'll drag that

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.980 
place so I'll drink that I'll drag that
down<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.729> little<00:05:30.849> bit<00:05:31.120> so<00:05:31.360> it<00:05:31.449> was<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.719> little<00:05:31.870> bit

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
down a little bit so it was a little bit

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.309 
down a little bit so it was a little bit
more<00:05:32.139> manageable<00:05:32.639> okay<00:05:33.639> I'm<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.960> last<00:05:35.139> one

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:35.319 
more manageable okay I'm the last one

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:37.439 
more manageable okay I'm the last one
that<00:05:35.469> I<00:05:35.500> use<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:35.919> micro<00:05:36.310> smoothing<00:05:36.789> and<00:05:36.969> this

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
that I use is micro smoothing and this

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.709 
that I use is micro smoothing and this
adjust<00:05:38.199> the<00:05:38.789> contrast<00:05:39.789> level<00:05:40.240> again<00:05:40.479> on<00:05:40.629> the

00:05:40.709 --> 00:05:40.719 
adjust the contrast level again on the

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:42.779 
adjust the contrast level again on the
small<00:05:40.990> scale<00:05:41.229> so<00:05:41.440> if<00:05:41.529> I<00:05:41.589> bring<00:05:41.830> it<00:05:41.949> up<00:05:42.039> you'll

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
small scale so if I bring it up you'll

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.950 
small scale so if I bring it up you'll
see<00:05:42.819> everything<00:05:43.150> just<00:05:43.419> gets<00:05:43.569> a<00:05:43.690> little<00:05:43.750> bit

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
see everything just gets a little bit

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.659 
see everything just gets a little bit
smoother<00:05:44.349> and<00:05:44.529> maybe<00:05:44.860> you<00:05:45.009> want<00:05:45.190> that<00:05:45.400> smooth

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
smoother and maybe you want that smooth

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.969 
smoother and maybe you want that smooth
look<00:05:45.699> you<00:05:46.569> go<00:05:46.690> all<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.080> way<00:05:47.139> to<00:05:47.199> the<00:05:47.379> left

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
look you go all the way to the left

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:49.860 
look you go all the way to the left
things<00:05:48.310> get<00:05:48.460> a<00:05:48.520> little<00:05:48.610> bit<00:05:48.789> more<00:05:48.940> gritty<00:05:49.330> so

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
things get a little bit more gritty so

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.689 
things get a little bit more gritty so
if<00:05:49.930> you<00:05:50.020> want<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.199> gritty<00:05:50.589> HDR<00:05:51.099> look<00:05:51.339> this<00:05:51.520> is

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
if you want that gritty HDR look this is

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:55.409 
if you want that gritty HDR look this is
the<00:05:51.789> slider<00:05:52.029> to<00:05:52.150> use<00:05:53.039> okay<00:05:54.060> and<00:05:55.060> then<00:05:55.150> you<00:05:55.240> just
