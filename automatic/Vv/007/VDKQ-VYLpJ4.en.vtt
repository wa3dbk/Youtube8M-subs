like<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> cpu<00:01:04.110> because<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.530> feel<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:05.100> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
like a cpu because I feel that's the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
like a cpu because I feel that's the
next<00:01:05.970> steps<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:06.540> done<00:01:06.720> pretty<00:01:06.810> much<00:01:06.960> most

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
next steps I've done pretty much most

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.200 
next steps I've done pretty much most
other<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.820> thing<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
other things it's the one thing that

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
other things it's the one thing that
people<00:01:09.689> who<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.960> redstone<00:01:10.439> doing<00:01:11.450> it's<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
people who like redstone doing it's the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.429 
people who like redstone doing it's the
one<00:01:12.720> thing<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:12.990> people<00:01:13.380> who<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.770> red<00:01:14.220> stone

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
one thing that people who like red stone

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.249 
one thing that people who like red stone
work<00:01:16.439> towards<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.270> I've<00:01:18.479> been<00:01:18.659> creating

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
work towards and so I've been creating

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.890 
work towards and so I've been creating
components<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:19.890> one<00:01:20.070> I've<00:01:20.310> made<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:20.939> very

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
components for one I've made my very

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.600 
components for one I've made my very

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
know what a d flip-flop is from some

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.420 
know what a d flip-flop is from some
other<00:01:35.700> all<00:01:35.909> my<00:01:36.030> other<00:01:36.180> memory<00:01:36.600> videos<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.280> it

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
other all my other memory videos so it

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.190 
other all my other memory videos so it
won't<00:01:38.610> change<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.299> output<00:01:39.600> till<00:01:40.079> I've

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
won't change the output till I've

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.289 
won't change the output till I've
clocked<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:41.689> rock<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:43.649> gone

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
clocked it rock it and it's all gone

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.850 
clocked it rock it and it's all gone
blah<00:01:45.299> blah<00:01:45.420> blah<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:46.140> that's<00:01:46.320> brilliant<00:01:46.560> it's

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
blah blah blah so that's brilliant it's

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
blah blah blah so that's brilliant it's
that<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> only<00:01:47.460> realized<00:01:47.850> now<00:01:48.000> that<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.329> could

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
that I only realized now that you could

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.300 
that I only realized now that you could
put<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> next<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> each<00:01:49.079> other<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.530> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
put it next to each other like this so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
put it next to each other like this so
it's<00:01:50.430> very<00:01:50.670> very<00:01:50.820> compact<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.470> 16<00:01:53.040> x<00:01:53.280> 4

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it's very very compact it's like 16 x 4

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.209 
it's very very compact it's like 16 x 4
x<00:01:53.729> 5<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.630> something<00:01:54.899> including<00:01:55.439> redstone<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
x 5 or something including redstone on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.039

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.569 
the top gotten program council right
here<00:01:58.350> all<00:01:59.310> might<00:01:59.640> this<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.090> design<00:02:01.579> with

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
here all might this is my design with

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.920 
here all might this is my design with
the<00:02:02.700> help<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:05.240> crap<00:02:06.240> i<00:02:06.450> can't<00:02:06.659> remember<00:02:06.750> his

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the help of crap i can't remember his

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.330 
the help of crap i can't remember his
name<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.110> he<00:02:07.350> gave<00:02:07.469> me<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.680> idea<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.220> i

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
name but he gave me the idea for it i

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.770 
name but he gave me the idea for it i
think<00:02:08.580> i<00:02:08.610> mentioned<00:02:08.789> in<00:02:09.000> my<00:02:09.149> program<00:02:09.599> comes

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
think i mentioned in my program comes

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.809 
think i mentioned in my program comes
video<00:02:10.050> well<00:02:10.560> then<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.979> scrap<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
video well then I like scrap this and

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.470 
video well then I like scrap this and
make<00:02:11.910> it<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.090> bit<00:02:12.209> better

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
make it a bit better

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.869 
make it a bit better
because<00:02:12.780> takes<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.830> phenomenal<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:14.550> space

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
because takes up a phenomenal out space

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.369 
because takes up a phenomenal out space
for<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.269> two<00:02:15.480> instructions<00:02:16.019> and<00:02:16.290> they're

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
for just two instructions and they're

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.530 
for just two instructions and they're
only<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.739> bit<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.220> I've<00:02:17.940> got<00:02:18.060> my<00:02:18.150> ale<00:02:18.299> you

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
only for bit and I've got my ale you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.809 
only for bit and I've got my ale you
obviously<00:02:19.069> accumulator<00:02:20.069> will<00:02:20.310> just<00:02:20.459> add<00:02:20.790> some

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
obviously accumulator will just add some

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.690 
obviously accumulator will just add some
memory<00:02:21.209> on<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.629> Lu<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.650> hopefully<00:02:23.610> I'll

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
memory on to the Lu and hopefully I'll

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
memory on to the Lu and hopefully I'll
be<00:02:23.760> able<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:24.000> string<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:24.239> together<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.569> make

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
be able to string it together to make

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.020 
be able to string it together to make
CPU<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:28.230> yeah<00:02:30.709> hopefully<00:02:31.709> I'll<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.580> able<00:02:32.879> to

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
CPU so yeah hopefully I'll be able to

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.699 
CPU so yeah hopefully I'll be able to
actually<00:02:33.330> build<00:02:33.690> one<00:02:33.959> rather<00:02:34.170> than<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.470> talk

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
actually build one rather than just talk

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.470 
actually build one rather than just talk
about<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.250> which<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.610> what<00:02:35.760> I've<00:02:35.849> been<00:02:35.879> doing<00:02:36.180> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
about it which is what I've been doing a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.080 
about it which is what I've been doing a
lot<00:02:36.690> recently<00:02:37.129> I'm<00:02:38.129> trying<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.760> think<00:02:38.790> about

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
lot recently I'm trying to think about

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.940 
lot recently I'm trying to think about
what<00:02:39.239> other<00:02:39.510> things<00:02:39.810> i<00:02:40.019> will<00:02:40.230> need<00:02:40.410> for<00:02:40.769> a<00:02:40.799> CPL

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
what other things i will need for a CPL

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.680 
what other things i will need for a CPL

taught me some stuff about CP using

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.940 
taught me some stuff about CP using
computers<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.060> general<00:02:51.420> i'm<00:02:51.569> just<00:02:51.780> a
