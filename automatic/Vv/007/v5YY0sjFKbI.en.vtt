00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
that exists on our planet let's say the

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.270 
that exists on our planet let's say the
planet<00:01:38.840> has<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> population<00:01:39.649> of<00:01:39.740> 1<00:01:40.009> million

people<00:01:40.670> on<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.329> we<00:01:41.689> can<00:01:41.840> observe<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.439> it

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
people on it and we can observe that it

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.700 
people on it and we can observe that it
weighs<00:01:42.799> eighty<00:01:43.159> three<00:01:43.490> point<00:01:43.820> six<00:01:44.119> kilograms

weighs eighty three point six kilograms

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.170 
weighs eighty three point six kilograms
next<00:01:45.710> we'll<00:01:45.979> demonstrate<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.700> increase<00:01:47.000> in

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
next we'll demonstrate the increase in

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.330 
next we'll demonstrate the increase in
population<00:01:47.570> as<00:01:47.990> there<00:01:48.680> are<00:01:48.770> only<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.100> certain

Earth's atmosphere us humans have to

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.480 
Earth's atmosphere us humans have to
grow<00:01:53.509> out<00:01:53.659> of<00:01:53.869> things<00:01:54.079> that<00:01:54.320> already<00:01:54.500> exist<00:01:54.799> as

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
grow out of things that already exist as

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.060 
grow out of things that already exist as
this<00:01:56.299> Brainiac<00:01:56.780> drinks<00:01:57.140> his<00:01:57.259> fizzy<00:01:57.500> pop<00:01:57.859> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
this Brainiac drinks his fizzy pop and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.760 
this Brainiac drinks his fizzy pop and
it's<00:01:58.369> processed<00:01:58.909> into<00:01:59.090> urine<00:01:59.600> so<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.469> atoms

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
it's processed into urine so the atoms

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.679 
it's processed into urine so the atoms
within<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.130> Earth's<00:02:01.399> atmosphere<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.060> process

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
within the Earth's atmosphere a process

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:11.000 
within the Earth's atmosphere a process
to<00:02:02.869> create<00:02:02.990> young<00:02:03.500> human<00:02:03.950> beings

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.500 

eventually<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.370> new<00:02:12.580> human<00:02:12.970> beings<00:02:13.330> are

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
eventually the new human beings are

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.670 
eventually the new human beings are
formed<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.630> there<00:02:16.960> they<00:02:17.140> are
