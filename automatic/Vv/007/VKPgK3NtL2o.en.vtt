 with a new video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:10.260
 with my iphone smaller iphone recording 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.179
 test this view was on the stones of the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.839
 this is t of 4 safe i can he 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.010
 is recording 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:23.660
 because my file is working goes to 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.660
 is the seventh that had to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.680
 in 20 and yes news app you want can 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.160
 lie 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.070
 these three hit dpf but they are 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.489
 my computer wanted this question 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.489
 had to transfer a bit to the cream 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.239
 I did it and say follow meter is there 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.460
 hd pvr 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.649
 I want these that are also there but me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.390
 got very bad with stuff and of course 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.390
 material we place them in a 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.340
 so look at the pvr I would just have to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.910
 make a video about how it worked 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.619
 and what i did so but looks like 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.540
 a record looks like that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.229
 soldered complaint 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.680
 my computer watch 600 watt power key 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.680
 seagate 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.330
 but you can 200 complaint there 2004 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:30.810
 and a geForce GTX 760 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.810
 67 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:40.390
 don't think its better 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.720
 Chose there are often cooling sat by the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.720
 thing 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.540
 yes makes much noise the additives authorized occupants 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.979
 then sat with the computer 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.180
 apparently herein and this paper 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.430
 fight for it 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.710
 if it's just it's a zoom and so 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.300
 especially it is just way too hot 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.270
 is just handy to water I come here 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.030
 is and I still like is it goes away 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.920
 so i took that for type and then 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.709
 would just be anyway if i am going to record 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.290
 from consoles will essentially controls 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.239
 or children know I can do more 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.010
 not 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.489
 it probably doesn't have a steady hand 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 a lot to do with my computer and 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.820
 writing my name just lie 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.150
 beyond the gusset nothing 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.739
 lightly screwed to the floor and here 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.880
 him 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.880
 the brain of the computer 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:38.890
 I will especially look out handy minis 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:47.470
 first row the pick brain of the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:50.320
 computer original photos x-pert x4 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.739
 his half-inch us two drive to be soft 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.350
 in the boom and you have to say buy it 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.780
 meticulous if you can buy 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.850
 just another fact x4 is fine 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.530
 great thing he have come 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.160
 put it break when waste of money 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360
 ready here also have a ventilation 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.360
 in front of 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.630
 i am going to pull this dumpy or i know her 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.630
 not see for quite windows 7 synergy 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.239
 first elephant later turned over this is so 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:25.890
 one of the mike at 10 am she would 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.680
 which was exactly what will and 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.500
 my heart is blowing 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.959
 this the next to just advice 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.030
 translate into do you remember where the video and 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.590
 that piece and 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.319
 Well I had just reported who said of we 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.500
 are going to send you new and I still have 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.319
 still not seen and 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.519
 on tight leader a week ago the 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.560
 comics bunch 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.780
 so this one works away look that is 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.579
 a 760 thin book no done so the box 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.030
 and 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.299
 is a good thing d 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.989
 r9 290 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:06.750
 with stick cooling comes to me and everything 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:11.299
 cooling and there is already another cooler 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.299
 on and that t 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.820
 which yes he must be publicly cooled 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.130
 and normal boyfriends only for one 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.019
 pretty high amount and then you have such 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.419
 cooler on it and then 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.270
 stock cooler of share itself and that 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.660
 its really prut my name is this one 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.660
 video 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.960
 so I have nothing left anyway 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.720
 upload 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.639
 many rider record not of the 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.820
 computer 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.039
 but a mammogram 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.870
 and that scratches for it 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.960
 could black the christ and I had too 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:53.099
 when they were in it so that in the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.240
 power up and it had such a size 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.979
 she was just completely shut so had 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.960
 just turn four holes and made a hole 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:03.150
 and water could be bought at a h80i 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.240
 and that stuck my food is here 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.580
 it is probably here but to our 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.639
 I sat so that was not really true 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.470
 best solution but still he does it 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.210
 but i want a couch watching 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.979
 these values do not miss a video 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.360
 duimpje do up 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:24.389
 down there again if you don't like it 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:26.659
 and then I'll say later until next time 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.659
