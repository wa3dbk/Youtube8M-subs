this<00:01:15.569> offense<00:01:15.959> from<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.170> different<00:01:16.319> point<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
this offense from a different point of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
this offense from a different point of
view<00:01:16.800> how<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.039> coaches<00:01:17.429> see<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
view how the coaches see it and now I

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
view how the coaches see it and now I
know<00:01:18.600> more<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.050> like<00:01:19.470> what<00:01:19.649> they<00:01:19.800> want<00:01:20.039> on

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280

the<00:01:20.369> field<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.819> I<00:01:20.849> think<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.240> helped<00:01:21.420> me<00:01:21.479> how

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
the field so I think that helped me how

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.380 
the field so I think that helped me how
much<00:01:22.229> easier<00:01:22.619> does<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.069> make<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> practice

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
much easier does it make it to practice

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.809 
much easier does it make it to practice
knowing<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.890> entire<00:01:26.160> team<00:01:26.429> has<00:01:26.640> one

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
knowing that the entire team has one

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.490 
knowing that the entire team has one
quarterback<00:01:27.149> to<00:01:27.509> look<00:01:27.720> at<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.229> be<00:01:28.319> able<00:01:28.440> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
quarterback to look at and to be able to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.809 
quarterback to look at and to be able to
practice<00:01:28.649> with<00:01:29.009> instead<00:01:29.459> of<00:01:29.550> kind<00:01:29.729> of

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819
