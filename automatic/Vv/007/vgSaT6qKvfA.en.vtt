00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
understand how to do it so yeah so that
was<00:01:39.539> the<00:01:39.689> venn<00:01:39.840> takedown<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.680> into

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
was the venn takedown you just go into

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.819 
was the venn takedown you just go into
event<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:42.299> can<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.229> hold<00:01:43.350> triangle<00:01:43.740> when

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
event and I can just hold triangle when

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.060 
event and I can just hold triangle when
a<00:01:43.860> person<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.399> above<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.789> and<00:01:45.829> yeah

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
a person is right above you and yeah

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.679 
a person is right above you and yeah
so<00:01:47.250> next<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.549> silent<00:01:47.939> takedown<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.450> should<00:01:48.600> go

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so next a silent takedown you should go

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.420 
so next a silent takedown you should go
behind<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.990> person<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.320> crush<00:01:49.439> triangle<00:01:49.859> it's

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
behind a person and crush triangle it's

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
behind a person and crush triangle it's
a<00:01:50.640> pretty<00:01:51.119> straightforward<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:52.109> as<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.619> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
a pretty straightforward also as you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.670 
a pretty straightforward also as you can
see<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.859> went<00:01:53.070> behind<00:01:53.189> him<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.509> so<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.469> you<00:01:55.560> can

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
see I went behind him so so as you can

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.910 
see I went behind him so so as you can
see<00:01:56.119> my<00:01:57.119> group<00:01:57.359> was<00:01:57.539> pretty<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.439> organized

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
see my group was pretty well organized

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.219 
see my group was pretty well organized
and<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.299> if<00:02:00.299> they<00:02:00.659> already<00:02:00.750> did<00:02:00.990> something

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and you if they already did something

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.780 
and you if they already did something
they<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.799> go<00:02:01.979> away<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.670> know

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
they would go away you know

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.310 
they would go away you know
take<00:02:03.910> down<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.300> could<00:02:04.540> help<00:02:04.720> upon<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.080> vantage

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
take down this could help upon a vantage

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.440 
take down this could help upon a vantage
point<00:02:05.740> in<00:02:05.890> the<00:02:05.980> whole<00:02:06.160> triangle<00:02:06.490> again<00:02:07.330> these

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
point in the whole triangle again these

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.980 
point in the whole triangle again these
are<00:02:07.630> pretty<00:02:07.840> pretty<00:02:08.530> self-explanatory

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
are pretty pretty self-explanatory

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
are pretty pretty self-explanatory
pretty<00:02:10.990> easy<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.410> do<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:12.190> ground<00:02:12.490> take<00:02:12.670> down

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
pretty easy to do so ground take down

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.340 
pretty easy to do so ground take down
this<00:02:13.060> one<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.600> like<00:02:13.780> stunt<00:02:14.080> them<00:02:14.170> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
this one you have to like stunt them and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.150 
this one you have to like stunt them and
get<00:02:14.470> them<00:02:14.560> on<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.770> ground

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
get them on the ground

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.460 
get them on the ground
I<00:02:15.190> just<00:02:15.610> basically<00:02:15.820> glided<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.690> dropped<00:02:17.260> and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I just basically glided and dropped and

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.190 
I just basically glided and dropped and
I<00:02:17.710> fell<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.700> him<00:02:19.000> and<00:02:19.150> then<00:02:19.270> you<00:02:19.780> have<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:20.020> press

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
I fell on him and then you have to press

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.730 
I fell on him and then you have to press
r2<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.580> drag<00:02:21.760> about<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.560> gel

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
r2 and drag about this so the gel

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.380 
r2 and drag about this so the gel
takedown<00:02:24.100> is<00:02:24.250> also<00:02:24.550> very<00:02:24.730> simple<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.150> pull<00:02:25.270> out

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
takedown is also very simple to pull out

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.330 
takedown is also very simple to pull out
your<00:02:25.510> gel<00:02:25.720> gun<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.350> just<00:02:26.830> use<00:02:27.040> it<00:02:27.070> on<00:02:27.220> the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
your gel gun and just use it on the

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.610 
your gel gun and just use it on the
ground<00:02:27.550> have<00:02:28.030> an<00:02:28.840> enemy<00:02:29.200> you're<00:02:29.380> running

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
ground have an enemy you're running

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.050 
ground have an enemy you're running
you're<00:02:29.740> boosting<00:02:29.890> partners<00:02:30.370> stand<00:02:30.580> up<00:02:30.760> on<00:02:30.910> it

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
you're boosting partners stand up on it

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.420 
you're boosting partners stand up on it
and<00:02:31.240> bam<00:02:31.870> you<00:02:32.500> just<00:02:32.620> blow<00:02:32.830> them<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.250> it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
and bam you just blow them up and it's

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.990 
and bam you just blow them up and it's
uh<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:34.360> pretty<00:02:34.570> simple<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.610> as<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:39.940> see

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
uh it's pretty simple so as you can see

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.199 
uh it's pretty simple so as you can see
right<00:02:40.270> there<00:02:40.480> but<00:02:40.690> so<00:02:41.410> this<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:42.400> probably<00:02:42.820> I

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
right there but so this is probably I

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.410 
right there but so this is probably I
guess<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.990> more<00:02:44.650> harder<00:02:45.459> one<00:02:45.670> of<00:02:46.000> all<00:02:46.240> these

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
guess the more harder one of all these

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.900 
guess the more harder one of all these
is<00:02:46.900> um<00:02:47.500> the<00:02:47.680> corner<00:02:47.950> takedown<00:02:48.280> kinda<00:02:48.820> had

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
is um the corner takedown kinda had

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.160 
is um the corner takedown kinda had
trouble<00:02:49.180> with<00:02:49.240> this<00:02:49.360> I<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.870> see<00:02:50.020> my

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
trouble with this I see you see my

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.320 
trouble with this I see you see my
partner<00:02:50.410> had<00:02:50.680> no<00:02:51.010> clue<00:02:51.250> how<00:02:51.430> far<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.790> go<00:02:51.910> and

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
partner had no clue how far to go and

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.000 
partner had no clue how far to go and
someone<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.320> have<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.530> get<00:02:53.650> him<00:02:53.770> at<00:02:53.860> the

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
someone you have to get him at the

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.040 
someone you have to get him at the
certain<00:02:54.310> angle<00:02:54.580> where<00:02:55.150> you're<00:02:55.390> able<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.810> press

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
this angle as you can see I could have

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.520 
this angle as you can see I could have
pressed<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.880> right<00:02:57.970> there<00:02:58.180> but<00:02:58.510> I<00:02:58.540> didn't<00:02:58.930> so
