00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this new lens of course packs a little

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.069 
this new lens of course packs a little
punch<00:00:37.920> cuz<00:00:38.250> it's<00:00:38.430> 14<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.239> 42<00:00:39.629> millimeter

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
punch cuz it's 14 to 42 millimeter

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.080 
punch cuz it's 14 to 42 millimeter
instead<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.710> just<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.070> straight<00:00:42.000> 17<00:00:46.879> here<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
instead of just a straight 17 here it is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.880 
instead of just a straight 17 here it is
on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.239> camera<00:00:48.629> brain<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
on the camera brain I see this is on the

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.069 
on the camera brain I see this is on the
little<00:00:50.100> limpa<00:00:50.340> Cpl<00:00:50.760> 3<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.300> doesn't<00:00:51.660> dwarf<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
little limpa Cpl 3 it doesn't dwarf the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.639 
little limpa Cpl 3 it doesn't dwarf the
camera<00:00:52.440> which<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> nice<00:00:54.079> from<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.410> very

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
camera which is nice from the top very

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.740 
camera which is nice from the top very
similar<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.100> quite<00:00:56.250> nicely<00:00:56.460> proportioned<00:00:56.940> one

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
similar is quite nicely proportioned one

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.840 
similar is quite nicely proportioned one

post<00:01:07.710> one<00:01:07.890> okay<00:01:08.490> here's<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.729> comparison<00:01:09.180> for

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
post one okay here's a comparison for

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.109 
post one okay here's a comparison for
the<00:01:09.360> top<00:01:09.540> with<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> 17<00:01:10.170> mil<00:01:10.439> again<00:01:10.909> but<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the top with the 17 mil again but to the

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
the top with the 17 mil again but to the
same<00:01:12.299> sort<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.600> size<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.450> very<00:01:15.450> very<00:01:15.689> usable<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
same sort of size so very very usable in

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.370 
same sort of size so very very usable in
size<00:01:17.240> now<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> show<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.049> switch<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
size now to show you when you switch it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.679 
size now to show you when you switch it
on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> magic<00:01:19.860> happens<00:01:20.189> out<00:01:20.909> comes<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> front

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
on the magic happens out comes the front

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.060 
on the magic happens out comes the front
and<00:01:21.900> suddenly<00:01:22.290> you've<00:01:22.470> got<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> little<00:01:22.890> zoom

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and suddenly you've got a little zoom

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.710 
and suddenly you've got a little zoom
lens<00:01:24.439> they've<00:01:25.439> basically<00:01:25.619> done<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.400> by

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
lens they've basically done this by

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
lens they've basically done this by
making<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.049> focusing<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> zooming

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
making the focusing and the zooming

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
making the focusing and the zooming
power<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:30.900> internal<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.740> lens<00:01:32.009> so<00:01:32.310> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
power so all internal to the lens so you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
power so all internal to the lens so you
don't<00:01:32.640> have<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> rings<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.420> outside<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
don't have the rings on the outside and

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.800 
don't have the rings on the outside and
all<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.049> gearing<00:01:34.350> necessary<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.659> can

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
all the gearing necessary so you can

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.560 
all the gearing necessary so you can
make<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> lens<00:01:37.229> much<00:01:37.470> smaller<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.240> think<00:01:39.240> it's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
make the lens much smaller I think it's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.730 
make the lens much smaller I think it's
really<00:01:39.720> great<00:01:40.049> having<00:01:40.259> been<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> photographer

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
really great having been a photographer

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
something creative with cameras with

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
something creative with cameras with
lens<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:47.009> something<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
lens is something really different and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.700 
lens is something really different and
imaginative<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.439> astonishing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
imaginative this is astonishing

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.999 
imaginative this is astonishing
technology<00:01:50.520> really<00:01:53.780> yes<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.229> lens<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.680> and

now<00:01:56.810> see<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> push<00:01:58.320> it<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.560> wide<00:02:00.200> and<00:02:01.200> back

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
now see I push it to the wide and back

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
now see I push it to the wide and back
it<00:02:02.340> opens<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.759> automatically<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.420> wide

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it opens up automatically on wide

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.330 
it opens up automatically on wide
there's<00:02:04.350> very<00:02:04.649> little<00:02:04.799> difference<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.280> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
there's very little difference in the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.219 
there's very little difference in the
protrusion<00:02:06.020> wide<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.350> telephoto<00:02:08.720> so<00:02:09.720> no

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
protrusion wide or telephoto so no

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.650 
protrusion wide or telephoto so no
problems<00:02:10.709> there

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
problems there

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.500 
problems there
the<00:02:12.660> focusing<00:02:13.260> well<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:13.890> all<00:02:14.040> internal

here<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:31.860> again<00:02:33.200> okay<00:02:34.200> now<00:02:34.350> we're<00:02:34.470> going<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
here it is again okay now we're going to

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.140 
here it is again okay now we're going to
take<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.830> look<00:02:34.980> at<00:02:35.070> how<00:02:35.160> quickly<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:35.610> focuses

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
take a look at how quickly it focuses

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.910 
take a look at how quickly it focuses
I'm<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.870> focus<00:02:37.020> from<00:02:37.320> this<00:02:37.470> spot<00:02:37.680> about

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
I'm going to focus from this spot about

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.070 
I'm going to focus from this spot about
couple<00:02:38.130> of<00:02:38.220> feet<00:02:38.540> two<00:02:39.540> thirds<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.900> meter

quickly<00:02:53.970> it<00:02:54.209> focuses<00:02:54.840> you'll<00:02:54.990> see<00:02:55.170> when<00:02:55.380> I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
quickly it focuses you'll see when I

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.100 
quickly it focuses you'll see when I
press<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.860> button<00:02:55.890> a<00:02:56.750> quick<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.840> picks<00:02:58.020> up

instantaneous close focusing that's what

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.330 
instantaneous close focusing that's what
we<00:03:27.540> get<00:03:27.780> nice<00:03:28.019> as<00:03:28.200> close<00:03:28.410> as<00:03:28.560> it'll<00:03:28.769> go<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.010> the

longest that's on the longest focal link

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.310 
longest that's on the longest focal link
is<00:03:32.100> where<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.310> get<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.459> most<00:03:32.840> view<00:03:33.840> there's

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
is where you get the most view there's

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.690 
is where you get the most view there's
the<00:03:34.530> size<00:03:34.739> of<00:03:34.860> it<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.100> viewfinder<00:03:35.250> so

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
the size of it in the viewfinder so

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.300 
the size of it in the viewfinder so
pretty<00:03:35.940> good<00:03:36.000> there<00:03:36.410> it's<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.530> exactly<00:03:37.830> macro

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
pretty good there it's not exactly macro

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.190 
pretty good there it's not exactly macro
but<00:03:38.519> it's<00:03:38.670> about<00:03:38.940> 22<00:03:39.450> centimeters<00:03:40.050> as<00:03:40.110> they

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
but it's about 22 centimeters as they

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.190 
but it's about 22 centimeters as they
say<00:03:40.380> it<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:41.090> here<00:03:42.090> it<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.269> in<00:03:42.450> fooling<00:03:42.900> around

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
say it is here it is in fooling around

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.070 
say it is here it is in fooling around
