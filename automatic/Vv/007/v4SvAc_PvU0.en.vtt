00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hi, I'm half and welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.359
 for everyone today we are going to do some 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 milk rolls and to do so we are going to 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.550
 need to follow ingredients 250 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.360
 grams of sifted flour ie 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.939
 passed through a sieve with a sieve 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.720
 10 grams of fresh yeast or in my 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:24.340
 case with 5 grams of dry yeast 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.310
 150 milliliters of warm milk 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.910
 40 grams of icing sugar or if you do not have 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.349
 you can use normal sugar 5 grams 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.960
 of salt 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.589
 50 grams of butter at temperature 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.440
 environment cut into cubes and an egg in 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.620
 a container we put 50 grams of the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.129
 flour that we had we add the 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.710
 yeast 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.040
 in my case dry and if it is fresh the 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.190
 crumble and we also add milk 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.039
 it has to be warm and with the help of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.840
 a rod beater we are going to mix it 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.630
 all 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.540
 [Music] 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.640
 once mixed we will put a film 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.770
 or a bathroom that does not release speed and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 let's let it sit for 15 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.460
 minutes in a warm place and without 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.590
 airflows once have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:19.130
 passed the 15 minutes in another container 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.130
 add the rest of the flour the salt 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.500
 and the icing sugar and we're going to mix it 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.880
 all right 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.880
 we add the mixture of the other containers 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.960
 and then we mix again 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.480
 and once mixed let's move on to 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.860
 pass it with the help of hands during 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.860
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.960
 after kneading the dough during 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 10 minutes let's move on to add the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.110
 two of butter integrate them well in 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.110
 mass 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.440
 once integrated the butter 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.900
 just like before we put a film on him 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.760
 cloth and let it rest for a 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.980
 time in a cardio place without currents 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.470
 of air after one hour we are going to 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.010
 cut the dough into 10 equal pieces for 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.010
 make the rolls 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.790
 once we have divided it into ten 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 We have placed the same pieces on a 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.020
 tray with a greaseproof paper or 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.000
 vegetable and now let's move on to give it 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.680
 elongated shape 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.680
 [Music] 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.470
 we will put it like this 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.910
 by the tray and we will do what 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.160
 same with all the bits 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.100
 once we will shape it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.080
 we put a cloth that releases hairs and 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.090
 we are going to let it rest for a 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.280
 hour and a quarter in a place love without 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.960
 drafts has passed an hour and 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.310
 fourth and we're going to put the oven to 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.980
 preheat we put the oven 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.470
 preheated to 210 degrees with heat by 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.840
 up and down we beat the egg and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 with the help of a brush like this 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.240
 how are we going to go painting all our 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.770
 rolls 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.110
 [Music] 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.150
 i 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.920
 once they are painted and the night 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.770
 preheated let's put it in the oven 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.280
 we lower the temperature to 200 degrees and what 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:24.260
 we leave with heat above and below 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.300
 in my case 15 minutes have passed and the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.570
 buns are already made so we're going to 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.880
 take it out once ready we will pass them 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.880
 to a grate to cool 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.270
 once they are cold they are ready to 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.220
