00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.460
 a number forgive half of a number 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.660
 plus its third part 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.690
 what number is chan chan 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.270
 fear intrigue 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.270
 stomachache 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.120
 mechanical energy 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.570
 plus its third part is 15 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.400
 the number is x 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.120
 for half a number like that 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.120
 It represents 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.260
 I go reading and writing in a way 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.670
 that break to what I am reading more 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 its third part 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.460
 3 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.330
 it's 15 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.330
 x 3 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.280
 if a high number of three units 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.770
 three more units of a number the 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.920
 third part is divided to three then 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 nothing I already have an equation 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.409
 the first thing is to read the problem 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.800
 and then interpret it ok you shut up 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.800
 please, I'm recording 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.100
 how do i do this equation 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 least common multiple is 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 of 2 and 3 and 1 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.280
 even if it is not 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.009
 and now I put 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.600
 as I do, I do it like that, 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.510
 of dividing what I do is 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.170
 multiply each term that is each 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 fraction by the least common multiple 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:23.810
 because because that's how it is written when 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.230
 write there is less chance of error 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.370
 and then I do 6 between 2 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.569
 3 xx 3 x 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.710
 6/3 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.850
 2 x x2 x 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.850
 and 6 by 15 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.569
 so I'm left with 3 x 2 x 5 x is 90 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.270
 x is equal to 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.730
 18 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.159
 true that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:03.879
 half of 18 that is 18/29 plus its 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:06.909
 third part which is 18 between 36 is 15 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.420
 Well yes it is true then it is that 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.420
 I have it well 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.720
 2 interpret algebraically what 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:22.340
 put in problem 3 write the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.680
 Equation 4 Solve the equation and 5 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.590
 check that it is well done so 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.860
 result 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:33.510
 logical with the problem that we have done 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.510
 if nobody copies it or nobody does it
