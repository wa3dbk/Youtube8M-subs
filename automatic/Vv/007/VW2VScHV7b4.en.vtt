I'm<00:00:11.610> going<00:00:12.000> to<00:00:12.059> be<00:00:12.150> talking<00:00:12.509> about<00:00:12.570> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I'm going to be talking about the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.350 
I'm going to be talking about the
anatomy<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.590> functions<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> parietal

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
anatomy and functions of the parietal

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.950 
anatomy and functions of the parietal
lobe<00:00:15.859> so<00:00:16.859> let's<00:00:17.039> get<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.520> into<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
lobe so let's get right into it the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.560 
lobe so let's get right into it the
parietal<00:00:19.350> lobe<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.609> can<00:00:20.760> see<00:00:21.029> here<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
parietal lobe as you can see here is

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.620 
parietal lobe as you can see here is
this<00:00:22.410> region<00:00:23.510> right<00:00:24.510> here<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:26.630> we're

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
this region right here and we're

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.870 
this region right here and we're
starting<00:00:28.230> at<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> central<00:00:28.920> sulcus<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.670> goes

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
starting at the central sulcus it goes

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.350 
starting at the central sulcus it goes
down<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.349> inferior<00:00:32.130> end<00:00:32.369> over<00:00:32.940> here

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
down and on the inferior end over here

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.959 
down and on the inferior end over here
we<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.930> lateral<00:00:34.460> cerebral<00:00:35.460> fissure<00:00:35.910> and

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
we have the lateral cerebral fissure and

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.100 
we have the lateral cerebral fissure and
posteriorly<00:00:38.969> we<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.629> parietal

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
posteriorly we have the parietal

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.220 
posteriorly we have the parietal
occipital<00:00:40.790> fissure<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:42.079> separates<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
occipital fissure that separates the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.549 
occipital fissure that separates the
parietal<00:00:43.590> lobe<00:00:43.829> from<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:45.149> occipital<00:00:45.660> lobe

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
parietal lobe from the occipital lobe

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.580 
parietal lobe from the occipital lobe
now<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.160> parietal<00:00:47.730> lobe<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.590> primarily

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
now the parietal lobe is primarily

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.930 
now the parietal lobe is primarily
involved<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.460> perceiving<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.510> processing

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
involved in perceiving and processing

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.520 
involved in perceiving and processing
somatosensory<00:00:53.940> events<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.020> we're<00:00:55.170> talking

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
somatosensory events so we're talking

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
somatosensory events so we're talking
about<00:00:55.649> things<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.280> touch<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.239> temperature

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
about things like touch and temperature

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
about things like touch and temperature
and<00:00:58.289> body<00:00:59.219> position<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.329> pain<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.670> term

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
and body position and pain so the term

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.660 
and body position and pain so the term
that<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> use<00:01:03.359> for<00:01:03.390> body<00:01:03.750> position<00:01:04.350> is

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
that we use for body position is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.789 
that we use for body position is
proprioception<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.930> term<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.530> we<00:01:07.770> use

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
proprioception and the term that we use

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.920 
proprioception and the term that we use
for<00:01:08.490> pain<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:10.549> nociception<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:12.330> appropriate

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
for pain is nociception it's appropriate

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.780 
for pain is nociception it's appropriate
ception<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.710> susceptance<00:01:14.570> are<00:01:15.570> also

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
ception in our susceptance are also

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.940 
ception in our susceptance are also
involved<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> processing<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
involved in the processing of the

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.800 
involved in the processing of the
parietal<00:01:20.880> lobe<00:01:22.369> alright<00:01:23.369> let's<00:01:23.580> go<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.450> little

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
parietal lobe alright let's go a little

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.010 
parietal lobe alright let's go a little
more<00:01:25.110> into<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.970> here<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> most

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
more into that here we have on the most

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
more into that here we have on the most
anterior<00:01:28.530> end<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.670> post<00:01:29.970> central

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
anterior end we have the post central

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.160 
anterior end we have the post central
gyrus<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.520> course<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:33.030> post<00:01:33.360> central

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
gyrus and of course the post central

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.609 
gyrus and of course the post central
gyrus<00:01:34.229> is<00:01:34.920> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.060> posterior<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
gyrus is going to be just posterior to

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.749 
gyrus is going to be just posterior to
the<00:01:37.939> central<00:01:39.079> salsa's<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.409> then<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.549> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the central salsa's and then we have the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.510 
the central salsa's and then we have the
post<00:01:42.030> central<00:01:42.869> sources<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> posterior

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
post central sources on the posterior

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.289 
post central sources on the posterior
end<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.259> gyrus<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.310> function<00:01:48.180> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
end of that gyrus and the function of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.810 
end of that gyrus and the function of
that<00:01:48.420> gyrus<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.170> basically<00:01:49.680> receiving<00:01:50.520> some

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
that gyrus is basically receiving some

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
that gyrus is basically receiving some
esthetic<00:01:51.329> information<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.470> we're<00:01:52.619> talking

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
esthetic information so we're talking

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.039 
esthetic information so we're talking
about<00:01:53.750> kinesthetic<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> tactile

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
about kinesthetic and tactile

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.600 
about kinesthetic and tactile
information<00:01:56.420> kinesthetic<00:01:57.420> meaning<00:01:57.810> body

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
information kinesthetic meaning body

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.850 
information kinesthetic meaning body
movements<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.729> tactile<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> touch<00:02:01.170> so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
movements and tactile would be touch so

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.020 
movements and tactile would be touch so
that<00:02:02.130> information<00:02:03.049> comes<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:05.460> goes<00:02:05.729> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
that information comes in and it goes to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.050 
that information comes in and it goes to
the<00:02:06.149> post<00:02:06.450> central<00:02:07.079> gyrus<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.890> there's<00:02:08.879> some

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the post central gyrus and there's some

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.210 
the post central gyrus and there's some
processing<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> happens<00:02:10.259> there<00:02:10.560> for<00:02:10.860> us<00:02:10.979> to

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
processing that happens there for us to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
processing that happens there for us to
be<00:02:12.180> able<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.480> recognize<00:02:12.870> movement

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
be able to recognize movement

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.570 
be able to recognize movement
of<00:02:14.010> body<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.140> when<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.380> touched<00:02:16.770> we<00:02:17.370> can

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
of body and when we get touched we can

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.130 
of body and when we get touched we can
feel<00:02:17.850> that<00:02:18.120> because<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.720> some<00:02:18.900> of<00:02:19.020> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
feel that because of some of the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.570 
feel that because of some of the
processing<00:02:19.770> that's<00:02:19.920> happening<00:02:20.580> right<00:02:20.760> here

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
processing that's happening right here

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.330 
processing that's happening right here
now<00:02:23.580> of<00:02:23.760> course<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.660> left<00:02:24.990> half<00:02:25.890> of<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> brain

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
now of course the left half of the brain

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.240 
now of course the left half of the brain
so<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:26.940> left<00:02:27.210> post<00:02:27.870> central<00:02:28.380> gyrus<00:02:28.440> is<00:02:29.070> going

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
so the left post central gyrus is going

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.130 
so the left post central gyrus is going
to<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.430> getting<00:02:29.910> information<00:02:30.150> from<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.930> right

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
to be getting information from the right

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.830

inferior parts of the post central gyrus

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.800 
inferior parts of the post central gyrus
and<00:03:21.060> as<00:03:21.690> we<00:03:21.959> go<00:03:22.110> more<00:03:22.250> superior<00:03:23.660> we're<00:03:24.660> going

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
and as we go more superior we're going

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.350 
and as we go more superior we're going
to<00:03:24.870> be<00:03:25.019> starting<00:03:25.320> to<00:03:25.530> get<00:03:26.040> input<00:03:26.610> from<00:03:26.940> the

we're<00:03:32.730> going<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:33.239> towards<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> center<00:03:34.230> of

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
we're going more towards the center of

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.170 
we're going more towards the center of
the<00:03:34.410> brain<00:03:34.830> we're<00:03:35.700> going<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:35.910> be<00:03:36.000> getting

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
information from the lower limbs so it's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.080 
information from the lower limbs so it's
so<00:03:39.330> mater<00:03:39.540> topically<00:03:40.140> organized<00:03:40.709> so<00:03:41.090> specific

so mater topically organized so specific

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.199 
so mater topically organized so specific
parts<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.709> gyrus<00:03:44.400> gets<00:03:44.670> information

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
parts of this gyrus gets information

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.870 
parts of this gyrus gets information
from<00:03:45.540> specific<00:03:46.350> parts<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.950> body<00:03:47.700> and

from specific parts of the body and

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.130 
from specific parts of the body and
you're<00:03:48.000> going<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.150> see<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.540> a<00:03:48.570> lot<00:03:48.810> in<00:03:49.050> the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
you're going to see that a lot in the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.190 
you're going to see that a lot in the
different<00:03:49.530> parts<00:03:49.830> of<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.070> brain<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:51.239> post

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
different parts of the brain so post

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.470 
different parts of the brain so post
central<00:03:52.620> gyrus<00:03:52.680> we<00:03:53.340> spoke<00:03:53.730> about<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.209> and

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
central gyrus we spoke about that and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.140 
central gyrus we spoke about that and
then<00:03:54.750> we<00:03:54.989> have<00:03:55.070> the<00:03:56.070> superior<00:03:56.580> parietal

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
then we have the superior parietal

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.440 
then we have the superior parietal
lobule<00:03:57.840> and<00:03:58.380> of<00:03:59.370> course<00:03:59.910> that's<00:04:00.090> going<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.390> be

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
lobule and of course that's going to be

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.770 
lobule and of course that's going to be
superior<00:04:01.080> and<00:04:01.470> that<00:04:01.940> what<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.120> does<00:04:03.420> is<00:04:03.630> it

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
superior and that what that does is it

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.770 
superior and that what that does is it
integrates<00:04:04.410> sensory<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.430> motor<00:04:05.910> functions

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
integrates sensory and motor functions

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.550 
integrates sensory and motor functions
and<00:04:07.400> then<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.430> have<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:09.320> inferior<00:04:10.320> parietal

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
and then we have the inferior parietal

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.300 
and then we have the inferior parietal
lobule<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.600> can<00:04:12.780> see<00:04:13.019> that<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.590> superior

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
lobule and you can see that the superior

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.849 
lobule and you can see that the superior
and<00:04:14.610> inferior<00:04:14.820> parietal<00:04:15.540> lobule

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
and inferior parietal lobule

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.599 
and inferior parietal lobule
are<00:04:17.390> separated<00:04:18.390> by<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.630> intra<00:04:19.620> parietal

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
are separated by this intra parietal

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.320 
are separated by this intra parietal
solstice<00:04:21.330> intra<00:04:22.169> parietal<00:04:23.070> intra<00:04:23.820> means<00:04:24.030> it's

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
solstice intra parietal intra means it's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.710 
solstice intra parietal intra means it's
inside<00:04:25.050> or<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:26.460> between

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720

parietal<00:04:27.960> the<00:04:28.560> parietal<00:04:28.950> lobe<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.760> that's<00:04:30.060> the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
parietal the parietal lobe so that's the

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.070 
parietal the parietal lobe so that's the
intra<00:04:30.930> parietal<00:04:31.880> salsas<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.060> in<00:04:33.930> the

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
intra parietal salsas and in the

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.130 
intra parietal salsas and in the
inferior<00:04:34.650> parietal<00:04:34.830> lobule<00:04:35.540> you<00:04:36.540> see<00:04:36.810> here<00:04:37.020> we

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
inferior parietal lobule you see here we

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.860 
inferior parietal lobule you see here we
have<00:04:37.290> the<00:04:37.440> supramarginal<00:04:38.190> gyrus<00:04:38.550> and<00:04:39.180> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
have the supramarginal gyrus and the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.760 
have the supramarginal gyrus and the
angular<00:04:40.590> gyrus<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.880> these<00:04:42.450> two<00:04:42.690> gyri<00:04:43.200> receive

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
angular gyrus and these two gyri receive

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.190 
angular gyrus and these two gyri receive
input<00:04:44.460> from<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:45.090> auditory<00:04:45.660> and<00:04:45.870> visual

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
input from the auditory and visual

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.370 
input from the auditory and visual
cortices<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:48.300> course<00:04:48.540> it's<00:04:48.720> processing

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
cortices and of course it's processing

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.530 
cortices and of course it's processing
auditory<00:04:49.620> information<00:04:50.130> and<00:04:50.730> visual

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
auditory information and visual

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.440 
auditory information and visual
information<00:04:51.920> so<00:04:52.920> in<00:04:53.460> order<00:04:53.760> for<00:04:53.910> us<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.030> see

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
information so in order for us to see

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.070 
information so in order for us to see
and<00:04:54.890> hear<00:04:55.890> we're<00:04:56.400> getting<00:04:56.760> information

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
and hear we're getting information

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.310 
and hear we're getting information
through<00:04:58.080> this<00:04:58.520> supramarginal<00:04:59.520> gyrus<00:04:59.910> and<00:05:00.510> the

through this supramarginal gyrus and the
angular<00:05:01.830> gyrus<00:05:02.870> then<00:05:03.870> we<00:05:03.990> have<00:05:04.140> a<00:05:04.170> specialized

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
angular gyrus then we have a specialized

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.850 
angular gyrus then we have a specialized
area<00:05:05.280> that's<00:05:06.000> called<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.540> ver<00:05:06.840> nika's<00:05:07.260> area

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
area that's called the ver nika's area

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.860 
area that's called the ver nika's area
and<00:05:08.070> I<00:05:08.250> know<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.550> looks<00:05:09.210> different<00:05:09.660> that<00:05:09.750> I'm

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
and I know it looks different that I'm

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.750 
and I know it looks different that I'm
pronouncing<00:05:10.140> it<00:05:10.530> but<00:05:11.010> that's<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.280> German

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
pronouncing it but that's the German

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.990 
pronouncing it but that's the German
pronunciation<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:13.070> what<00:05:14.070> that<00:05:14.250> helps<00:05:14.430> us<00:05:14.760> do

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
pronunciation and what that helps us do

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.800 
pronunciation and what that helps us do
is<00:05:15.270> understand<00:05:16.370> spoken<00:05:17.370> language<00:05:18.270> so<00:05:18.450> someone

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
is understand spoken language so someone

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.600 
is understand spoken language so someone
is<00:05:18.930> speaking<00:05:19.230> to<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.370> need<00:05:20.490> to

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
is speaking to you and you need to

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.340 
is speaking to you and you need to
understand<00:05:21.210> what<00:05:21.480> they<00:05:21.630> are<00:05:21.660> saying<00:05:22.050> there's

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
understand what they are saying there's

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.800 
understand what they are saying there's
processing<00:05:23.130> that's<00:05:23.340> happening<00:05:23.910> in<00:05:24.030> the<00:05:24.510> Verna

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
processing that's happening in the Verna

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.340 
processing that's happening in the Verna
kurz<00:05:25.110> area<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:25.920> of<00:05:26.250> course<00:05:26.610> in<00:05:27.540> some<00:05:27.870> cases

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
kurz area and of course in some cases

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.950 
kurz area and of course in some cases
it's<00:05:28.700> difficult<00:05:29.700> to<00:05:29.820> understand<00:05:30.270> some<00:05:30.540> people

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
it's difficult to understand some people

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.050 
it's difficult to understand some people
than<00:05:31.290> others<00:05:31.500> I'm<00:05:32.250> sorry<00:05:32.640> I<00:05:32.730> shouldn't<00:05:33.000> have

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
than others I'm sorry I shouldn't have

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.040 
than others I'm sorry I shouldn't have
done<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:34.190> okay<00:05:35.190> let's<00:05:35.520> continue<00:05:35.669> so<00:05:36.050> if

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
done that okay let's continue so if

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.860 
done that okay let's continue so if
there's<00:05:37.530> damage<00:05:38.190> to<00:05:38.460> this<00:05:38.820> area<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:39.600> if<00:05:39.750> we

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
there's damage to this area so if we

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.650 
there's damage to this area so if we
have<00:05:40.050> like<00:05:40.260> lesions<00:05:40.980> in<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.340> Verna<00:05:41.760> cos<00:05:42.090> area

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
have like lesions in the Verna cos area

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.890 
have like lesions in the Verna cos area
that<00:05:43.380> can<00:05:43.530> result<00:05:43.950> in<00:05:44.130> Verna<00:05:44.970> cause<00:05:45.270> aphasia

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
that can result in Verna cause aphasia

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.460 
that can result in Verna cause aphasia
and<00:05:46.340> what<00:05:47.340> that<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.850> is<00:05:48.230> impairment<00:05:49.230> of

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470 
and what that is is impairment of

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.340 
and what that is is impairment of
comprehension<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.930> repetition<00:05:51.930> so<00:05:52.110> you<00:05:52.169> have

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:52.350 
comprehension and repetition so you have

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.470 
comprehension and repetition so you have
a<00:05:52.380> hard<00:05:52.680> time<00:05:52.830> understanding<00:05:53.480> spoken

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
a hard time understanding spoken

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.500 
a hard time understanding spoken
language<00:05:55.080> because<00:05:55.530> of<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.770> damage<00:05:56.220> in<00:05:56.510> this

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
language because of the damage in this

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.380 
language because of the damage in this
area<00:05:58.350> that's<00:05:58.830> pretty<00:05:59.160> much<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.790> that's<00:06:00.180> all<00:06:00.360> I

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
area that's pretty much it that's all I

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.570 
area that's pretty much it that's all I
want<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.660> cover<00:06:00.810> for<00:06:01.080> this<00:06:01.230> episode<00:06:01.770> as<00:06:01.950> usual
