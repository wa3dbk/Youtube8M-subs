accordingly however i'm just going to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.959 
accordingly however i'm just going to
measure<00:00:48.629> my<00:00:48.899> ambient<00:00:49.440> room<00:00:49.710> lighting<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.940> i

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
measure my ambient room lighting so i

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.010 
measure my ambient room lighting so i
have<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.570> make<00:00:51.719> sure<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:54.020> checkbox

pretty close the color temperature is a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.060 
pretty close the color temperature is a
little<00:02:20.340> high<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:20.880> I'd<00:02:21.030> want<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.390> make

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
little high so I'd want to make

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.090 
little high so I'd want to make
adjustments<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.250> if<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.630> need<00:02:25.100> for

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
adjustments to that if if I need for

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.180 
adjustments to that if if I need for
before<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> start<00:02:27.150> doing<00:02:28.140> color<00:02:28.380> critical<00:02:28.950> work

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190

in that room lighting that's how you

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.930 
in that room lighting that's how you
