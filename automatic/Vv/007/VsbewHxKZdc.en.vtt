00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.349 
useful stuff there you can almost
certainly<00:01:37.979> skip<00:01:38.490> this<00:01:38.609> update<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.149> like

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
certainly skip this update if you like

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:41.300 
certainly skip this update if you like
but<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.869> does<00:01:40.079> supposedly<00:01:40.710> fix<00:01:41.039> some<00:01:41.280> issues

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
but it does supposedly fix some issues

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.459 
but it does supposedly fix some issues
with<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> recent<00:01:42.090> apps<00:01:42.329> button<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> might

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
with the recent apps button so it might

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.349 
with the recent apps button so it might
be<00:01:43.500> worth<00:01:43.770> looking<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> skip<00:01:45.210> it

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
be worth looking at and if you skip it

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.419 
be worth looking at and if you skip it
it's<00:01:45.539> entirely<00:01:45.960> likely<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.070> next

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
it's entirely likely that the next

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.950 
it's entirely likely that the next
update<00:01:47.609> will<00:01:47.759> bundle<00:01:48.119> list<00:01:48.359> along<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.840> as

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
update will bundle list along with it as

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
update will bundle list along with it as
well<00:01:49.109> so<00:01:49.439> yeah<00:01:50.070> maybe<00:01:50.880> someone<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:51.420> come

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
well so yeah maybe someone will come

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.120 
well so yeah maybe someone will come
along<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.869> mirror<00:01:52.289> it<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.590> rip<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.890> all<00:01:52.920> that

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
