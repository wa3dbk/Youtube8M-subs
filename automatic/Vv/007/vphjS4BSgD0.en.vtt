00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.600
 60% from cardboard or plastic clay 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.940
 the remainder is a chemical mixture of the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.440
 half is gunpowder and the other 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.460
 half chemicals that color 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 do n't cause that fireworks 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.150
 we all know is harmless 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.310
 but how bad is it really for 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.440
 the environment 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.900
 yes it is good to be there my quiet too 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.070
 especially decorative fireworks is harmful 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.110
 for the environment 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.850
 as you heard, the colors become pole 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.070
 by composing a number 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 chemicals and I have them here for a moment 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.840
 before you get it listed 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.250
 of course some heavy metals 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.500
 to this are some of those heavy ones 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.780
 metals are of course a whole bunch and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.310
 they then give a number of colors with 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.370
 especially the lower two 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.470
 strontium and barium are all those links 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 have since been replaced substances 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.360
 for found but the one just not 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.850
 of those very beautiful colors where 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.700
 bangers buy fabrics free it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.500
 promote the greenhouse effect in particular co2 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.240
 but if you compare it to a year 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.090
 production of cars and industry 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.249
 That is not too bad because he is already stuck 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 can remember is the New Year's Eve 

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:16.619
 92 93 a thick layer of fog and smog 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.929
 then over the Netherlands but how 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.029
 something like that actually arises 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.700
 well i can explain that on the basis of 

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:25.979
 the next card I have here 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.549
 there is always in the air and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.529
 amount of water vapor that water vapor that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.270
 can condense into small drugs or does 

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:36.749
 that just not but what happens now 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.659
 on New Year's Eve then comes with all the fireworks 

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.520
 an incredible amount of dust in it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.829
 the air and all that water vapor that attracts 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.599
 to that substance its condensation 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.249
 particles what happened then is that 

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.319
 basically all that 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.419
 dust particles then form droplets 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:53.310
 it becomes as if it were mist on the 

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:54.419
 Earth is going to fall and I'm just going to you 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.700
 all the way 

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:59.849
 a kind of fog and you are that fog 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.029
 not so very cool for now 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:05.219
 well in the coming days that chance of missing 

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.989
 not so very big and burning 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.550
 ask steering committee this year with old and old 

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:10.739
 new is going to happen 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.000
 and then we go now we look at now well 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.890
 this is from yesterday 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.440
 This is team that the world is worse 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.030
 Alps is drawn that sits 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.130
 yesterday then above the Balkans east 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.990
 europe you see it further 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.670
 pulling away is to the east 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.860
 we had showers from the North Sea 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.300
 push as land entered we must already 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.790
 looking further west again 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.100
 to the ocean there is a terrible one 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.330
 large club with clouds and also one 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.400
 number of malfunctions 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.040
 in addition to some showers at the moment 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.230
 gradually move above our country 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.850
 away but you see that malfunction is already whole 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.350
 come closer quickly 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.330
 tomorrow afternoon it will be above the British 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.720
 Islands plotting a lot 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.610
 clouds and rain by the way and also 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.600
 here so healing southwest there is just sitting there 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.880
 just a little 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.620
 low pressure area down a small disturbance 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.090
 pay on the bright islands 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.920
 that would take a few showers 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.170
 can cause the temperatures 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 contact us beautiful tomorrow 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.580
 grade 5 or something like today 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.870
 and actually what the rain we respect 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.310
 sit just on the edge of a whole 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.110
 large area 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.790
 almost everywhere in the whole 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.490
 Mediterranean Sea approach such 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.410
 there is still a strip across it 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.820
 some showers and that the enormous rain shower 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.290
 above the british islands 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.780
 that will come gradually 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 about our country through some snow in the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.800
 alps tomorrow name northern parts 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.180
 not so very much we and it 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.450
 best weather you actually feel like it 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.250
 the riviera and the costa the necessary cost 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.930
 table also the southern costa 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.400
 there still fall from time to time 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.110
 some showers and basically the whole through it 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.790
 western europe is just still 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.860
 what on the changeable side of course 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.110
 from would be the song this afternoon at one o'clock 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.780
 The Netherlands still partly in sin 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.370
 were showers and as long as the wind 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.010
 come from the northwest 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.470
 those showers or always towards us 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.590
 at least the case of 8 is so although the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.600
 most of the showers in the coastal provinces will 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.100
 continue to fall and die inland 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.510
 which as it were a bit out of it 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.820
 southeast of the country that will 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.200
 mostly dry tonight wind 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.269
 falls to a large extent out of it again 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.060
 also means a fog bank can 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:09.500
 and yes here and there of course 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.450
 because right on the ground timbuktu anyway 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.100
 again at the freezing point just comes 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.420
 underneath it can be smooth locally 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.419
 of course also during the winter showers 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.820
 may that be the case start tomorrow 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.160
 we actually just so it is the country 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.660
 largely or follows a single winter 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.240
 rain north of the country further 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.620
 because a whole few than the best 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.400
 we gradually get more out 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.900
 clouds and tomorrow afternoon it's normal 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.010
 rainy clouds a lot of rain one 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.070
 grade or 5 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.120
 a moderate southwest wind and then after 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.550
 tomorrow 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.350
 slightly changeable weather not of the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.780
 harsh world are quite dry 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.280
 periods are thereby 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.840
 and then of course is interesting because 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.450
 that will happen with the New Year 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:54.300
 and that is a bit in between 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.550
 Friday so I think New Year's Day 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.110
 a rainy day is Saturday 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.970
 New Year's Day there will also be some showers 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.050
 are just going to fall between them 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.210
 that New Year's Eve 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.920
 I think he's just mostly dry 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.200
 whistled very quietly with others 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.880
 words there is therefore a chance of fog again 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.050
 sip or how it could want 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.090
 to mention 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.830
 temperatures are about normal for this 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.260
 about five or six at the time of the year 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.550
 degrees one day during the night 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:20.190
 grade or 2 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.110
 finally our announcement again 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.300
 because from January 1 we will go again 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.550
 move your earth continue for hours 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:29.040
 but we go to one every day 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.390
 namely another time at around 10 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.200
 for seven crystal a very pleasant one 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.590
 evening 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.590
 see you tomorrow
