00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
and start with rolling it you can

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.570 
and start with rolling it you can
actually<00:01:50.790> glue<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.300> if<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:54.680> now<00:01:55.680> with

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
spiral flowers and that you don't start

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.460 
spiral flowers and that you don't start
from<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> outside<00:01:59.190> from<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.899> inside<00:02:01.320> you

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
from the outside from the inside you

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.340 
from the outside from the inside you
start<00:02:01.710> from<00:02:01.800> the<00:02:02.009> outside<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:03.960> i'm<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.259> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
start from the outside so i'm going to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.800 
start from the outside so i'm going to
put<00:02:04.500> those<00:02:04.710> two<00:02:05.130> outside<00:02:05.670> parts<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.420> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
put those two outside parts on there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.479 
put those two outside parts on there
like<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:09.410> just<00:02:10.410> start<00:02:10.769> rolling<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
like that and just start rolling it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.910 
like that and just start rolling it
around<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.380> little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.680> fiddly

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
around and can get a little bit fiddly

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.009 
around and can get a little bit fiddly
so<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:15.660> have<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.080> have<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> play<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.620> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.970 

there<00:02:22.019> we<00:02:22.320> go<00:02:22.500> so<00:02:22.950> it's<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.430> roll

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.910 

I<00:02:29.069> just<00:02:29.700> keep<00:02:29.909> going

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.650 

now<00:02:33.920> I've<00:02:34.220> done<00:02:34.430> this<00:02:34.580> also<00:02:34.880> with<00:02:35.890> material<00:02:37.660> as

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
now I've done this also with material as

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.760 
now I've done this also with material as
well<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.050> could<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.350> it<00:02:39.410> two<00:02:39.620> different

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
well you could do it two different
