to break into some kind of inside

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.110 
to break into some kind of inside
movement<00:03:55.480> okay<00:03:56.079> which<00:03:56.980> allows<00:03:57.549> me<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:57.850> come

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120

rolling okay now I want to regrip right
now<00:04:14.019> I'm<00:04:14.169> not<00:04:14.380> just<00:04:14.620> talking<00:04:14.859> about

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
now I'm not just talking about

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.310 
now I'm not just talking about
regrouping<00:04:15.280> my<00:04:15.519> fingers<00:04:15.940> time<00:04:16.660> we<00:04:16.780> regroup<00:04:17.079> my

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
regrouping my fingers time we regroup my

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.230 
regrouping my fingers time we regroup my
some<00:04:17.530> where<00:04:18.190> is<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.460> pressure<00:04:18.700> right<00:04:19.000> now<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:19.240 
some where is the pressure right now the

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.810 
some where is the pressure right now the
pressures<00:04:19.720> all<00:04:19.840> right<00:04:20.110> here<00:04:20.500> okay<00:04:20.860> so<00:04:21.310> I<00:04:21.340> can

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
pressures all right here okay so I can

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.240 
pressures all right here okay so I can
probably<00:04:22.030> wait<00:04:22.360> all<00:04:22.390> my<00:04:22.600> fingers<00:04:23.020> with<00:04:23.830> not

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
probably wait all my fingers with not

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.800 
probably wait all my fingers with not
too<00:04:24.430> much<00:04:24.580> difficulty<00:04:25.000> I<00:04:25.150> can<00:04:25.360> probably<00:04:25.510> get<00:04:25.780> a

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
too much difficulty I can probably get a

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.540 
too much difficulty I can probably get a
couple<00:04:26.020> good<00:04:26.320> finger<00:04:26.680> rips<00:04:27.040> in<00:04:27.220> there<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
couple good finger rips in there and

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.680 
couple good finger rips in there and
it's<00:04:27.700> gonna<00:04:27.760> be<00:04:27.940> fabulous

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
it's gonna be fabulous

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.110 
it's gonna be fabulous
but<00:04:29.260> I'm<00:04:29.440> thinking<00:04:29.740> why<00:04:30.310> would<00:04:30.340> ever<00:04:30.760> like<00:04:30.970> to

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
but I'm thinking why would ever like to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.500 
but I'm thinking why would ever like to
get<00:04:31.270> my<00:04:31.420> thumb<00:04:31.720> higher<00:04:32.620> up<00:04:32.890> okay<00:04:33.670> cuz<00:04:34.300> then

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
get my thumb higher up okay cuz then

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.080 
get my thumb higher up okay cuz then
it's<00:04:34.720> gonna<00:04:34.840> be<00:04:35.050> so<00:04:35.290> much<00:04:35.470> easier<00:04:35.550> but<00:04:36.550> it's

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
it's gonna be so much easier but it's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.850 
it's gonna be so much easier but it's
really<00:04:37.390> hard<00:04:37.600> to<00:04:37.690> do<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:37.870> when<00:04:38.440> he's<00:04:38.590> holding

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
really hard to do that when he's holding

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.360 
really hard to do that when he's holding
on<00:04:38.950> to<00:04:38.980> me<00:04:39.130> like<00:04:39.160> that<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.240> can<00:04:40.960> switch<00:04:41.530> with

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
on to me like that so I can switch with

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.090 
on to me like that so I can switch with
my<00:04:42.490> pyramid<00:04:42.850> okay<00:04:43.540> I<00:04:43.780> can<00:04:44.500> I<00:04:44.590> can<00:04:44.740> be<00:04:44.770> on<00:04:44.950> this

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
my pyramid okay I can I can be on this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.940 
my pyramid okay I can I can be on this
side<00:04:45.370> and<00:04:46.060> I<00:04:46.150> can<00:04:46.330> cross<00:04:46.540> over<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.200> can<00:04:47.710> cross

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
side and I can cross over I can cross

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.470 
side and I can cross over I can cross
right<00:04:48.190> over<00:04:48.250> and<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.610> can<00:04:48.760> switch<00:04:48.970> to<00:04:49.000> an<00:04:49.210> inside

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
right over and I can switch to an inside

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.230 
right over and I can switch to an inside
technique<00:04:49.930> and<00:04:50.470> I<00:04:50.680> can<00:04:50.860> even<00:04:51.010> come<00:04:51.340> right<00:04:52.090> down

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
technique and I can even come right down

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.940 
technique and I can even come right down
underneath<00:04:52.600> them<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:53.080> for<00:04:53.200> a<00:04:53.260> second<00:04:53.650> real

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
underneath them just for a second real

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.520 
underneath them just for a second real
scary<00:04:54.310> sometimes<00:04:54.630> but<00:04:55.630> if<00:04:55.780> you<00:04:55.930> do<00:04:56.140> it<00:04:56.320> if<00:04:56.410> you

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
scary sometimes but if you do it if you

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.050 
scary sometimes but if you do it if you
have<00:04:56.680> enough<00:04:56.950> control<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.670> match<00:04:57.820> is

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
have enough control and the match is

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.700 
have enough control and the match is
like<00:04:58.270> real<00:04:58.630> tight<00:04:58.990> you<00:04:59.020> know<00:04:59.350> one<00:04:59.530> of<00:04:59.560> those

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
like real tight you know one of those

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.650 
like real tight you know one of those
good<00:05:00.010> matches<00:05:00.520> where<00:05:00.700> it's<00:05:00.880> like<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.540> know

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
good matches where it's like you know

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:02.880 
good matches where it's like you know
who's<00:05:01.900> going<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.140> win<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.350> there's<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.740> lot<00:05:02.860> of

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
who's going to win and there's a lot of

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.290 
who's going to win and there's a lot of
pressure<00:05:03.160> and<00:05:03.400> things<00:05:03.550> are<00:05:03.700> moving<00:05:03.880> very<00:05:04.060> much

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
pressure and things are moving very much

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.590 
pressure and things are moving very much
if<00:05:04.750> you<00:05:05.290> come<00:05:05.530> in<00:05:05.740> real<00:05:05.920> quick<00:05:06.250> okay<00:05:07.150> what<00:05:07.510> it

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
if you come in real quick okay what it

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.210 
if you come in real quick okay what it
does<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.990> changes<00:05:08.020> where<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.710> pressure<00:05:08.950> is

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
does is it changes where the pressure is

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.750 
does is it changes where the pressure is
so<00:05:10.000> very<00:05:10.690> slow<00:05:11.050> okay<00:05:11.320> very<00:05:11.500> slow<00:05:11.860> here<00:05:12.430> we<00:05:12.580> are

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
so very slow okay very slow here we are

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.990 
so very slow okay very slow here we are
don't<00:05:13.540> move<00:05:13.690> ready<00:05:13.990> go<00:05:14.230> okay<00:05:14.680> right<00:05:15.190> now<00:05:15.370> we're

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
pretty balanced okay we both have

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.490 
pretty balanced okay we both have
pressure<00:05:18.190> in<00:05:18.490> our<00:05:19.060> fingers<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:19.720> in<00:05:20.110> our<00:05:20.230> hands

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
pressure in our fingers and in our hands

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.250 
pressure in our fingers and in our hands
okay<00:05:20.710> close<00:05:21.430> match<00:05:21.820> okay<00:05:22.240> I'm<00:05:22.750> gonna<00:05:22.870> try<00:05:23.110> and
