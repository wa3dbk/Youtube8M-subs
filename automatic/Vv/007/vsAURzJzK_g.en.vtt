00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:06.284
 Hello! What's up friends! Welcome to my channel, the recipe of grandma. Today we are going to do, 

00:00:06.284 --> 00:00:12.059
 a basic recipe, for many desserts, what are we going to do, Christmas is coming and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.619
 I am preparing myself, to leave you videos, to have enough time, to do, 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.060
 In this occasion we are going to make a pastry cream, which later we will use it, to 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.590
 make tartlets, to make a French dessert called pate a choux, which you will love, 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.280
 I am sure and good, thank you very much to all the people, who leave me their comments, 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.510
 I thank you very much, also when you subscribe to the channel, that helps me a lot 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.960
 and well I have no choice but to thank all of you, for supporting me. The ingredients 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:04.800
 are super easy, 1 liter of milk or 4 cups, 80 grs or 2.8 ounces of cornstarch, from the 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:13.140
 that has no flavor, more or less if they have a scale, this is a measure of a spoonful, 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.939
 would be 8 of these, not the reason because otherwise they would be less, just as I am teaching them, 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:30.950
 a little copeaditas 8, 1 cup of sugar, 8 egg yolks and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.680
 that's all we're going to need, the first thing we're going to do is we're going to boil 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:44.200
 milk and while the milk is boiling, let's go with the rest, which is going to be very 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:54.399
 simple, let's put the eggs, the yolks in a bigger bolw, let's mix with 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:03.750
 the sugar, with a balloon or a blender, as you want to do, we are going to mix, 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:14.360
 what are the yolks with the sugar, okay now I show them when I finish, as they can 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.250
 observe, the yolks are already well mixed with the sugar, I will add what is the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:29.740
 vanilla and what is being maizena or as you know it in other places, is this 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:41.300
 feccula of corn and again I'm going to start mixing, because 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:57.300
 we do not want, no grumo, look I do not take any minute mixing vigorously, obviously with 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:08.170
 strength, you can also support by putting a rag, as well and putting it like that for 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.900
 that does not move them, well then well, we have to stay, all well incorporated, that 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:26.760
 do not see any cornstarch, because otherwise the cream will have lumps, at this point the milk 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.790
 is already wanting to boil, you can see some bubbles, I'll wait a little more 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.840
 and we're going to add it, as you can see the milk is already boiling, I'm going to lower it 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:50.650
 at least, well, since I lower it to the fire, I'm going, I'm going to temper the egg, which means 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.560
 temper? for those of us who do not know, I did not know either, right? but I'm hardly here, cultivating, 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:03.850
 true? Well look, here I have the egg mixture, if I give you the egg at this point 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.820
 there, a lot of things can happen, because this is an egg, so what we are going to do is 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:18.100
 that we are going to take, some of the milk, of which it is very hot, is boiling and 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:25.939
 we are going to add it to this mixture, about 2 tablespoons of it, we are going to mix it very 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:31.960
 all right! Here you can see, more clearly, what we are going to do, is that, we are going to raise 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.819
 the temperature, here to the egg because if we make it from, that fast, the eggs will 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:46.199
 They can cook us and it is a disaster. Then just mix this very well, since it started 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:53.610
 grab temperature, because I already mix well, with milk, what we are going to do, is that it is 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:01.720
 mix, we will add it to the other mixture, which should already be on low heat, quickly 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.520
 we incorporate it and quickly we will move it, also what you can use, in 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:19.819
 this case, is being, well, a miserable one, which are these, to incorporate everything very, very 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:28.949
 all right! Then do not stop moving, remember that the fire, is down, is not 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:37.180
 very hot the flame, is as you can see, is short, then we will continue 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:46.669
 here for about 2 or 3 minutes, until the mixture has become thicker. As they can 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:57.180
 see, the more we give it, the longer the lines are seen, it is already thickening. Go 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.629
 to say, good Jessica, because even when, I'll be moving me here, right? good and the test 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:11.020
 to know that it is already, is to put a spoon, draw a line and if the line does not come together, 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.639
 that they turn the spoon so up and down, is that it is already. It only takes 5 or 6 minutes, no, 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:26.699
 It does not take much and good, here is our pastry cream, I'm going to let it warm 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:31.819
 and I'm going to put it in the refrigerator, since it's warm and we can store it there, for what 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:37.622
 we want to use it Even warm can be used, but we have to wait, that 

00:06:37.622 --> 00:06:43.189
 warm, good friends, this has been the recipe for the custard and how I had them 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:48.050
