00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
toolkit also known as expert so the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.519 
toolkit also known as expert so the
problem<00:00:15.450> usually<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.170> you<00:00:16.379> have

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
problem usually is that you have

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:17.630 
problem usually is that you have
something<00:00:16.800> like<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.250> your<00:00:17.340> machine

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
something like this on your machine

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.150 
something like this on your machine
which<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.480> have<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> couple<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.410> CPUs<00:00:19.859> here

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
which is I have a couple of CPUs here

manager allows you to drill in here and
see<00:00:27.269> well<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.170> application<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> it's

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
see well it's this application and it's

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
see well it's this application and it's
certain<00:00:29.429> amount<00:00:29.640> of<00:00:29.699> time<00:00:29.939> here<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:30.990> one

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
certain amount of time here we have one

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.319 
certain amount of time here we have one
of<00:00:31.410> our<00:00:31.500> cores<00:00:31.920> at<00:00:32.070> any<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.399> time<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.850> busy<00:00:33.180> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
of our cores at any one time is busy so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.170 
of our cores at any one time is busy so
where<00:00:34.079> do<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.260> go<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.180> can

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
where do you go from here you can

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.389 
where do you go from here you can
right-click<00:00:36.450> create<00:00:36.870> some<00:00:37.170> dump<00:00:37.380> files<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
right-click create some dump files but

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.760 
right-click create some dump files but
there's<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:38.850> easier<00:00:39.149> way<00:00:39.379> expert<00:00:40.379> flowes<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
there's an easier way expert flowes you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's an easier way expert flowes you
to<00:00:40.860> dig<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> process<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.090> get

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to dig into the process and get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.200 
to dig into the process and get
information<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.379> very<00:00:44.340> rich<00:00:44.610> function

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
information like this very rich function

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569 
information like this very rich function
level<00:00:45.480> detail<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
level detail so that I can see in this

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.080 
level detail so that I can see in this
case<00:00:47.789> each<00:00:48.360> CPU<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:49.489> calling<00:00:50.489> function<00:00:50.850> one

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
case each CPU is calling function one

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
case each CPU is calling function one
two<00:00:51.570> three<00:00:52.140> four<00:00:52.440> five<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.160> six<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.760> ends<00:00:54.420> up

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
two three four five and six and ends up

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
two three four five and six and ends up
with<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> call<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.770> tick<00:00:55.980> count<00:00:56.160> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
with this call to get tick count and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.849 
with this call to get tick count and
that's<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.210> I'm<00:00:57.300> doing<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> loop<00:00:57.960> which

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
that's what I'm doing in a loop which

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.689 
that's what I'm doing in a loop which
Cocoon<00:00:59.250> consumes<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> bulk<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.329> CPU<00:01:00.809> time

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
Cocoon consumes the bulk of my CPU time

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.420 
Cocoon consumes the bulk of my CPU time
so<00:01:02.699> how<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.420> level<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.809> detail

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
so how do we get to this level of detail

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.190 
so how do we get to this level of detail
alright<00:01:05.430> well<00:01:05.610> let<00:01:05.729> me<00:01:05.820> show<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
alright well let me show you so you

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.880 
alright well let me show you so you
install<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.310> tool<00:01:08.369> kit<00:01:09.020> via<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.560> Windows

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
seven SDK what that's going to do is

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.700 
seven SDK what that's going to do is
crank<00:01:14.549> up<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.760> web<00:01:14.970> installer<00:01:15.560> that's<00:01:16.560> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
crank up the web installer that's the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890 
crank up the web installer that's the
easiest<00:01:16.950> way<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.400> rather<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
easiest way to do this rather so that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
easiest way to do this rather so that
you're<00:01:19.020> only<00:01:19.170> installing<00:01:19.830> these<00:01:19.979> components

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
you're only installing these components

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
but again we have to warn you there so

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.870 
but again we have to warn you there so
we<00:02:57.570> do<00:02:57.810> to<00:02:57.990> look<00:02:58.410> at<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> trace<00:02:58.860> well<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.730> can

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
we do to look at the trace well you can

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.540 
we do to look at the trace well you can
use<00:03:00.060> any<00:03:00.240> vista<00:03:00.660> or<00:03:00.690> higher<00:03:01.080> machine<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.890> view

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
use any vista or higher machine to view

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.310 
use any vista or higher machine to view
the<00:03:02.670> trace<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.150> just<00:03:03.570> has<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:03.990> internet

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
the trace it just has to have internet

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.870 
the trace it just has to have internet
connectivity<00:03:04.740> so<00:03:05.070> we<00:03:05.190> can<00:03:05.310> do<00:03:05.400> our<00:03:05.550> symbol

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
connectivity so we can do our symbol

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.530 
connectivity so we can do our symbol
resolution<00:03:06.350> but<00:03:07.350> essentially<00:03:08.300> that's<00:03:09.300> all

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
resolution but essentially that's all

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.910 
resolution but essentially that's all
you<00:03:09.690> need<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.410> other<00:03:10.500> words<00:03:10.709> you<00:03:10.800> can

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
you need so in other words you can

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.440 
you need so in other words you can
capture<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.430> trace<00:03:11.640> on<00:03:11.790> one<00:03:11.940> machine<00:03:12.090> and

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
capture the trace on one machine and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.760 
capture the trace on one machine and
view<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.660> on<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:12.780> other<00:03:12.990> no<00:03:13.200> problem<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.500> one

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
view it on the other no problem so one

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.100 
view it on the other no problem so one
thing<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.040> mention<00:03:17.160> about<00:03:17.370> symbols<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.150> should

you<00:04:57.960> probably<00:04:58.319> will<00:04:58.560> have<00:04:58.590> module<00:04:59.129> and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
you probably will have module and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.369 
you probably will have module and
function<00:04:59.639> and<00:04:59.789> make<00:05:00.599> sure<00:05:00.750> you're<00:05:00.930> sorted<00:05:01.259> by

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
function and make sure you're sorted by

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:07.129 
function and make sure you're sorted by
weight<00:05:04.819> so<00:05:05.819> as<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.240> mentioned<00:05:06.539> earlier<00:05:06.599> you

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
weight so as I mentioned earlier you

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.830 
weight so as I mentioned earlier you
might<00:05:07.319> not<00:05:07.500> have<00:05:07.909> some<00:05:08.909> good<00:05:09.240> stack<00:05:09.509> traces

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.059 
might not have some good stack traces
here<00:05:10.490> like<00:05:11.490> I've<00:05:11.669> got<00:05:11.939> because<00:05:12.840> one<00:05:13.289> you<00:05:13.740> may

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:14.069 
here like I've got because one you may

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:15.950 
here like I've got because one you may
have<00:05:14.219> had<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.520> have<00:05:14.729> set<00:05:15.090> disable<00:05:15.629> paging

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
have had to have set disable paging

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.070 
have had to have set disable paging
executive<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:17.250> didn't<00:05:17.580> do<00:05:17.699> so<00:05:17.909> so<00:05:18.719> that's<00:05:18.840> one

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
executive and didn't do so so that's one

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.649 
executive and didn't do so so that's one
reason<00:05:19.490> but<00:05:20.490> you<00:05:20.610> can<00:05:20.789> still<00:05:21.000> get<00:05:21.150> information

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
reason but you can still get information

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.309 
reason but you can still get information
here<00:05:21.930> because<00:05:22.650> notice<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:24.080> I've<00:05:25.080> got<00:05:25.110> a

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
here because notice that I've got a

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.040 
here because notice that I've got a
module<00:05:25.860> and<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.669> function<00:05:27.090> here<00:05:27.330> because<00:05:28.020> I

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
module and a function here because I

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.350 
module and a function here because I
have<00:05:28.259> symbols<00:05:28.620> resolved<00:05:29.129> that<00:05:30.029> I'm<00:05:30.120> getting

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
have symbols resolved that I'm getting

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.749 
have symbols resolved that I'm getting
functional<00:05:30.779> level<00:05:31.020> detail<00:05:31.400> so<00:05:32.400> that<00:05:32.550> could

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 
functional level detail so that could

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.040 
functional level detail so that could
still<00:05:32.969> be<00:05:33.090> enough<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.449> flag<00:05:33.659> your<00:05:33.840> top

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
still be enough to flag your top

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.980 
still be enough to flag your top
consumer<00:05:34.439> of<00:05:34.680> CPU<00:05:35.069> given<00:05:35.370> a<00:05:35.460> given<00:05:35.610> process<00:05:38.990> so

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
consumer of CPU given a given process so

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.450 
consumer of CPU given a given process so
if<00:05:40.199> you<00:05:40.349> didn't<00:05:40.620> have<00:05:40.770> symbols<00:05:41.159> for<00:05:41.279> this

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
if you didn't have symbols for this

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.100 
if you didn't have symbols for this
stack<00:05:41.699> here<00:05:41.729> another<00:05:42.240> reason<00:05:42.659> would<00:05:42.990> have

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
stack here another reason would have

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.200 
stack here another reason would have
been<00:05:43.289> maybe<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.520> don't<00:05:44.759> have<00:05:44.909> symbols

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
been maybe that you don't have symbols

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.209 
been maybe that you don't have symbols
for<00:05:45.449> it<00:05:45.569> maybe<00:05:45.840> it's<00:05:46.020> not<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.199> Microsoft<00:05:46.770> binary

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
for it maybe it's not a Microsoft binary

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.629 
for it maybe it's not a Microsoft binary
maybe<00:05:47.669> it's<00:05:47.849> a<00:05:47.909> third<00:05:48.090> party<00:05:48.120> function<00:05:48.949> and<00:05:49.949> it

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
maybe it's a third party function and it

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.809 
maybe it's a third party function and it
or<00:05:51.000> third<00:05:51.210> party<00:05:51.449> DLL<00:05:51.810> so<00:05:52.190> you<00:05:53.190> would<00:05:53.370> see<00:05:53.580> just

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:53.819 
or third party DLL so you would see just

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.779 
or third party DLL so you would see just
the<00:05:54.029> name<00:05:54.509> of<00:05:54.539> it<00:05:54.839> such<00:05:55.500> as<00:05:55.909> each<00:05:56.909> CPU<00:05:57.270> and<00:05:58.789> then

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
the name of it such as each CPU and then

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.219 
the name of it such as each CPU and then
you<00:05:59.940> would<00:06:00.120> see<00:06:00.300> maybe<00:06:00.479> a<00:06:00.569> question<00:06:00.960> mark<00:06:01.139> or

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:01.229 
you would see maybe a question mark or

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.119 
you would see maybe a question mark or
nothing<00:06:01.529> here<00:06:02.599> but<00:06:03.599> that's<00:06:03.779> okay<00:06:04.080> what<00:06:04.979> do<00:06:05.039> you

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:05.129 
nothing here but that's okay what do you
