 begin to uncover the first rooms 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.820
 with jelly bean and good this time 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.380
 I'll show this to omega 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.419
 samsung galaxy s3 what good versions 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.180
 that roland on the internet say that it is 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.980
 an official version then this 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.950
 Average meeting is based on the latter 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.100
 firmware the launched samsung 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.899
 in days gone by right now I am 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.510
 setting quickly and he just 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.640
 to finish installed then you have to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.920
 configure we're going to skip some 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.710
 steps that do not have much to do 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.800
 to be able to quickly access what 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.289
 will be the interface that good does not change 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.730
 it's still yours louis we're going to 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.380
 see the help texts and 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.820
 let's go into the configuration to 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.190
 to see that it is indeed about 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:08.869
 this room custom and we are running 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:13.490
 the version of android 4.1.1 and the ipi that 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.860
 we can see these little beans that good 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.479
 we can have fun there while throwing 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.479
 the everywhere 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.600
 leaving back 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:30.580
 show them that this is the number of 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.280
 compilation xx of lh 7 equal of the 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.610
 base band then it is the last film 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.229
 samsung we can see what to access 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.900
 quickly to the explanations for not 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.470
 Changes a lot 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.210
 and saying the same thing already comes surrounded by 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.700
 so we have the application of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.360
 strooper its installed here some 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.950
 extra applications too 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.940
 and let's try the camera 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.140
 we have to work 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.190
 and properly 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 we have to move 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.710
 ok let's take a picture 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.330
 and ready can access it 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.160
 quickly 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.670
 as you can see the camera works 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.240
 perfectly 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.660
 there is the picture that we have taken well 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.440
 we can do are and return 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.850
 what else can we see on this route the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.990
 truth is that there are not many changes 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.410
 physical fact as mentioned 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.900
 omega is based on the stock room 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.090
 from samsung so they do not add like that 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.080
 much we can see the texts of help to the 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.310
 moment that we unlock there is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.330
 let's quickly access 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.330
 something that has been 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.030
 the messages we can see that it does not change 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.560
 much the day reading is still the same 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.860
 that has been driving us we are a 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.200
 correct contact interface of 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.750
 same way does not change much but there 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.330
 is 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.840
 let's quickly access 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.650
 but good 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.650
 let's open 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.430
 everyone 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.090
 the widgets we have perfectly 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.130
 placed everything works perfectly 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.230
 it shows a little faster in terms of 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.870
 speed compared to the version 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.690
 of mix and it shows a little more 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.060
 most fluid difference the effects of 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:44.480
 transition and everything that has to do 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.940
 with the graphical interface 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.690
 let's see around here that we have 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.709
 perfectly the options to minimize 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.959
 the videos works perfectly and 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.270
 it moves pretty well we got the 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:03.160
 swords bad and nothing 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:06.150
 let's close it extra king 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.820
 ok let's see the bar 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.820
 notifications as it's been driving 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.900
 from this 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.299
 we are registering the device we 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.690
 we stopped seconds and ready 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:27.169
 ok now if the bar notifications of 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.389
 it is driving a change in the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.389
 shortcuts to wifi to liu feet 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.800
 and everything that has to do with 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.229
 shortcuts 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.259
 we have menus that do not change from 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.289
 done but also a little bit more 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:46.840
 ordered we have a special for 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.230

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:55.800
 fast way and they work to the 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.800
 perfection 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.230
 let's see what else we have here 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.640
 the applications we are going to open 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.850
 quickly the explorer to see 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.860
 that also works properly and it 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.300
 opens pretty well let's access 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.300
