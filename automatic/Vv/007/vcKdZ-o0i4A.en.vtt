00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.380 
kids died off before going over there
because<00:03:29.700> everyone<00:03:30.700> tries<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.940> go<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
because everyone tries to go to that

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.210 
because everyone tries to go to that
corner<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.870> feel<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:32.890> rare<00:03:33.190> that

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
corner and I feel that it's rare that

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.910 
corner and I feel that it's rare that
people<00:03:33.670> even<00:03:34.269> try<00:03:34.510> to<00:03:34.540> run<00:03:35.260> over<00:03:35.410> here<00:03:35.650> but

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
people even try to run over here but

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.060 
people even try to run over here but
it's<00:03:36.220> more<00:03:36.400> safer<00:03:36.910> because<00:03:37.750> no<00:03:37.930> one<00:03:38.110> if<00:03:38.769> people

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
it's more safer because no one if people

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.890 
it's more safer because no one if people
don't<00:03:39.220> run<00:03:39.370> over<00:03:39.400> here<00:03:39.760> then<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.269> have<00:03:40.390> a<00:03:40.420> higher

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
don't run over here then I have a higher

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.710 
don't run over here then I have a higher
chance<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.290> surviving<00:03:41.830> till<00:03:42.459> the<00:03:42.580> end<00:03:42.700> and<00:03:42.910> now

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
chance of surviving till the end and now

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.720 
chance of surviving till the end and now
as<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:43.930> can<00:03:44.049> see<00:03:44.110> the<00:03:44.290> survivors<00:03:44.830> are<00:03:45.070> getting

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
as you can see the survivors are getting

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.330 
as you can see the survivors are getting
killed<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:47.560> actually<00:03:48.010> kind<00:03:48.310> of
