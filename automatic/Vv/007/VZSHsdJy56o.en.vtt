00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.220 
start integrating her in with them and
she<00:02:15.819> starts<00:02:16.120> getting<00:02:16.360> out<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.569> hand<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.080> can

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
she starts getting out of hand we can

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.750 
she starts getting out of hand we can
throw<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.620> command<00:02:17.950> at<00:02:18.129> her<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.430> hopefully

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
throw that command at her and hopefully

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.880 
throw that command at her and hopefully
she'll<00:02:19.150> respond<00:02:19.540> by<00:02:20.140> stopping<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:20.709> she's

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
she'll respond by stopping what she's

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.530 
she'll respond by stopping what she's
doing<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.370> waiting<00:02:21.819> for<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.060> different

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
doing and waiting for a different

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.690 
doing and waiting for a different
command<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.019> she's<00:02:23.290> refocused<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.220> not

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
command so she's refocused and not

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.960 
command so she's refocused and not
getting<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.239> hand

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
