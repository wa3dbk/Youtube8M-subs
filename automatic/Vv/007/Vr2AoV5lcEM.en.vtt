nothing nothing on a banana hobby all
right<00:03:57.310> so<00:03:57.610> it's<00:03:58.830> in<00:03:59.830> it's<00:04:00.010> banana<00:04:00.310> hobby<00:04:00.549> esc

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
right so it's in it's banana hobby esc

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.229 
right so it's in it's banana hobby esc
is<00:04:01.480> not<00:04:01.690> functioning<00:04:02.230> properly<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:03.120> see<00:04:04.120> what

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
is not functioning properly and see what

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.430 
is not functioning properly and see what
they're<00:04:04.390> going<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.600> do<00:04:04.750> hopefully<00:04:05.049> they<00:04:05.350> will

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
they're going to do hopefully they will

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.900 
they're going to do hopefully they will
not<00:04:05.530> replace<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.190> one<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:08.230> right<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.579> that's

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
not replace this one all right so that's

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.930 
not replace this one all right so that's
what<00:04:10.150> we<00:04:10.269> got<00:04:12.150> to<00:04:13.150> get<00:04:13.299> nothing<00:04:14.820> nothing<00:04:15.820> on

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
what we got to get nothing nothing on

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.050 
what we got to get nothing nothing on
the<00:04:16.060> ASC<00:04:16.919> all<00:04:17.919> right<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.220> that'll<00:04:18.579> Beth<00:04:18.729> do<00:04:18.910> it

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
the ASC all right so that'll Beth do it

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:25.500 
the ASC all right so that'll Beth do it
with<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.299> video<00:04:21.810> right<00:04:22.810> here<00:04:24.060> motor<00:04:25.060> and

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
with this video right here motor and

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.770 
with this video right here motor and
everything<00:04:26.020> else<00:04:26.530> seems<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.860> be<00:04:27.010> fine<00:04:27.780> it's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
everything else seems to be fine it's

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.170 
everything else seems to be fine it's
making<00:04:28.990> some<00:04:29.320> clicking<00:04:29.770> noise<00:04:29.979> into<00:04:30.460> I<00:04:30.789> think

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
making some clicking noise into I think

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.580 
making some clicking noise into I think
that's<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.450> esc<00:04:34.950> throttle<00:04:35.950> right<00:04:36.610> there<00:04:37.590> all

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
that's a esc throttle right there all

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:46.760 
that's a esc throttle right there all
right<00:04:40.950> there<00:04:41.950> it<00:04:42.070> is

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.400 

all<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:47.980> I<00:04:48.220> just<00:04:48.550> wanted<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.880> get<00:04:49.060> a<00:04:49.410> video

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
all right I just wanted to get a video

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.200 
all right I just wanted to get a video
of<00:04:50.650> what<00:04:50.680> the<00:04:51.070> motor<00:04:51.310> does<00:04:51.580> when<00:04:51.850> we<00:04:51.940> put<00:04:52.180> a

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
of what the motor does when we put a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.650 
of what the motor does when we put a
little<00:04:52.420> force<00:04:53.350> on<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.740> motor<00:04:53.980> like<00:04:54.250> that

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
little force on the motor like that

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.960 
little force on the motor like that
little<00:04:56.190> g-force<00:04:58.980> was<00:04:59.980> making<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.460> grinding

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
little g-force was making a grinding

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.180 
little g-force was making a grinding
noise<00:05:01.270> sounded<00:05:01.930> like<00:05:02.080> a<00:05:02.140> magnet<00:05:02.710> was<00:05:02.860> coming

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
noise sounded like a magnet was coming

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:38.960 
noise sounded like a magnet was coming
off<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:05.820> inside<00:05:06.820> the<00:05:07.030> motor<00:05:07.210> so<00:05:07.630> here<00:05:08.170> we<00:05:08.290> go

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.850 

so<00:05:39.970> to<00:05:40.300> me<00:05:40.449> that<00:05:40.660> sound<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.990> like<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.199> bad<00:05:41.530> motor

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
so to me that sound of like a bad motor

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.689 
so to me that sound of like a bad motor
in<00:05:42.099> there<00:05:42.900> see<00:05:43.900> that<00:05:44.139> that's<00:05:44.560> with<00:05:44.889> my<00:05:45.130> castle

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
in there see that that's with my castle

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.379 
in there see that that's with my castle
creation<00:05:46.330> ESC<00:05:47.550> motor<00:05:48.550> sounds<00:05:49.030> like<00:05:49.180> it's

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
creation ESC motor sounds like it's

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:52.050 
creation ESC motor sounds like it's
grinding<00:05:49.720> inside<00:05:50.380> there<00:05:50.740> causing<00:05:51.610> a<00:05:51.849> high

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
grinding inside there causing a high

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:10.439 
grinding inside there causing a high
load<00:05:52.300> on<00:05:52.569> that<00:05:52.810> now

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:17.309 

I<00:06:14.789> hope<00:06:15.789> I<00:06:15.909> got<00:06:16.090> enough<00:06:16.150> good<00:06:16.629> video<00:06:16.960> for<00:06:17.289> that

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
I hope I got enough good video for that

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:21.480 
I hope I got enough good video for that
um<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:18.009> got<00:06:18.969> to<00:06:19.089> take<00:06:19.210> the<00:06:19.389> motor<00:06:19.629> apart<00:06:19.960> and<00:06:20.490> see

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
um I got to take the motor apart and see

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.369 
um I got to take the motor apart and see
while<00:06:21.699> it's<00:06:21.939> doing<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.300> it<00:06:22.599> just<00:06:23.080> sounds

00:06:23.369 --> 00:06:23.379 
while it's doing that it just sounds

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:25.439 
while it's doing that it just sounds
like<00:06:23.529> it's<00:06:23.710> a<00:06:24.009> something's<00:06:24.789> coming<00:06:24.999> loose<00:06:25.240> in

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:25.449 
like it's a something's coming loose in

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.799 
like it's a something's coming loose in
the<00:06:25.539> motor<00:06:25.779> grinding<00:06:26.680> and<00:06:27.639> then<00:06:28.089> take<00:06:28.479> part

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:28.809 
the motor grinding and then take part

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.079 
the motor grinding and then take part
motor<00:06:29.139> and<00:06:29.379> hopefully<00:06:30.309> get<00:06:30.460> it<00:06:30.580> replaced<00:06:30.819> by

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:31.089 
motor and hopefully get it replaced by

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:43.930 
motor and hopefully get it replaced by
banana<00:06:31.419> alright<00:06:31.990> thanks<00:06:32.499> for<00:06:32.529> watch

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940
