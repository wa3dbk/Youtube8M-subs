00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 half if I am not mistaken 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.959
 yes that means we're flanking now 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.660
 of course with a header 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:21.000
 weak that would be with me the ben everyone 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.019

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.600

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.840
 thought I'm coming over is still 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.130
 my children allowed but close 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.239
 idiot stops 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.930

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:56.090

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:59.900
 oha both where my darling hofer 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:03.329
 No eleven I did not do anything 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.489
 I only pressed iks 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:11.600
 so that he fits the path that was one 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.600
 very small rempler 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.960
 1 0 for him at half-time maybe 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.540
 I can still make up for that 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.750
 whistle so small hook there sounded hook 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.330
 but his bones are always here as well 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.560
 always in between , but now 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.560
 now it has to work 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.750
 So he got through no, I'm like that 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.520
 come through nice but I still have 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.990
 a corner you need it the corner must 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.810
 sit there we have half-time 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:50.020
 the compensation 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:54.040
 the computer comes my god so whistle 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:56.590
 So it remains 1 0 for him and now 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.850
 bring me my little joker when I am 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.070
 I realize having difficulty and so 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.040
 then then usually the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:10.450
 braithwaite out for stupid who stepped up 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.690
 again the defense with silver and thereby 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.130
 it can stay that way first then look 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.730
 we will 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.520
 last time where I like stupid 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.450
 came in, that was a normal one 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.630
 friendly 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.630
 there was a draw and then I have 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:32.440
 13 minutes time their debut as show 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:35.050
 times like you without help if through 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.430
 Just run through and stay 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.120
 not stand on the spot when I die 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:43.630
 send gorgeous gorgeous 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.010

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:49.110
 i only come now this is mine 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.110
 chance my songs 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.150
 I knew I did not know where I was 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.509
 did not know where to go 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:04.120
 now can come 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:08.180
 He beheads him a kind of jump into arms 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:12.590
 or so is also very nice 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.189
 sascha is now running with me 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.560
 not calculated 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:21.439
 help no so now but now slowly 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.840
 But time is the coach how far comes 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.819
 one with the keeper from barely ten 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.069
 minutes each village not be true what 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.319
 you happen I just make me shit 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:32.289
 just shit everybody was there 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.219
 beginner any wind that was well 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:41.029
 that 's it jumps a bit baffled me 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:42.830
 I'm a bit of what he got me the 500k 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:44.719
 thus given me even already in the run 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.219
 if he does not care anymore 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:50.749
 then he wins a mill directly 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:56.919
 Back and always shit no matter 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:56.919
 every time a corner that's all time 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:05.979
 you me yes it is clear you are clear 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:21.170
 away because I shot mine but 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:23.270
 what are you looking at the uni steers me 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.260
 So this raises a pizza then runs down 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:29.930
 otherwise well least officer at least 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:33.290
 honorable strike so get shows what else 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:35.500
 What else do I expect you will not get 

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.500
 in order to 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.970
 this much chaos the company 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.509
 this conclusion 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:55.050
 this committee of the best striker the 

00:06:51.509 --> 00:06:57.680
 I logically says lohse war 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.600
 still one becomes yes now he whistles 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:04.169
 So he definitely played well 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.669
 you can not say anything against me but me 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:07.949
 just found it sad that with me 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:10.139
 he went almost nothing forward 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:12.500
 Now get a miller from me because 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:15.449
 He already said that in advance 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.729
 500,000 given to me for safety 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:19.139
 hedging so to speak so there he is the 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:25.380
 player has set up there for one 

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:27.060
 million zack away and the thrust times 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.590
 right off so people that 's it with the 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:31.260
 Unfortunately today's vader lost 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.740
 but what the hell happens I am 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.410
 curious; excited 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.419
 against whom the next wales take place 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:41.060
 I will say goodbye for today 

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:41.060
 Only win euro until next time 3
