00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.779
 new phone that brings us movilnet and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.279
 this time is the zte 795 in advance 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.460
 I tell you it's a range phone 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.109
 Very low at a price of 1,650 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.199
 bolivars should be achieved in that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.939
 price in the showcases of movilnet la 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 truth is a phone very, very, very 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.750
 basic good in the box you manage to score 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.059
 we have a layout of a telephone 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.829
 quite simple and here does not tell me 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 more nothing is a gsm phone and well let's 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.040
 to know him better and let's start 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.970
 unpacking 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.640
 well this box comes very but very 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.590
 compressed everything well in a very place 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.000
 we're going to take things out in 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.610
 order the first thing we have here is the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.920
 movilnet gift bag 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.620
 in an ecological bag here we have 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.719
 the team 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.360
 as I tell you very, very, very, very, very 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.580
 simple 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.990
 and here it shows that he has a camera 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.880
 digital 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.729
 it's really obvious to say that 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 digital camera key says it 's movilnet 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.229
 this phone is unique mobile 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.700
 let's leave it here and now 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.399
 we started to take out all the small 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:25.039
 things that the battery brings here we are going to 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:27.430
 Take it out at once so you can turn it on 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.430
 the phone 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.900
 this battery is 1,200 thousand pesos a 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 capacity 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 very small thousand 200 thousand inverse 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.900
 we continue to see over here 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.290
 3.5 mm hands-free 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.600
 Quick and certified use guide 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.600
 warranty 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 microusb cable 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.960
 in the adapter for the charger 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.970
 just like all the zetas 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.790
 and finally the service guide of 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 movement does not bring anything more notice everything 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.840
 I came in this little box 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.300
 pretty good we're going to get back in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.080
 all inside the lid box 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.970
 what it has inside and what we see is a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.970
 slot for a sim card here is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.160
 and brings a memory brings it and is 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.700
 a micro sd of 4gb brand toshiba 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.750
 there you can see better a micro sd 4 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.140
 gigas toshiba brand let's introduce 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.140
 Battery 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.780
 and let's see that the operating system has 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.780
 this phone we are going to turn it on 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.799
 At least I see that it is not a telephone 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.799
 so old since the android system 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.129
 well maybe the operating system is not 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:14.329
 so old from what I see already above 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:16.920
 they can tell you that it is a 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:18.360
 low-end phone 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.830
 and good for the price you can not 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.599
 expect much more are one thousand six hundred 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.090
 fifty bolivars very little money for 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:26.950
 a phone we hope you can 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.720
 get and the right price 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:34.629
 ok let's unlock it here and 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.900
 so let's review here in the 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.579
 settings in the settings 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.579
 let's see here about the device 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.390
 and we have a version of android 4.2.2 and 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.390
 the inning is quite current 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.560
 really no no no no I would not 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.710
 ok let's cinnamon in dubai clark to 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.430
 know the hardware characteristics 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.430
 of this team 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:17.040
 to make here we have a ztv 795 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:22.020
 Android 4.2.2 a mtk 6 572 processor 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.300
 gpu malÃ­ 400 a resolution of 320 x 480 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.790
 very, very low resolution of the 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.660
 screen one the only camera that you have 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.160
 3.1 megapixels a total ram of 473 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.610
 megas used that means 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.080
 is 502 the rest is for the system 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.600
 here the internal memory if it shows us 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.160
 that we have 127 gigs and we have enough 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.470
 available or you want to say no 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.020
 I should have a lot of trouble in the 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.900
 cpu we have two nuclei to a giga hertz 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.600
 very good 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.650
 and in the gpu we have the density of 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:56.630
 pixels is 160 is very simple 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.850
 really and good here more information 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.720
 on the camera we do not have the resolution 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.729
 is 2048 x 1536 and good for that 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.009
 show the sensors nothing nothing very 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.350
 important really a phone very 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:11.160
 simple but it's worth knowing 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.860
 and what 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.300
 is the new thing that brings us mobile already in its 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.260
 showcases and for a price of a thousand 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.280
 six hundred and fifty bolivars 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.890
 I really do not have much of what 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.170
 complain because a pretty phone 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.420
 simple could be the perfect gift 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.130
 for anyone who loves 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:30.930
 start in the android world and well 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.450

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.170
 thorough review to see what is done 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.950
