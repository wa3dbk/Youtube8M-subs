she got a goal

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.309 
she got a goal
it's<00:06:22.289> 3-1<00:06:22.860> and<00:06:23.129> he<00:06:23.759> scores<00:06:24.180> in<00:06:24.509> injury<00:06:24.899> time<00:06:25.080> in

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
it's 3-1 and he scores in injury time in

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.859 
it's 3-1 and he scores in injury time in
the<00:06:25.379> second<00:06:25.680> half<00:06:25.830> which<00:06:26.219> I<00:06:26.689> don't<00:06:27.689> really

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:27.869 
the second half which I don't really

00:06:27.869 --> 00:06:29.420 
the second half which I don't really
think<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:28.199> can<00:06:28.379> complain<00:06:28.710> about<00:06:28.770> that<00:06:29.189> because

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.689 
think I can complain about that because
