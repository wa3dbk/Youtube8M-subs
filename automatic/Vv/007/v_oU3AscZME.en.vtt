fishtail braid next you're going to take
a<00:00:25.920> very<00:00:26.189> thin<00:00:26.490> section<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:28.230> side<00:00:28.529> i'm

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
a very thin section from one side i'm

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500 
a very thin section from one side i'm
starting<00:00:29.250> off<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.580> left<00:00:29.880> side<00:00:30.119> for

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
starting off on the left side for

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.450 
starting off on the left side for
example<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.140> you're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:31.980> cross<00:00:32.189> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
example and you're going to cross it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.310 
example and you're going to cross it
over<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> opposite<00:00:33.390> side<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.930> this<00:00:34.079> case

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
over to the opposite side in this case

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.810 
over to the opposite side in this case
i'm<00:00:34.530> crossing<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> over<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> right<00:00:35.790> side

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
i'm crossing it over to the right side

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.479 
i'm crossing it over to the right side
and<00:00:36.420> then<00:00:36.930> you're<00:00:37.110> going<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> hold<00:00:38.100> those<00:00:38.250> two

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
and then you're going to hold those two

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.639 
and then you're going to hold those two
pieces<00:00:38.670> together<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:40.020> cross<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.320> piece

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
pieces together and then cross a piece

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.229 
pieces together and then cross a piece
from<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> right<00:00:41.129> side<00:00:41.399> move<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.210> left

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
from the right side move it to the left

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.660 
from the right side move it to the left
side<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.559> forth<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.550> you're

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
side and so on and so forth and you're

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.369 
side and so on and so forth and you're
just<00:00:44.700> going<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.120> repeat<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.230> over

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
just going to repeat this over and over

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
just going to repeat this over and over
until<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.980> get<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> nice<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:47.910> fishtail

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
until you get that nice little fishtail

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.069 
until you get that nice little fishtail
braid<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.700> i<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:51.420> noticed<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
braid and i have noticed that the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
braid and i have noticed that the
smaller<00:00:52.410> section<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.309> use<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:54.300> more

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
smaller section you use the more

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.959 
smaller section you use the more
detailed<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.410> fishtail<00:00:55.920> braid<00:00:56.129> will<00:00:56.460> look

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
detailed your fishtail braid will look

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.479 
detailed your fishtail braid will look
and<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.690> my<00:00:58.109> opinion<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.829> better<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.340> will

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
and in my opinion the better it will

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.060 
and in my opinion the better it will
look<00:00:59.730> if<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.629> use<00:01:00.989> larger<00:01:01.530> sections<00:01:01.949> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
look if you use larger sections you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.609 
look if you use larger sections you
definitely<00:01:02.640> will<00:01:02.820> finish<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> lot<00:01:03.390> faster<00:01:03.619> but

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
definitely will finish a lot faster but

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.100 
definitely will finish a lot faster but
it<00:01:04.650> won't<00:01:04.890> look<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.900> if<00:01:06.900> you're

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it won't look as pretty now if you're

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
it won't look as pretty now if you're
comfortable<00:01:07.350> with<00:01:07.619> braiding<00:01:08.340> all<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> way

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
comfortable with braiding all the way

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
comfortable with braiding all the way
down<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.090> length<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.420> your<00:01:09.479> hair<00:01:09.630> go<00:01:10.020> ahead

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
down the length of your hair go ahead

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.640 
down the length of your hair go ahead
and<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.369> for<00:01:11.549> me<00:01:11.670> I<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.180> tired<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and do so but for me I got tired and I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.440 
and do so but for me I got tired and I
don't<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.250> would<00:01:14.549> ever<00:01:14.580> braid<00:01:15.180> all

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
don't think that I would ever braid all

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.719 
don't think that I would ever braid all
the<00:01:15.479> way<00:01:15.689> down<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> fishtail<00:01:16.830> braid<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.400> I

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the way down with a fishtail braid but I

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.140 
the way down with a fishtail braid but I
just<00:01:18.360> tied<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.229> then<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> was<00:01:19.830> done

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
just tied it here and then I was done

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.550 
just tied it here and then I was done
the<00:01:21.150> next<00:01:21.479> braid<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.780> we're<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> work

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the next braid that we're going to work

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
the next braid that we're going to work
on<00:01:22.770> is<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.460> Dutch<00:01:23.909> braid<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:25.080> that

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
on is the Dutch braid and that's that

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.929 
on is the Dutch braid and that's that
braid<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.710> kind<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.220> looks<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.580> they're

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
braid that kind of looks like they're

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.850 
braid that kind of looks like they're
dimensional<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.049> sticks<00:01:28.350> out<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
dimensional or like it sticks out and

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.030 
dimensional or like it sticks out and
the<00:01:29.460> way<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.670> achieve<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.329> is<00:01:30.630> by<00:01:31.040> braiding

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
the way you achieve this is by braiding

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010 
the way you achieve this is by braiding
under<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.150> you're<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> cross<00:01:33.689> them

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
under so you're going to cross them

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.649 
under so you're going to cross them
under<00:01:34.500> each<00:01:34.650> other<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.180> cross<00:01:36.420> them

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
under each other and as you cross them

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.929 
under each other and as you cross them
under<00:01:37.049> you're<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> add<00:01:37.950> sections<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
under you're going to add sections of

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
under you're going to add sections of
hair<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.869> again<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.860> smaller<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
hair to it and again the smaller the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.130 
hair to it and again the smaller the
sections<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.119> more<00:01:42.299> detailed<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.899> braid

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sections the more detailed your braid

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.679 
sections the more detailed your braid
will<00:01:43.350> appear<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.950> again<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:45.000> opinion<00:01:45.329> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
will appear and again in my opinion the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.590
