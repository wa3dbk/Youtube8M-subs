00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.039
 No one on the backstage program in partnership with the 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.039
 Today's program let's help you choose how you're going to buy 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.510
 there is doubt that it afflicts most new mac users and sometimes even 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.160
 the old is the choice of which model will be your first or if the new mac 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.090
 the choice is not as complex as choosing a pc 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.420
 today you have a well delineated product line 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.550
 according to your needs 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.560
 this product line is divided into two parts 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.680
 in the course that wreckage 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.560
 the notebook is made for those who need portability while the desktop is for 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.310
 who does not need portability what is the best performance for their 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.310
 Professional activities 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.400
 the mac book air is the laptop that makes any other computer looks 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.130
 instigating to be versions of 11 and 13 inches and was made for who needs 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.650
 very mobile but does not give way to performance 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.240
 is another little thinner and lighter in the world 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.760
 with its Intel Core 2 Duo processor 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.800
 lss buying solid apartments 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.100
 which makes the application access speed increase by greatly improving your 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.110
 operation 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.880
 and decreasing its opening time 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.259
 but this computer is not suitable for people who need to use masks 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.460
 that use a lot of processor like making complete editions in videos the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.120
 corinthians 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.470
 it is important to know that because he is too young he does not have a reader 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.470
 from dvd 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.340
 is the traditional and the only method with time 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.329
 with so little better performance 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.690
 this netbook is one that you do everything a little 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.980
 is better for carts than the ones on the munique processor but still has a 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.409
 modest performance 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.409
 and professional applications 

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.279
 different from mac power 

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:13.279
 This is the first time that can be useful for many users. 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.989
 has a 3-inch screen effect of a single white plastic block 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:25.389
 they are crazy for whoever is of power 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.930
 made of aluminum also records dvd expediente with the screens of 13 15 and 17 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:31.269
 inches 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.239
 as I have said is mainly for professionals with back wages 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.269
 with its core i5 and core i7 processors 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.810
 this is the powerful glass door 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.270
 with the replica uncle of the video editing professionals that aldo without 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.649
 no problem 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:49.560
 has a slightly saltier price 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 but what is worth for its quality and power 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.229
 The interesting thing about Apple's product line is that the 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:00.229
 way or another look very much like desktops 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:07.350
 mac mini is a small and cheap computer 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.260
 which performs moderately 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.709
 But how do I want to? 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.099
 do not expect it to hold programs that we are very processor 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.369
 it's cheap but something that can be bad is that it does not come with screen 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:20.409
 keyboard or morocco 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.419
 for those who already have experience and liquids 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.829
 do not need a lot of power or need a small computer 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.819
 This is a perfect mac. 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.419
 many also use as media center 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.559
 connecting your hdmi connection directly to tv 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:43.719
 the apple cannon integrates cpu directly into the screen using the keyboard and 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:45.179
 wireless mouse 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.059
 is the mac that comes with the intention of keeping your table organized 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:51.559
 no strings pass through the table 

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:56.099
 in a perfect situation the only thread that will need to go to your lament of 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.659
 truth is the energy 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.139

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.869

 and is a machine made for those who need to do a little more work 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.359
 heavy 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.889
 but you want everything as nice and organized as possible 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.910
 this is the most powerful computer in the entire apple product line using 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.170
 used on the mind incredibly fast then ground 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.759

 is the computer so money is no problem they understand what all 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.990
 an interesting thing from the apple product line 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.380
 is that for the whole group has a desktop equivalent 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.800
 it is as if both were made for the same type of user only one for 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.800
