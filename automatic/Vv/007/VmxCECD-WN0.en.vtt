intense<00:00:44.940> training<00:00:45.210> for<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.110> see

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
intense training for this we just see

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.160 
intense training for this we just see
everybody's<00:00:47.219> like<00:00:47.399> works<00:00:48.360> every<00:00:48.539> single<00:00:48.719> day

as much as time they can removed if they

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.360 
as much as time they can removed if they
take<00:01:05.260> it<00:01:05.350> really<00:01:05.500> seriously<00:01:05.710> this<00:01:06.130> time

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
we lost and they actually took it to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.810 
we lost and they actually took it to
heart<00:01:11.200> they<00:01:11.470> thought<00:01:11.680> they<00:01:12.310> felt<00:01:12.520> humiliated
