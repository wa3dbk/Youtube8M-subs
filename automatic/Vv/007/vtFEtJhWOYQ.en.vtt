now<00:00:05.870> for<00:00:06.170> this<00:00:06.350> test<00:00:06.910> hmm<00:00:07.910> a<00:00:08.980> viewer<00:00:09.980> asked<00:00:10.400> me

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:10.870 
now for this test hmm a viewer asked me

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.949 
now for this test hmm a viewer asked me
what<00:00:11.870> I<00:00:11.900> thought<00:00:11.990> of<00:00:12.230> using<00:00:12.650> cor<00:00:13.400> is<00:00:13.730> a

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
what I thought of using cor is a

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.260 
what I thought of using cor is a
collective<00:00:14.959> life<00:00:15.160> and<00:00:16.160> my<00:00:16.400> answer<00:00:16.550> was<00:00:16.700> welds

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
collective life and my answer was welds

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:25.010 
collective life and my answer was welds
the<00:00:17.330> either<00:00:17.510> way<00:00:17.800> let's<00:00:18.800> find<00:00:18.980> out<00:00:20.890> so

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.210 

working<00:00:26.020> on<00:00:26.080> try<00:00:26.350> it<00:00:28.230> yes<00:00:29.230> this<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.740> distilled

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
working on try it yes this is distilled

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.970 
working on try it yes this is distilled
water<00:00:30.460> and<00:00:30.580> here<00:00:31.090> goes<00:00:31.210> the<00:00:31.270> first<00:00:31.599> tablespoon

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.400 

well<00:00:38.640> i<00:00:38.670> sees<00:00:43.040> see<00:00:44.040> some<00:00:44.309> hydroxy<00:00:44.940> production

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.310 

going<00:00:49.130> on<00:00:49.250> very<00:00:49.460> large<00:00:49.760> mouth<00:00:50.090> and<00:00:50.930> it<00:00:51.200> looks

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
going on very large mouth and it looks

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.850 
going on very large mouth and it looks
like<00:00:51.410> it's<00:00:51.530> creating<00:00:52.070> home<00:00:52.900> that's<00:00:53.900> two

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
like it's creating home that's two

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.020 
like it's creating home that's two
tablespoons<00:00:55.550> per<00:00:55.850> gallon<00:00:57.790> now<00:00:58.790> we're<00:00:58.940> going

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
tablespoons per gallon now we're going

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.100 
tablespoons per gallon now we're going
to<00:00:59.090> try<00:01:01.300> now<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:02.480> will<00:01:02.629> be<00:01:02.750> just<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:03.080> little

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
to try now this will be just a little

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:10.150 
to try now this will be just a little
short<00:01:07.810> probably<00:01:08.810> three<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.650> half<00:01:09.710> let's

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
short probably three and a half let's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.859 
short probably three and a half let's
add<00:01:10.310> a<00:01:10.340> little<00:01:10.520> more<00:01:13.330> that's<00:01:14.330> a<00:01:14.450> big<00:01:14.630> four

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
add a little more that's a big four

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:25.070 
add a little more that's a big four
tablespoons<00:01:15.470> per<00:01:15.710> gallon

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.930 

man

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.080 

IC<00:01:28.720> production<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:33.280> looks<00:01:33.460> like<00:01:33.550> it's<00:01:33.790> making

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
IC production it looks like it's making

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:59.430 
IC production it looks like it's making
phone

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:13.840 

I<00:01:59.530> was<00:02:00.070> I<00:02:00.130> guess<00:02:00.310> register<00:02:00.760> in<00:02:00.820> about<00:02:01.030> two<00:02:01.300> amps

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.060 

here's<00:02:14.480> another<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:15.050> sort<00:02:15.320> of<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.500> tablespoon

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
here's another just sort of a tablespoon

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:26.100 
here's another just sort of a tablespoon
and<00:02:16.670> see<00:02:16.910> what<00:02:17.120> happens

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.810 

okay<00:02:26.710> that's<00:02:26.980> equivalent<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.610> six

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
okay that's equivalent of six

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:40.140 
okay that's equivalent of six
tablespoons<00:02:28.210> for<00:02:28.660> Calum

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.960 

and<00:02:40.689> it<00:02:41.170> looks<00:02:41.319> like<00:02:41.379> what<00:02:41.650> CLR<00:02:42.129> does<00:02:42.370> is<00:02:42.670> it

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
and it looks like what CLR does is it

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:53.900 
and it looks like what CLR does is it
makes<00:02:43.000> foam

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:01.030 

doesn't<00:02:54.750> stay<00:02:54.930> foamed<00:02:55.970> but<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.120> makes<00:02:57.270> phone

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.290 

seems<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.190> in<00:03:02.340> just<00:03:02.520> a<00:03:02.610> few<00:03:02.760> minutes<00:03:02.940> that's

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
seems like in just a few minutes that's

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.240 
seems like in just a few minutes that's
built<00:03:03.630> up<00:03:03.750> about<00:03:04.080> a<00:03:04.140> quarter<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.740> an<00:03:04.890> inch<00:03:05.010> of

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
built up about a quarter of an inch of

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:24.080 
built up about a quarter of an inch of
it<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:10.700> bring<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:11.820> down<00:03:23.090> production

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
it and to bring this down production

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:33.150 
it and to bring this down production
isn't<00:03:24.420> particularly<00:03:24.780> high<00:03:25.230> either

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.410 

now<00:03:33.850> I'm<00:03:34.000> going<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.210> add<00:03:34.390> one<00:03:34.720> more<00:03:35.170> tablespoon

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
now I'm going to add one more tablespoon

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:48.390 
now I'm going to add one more tablespoon
let's<00:03:37.420> see<00:03:37.540> what<00:03:37.660> we<00:03:37.780> get<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.860> makes<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:48.220> as

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
let's see what we get that makes it as

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.300 
let's see what we get that makes it as
close<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.850> tablespoon<00:03:49.420> is<00:03:49.570> going<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.050> get

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
close to a tablespoon is going to get

00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:03.090 
close to a tablespoon is going to get
this<00:03:51.310> makes<00:03:51.610> 8<00:03:52.030> tablespoons<00:03:52.860> per<00:03:53.860> gallon

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.590 

as<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:04.210> can<00:04:04.360> see<00:04:04.690> it<00:04:05.410> is<00:04:06.100> producing<00:04:06.730> gas<00:04:07.090> but

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
as you can see it is producing gas but

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:30.800 
as you can see it is producing gas but
it's<00:04:07.870> also<00:04:08.350> producing<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.070> lot<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.340> poem

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.690 

well<00:04:31.810> I'd<00:04:32.020> say<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.380> foam<00:04:32.590> component<00:04:33.250> renders

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
well I'd say the foam component renders

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:49.050 
well I'd say the foam component renders
the<00:04:34.030> clr<00:04:34.750> unsuitable<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.530> an<00:04:35.650> elector<00:04:36.010> white

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.120 

you
