00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
think of it as a lick or you know shape

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.570 
think of it as a lick or you know shape
or<00:02:32.720> whatever<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:33.140> run<00:02:33.500> but<00:02:34.130> if<00:02:34.250> you<00:02:34.340> start<00:02:34.550> to

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
or whatever a run but if you start to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.060 
or whatever a run but if you start to
break<00:02:34.820> it<00:02:35.000> down<00:02:35.150> and<00:02:35.480> you<00:02:35.540> realize<00:02:36.380> within

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
break it down and you realize within

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.040 
break it down and you realize within
these<00:02:38.800> scale<00:02:39.800> shapes<00:02:40.160> are<00:02:40.550> different<00:02:41.050> chords

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
these scale shapes are different chords

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.479 
these scale shapes are different chords
right<00:02:42.410> like<00:02:42.620> we've<00:02:42.770> been<00:02:42.890> talking<00:02:43.250> about<00:02:43.280> in

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.270 
the last series of lessons you can start
to<00:02:45.530> see<00:02:45.700> alright<00:02:46.700> when<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.060> break<00:02:47.420> out<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.830> here

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
to see alright when I break out to here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.860 
to see alright when I break out to here
you<00:02:49.520> know<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:49.640> could<00:02:49.970> be<00:02:50.000> going<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.360> E<00:02:50.630> minor

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
you know I could be going from E minor

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.290 
you know I could be going from E minor
pentatonic<00:02:50.959> and<00:02:51.650> jumping<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.700> grabbing

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
pentatonic and jumping in and grabbing

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.690 
pentatonic and jumping in and grabbing
that<00:02:53.630> major<00:02:54.170> third<00:02:54.590> of<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.830> e<00:02:54.860> chord<00:02:55.340> right

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
that major third of the e chord right

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.620 
that major third of the e chord right
here<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.350> then<00:02:57.560> I<00:02:57.650> combine<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.370> maybe<00:02:59.030> with<00:02:59.270> E

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
here so then I combine that maybe with E

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.900 
here so then I combine that maybe with E
minor<00:03:00.290> position<00:03:00.890> -<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.400> have<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:01.670> cool

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
minor position - and I have this cool

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
you're using e an E major chord shape

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.710 
you're using e an E major chord shape
with<00:03:12.860> E<00:03:13.160> minor<00:03:13.430> pentatonic<00:03:13.580> and<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:20.510> get<00:03:20.600> this

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
with E minor pentatonic and you get this

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.280 
with E minor pentatonic and you get this
awesome

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
you know lick now when you combine that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.010 
you know lick now when you combine that
with<00:03:24.320> some<00:03:24.800> of<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.950> typical<00:03:25.330> blues<00:03:26.330> runs<00:03:26.750> that

with some of the typical blues runs that

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.720 
with some of the typical blues runs that
we<00:03:27.140> may<00:03:27.410> have<00:03:27.590> learned<00:03:27.890> from<00:03:28.280> over<00:03:28.460> the<00:03:28.700> years

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
we may have learned from over the years

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.760 
we may have learned from over the years
you<00:03:29.210> start<00:03:29.510> to<00:03:29.570> be<00:03:29.720> able<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.020> access<00:03:30.290> these

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
you start to be able to access these

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.730 
you start to be able to access these
really<00:03:31.280> awesome<00:03:31.900> kind<00:03:32.900> of<00:03:32.960> extended

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
really awesome kind of extended

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.920 
really awesome kind of extended
pentatonic<00:03:34.400> runs<00:03:34.640> okay<00:03:34.940> so<00:03:35.000> check<00:03:35.360> this<00:03:35.540> out

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
pentatonic runs okay so check this out

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.830 
pentatonic runs okay so check this out
so<00:03:36.320> think<00:03:36.740> about<00:03:36.830> a<00:03:37.340> minor<00:03:38.330> pentatonic<00:03:38.660> and

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
so think about a minor pentatonic and

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.290 
so think about a minor pentatonic and
then<00:03:41.840> our<00:03:42.170> two<00:03:42.560> E<00:03:42.590> major<00:03:43.280> chord<00:03:43.490> inversions

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
then our two E major chord inversions

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.390 
then our two E major chord inversions
that<00:03:44.690> are<00:03:44.870> right<00:03:45.080> here<00:03:45.560> so<00:03:45.770> we<00:03:45.890> have<00:03:46.010> E<00:03:46.250> major

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
that are right here so we have E major

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.200 
that are right here so we have E major
right<00:03:46.730> here<00:03:47.170> have<00:03:48.170> a<00:03:48.350> major<00:03:48.560> right<00:03:48.830> here<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:50.180> e

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
right here have a major right here the e

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:56.040 
right here have a major right here the e
shape<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:53.660> I<00:03:53.690> go

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.350 

what<00:03:56.950> I'm<00:03:57.040> doing<00:03:57.100> is<00:03:57.550> I'm<00:03:57.700> combining<00:03:57.910> this

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
what I'm doing is I'm combining this

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.790 
what I'm doing is I'm combining this
shape<00:03:58.660> here<00:03:58.930> a<00:04:00.540> major<00:04:01.540> pentatonic<00:04:02.020> position

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
shape here a major pentatonic position

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.490 
shape here a major pentatonic position
to<00:04:03.010> which<00:04:03.910> is<00:04:04.090> right<00:04:04.330> inside<00:04:04.720> of<00:04:04.750> position<00:04:05.290> one

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
to which is right inside of position one

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.590 
to which is right inside of position one
and<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:06.010> minor<00:04:08.490> position<00:04:09.490> one<00:04:10.000> because<00:04:10.300> a<00:04:10.330> lot

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
and a minor position one because a lot

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.760 
and a minor position one because a lot
of<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.840> chords<00:04:11.430> are<00:04:12.430> five<00:04:12.730> chords<00:04:13.530> so<00:04:14.530> you<00:04:14.620> can

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
of the chords are five chords so you can

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.490 
of the chords are five chords so you can
play<00:04:14.950> both<00:04:15.190> major<00:04:15.640> and<00:04:15.790> minor<00:04:16.420> scales<00:04:16.570> and<00:04:17.410> you

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
play both major and minor scales and you

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.340 
play both major and minor scales and you
can<00:04:17.650> get<00:04:17.770> away<00:04:17.860> with<00:04:18.220> murder

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
can get away with murder

guys well even the 70s their vibrato is

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.460 
guys well even the 70s their vibrato is
killer<00:06:43.070> and<00:06:43.190> that<00:06:43.400> adds<00:06:43.580> so<00:06:44.060> much<00:06:44.780> to<00:06:44.840> playing

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
killer and that adds so much to playing

00:06:45.470 --> 00:07:08.120

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
vibrato is huge so in this style of

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.100 
vibrato is huge so in this style of
playing<00:07:12.010> you<00:07:12.310> can<00:07:12.490> work<00:07:12.670> with<00:07:12.910> mixing<00:07:13.870> major

and minor seeing the chord shapes that's

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.880 
and minor seeing the chord shapes that's
super<00:07:16.690> important<00:07:17.140> I<00:07:17.230> can't<00:07:17.470> emphasize<00:07:17.860> that
