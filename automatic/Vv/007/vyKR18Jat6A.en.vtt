aero<00:04:06.209> foam<00:04:08.480> two-thirds<00:04:09.480> lighter<00:04:09.780> I<00:04:10.049> think

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
aero foam two-thirds lighter I think

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.460 
aero foam two-thirds lighter I think
that's<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.769> right<00:04:10.920> ratio<00:04:12.140> we'll<00:04:13.140> see<00:04:13.290> if<00:04:13.380> it

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
that's the right ratio we'll see if it
