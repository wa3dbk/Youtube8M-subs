00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.950
 hello, it's eureka's and my name is 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.299
 they welcome the first 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.210
 pointless I want you so a bit 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.500
 I tried got me I thought 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.170
 so many speculate a meaningful one 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.630
 rum over upcoming extensions and 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.490
 tell you there as much as I have 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.930
 why not think of it from my own 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.029
 format that I do every now and then 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.650
 bring if I think there is 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.340
 anything I could tell you 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.470
 what would be worth knowing for you and her 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.600
 you can think about it today 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.890
 Extensions go and that I had 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.479
 you already a little bit something 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.839
 so many are going now 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:49.059
 Rumors currently through the network that could 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.190
 be the next since enlargement and 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.100
 I mean just before the gamescom 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.369
 started in cologne where in any case something 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.540
 it should be published 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.640
 of course exciting again 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.930
 I used that as an opportunity to do that 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.400
 Now just a little bit me 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.830
 thought a bit researched 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.320
 when did which information come out 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.920
 from ea or official 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.609
 sims page on facebook and when did the 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.609
 corresponding text 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:20.829
 at that time were here on 4.9 and 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:24.039
 Shortly afterwards a month later good 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.689
 month later on 10 10 ps ask what 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:29.170
 you are so interested 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.840
 extensions what would be there for 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.240
 there were e-mails at that time too 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.490
 sent by ea to random players 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.820
 I did not belong at that time and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.869
 You must not give up my mustard 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.259
 but then there were some like it 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.320
 has divulged who have told 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:51.130
 to let us have those sent at that time 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.909
 it was about health &amp; wellness 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.619
 supernatural city ​​life around city life and 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:04.149
 own shops or active jobs and order 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:06.999
 fame and fortune and two things of it 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.220
 we already have we have to work 

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:11.140
 We have the own business 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.520
 shop of own shops and 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.250
 active careers where we have our sims 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.900
 you can help shape it 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.380
 we can lead upwards 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.100
 in it 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.650
 that came on the 24th and now health too 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.570
 and wellness can be in there too 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.640
 health is still a bit too 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.980
 Come in to work with me 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.160
 but now the us careers think but how 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.320
 It should now also in there recently 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.300
 then, of course, the question remains what 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.180
 this other is considered as 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.730
 important extension come what comes 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.769
 maybe only as a game pack like last 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.090
 wellness and yes I've since times 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.790
 a few thoughts to do so me 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 think citylife that's a little bit 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.760
 well thought of as a nightlife extension 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.660
 a little bit of direction has it been day 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:08.260
 then or nightlife and living it 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.790
 you wanted that kind of a little bit 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.510
 control in the city what you have there 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.180
 a little bit more live in the city 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.640
 can bring in and I could me 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.709
 think that the contents are the 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.670
 maybe also in a gamepad action 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.500
 can come in 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.250
 that's not because it sounds 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.730
 at least not so extensive 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.170
 if I turn to high now 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.739
 wealth think so what a bit 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:41.200
 the star extension will be there 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.560
 I had that would be a point from that 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.480
 At the time, three would be showtime 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.120
 that would be rather in my opinion 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.400
 After an important extension I would 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.130
 as well as to fight 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.950
 that was already synonymous with sims 3 with 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:59.829
 vampires and other monster zombies 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:04.650
 everything was there too that is 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:08.780
 rather a real expansion pack and 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.400
 of course the animals 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.130
 after the animals without there first 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.880
 not asked at all but it does not have 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.890
 took a while 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:20.060
 As I said in the second quarter came to the 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.580
 work out and since then 904 came one 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.500
 asked or hounded a question through 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:30.080
 internet what the sims around the globe 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.050
 I am the only one engaged 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.400
 I think about it 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.960
 also had hits boiler and the consequence 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.340
 also left posted by two people 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.760
 which then already busy 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.700
 to have 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:42.890
 It came the question what belongs to you 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.010
 a right the extension on the 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.169
 official page on facebook and me 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:51.680
 So why do you put such a 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.810
 if not in the next time 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.790
 An extension with their planned 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.980
 several he is now, however 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:01.070
 the question would be really the next one 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.680
 Enhancements for we know the 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.229
 sims extension with animals came to pick 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.450
 1 2 as well as three always he first one 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:11.090
 a little later , it is relatively much 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.100
 to develop because the animals in the 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.440
 end effect even small sims are that is 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.700
 yes also what where the developers are always very 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.350
 put a lot of emphasis on having each one 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.250
 times that are small are im 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.390
 end effect with your own goals with your own 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.190
 wish and now probably too 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.960
 own emotions with 6 4 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.610
 I think that's what we in the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.620
 will bring in wildlife and it will 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.820
 be quite difficult to develop 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.820
 I could imagine 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.440
 Of course there is the question how 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:39.140
 It is fast developing 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.289
 the question about work after active 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.840
 jobs up to work were about 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.370
 six months in between and the 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.080
 proper extension always came to me 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.360
 already in six months rhythm always like that 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.190
 two in the year so half a year came 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:57.410
 An extension usually and in the 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:00.440
 october it would then yes time again 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.660
 we expect april shortly afterwards 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.680
 at the beginning of april the question arose april may 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:08.450
 june july august september october then 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.340
 we are even if you are so 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.900
 calculate at simona so then would have to 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.500
 about the next extension already 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.120
 come 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.639
 so we can expect it soon 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.860
 and the 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.719
 stood between this question and the 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.120
 Next extension would be exactly that 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:25.409
 same as between the work question and 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.479
 to the work itself 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:31.139
 that's why, of course, the 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:33.120
 question is it the animals extension or 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:34.740
 Maybe something else is coming 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.379
 maybe something supernatural 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.909
 complete but the star extension also 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:40.520
 if there are no further questions 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:44.069
 were made 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:45.749
 I'm just curious what your 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.340
 opinions are what I naturally 

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:48.419
 even the room has to throw something 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.740
 with the little kids 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:52.919
 because it's already on it 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.930
 is developed yet nothing closer to 

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:56.550
 Well, that's my opinion 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.750
 thoughts and my tips for the 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.669
 next extensions 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.229
 I'm curious I think on the 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.279
 We can provide gamescom with more information 

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.330
 I will recharge you, of course 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:06.029
 also supply 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.379
 since i'll be there and now 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.539
 Write me the comments what 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.430
 your opinion on the extensions are 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.639
 what you think and maybe you too 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.099
 you liked this result and then 

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:21.680
 we'll see each other in the morning 

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:21.680
 So, bye bye 

00:07:52.729 --> 00:07:57.550
 I have the occasion to taken them to 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.550
 just a little bit now
