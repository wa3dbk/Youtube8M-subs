I<00:00:00.089> wanted<00:00:01.050> to<00:00:01.170> talk<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.380> little<00:00:01.589> bit<00:00:01.800> about<00:00:01.979> that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
I wanted to talk a little bit about that

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.100 
I wanted to talk a little bit about that
connection<00:00:02.669> between<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.449> handmade<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.020> the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
connection between the handmade in the

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.030 
connection between the handmade in the
digital<00:00:04.290> because<00:00:05.040> it<00:00:05.700> always<00:00:05.819> seems<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> me

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
digital because it always seems to me

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.799 
digital because it always seems to me
and<00:00:08.040> obviously<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.610> past<00:00:08.880> there's<00:00:09.660> a

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
and obviously in the past there's a

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.720 
and obviously in the past there's a
connection<00:00:10.200> with<00:00:10.500> future<00:00:10.860> systems<00:00:11.190> now<00:00:11.460> going

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
connection with future systems now going

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.610 
connection with future systems now going
forward<00:00:12.150> with<00:00:12.330> Amanda<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.809> event<00:00:13.080> architects

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
forward with Amanda of event architects

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.460 
forward with Amanda of event architects
that<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.759> way<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.910> straddle<00:00:15.690> these<00:00:15.900> kind<00:00:16.320> of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
that in a way you straddle these kind of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.279 
that in a way you straddle these kind of
wonderful<00:00:16.980> worlds<00:00:17.490> where<00:00:17.699> there's<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.289> history

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
wonderful worlds where there's a history

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.490 
wonderful worlds where there's a history
and<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.100> connection<00:00:20.670> we've<00:00:20.880> practices<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.689> RQ

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
and a connection we've practices like RQ

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
and a connection we've practices like RQ
Graham<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:23.039> example<00:00:23.640> nur<00:00:23.850> what<00:00:24.660> provision

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
Graham for example nur what provision

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.099 
Graham for example nur what provision
and<00:00:25.500> optimism<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.369> then<00:00:27.029> very<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:27.570> very

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
and optimism and then very much a very

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
and optimism and then very much a very
contemporary<00:00:28.619> engagement<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.429> digital

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.290 
practitioners who are on the forefront
yep<00:00:34.620> do<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.430> yourself<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.090> feel

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
yep do you see that yourself do you feel

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.030 
yep do you see that yourself do you feel
that<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.570> straddle<00:00:36.989> those<00:00:37.140> two<00:00:37.440> worlds<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that you straddle those two worlds and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.299 
that you straddle those two worlds and
that<00:00:38.219> perhaps<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:39.500> not<00:00:40.500> even<00:00:40.530> necessarily

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
that perhaps that not even necessarily

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.420 
that perhaps that not even necessarily
pay<00:00:41.670> for<00:00:41.910> architects<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.570> sometimes<00:00:43.079> that

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
pay for architects that sometimes that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.500 
pay for architects that sometimes that
freedom<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> comes<00:00:44.820> with<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.360> expressing

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
freedom that comes with just expressing

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.799 
freedom that comes with just expressing
ideas<00:00:46.070> is<00:00:47.070> still<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.520> much<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.660> spirit

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
ideas is still very much in the spirit

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.660 
ideas is still very much in the spirit
of<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.469> work<00:00:49.649> as<00:00:50.039> much<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
of your work as much as the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.700 
of your work as much as the
computational<00:00:51.710> yes<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.920> mean<00:00:53.039> for<00:00:53.280> me<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.710> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
computational yes I mean for me the the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.400 
computational yes I mean for me the the
unbuilt<00:00:56.129> work<00:00:56.399> has<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:57.090> much<00:00:57.329> significance<00:00:58.109> as

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
unbuilt work has as much significance as

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.520 
unbuilt work has as much significance as
the<00:00:58.800> built<00:00:59.250> work<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.030> goes<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:01.140> know

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
the built work and that goes to you know

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.830 
the built work and that goes to you know
looking<00:01:01.890> back<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.390> other<00:01:03.390> great<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.360> at

looking back at other great you know at

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
looking back at other great you know at
visionary<00:01:07.619> architects<00:01:08.070> like<00:01:08.310> Cedric<00:01:08.580> prize

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
visionary architects like Cedric prize

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.510 
visionary architects like Cedric prize
like<00:01:09.180> Earth<00:01:09.450> Graham<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.280> who<00:01:11.280> built

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
like Earth Graham and who built

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.120 
like Earth Graham and who built
virtually<00:01:12.420> nothing<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.380> whose<00:01:13.590> work<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
virtually nothing but whose work is

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.340 
virtually nothing but whose work is
resonant<00:01:14.880> even<00:01:15.210> today<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.930> can<00:01:16.020> see<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
resonant even today and you can see the

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
resonant even today and you can see the
influence<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.830> many<00:01:16.979> buildings<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.640> even

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
influence so many buildings and even

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.210 
influence so many buildings and even
looking<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.619> legacy<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.100> our

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
looking at the kind of legacy of our

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.719 
looking at the kind of legacy of our
unbuilt<00:01:20.790> work<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.409> has<00:01:22.590> a

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
unbuilt work you know it has a

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.190 
unbuilt work you know it has a
significance<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.509> as<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:25.020> know<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
significance that's just as you know to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.330 
significance that's just as you know to
me<00:01:25.439> anyway<00:01:25.799> as<00:01:26.630> as<00:01:27.630> powerful<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.590> built

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
me anyway as as powerful as the built

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.219 
me anyway as as powerful as the built
work<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> sometimes<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> because<00:01:30.930> it's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
work and sometimes more so because it's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.370 
work and sometimes more so because it's
it's<00:01:31.530> more<00:01:31.740> extreme<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.049> it's<00:01:34.049> very

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
it's more extreme and it's very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.600 
it's more extreme and it's very
important<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.400> me<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.420> kind<00:01:36.990> of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
important to me to have that kind of

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.050 
important to me to have that kind of
that<00:01:38.610> vision<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.420> passion<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:41.060> conceptual

think<00:02:14.470> if<00:02:14.830> you<00:02:15.100> try<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:16.000> separate<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.350> two

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
think if you try and separate the two

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.920 
think if you try and separate the two
you<00:02:18.250> become<00:02:18.610> distant<00:02:19.150> from<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.540> people<00:02:19.900> that

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you become distant from the people that

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.530 
you become distant from the people that
you're<00:02:20.140> actually<00:02:20.350> designed<00:02:21.340> for<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.880> you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you're actually designed for and you

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.180 
you're actually designed for and you
become<00:02:22.840> distant<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.500> process<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.100> it's

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
become distant from the process and it's

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.220 
become distant from the process and it's
very<00:02:24.400> easy<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.970> seduced<00:02:25.420> by<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> kind<00:02:26.140> of

know the images on the computer and it's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.420 
know the images on the computer and it's
easy<00:02:31.240> to<00:02:31.810> lose<00:02:32.710> sight<00:02:32.770> of<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.250> real

you<00:02:37.180> know<00:02:37.300> of<00:02:37.480> the<00:02:37.630> core<00:02:38.110> idea<00:02:38.410> and<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.040> have<00:02:39.280> and

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
you know of the core idea and I have and

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.880 
you know of the core idea and I have and
when<00:02:40.240> that<00:02:40.390> happens<00:02:40.420> I<00:02:41.080> think<00:02:41.350> it's<00:02:41.560> kind<00:02:41.800> of

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
when that happens I think it's kind of

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.910 
when that happens I think it's kind of
evident<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:43.350> buildings<00:02:44.350> where<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.620> has<00:02:44.800> been

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
evident in buildings where this has been

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.230 
evident in buildings where this has been
the<00:02:45.070> case<00:02:45.780> not<00:02:46.780> her<00:02:46.990> own<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.320> course<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:48.240> that

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the case not her own of course and that

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.760 
the case not her own of course and that
there<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.200> building<00:02:50.530> becomes

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
there is a you know the building becomes

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.200 
there is a you know the building becomes
a<00:02:50.920> kind<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.130> empty<00:02:51.400> vessel<00:02:51.790> there's<00:02:51.970> nothing

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
a kind of empty vessel there's nothing

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.370 
a kind of empty vessel there's nothing
to<00:02:52.330> hold<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.720> there's<00:02:52.930> no<00:02:53.110> real<00:02:54.030> authenticity

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
to hold it there's no real authenticity

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.170 
to hold it there's no real authenticity
there's<00:02:56.380> no<00:02:56.500> integrity<00:02:56.770> in<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.940> for<00:02:58.150> me

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
there's no integrity in and so for me

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.960 
there's no integrity in and so for me
the<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.720> holding<00:02:58.930> onto<00:02:59.200> that<00:02:59.470> is<00:02:59.680> to<00:03:00.100> to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
the way of holding onto that is to to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.450 
the way of holding onto that is to to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
merge the digital and the hand and to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.600 
merge the digital and the hand and to
switch<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.390> see<00:03:04.720> how<00:03:04.959> one<00:03:05.340> impacts<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.459> other

ideas<00:04:26.710> which<00:04:27.010> are<00:04:27.250> buildings<00:04:27.850> rather<00:04:28.480> than

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
ideas which are buildings rather than

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.150 
ideas which are buildings rather than
buildings<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.260> forming<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.580> furniture

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
buildings in forming the the furniture

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.870 
buildings in forming the the furniture
so<00:04:33.210> it's<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.919> if<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.220> it's<00:04:36.460> part<00:04:36.700> of<00:04:36.790> the

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
so it's a if you like it's part of the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.310 
so it's a if you like it's part of the
kind<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.120> protease<00:04:37.480> become<00:04:37.840> part<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.260> the

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
kind of protease become part of the

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.280 
kind of protease become part of the
process<00:04:38.590> of<00:04:39.160> design<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.820> work<00:04:40.030> at<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.780> scale

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
process of design to work at that scale

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.670 
process of design to work at that scale
and<00:04:42.330> also<00:04:43.330> working<00:04:43.540> with<00:04:43.690> furniture<00:04:44.230> there's

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
and also working with furniture there's

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.970 
and also working with furniture there's
an<00:04:44.830> ability<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.370> kind<00:04:45.669> of<00:04:45.790> refine<00:04:46.240> form<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:47.770> a

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
an ability to kind of refine form in a

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.020 
an ability to kind of refine form in a
way<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.669> don't<00:04:49.120> have<00:04:49.510> that<00:04:50.580> fin<00:04:51.580> s<00:04:51.730> in<00:04:51.940> a

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
something that will will stay with me to

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.150 
something that will will stay with me to
define<00:05:55.390> what<00:05:55.450> it<00:05:55.810> is<00:05:55.960> that<00:05:56.169> I<00:05:56.289> take<00:05:56.560> well<00:05:56.919> you

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
define what it is that I take well you

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.529 
define what it is that I take well you
know<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.310> take<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.700> legacy<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.120> what<00:05:58.390> we

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
know I take the legacy of what we

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.930 
know I take the legacy of what we
created<00:05:59.110> together<00:05:59.500> and<00:06:00.010> so<00:06:00.340> it's<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.820> know

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
created together and so it's you know

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.679 
created together and so it's you know
part<00:06:01.450> of<00:06:02.610> part<00:06:03.610> of<00:06:03.700> who<00:06:03.880> I<00:06:03.940> am<00:06:04.060> now<00:06:04.510> and

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:07.689 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:16.969 

I<00:06:07.779> think<00:06:09.330> as<00:06:10.330> a<00:06:10.389> sort<00:06:10.719> of<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:15.209> fluency<00:06:16.209> of

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
I think as a sort of a fluency of

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:23.819 
I think as a sort of a fluency of
thinking<00:06:17.979> and<00:06:18.129> a<00:06:18.929> an<00:06:20.639> absolute<00:06:22.469> need<00:06:23.469> to

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:23.829 
thinking and a an absolute need to

00:06:23.829 --> 00:06:28.109 
thinking and a an absolute need to
understand<00:06:24.549> the<00:06:25.119> way<00:06:25.809> that<00:06:26.559> a<00:06:26.610> form<00:06:27.610> that<00:06:27.999> a

building that an idea that we conceive
can<00:06:31.509> be<00:06:31.659> realized<00:06:32.049> so<00:06:32.769> I'm<00:06:33.329> I'm<00:06:34.329> not

be made it you know it holds no meaning

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:45.869 
be made it you know it holds no meaning
for<00:06:42.729> me<00:06:42.909> that<00:06:43.719> it's<00:06:44.399> you<00:06:45.399> know<00:06:45.429> whenever<00:06:45.699> a

yawn and i did a competition we always

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:49.859 
yawn and i did a competition we always

00:06:49.859 --> 00:06:49.869

00:07:40.679 --> 00:07:40.689 
where you think you can go so I guess

where you think you can go so I guess
that's<00:07:40.959> what<00:07:41.169> I<00:07:41.199> will<00:07:41.619> take<00:07:41.800> with<00:07:41.949> me<00:07:42.129> from

that's what I will take with me from
young<00:07:42.749> well<00:07:43.749> thank<00:07:44.079> you<00:07:44.229> very<00:07:44.439> much<00:07:44.649> we<00:07:45.579> might
