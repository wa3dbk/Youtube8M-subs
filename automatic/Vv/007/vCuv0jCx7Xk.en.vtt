my<00:01:15.080> first<00:01:15.260> print<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:15.680> my<00:01:15.830> he<00:01:16.100> knew<00:01:16.250> he'd<00:01:16.430> to

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
my first print with my he knew he'd to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.500 
my first print with my he knew he'd to
bed<00:01:16.730> you<00:01:17.690> can<00:01:17.810> see<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.140> left<00:01:18.350> left<00:01:18.920> a<00:01:19.360> line<00:01:20.360> in

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
bed you can see it left left a line in

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.360 
bed you can see it left left a line in
the<00:01:20.600> captain<00:01:20.960> tape<00:01:21.170> not<00:01:21.620> entirely<00:01:21.920> pleased

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
the captain tape not entirely pleased

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.270 
the captain tape not entirely pleased
about<00:01:22.490> that<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:22.910> no<00:01:23.060> I<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.540> do<00:01:23.630> at<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.900> point

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
about that but no I can do at this point

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.640 
about that but no I can do at this point
I'm<00:01:25.280> guessing<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:26.420> reason<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.900> all<00:01:27.050> slid<00:01:27.440> off

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
I'm guessing the reason it all slid off

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.950 
I'm guessing the reason it all slid off
like<00:01:27.860> it<00:01:28.010> did<00:01:28.040> is<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:29.000> had<00:01:29.240> at<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:29.750> wrong

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
like it did is I had at the wrong

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.170 
like it did is I had at the wrong
temperature<00:01:30.230> I<00:01:30.560> headed<00:01:30.920> at<00:01:31.160> 45<00:01:31.910> degrees

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
temperature I headed at 45 degrees

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.620 
temperature I headed at 45 degrees
Celsius<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.890> try<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.010> again<00:01:34.160> uh<00:01:34.610> for<00:01:35.570> my

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
Celsius and try that again uh for my

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.000 
Celsius and try that again uh for my
next<00:01:35.840> build<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:37.120> silver<00:01:38.120> rectangular<00:01:39.010> power

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
next build that silver rectangular power

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.940 
next build that silver rectangular power
supply<00:01:40.310> in<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.430> corner<00:01:40.730> there<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:41.000> often<00:01:41.180> a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
supply in the corner there is often a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.320 
supply in the corner there is often a
server<00:01:42.950> I<00:01:43.630> got<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.660> salvaged<00:01:46.180> anyways<00:01:47.180> I'm

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
server I got a salvaged anyways I'm

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.940 
server I got a salvaged anyways I'm
going<00:01:47.480> to<00:01:47.570> mess<00:01:48.470> around<00:01:48.620> with<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
going to mess around with the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.400 
going to mess around with the
temperatures<00:01:49.310> try<00:01:49.610> and<00:01:49.730> get<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.910> decent<00:01:50.750> print

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
temperatures try and get a decent print

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.340 
temperatures try and get a decent print
out<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.800> it<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> far<00:01:55.510> not<00:01:56.510> entirely<00:01:56.870> impressed

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
out of it so far not entirely impressed

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.240 
out of it so far not entirely impressed
but<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:57.740> most<00:01:57.950> likely<00:01:58.040> my<00:01:58.430> own<00:01:58.610> failure<00:01:59.060> so

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
but it's most likely my own failure so

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.700 
but it's most likely my own failure so
hey<00:02:01.450> failure<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.570> always<00:02:02.720> an<00:02:02.900> option<00:02:03.110> try

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
hey failure is always an option try

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.390 
hey failure is always an option try
until<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.070> succeed<00:02:05.650> anyways<00:02:06.650> I'll<00:02:07.070> have<00:02:07.370> a

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400
