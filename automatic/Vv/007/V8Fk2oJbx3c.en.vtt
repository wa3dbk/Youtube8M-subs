00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello to all and to all well I'm going to 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:09.389
 say this video because I've done this 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.759
 good day it occurred to me to make some 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.490
 pieces of newspaper and as you can see he did not manage 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.800
 complete everything I would like to be an idea of 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:24.180
 two worlds upside down is magical 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.349
 if they know him but once I made a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.359
 entered into competition with same mouths 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.270
 but good thing is that I'm going to 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.490
 say closer but that's it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:44.610
 it's like that for materials 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:44.610
 well then formal 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.930
 the material is the notebook they have to 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.880
 let's work if it is that you 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 want 100 sheets for 50 what 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.840
 do from diary sites and 50 from 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.650
 good smartphone what I used to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.620
 this is a black cardboard 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.740
 well 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:23.300
 so that it looked like this I made this 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.330
 one good cut to the template 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.290
 the internet just mess up this 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:33.350
 daily logo and then of the several exam 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:38.360
 I 've done this with a corrector that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.520
 dry and start here but I do not know is that it 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.760
 it happened to me to be more magazine and 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.370
 where is with the smartphone the only one 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.500
 can do is from a notebook that is more 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.350
 a minute and like this one but a little 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.430
 bigger as a college student but it's not 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:58.240
 bander but unstitched then what 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.790
 do you get there you can put a small glass 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.570
 national that you want first and 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.570
 same in scoop as in the cross 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.450
 so that it looks more real and they wonder 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.650
 by the paper that is run 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:22.739
 it's after the same cooked notebook 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.370
 I took it out because it looks more or less and 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.370
 It has a lot of texture then 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.640
 we open it and it's a normal notebook 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:41.430
 then stay here because 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.310
 well this later because I 'm going to 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.069
 teach the advances of the destruction this 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.920
 diary and the smartphone so that it is 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.620
 uploading past videos and on Sundays 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.340
 because I've had enough chances that 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.340
 do then 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.900
 I think those are the days when 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.530
 can I record then if these 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.450
 it's also the warning that I'm going to start 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.580
 to do this project of these from this 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.739
 daily and the smart work I will not teach 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.780
 how to make the page because it is that the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.820
 true if it's a little work of 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:22.800
 edit it and everything then I'm just going to 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:26.220
 I'm going to teach, I'm going to teach you 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.200
 pages that I will do as visits 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.980
 So, I hope you have them 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.980
