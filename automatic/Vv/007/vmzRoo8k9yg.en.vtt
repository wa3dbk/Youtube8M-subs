did you kind of like sketch some ideas
out<00:00:19.410> first<00:00:19.650> yeah<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.250> actually<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.199> base

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
out first yeah I actually got a base

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.470 
out first yeah I actually got a base
image<00:00:22.590> off<00:00:22.949> google<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:23.939> actually<00:00:24.150> isn't

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
image off google so this actually isn't

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.880 
image off google so this actually isn't
my<00:00:25.080> design<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:26.539> hopefully<00:00:27.539> no<00:00:28.109> one<00:00:28.260> comments

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
my design so hopefully no one comments

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
my design so hopefully no one comments
on<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.010> but<00:00:29.789> uh<00:00:29.929> yeah<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:30.960> just<00:00:31.199> thought<00:00:31.289> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
on that but uh yeah I just thought it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.870 
on that but uh yeah I just thought it
would<00:00:31.500> be<00:00:31.590> appropriate<00:00:31.769> since<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
would be appropriate since it's like you

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.610 
would be appropriate since it's like you
know<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> haunted<00:00:33.390> house<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.500> this

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
this is basically the backyard of

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.120 
this is basically the backyard of
Carnival<00:01:55.960> manor<00:01:56.110> we're<00:01:56.380> all<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.680> stuff<00:01:56.979> is

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
Carnival manor we're all the stuff is

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.040 
Carnival manor we're all the stuff is
stored<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.790> it's<00:01:57.940> no<00:01:58.060> longer<00:01:58.090> used<00:01:58.600> its<00:01:58.899> kind

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
stored that it's no longer used its kind

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.359 
stored that it's no longer used its kind
of<00:01:59.140> expired<00:01:59.970> maybe<00:02:00.970> amortize<00:02:01.479> so<00:02:01.960> and<00:02:02.369> maybe

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
of expired maybe amortize so and maybe

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.920 
of expired maybe amortize so and maybe
one<00:02:03.640> of<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.790> reasons<00:02:03.820> why<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.270> because<00:02:04.450> these

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
one of the reasons why is because these

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.840 
one of the reasons why is because these
panels<00:02:05.350> being<00:02:05.560> her<00:02:05.649> feet<00:02:05.890> over<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.280> time<00:02:06.520> so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
panels being her feet over the time so

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.219 
panels being her feet over the time so
instead<00:02:07.270> of<00:02:07.330> using<00:02:07.570> them<00:02:07.750> they<00:02:07.869> just<00:02:07.899> put<00:02:08.140> them

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
instead of using them they just put them

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.719 
instead of using them they just put them
in<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.350> backyard<00:02:08.739> so<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.250> backyard<00:02:09.640> is

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
in the backyard so the backyard is

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.880 
in the backyard so the backyard is
almost<00:02:09.940> like<00:02:10.090> a<00:02:10.149> junkyard<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:11.020> junkyard<00:02:11.560> have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
almost like a junkyard a junkyard have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.550 
almost like a junkyard a junkyard have
scarce<00:02:12.280> around<00:02:12.640> every<00:02:13.030> corner<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.380> that's

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
scarce around every corner so that's

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.840 
scarce around every corner so that's
kind<00:02:14.739> of<00:02:14.770> what<00:02:14.920> carnival<00:02:15.160> manners<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:15.670> about
