a<00:01:48.659> sequel<00:01:49.020> but<00:01:49.140> i<00:01:49.200> believe<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.560> more<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
a sequel but i believe it's more of a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
a sequel but i believe it's more of a
companion<00:01:50.340> at<00:01:50.790> least<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.270> I'm

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
companion at least that's what I'm
hoping<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:53.159> sequel<00:01:53.880> /<00:01:54.090> companion<00:01:54.659> to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
little bit hesitant about because it is

um contemporary and it also deals with

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.040 
um contemporary and it also deals with
religion<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.550> idea<00:02:49.820> of<00:02:50.060> trying<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.870> live

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
religion and the idea of trying to live

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.720 
religion and the idea of trying to live
up<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.350> some<00:02:51.380> sort<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.940> moral<00:02:52.940> code<00:02:53.210> and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
up to some sort of moral code and

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.040 
up to some sort of moral code and
waiting<00:02:55.730> until<00:02:55.940> marriage<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.450> all<00:02:56.570> that<00:02:56.780> jazz

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
waiting until marriage and all that jazz

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.970 
waiting until marriage and all that jazz
um<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.280> as<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.180> said<00:02:59.420> before<00:02:59.480> I<00:03:00.230> am<00:03:00.290> not

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
um and as I have said before I am not

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.760

religious<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.970> for<00:03:02.870> me<00:03:03.080> a<00:03:03.110> book<00:03:03.320> like<00:03:03.470> this<00:03:03.500> is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
religious so for me a book like this is

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.320 
religious so for me a book like this is
all<00:03:03.950> going<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.160> depend<00:03:04.310> on<00:03:04.550> how<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.850> done<00:03:05.030> I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
all going to depend on how it's done I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.600 
all going to depend on how it's done I
don't<00:03:06.020> mind<00:03:06.140> books<00:03:06.470> about<00:03:06.800> religion<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.490> I

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
don't mind books about religion and I

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.160 
don't mind books about religion and I
don't<00:03:07.790> mind<00:03:07.940> books<00:03:08.210> that<00:03:08.510> have<00:03:08.720> religious

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
don't mind books that have religious

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.830 
don't mind books that have religious

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
characters i'm not anti religion just

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.250 
characters i'm not anti religion just
because<00:03:12.050> i'm<00:03:12.140> not<00:03:12.260> religious<00:03:12.740> so<00:03:14.110> it<00:03:15.110> all<00:03:15.200> just

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
because i'm not religious so it all just

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.860 
because i'm not religious so it all just
kind<00:03:15.560> of<00:03:15.680> depends<00:03:15.950> on<00:03:16.070> whether<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:16.520> seems

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
kind of depends on whether it seems

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.690 
kind of depends on whether it seems
heavy-handed<00:03:17.870> or<00:03:18.110> like<00:03:18.890> it's<00:03:19.010> talking<00:03:19.280> down

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
heavy-handed or like it's talking down

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.080 
heavy-handed or like it's talking down
to<00:03:19.730> people<00:03:19.940> or<00:03:20.810> trying<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.350> convert<00:03:21.680> people

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
to people or trying to convert people

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.000 
to people or trying to convert people
things<00:03:23.090> like<00:03:23.180> that<00:03:23.480> will<00:03:23.780> really<00:03:24.020> put<00:03:24.800> me<00:03:24.920> off

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
things like that will really put me off

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.690 
things like that will really put me off
but<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:25.460> it's<00:03:25.640> just<00:03:25.970> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.460> snippet<00:03:28.460> of

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
but if it's just you know a snippet of

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.220 
but if it's just you know a snippet of
this<00:03:28.880> girls<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.420> that<00:03:29.600> she's<00:03:29.780> trying<00:03:30.050> to

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
this girls like that she's trying to

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.650 
this girls like that she's trying to
deal<00:03:30.440> with<00:03:30.620> things<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:31.040> figure<00:03:31.310> out<00:03:31.370> herself

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
deal with things and figure out herself

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.800 
deal with things and figure out herself
then<00:03:32.660> that<00:03:33.170> sounds<00:03:33.500> good<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.420> it<00:03:35.420> could<00:03:35.630> really

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
then that sounds good so it could really

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.450 
then that sounds good so it could really
go<00:03:35.990> either<00:03:36.020> way<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.740> I'm<00:03:36.890> not<00:03:37.040> sure<00:03:37.070> which<00:03:37.310> way

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
go either way and I'm not sure which way

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.730 
go either way and I'm not sure which way
it<00:03:37.580> will<00:03:37.670> go<00:03:37.730> but<00:03:38.390> with<00:03:38.900> Jackson<00:03:39.350> Pierce<00:03:39.560> I'm

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
it will go but with Jackson Pierce I'm

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.170 
it will go but with Jackson Pierce I'm
assuming<00:03:40.130> it<00:03:40.220> will<00:03:40.310> go<00:03:40.460> with<00:03:40.910> a<00:03:40.970> ladder

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
assuming it will go with a ladder
