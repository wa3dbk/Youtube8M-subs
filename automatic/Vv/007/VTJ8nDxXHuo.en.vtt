00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.060 
people might not find that useful
because<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:37.049> last<00:01:37.200> couple<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.740> months<00:01:37.979> are

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because the last couple of months are

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
because the last couple of months are
tight<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.850> Christmas<00:01:39.210> shopping<00:01:39.450> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
tight because of Christmas shopping and

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.639 
tight because of Christmas shopping and
sales<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.500> whatnot<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.040> so<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:43.170> could<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.530> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
sales and whatnot and so you could do it

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
sales and whatnot and so you could do it
in<00:01:43.770> reverse<00:01:44.070> order<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.670> start<00:01:45.030> with

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
in reverse order and start with

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.330 
in reverse order and start with
fifty-two<00:01:45.780> dollars<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.619> first<00:01:46.860> week<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
fifty-two dollars the first week and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.490 
fifty-two dollars the first week and
then<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.640> all<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.880> way<00:01:48.119> down<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:49.259> dollar

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
then go all the way down to one dollar

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.039 
then go all the way down to one dollar
the<00:01:49.740> last<00:01:49.950> week<00:01:50.250> that's<00:01:50.520> another<00:01:50.790> way

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the last week that's another way

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.920 
the last week that's another way
the<00:01:52.860> third<00:01:53.159> way<00:01:53.460> was<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.060> think<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> article

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the third way was I think the article

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.539 
the third way was I think the article
describes<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.649> as<00:01:56.479> do<00:01:57.479> your<00:01:57.630> best<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
describes it as do your best and that is

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.280 
describes it as do your best and that is
that<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.939> save<00:02:00.240> whatever<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.200> then

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that you save whatever you can and then

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.410 
that you save whatever you can and then
cross<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.590> off<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> chart<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> they<00:02:03.240> gave

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
cross it off of the chart that they gave

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
cross it off of the chart that they gave
you<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.290> example<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.920> week<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.280> have

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
you so for example if this week I have

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.760 
you so for example if this week I have
42<00:02:05.850> dollars<00:02:06.000> I'll<00:02:06.360> say<00:02:06.570> 42<00:02:06.990> dollars<00:02:07.110> cross<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
42 dollars I'll say 42 dollars cross it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.889 
42 dollars I'll say 42 dollars cross it
off<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> list<00:02:08.190> and

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
off the list and

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.410 
off the list and
next<00:02:09.259> week<00:02:09.409> I<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.679> $2.00<00:02:10.340> I'll<00:02:10.459> save<00:02:10.759> $2<00:02:11.299> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
next week I have $2.00 I'll save $2 and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.080 
next week I have $2.00 I'll save $2 and
then<00:02:11.510> cross<00:02:11.810> off<00:02:12.049> week<00:02:12.319> 2<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.459> way<00:02:13.670> still

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
then cross off week 2 and that way still

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.020 
then cross off week 2 and that way still
L<00:02:14.329> end<00:02:14.599> up<00:02:14.840> with<00:02:15.579> hopefully<00:02:16.579> with<00:02:16.700> thirteen

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
L end up with hopefully with thirteen

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.670 
L end up with hopefully with thirteen
hundred<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.360> seven<00:02:17.599> dollars<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.200> have

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
hundred and seven dollars but I have

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.550 
hundred and seven dollars but I have
done<00:02:19.069> it<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> way<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:19.549> was<00:02:20.360> you<00:02:21.319> know<00:02:21.439> the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
done it the way that was you know the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.990 
done it the way that was you know the
however<00:02:21.980> much<00:02:22.129> I<00:02:22.250> could<00:02:22.400> have<00:02:22.489> saved<00:02:22.640> at<00:02:22.879> that

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
however much I could have saved at that

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.729 
however much I could have saved at that
time<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.299> that's<00:02:23.450> another<00:02:23.659> way<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.409> way<00:02:24.560> I'm

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
time so that's another way the way I'm

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.559 
time so that's another way the way I'm
thinking<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.370> doing<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.730> as<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:25.939> traditional

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
thinking of doing it as this traditional

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.960 
thinking of doing it as this traditional
way<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.750> starting<00:02:27.319> with<00:02:27.560> $1<00:02:28.069> and<00:02:28.370> going<00:02:28.609> up<00:02:28.760> to

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
way of starting with $1 and going up to

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.349 
way of starting with $1 and going up to
$52<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.859> was<00:02:31.280> just<00:02:31.489> hoping<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:32.030> can<00:02:32.150> get

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:32.359 
$52 and I was just hoping that I can get

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.179 
$52 and I was just hoping that I can get
some<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.870> guys<00:02:33.019> to<00:02:33.290> join<00:02:33.500> in<00:02:33.709> on<00:02:33.829> it<00:02:34.010> just
