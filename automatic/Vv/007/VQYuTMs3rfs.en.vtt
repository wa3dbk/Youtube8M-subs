00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
started working with just the shape of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.130

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
think I captured a couple elements of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.830 
think I captured a couple elements of
Holmes<00:03:07.580> cat<00:03:07.850> in<00:03:08.269> there<00:03:08.420> though<00:03:08.570> you<00:03:08.600> know

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
Holmes cat in there though you know

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.970 
Holmes cat in there though you know
there's<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.320> donor<00:03:09.530> for<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:09.769> brain

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
there's the donor for the brain

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.370 
there's the donor for the brain
obviously<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:11.690> fact<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:11.930> things<00:03:12.080> going

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
obviously and the fact that things going

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.310 
obviously and the fact that things going
one<00:03:12.530> year<00:03:12.769> and<00:03:13.070> out<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.370> other<00:03:13.400> but

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
one year and out the other but

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.479 
one year and out the other but
ultimately<00:03:15.320> sort<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.860> my<00:03:15.920> favorite<00:03:16.070> part<00:03:16.400> of

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
ultimately sort of my favorite part of

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.330 
ultimately sort of my favorite part of
it<00:03:16.610> is<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.820> it's<00:03:17.000> very<00:03:17.290> simple<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.800> a<00:03:18.920> very

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
it is that it's very simple in a very

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.520

idea pretty much pops into my head
straight<00:04:06.769> away<00:04:07.070> when<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.519> started<00:04:07.970> thinking

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
straight away when I started thinking

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.309 
straight away when I started thinking
about<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:08.660> competition<00:04:09.819> plus<00:04:10.819> I<00:04:11.150> love<00:04:12.080> that

the last

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.830 
the last
it's<00:04:14.790> because<00:04:15.120> they<00:04:15.270> were<00:04:15.330> struggling<00:04:15.660> to

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
it's because they were struggling to

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.690 
it's because they were struggling to
come<00:04:16.019> up<00:04:16.079> with<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.920> the<00:04:17.010> time<00:04:17.220> slot<00:04:17.519> of<00:04:17.549> the
