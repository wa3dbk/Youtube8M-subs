00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.309 
I get it at an angle like this super
stove<00:01:26.590> doesn't<00:01:26.890> have<00:01:27.250> a<00:01:27.280> bottom<00:01:28.209> to<00:01:29.140> its

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
stove doesn't have a bottom to its

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.730 
stove doesn't have a bottom to its
center<00:01:29.830> and<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.940> bush<00:01:31.149> buddy<00:01:31.420> has<00:01:31.720> a<00:01:32.289> nice

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
center and the bush buddy has a nice

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.389 
center and the bush buddy has a nice
flow<00:01:33.159> of<00:01:33.310> air<00:01:33.899> that<00:01:34.899> comes<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.130> through<00:01:36.369> the

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
flow of air that comes up through the

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:44.369 
flow of air that comes up through the
base<00:01:37.019> so<00:01:38.019> it<00:01:38.170> allows<00:01:38.379> that<00:01:39.569> central<00:01:43.259> column<00:01:44.259> of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:44.379 
base so it allows that central column of

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:52.740 
base so it allows that central column of
flame<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:45.039> occur<00:01:46.619> really<00:01:47.619> burns<00:01:47.890> nice<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:52.720> a
