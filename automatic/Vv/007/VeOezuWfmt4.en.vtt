really<00:02:04.460> decide<00:02:04.850> how<00:02:05.030> much<00:02:05.210> they're<00:02:05.420> able<00:02:05.750> to

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
really decide how much they're able to

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.359 
really decide how much they're able to
do<00:02:06.049> and<00:02:06.229> how<00:02:06.320> much<00:02:06.380> they're<00:02:06.649> willing<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:07.040> do

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
do and how much they're willing to do

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.110 
do and how much they're willing to do
and<00:02:08.379> medications<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:09.679> insulins<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.819> any

and medications and insulins and and any

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.550 
and medications and insulins and and any
other<00:02:11.330> way<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> treat<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.930> diabetes<00:02:12.379> is

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
other way to treat the diabetes is

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.200 
other way to treat the diabetes is
something<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:12.980> we<00:02:13.040> negotiate<00:02:13.580> together

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
something that we negotiate together

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.080 
something that we negotiate together
to<00:02:14.540> fit<00:02:14.690> their<00:02:14.870> lifestyle<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:16.610> optimize

to fit their lifestyle and to optimize

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.030 
to fit their lifestyle and to optimize
their<00:02:17.330> sugar<00:02:17.600> control<00:02:20.440> there's<00:02:21.440> big<00:02:21.680> trends

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
their sugar control there's big trends

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.920 
their sugar control there's big trends
in<00:02:22.160> diabetes<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.880> thyroid<00:02:23.030> diabetes<00:02:23.750> is<00:02:23.900> a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
in diabetes and thyroid diabetes is a

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
in diabetes and thyroid diabetes is a
very<00:02:24.140> exciting<00:02:24.650> field<00:02:24.830> now<00:02:25.070> because<00:02:25.400> new

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
very exciting field now because new

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.490 
very exciting field now because new
medications<00:02:26.300> are<00:02:26.480> coming<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.870> all<00:02:27.170> the<00:02:27.320> time

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
medications are coming out all the time

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.040 
medications are coming out all the time
new<00:02:27.770> classes<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.370> medications<00:02:29.180> for<00:02:29.390> many

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
new classes of medications for many

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.620 
new classes of medications for many
years<00:02:30.440> we<00:02:30.680> had<00:02:30.830> insulin<00:02:31.310> only<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:32.180> beginning

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
years we had insulin only and beginning

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.930 
years we had insulin only and beginning
in<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.840> 70s<00:02:33.320> we<00:02:33.440> had<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.860> type<00:02:34.130> of<00:02:34.400> pill<00:02:34.640> and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
in the 70s we had one type of pill and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.450 
in the 70s we had one type of pill and
there<00:02:35.870> was<00:02:35.990> not<00:02:36.110> another<00:02:36.440> new<00:02:36.740> type<00:02:37.010> of<00:02:37.040> pill

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
there was not another new type of pill

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.250 
there was not another new type of pill
on<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.730> market<00:02:38.030> until<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.450> mid<00:02:38.630> 90s<00:02:39.080> and

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
on the market until the mid 90s and

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.020 
on the market until the mid 90s and
since<00:02:39.950> then<00:02:40.130> there<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.400> been<00:02:40.430> half<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.880> dozen

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
since then there have been half a dozen

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.210 
since then there have been half a dozen
new<00:02:41.330> kinds<00:02:41.660> of<00:02:41.750> pills<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.560> it's<00:02:42.710> become<00:02:43.040> much

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
new kinds of pills so it's become much

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.970 
new kinds of pills so it's become much
more<00:02:43.370> complicated<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:44.330> choose<00:02:44.980> what

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
more complicated to choose what

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.860 
more complicated to choose what
combination<00:02:46.670> will<00:02:46.880> work<00:02:46.910> for<00:02:47.360> each<00:02:47.510> patient

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
combination will work for each patient

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.050 
combination will work for each patient
so<00:02:48.290> diabetes<00:02:49.040> has<00:02:49.310> really<00:02:49.550> undergone<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> lot

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
so diabetes has really undergone a lot

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.120 
so diabetes has really undergone a lot
of<00:02:50.210> changes<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.900> there's<00:02:51.470> also<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.770> lot<00:02:52.100> more

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
of changes and there's also a lot more

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.010 
of changes and there's also a lot more
people<00:02:52.670> with<00:02:52.940> diabetes<00:02:53.240> we're<00:02:53.750> seeing

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
people with diabetes we're seeing

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.220 
people with diabetes we're seeing
younger<00:02:54.320> and<00:02:54.710> younger<00:02:54.830> patients<00:02:55.520> with<00:02:56.090> type<00:02:56.900> 2

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
younger and younger patients with type 2

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.480 
younger and younger patients with type 2
or<00:02:57.530> what<00:02:57.680> used<00:02:57.830> to<00:02:57.950> be<00:02:58.010> called<00:02:58.220> adult<00:02:58.540> diabetes

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
or what used to be called adult diabetes

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.340 
or what used to be called adult diabetes
so<00:03:01.490> type<00:03:01.790> 2<00:03:02.090> diabetes<00:03:02.660> has<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.840> lot<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.200> new

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
so type 2 diabetes has a lot of new

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.500 
so type 2 diabetes has a lot of new
medications<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.130> even<00:03:04.640> within<00:03:05.090> the<00:03:05.180> field<00:03:05.360> of

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
medications and even within the field of

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.360 
medications and even within the field of
type<00:03:05.720> 1<00:03:05.960> or<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.410> we<00:03:06.500> used<00:03:06.530> to<00:03:06.770> call<00:03:06.890> juvenile

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
type 1 or what we used to call juvenile

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.180 
type 1 or what we used to call juvenile
diabetes<00:03:08.170> there<00:03:09.170> are<00:03:09.260> many<00:03:09.440> new<00:03:09.620> insulins

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
diabetes there are many new insulins

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.820 
diabetes there are many new insulins
there<00:03:10.790> are<00:03:10.970> new<00:03:11.150> types<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.630> insulin<00:03:12.050> pumps<00:03:12.590> and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
there are new types of insulin pumps and

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.490 
there are new types of insulin pumps and
sensors<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.640> help<00:03:13.670> patients<00:03:14.230> monitor<00:03:15.230> their

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
sensors to help patients monitor their

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.830 
sensors to help patients monitor their
progress<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.550> diabetes<00:03:16.910> has<00:03:17.240> undergone<00:03:17.570> many

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
progress so diabetes has undergone many

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.310 
progress so diabetes has undergone many
changes<00:03:17.960> in<00:03:18.440> the<00:03:18.530> last<00:03:18.680> 20<00:03:19.070> years<00:03:20.020> by<00:03:21.020> rate

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
changes in the last 20 years by rate

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.460 
changes in the last 20 years by rate
there<00:03:22.130> are<00:03:22.310> changes<00:03:22.640> in<00:03:22.880> the<00:03:23.120> technology<00:03:24.110> so

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
there are changes in the technology so

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.100 
there are changes in the technology so
when<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:24.890> started<00:03:25.400> out<00:03:25.550> as<00:03:25.850> an<00:03:26.450> endocrinologist

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
when I started out as an endocrinologist

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
when I started out as an endocrinologist
in<00:03:27.430> 1994<00:03:28.660> we<00:03:29.660> hardly<00:03:30.020> ever<00:03:30.140> used<00:03:30.470> sonograms<00:03:30.890> to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
in 1994 we hardly ever used sonograms to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.950 
in 1994 we hardly ever used sonograms to
look<00:03:31.280> at<00:03:31.400> thyroids<00:03:31.760> we<00:03:31.940> didn't<00:03:32.240> use<00:03:32.420> sonograms

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:32.960 
look at thyroids we didn't use sonograms

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.020 
look at thyroids we didn't use sonograms
to<00:03:33.200> do<00:03:33.320> biopsies<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.160> it's<00:03:34.340> completely

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
to do biopsies and it's completely

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.150 
to do biopsies and it's completely
changed<00:03:35.480> now<00:03:35.540> more<00:03:36.440> treatment<00:03:36.920> guidelines

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
changed now more treatment guidelines

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.040 
changed now more treatment guidelines
have<00:03:37.610> been<00:03:37.640> published<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.360> standardize<00:03:38.840> the

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
have been published to standardize the

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.680 
have been published to standardize the
care<00:03:39.260> for<00:03:39.500> thyroid<00:03:39.920> problems<00:03:40.430> so<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.940> both<00:03:41.480> of

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
care for thyroid problems so the both of

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.380 
care for thyroid problems so the both of
those<00:03:41.870> fields<00:03:42.350> have<00:03:42.410> changed<00:03:42.980> and

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
those fields have changed and

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.300 
those fields have changed and
osteoporosis<00:03:44.390> has<00:03:44.900> also<00:03:45.310> changed

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
osteoporosis has also changed

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.350 
osteoporosis has also changed
tremendously<00:03:46.670> in<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.870> last<00:03:48.020> 15<00:03:48.710> years<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
tremendously in the last 15 years the

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.870 
tremendously in the last 15 years the
the<00:03:50.600> baby<00:03:50.780> boomers<00:03:51.320> reached<00:03:52.040> 65<00:03:52.580> this<00:03:52.820> year

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
the baby boomers reached 65 this year

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.060 
the baby boomers reached 65 this year
and<00:03:53.680> osteoporosis

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
and osteoporosis

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.330 
and osteoporosis
as<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.610> result<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.930> rates<00:03:57.710> of<00:03:57.980> detection

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
as a result the the rates of detection

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.070 
as a result the the rates of detection
are<00:03:58.700> going<00:03:59.000> up<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.360> they<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.600> more<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.050> more

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
are going up and they have more and more

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.980 
are going up and they have more and more
medications<00:04:00.770> for<00:04:00.890> osteoporosis<00:04:01.310> in<00:04:01.990> 1994

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
medications for osteoporosis in 1994

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.380 
medications for osteoporosis in 1994
there<00:04:03.860> were<00:04:04.040> no<00:04:04.250> prescription<00:04:04.850> medications

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
there were no prescription medications

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.510 
there were no prescription medications
that<00:04:05.660> were<00:04:05.810> FDA<00:04:06.290> approved<00:04:06.740> for<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.220> treatment

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
that were FDA approved for the treatment

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.360 
that were FDA approved for the treatment
of<00:04:07.550> osteoporosis<00:04:07.670> and<00:04:08.450> now<00:04:08.660> we<00:04:09.530> have<00:04:09.710> you<00:04:10.280> know

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
of osteoporosis and now we have you know

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.390 
of osteoporosis and now we have you know
six<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.210> ten<00:04:11.510> medications<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:12.380> choose<00:04:12.620> from<00:04:12.860> so

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
six to ten medications to choose from so

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.479 
six to ten medications to choose from so
there's<00:04:13.610> really<00:04:13.760> been<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> lot<00:04:14.210> of<00:04:14.240> changes

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.460 

within<00:04:18.489> the<00:04:18.609> field<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.970> diabetes<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:20.049> way

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
within the field of diabetes the way

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.740 
within the field of diabetes the way
that<00:04:20.829> we<00:04:20.920> define<00:04:21.180> diabetes<00:04:22.180> has<00:04:22.390> actually

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
that we define diabetes has actually

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.320 
that we define diabetes has actually
changed<00:04:22.780> so<00:04:23.770> for<00:04:24.010> many<00:04:24.160> years<00:04:24.490> diabetes<00:04:25.150> was

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
changed so for many years diabetes was

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.850 
changed so for many years diabetes was
diagnosed<00:04:25.870> based<00:04:26.200> on<00:04:26.640> blood<00:04:27.640> glucose<00:04:28.090> values

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
diagnosed based on blood glucose values

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.400 
diagnosed based on blood glucose values
with<00:04:29.860> or<00:04:30.070> without<00:04:30.220> symptoms<00:04:30.960> within<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.230> last

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
with or without symptoms within the last

with or without symptoms within the last
year<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:33.070> American<00:04:33.520> Diabetes<00:04:33.820> Association

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
year the American Diabetes Association

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.890 
year the American Diabetes Association
now<00:04:35.890> says<00:04:36.250> that<00:04:36.490> we<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.850> use<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.120> test<00:04:37.600> called

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
now says that we can use a test called

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.800 
now says that we can use a test called
a1c<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.890> diagnose<00:04:39.310> diabetes<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.970> a<00:04:40.300> one<00:04:40.540> C<00:04:40.780> is

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
a1c to diagnose diabetes and a one C is

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.260 
a1c to diagnose diabetes and a one C is
a<00:04:40.990> test<00:04:41.320> that<00:04:41.500> previously<00:04:42.040> we<00:04:42.700> had<00:04:42.820> only<00:04:42.970> used

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
a test that previously we had only used

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.390 
a test that previously we had only used
to<00:04:43.480> monitor<00:04:44.080> patients<00:04:44.380> who<00:04:44.770> are<00:04:44.890> already

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
to monitor patients who are already

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.170 
to monitor patients who are already
diagnosed<00:04:45.910> with<00:04:46.060> diabetes<00:04:46.800> and<00:04:47.800> an<00:04:47.950> a1c<00:04:48.370> is<00:04:48.760> an

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
diagnosed with diabetes and an a1c is an

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.940 
diagnosed with diabetes and an a1c is an
easier<00:04:49.570> test<00:04:49.840> for<00:04:50.080> the<00:04:50.140> patient<00:04:50.500> to<00:04:50.560> do<00:04:50.770> you

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
easier test for the patient to do you

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.409 
easier test for the patient to do you
don't<00:04:51.070> have<00:04:51.190> to<00:04:51.310> be<00:04:51.490> fasting<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.120> don't<00:04:52.270> have

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
don't have to be fasting you don't have

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.230 
don't have to be fasting you don't have
to<00:04:52.570> drink<00:04:53.380> a<00:04:53.500> glucose<00:04:54.010> drink<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.730> get<00:04:54.850> repeat

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
to drink a glucose drink and get repeat

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.940 
to drink a glucose drink and get repeat
blood<00:04:55.480> sugars<00:04:55.840> it's<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.110> simple<00:04:56.470> blood<00:04:56.650> test

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
blood sugars it's a simple blood test

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.670 
blood sugars it's a simple blood test
and<00:04:57.220> it<00:04:58.030> will<00:04:58.390> probably<00:04:58.750> make<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.290> easier<00:04:59.590> for

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
and it will probably make it easier for

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.370 
and it will probably make it easier for
us<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.070> detect<00:05:00.700> diabetes<00:05:01.360> in<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:01.690> population

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:02.380 
us to detect diabetes in the population

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.230 
us to detect diabetes in the population
so<00:05:03.100> that's<00:05:03.220> been<00:05:03.580> a<00:05:03.720> it's<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.780> it's<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.440> new<00:05:05.950> trick

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
so that's been a it's a it's a new trick

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:13.590 
so that's been a it's a it's a new trick
for<00:05:07.240> an<00:05:07.360> old<00:05:07.570> test<00:05:10.770> our<00:05:11.770> practice<00:05:12.250> is<00:05:12.460> small<00:05:12.820> we

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
for an old test our practice is small we

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.370 
for an old test our practice is small we
are<00:05:13.860> two<00:05:14.860> physicians<00:05:15.270> in<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.419> small<00:05:16.720> office<00:05:17.140> we

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
are two physicians in a small office we

are a faculty practice at Maimonides

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.659 
are a faculty practice at Maimonides
which<00:05:19.780> means<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.290> we're<00:05:20.520> associated<00:05:21.520> with

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
which means that we're associated with

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.640 
which means that we're associated with
the<00:05:21.760> hospital<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.690> our<00:05:22.810> office<00:05:22.960> is<00:05:23.320> two
