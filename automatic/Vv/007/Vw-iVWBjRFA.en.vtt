00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.910
 Camera pose from father to child Today I have a big talk because everyone has a very important talk 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.780
 Listen carefully 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.230
 I already I'm become root force not'm this at the time the well has caught everyone 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 What is the basic photo in the basic photo 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 In English, it's a photograph. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.230
 Photon 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.160
 And an image with graph light 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.990
 Amount of there So you light a photograph those that were established without the surprisingly think of is I light 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.660
 Have you ever thought about it 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:37.570
 Oh I light is lived day earth in daily or Naa's a lot great whether light combing Ne Na and uh 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.220
 It's not that I think I would chance a lot of 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.120
 Well in general the light is high 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:47.140
 That's why people say this is bright 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.309
 On the contrary, that there is little light 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:56.079
 People say that there is little light Klein 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:01:01.510
 Naturally it is a photograph saying that this camera will transfer light 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.040
 It depends on the amount of light It strikes in a bright place It becomes a bright picture and always a dark place 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.130
 It will be a dark photo 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:14.479
 It's not just thinking about the amount of light in time 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:21.500
 I can do it, for example , when I took the light of this room for only one second now 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:23.260
 The amount Which is of light when bathed in a little dark and it is in this fly is a full day in the light of this light 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.380
 Hey Do you often 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.980
 The amount of light in the case of the picture is so considered 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:35.890
 It's not only bright looking, but it's dark 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:41.170
 You can think that such an increase in the amount of light can be made by accumulating in this way in units of time 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:43.250
 Then, how to feel the light is different depending on the person, for example, older people than young children 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.660
 Dark curls but slightly 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:52.430
 Birds I say I woman takes and not enough is it after vitamin a'm what so against 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:58.100
 That of the degree to which you feel the light was gone so I'd say can not be seen by 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 There is a nice outside Lilies planning or in front of the sensitivity iso and mean and sensitivity digital camera and sensitivity 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:08.970
 More than that, for example, a sensitivity of 2000 is better than a sensitivity of 100. 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:15.330
 The degree of feeling is large. The larger the number, the greater the degree of light . 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 I What happens to the the sensitivity comes to be reflected dark as high as dazzling in everyone 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.260
 Doing this will or frowning face in the not it's the first place eyes to adjust the amount of light 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.560
 I squeezed with an anti-Kyu if there is the Tteyuu dating 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:32.200
 And it is not have to adjust the amount of light entering 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.730
 This is also referred to as the same as in the diaphragm blades also I the iris of the eye in the do's lens in the digital camera 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.140
 There is a mechanism 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:46.380
 This according to the number, the greater say Toka squeeze to f 5.6 from f 1.8 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:48.209
 The hole is getting smaller and smaller The hole that lets the light go down squeezes out 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.140
 If you try to reduce 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:57.620
 And for the time to light , this is the shutter speed 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:04.840
 There is a shutter speed, for example shutter speed 1/8000 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:04.840
 Pasha is a moment It's a shutter speed of one second 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:15.090
 I will feel I mean root 1 second Attan' 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:20.160
 Do not forget the three elements I just said Shutter speed and aperture and sensitivity 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:24.600
 The patient is all right here, is n't it a camera SLR that is not so decent with your camera 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.120
 I think the mode dial that comes with your large guard It is more of a decent camera also 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.560
 Moon 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:32.080
 Kedomo I think that it has entered common probably any manufacturer it is this mode l 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:37.450
 There is a dial to say the m 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:39.580
 Please turn to the dial m Today is homework, but it has been turned to the tournament m 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.819
 Please take a picture with 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.110
 "m" is a manual setting. 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:51.860
 m The car I talked about today 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:55.900
 ー ー ー ー Speed ​​and aperture and eyebrow sensitivity Try taking a picture while adjusting these three by yourself 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.900
 It is please homework See you next time
