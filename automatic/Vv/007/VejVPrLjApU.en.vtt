 infiltrated gameplay for you to see 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.450
 quietly 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.490
 and well, the game is developed 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 for the Japanese study games that were 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.960
 the people in charge of the dragon franchise 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.250
 ball z budokai and the game will feature a 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.950
 new game system 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.300
 in addition to a new world map a 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.100
 mysterious city and others 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.470
 characteristics that will be announced to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.710
 over the next months already 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 we'll see what this game holds 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.040
 the fact is that good as you see in the 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.670
 trailer if you had seen the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.080
 trailer there is a question that good is the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.660
 already he is trying to solve 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 in the previous informative video of this 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.250
 game that comes to be the warrior 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.170
 mysterious the warrior that we saw 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.890
 that goes with the trump jacket 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.470
 redhead the seeker 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.040
 etcetera then we do not know who is 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.930
 it's still what I think is what 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.540
 that what I said in the other video is not 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.369
 it can be a created character even though 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.610
 goal in the story of 'dragon ball' and 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:06.650
 we can play with him I do not know anymore 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.440
 we will see and they will be taking out new 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.140
 news to see if we can not enter 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 Quick of who is this warrior and nothing 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.550
 it is simply then this so that what 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.980
 you know, it was a little advance of the game and 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.270

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.180
