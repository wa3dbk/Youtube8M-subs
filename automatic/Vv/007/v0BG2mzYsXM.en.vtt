aperture F stops again alright first of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.120 
aperture F stops again alright first of
all<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:23.850> only<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.410> numbers<00:00:25.410> to<00:00:25.920> remember

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
all there's only two numbers to remember

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.330 
all there's only two numbers to remember
and<00:00:26.609> that<00:00:27.180> makes<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> all<00:00:27.689> simple<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:29.099> number

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and that makes it all simple that number

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.920 
and that makes it all simple that number
is<00:00:29.429> 1<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.470> then<00:00:31.579> 1.4<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.210> my<00:00:33.360> handwriting<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
is 1 and then 1.4 now my handwriting is

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.040 
is 1 and then 1.4 now my handwriting is
sloppy<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.710> please<00:00:34.980> forgive<00:00:35.309> me<00:00:35.489> okay<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.210> this

is all you need to know to remember all
the<00:00:38.850> other<00:00:39.000> aperture<00:00:39.540> numbers<00:00:39.840> so<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.800> next

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the other aperture numbers so the next

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.650 
the other aperture numbers so the next
number<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> just<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.180> number<00:00:42.500> double<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:44.660> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
number is just this number double to the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.720 
number is just this number double to the
next<00:00:45.930> number<00:00:46.050> is<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.500> number<00:00:46.770> doubled<00:00:47.700> 2.8

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
next number is this number doubled 2.8

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.939 
next number is this number doubled 2.8
the<00:00:50.730> next<00:00:51.059> number<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:52.020> number<00:00:52.289> double

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the next number is this number double

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.119 
the next number is this number double
for<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.899> next<00:00:55.199> number<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.890> number

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
for the next number is this number

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.569 
for the next number is this number
double<00:00:56.719> 5.6<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.800> see<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> pattern<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
double 5.6 and you see the pattern you

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.340 
double 5.6 and you see the pattern you
see<00:00:59.609> how<00:00:59.850> easy<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.359> is<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> continue<00:01:01.199> this

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
see how easy it is to continue this

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
see how easy it is to continue this
string<00:01:01.680> all<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> double<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
string all you have to do is double the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.560 
string all you have to do is double the
previous<00:01:03.570> number<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.100> have<00:01:05.220> 5.6<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> next

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
previous number so we have 5.6 the next

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.390 
previous number so we have 5.6 the next
number<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> this<00:01:07.350> number<00:01:07.670> 4<00:01:08.670> 4<00:01:09.420> double<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.960> 8

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
number is this number 4 4 double is 8

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.789 
number is this number 4 4 double is 8
the<00:01:11.400> next<00:01:11.549> number<00:01:11.909> is<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.150> one<00:01:12.390> double<00:01:12.900> five

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the next number is this one double five

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.120 
the next number is this one double five
point<00:01:14.100> six<00:01:14.310> times<00:01:15.240> 2<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.830> actually

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
point six times 2 well that one actually

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.179 
point six times 2 well that one actually
this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.090> answer<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> 11<00:01:18.869> but<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.740> answer

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
this is the answer is 11 but the answer

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.359 
this is the answer is 11 but the answer
actually<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:21.049> 11<00:01:22.049> point<00:01:22.350> 2<00:01:22.500> but<00:01:23.100> we're<00:01:23.250> going

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
actually is 11 point 2 but we're going

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.330 
actually is 11 point 2 but we're going
to<00:01:23.430> cheat<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.729> say<00:01:23.850> 11<00:01:24.210> okay<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> 8/8<00:01:25.830> double

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
to cheat and say 11 okay the 8/8 double

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
to cheat and say 11 okay the 8/8 double
16<00:01:26.909> ah<00:01:27.829> my<00:01:28.829> handwriting<00:01:29.009> sucks<00:01:29.729> okay<00:01:30.540> 11

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
16 ah my handwriting sucks okay 11

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.039 
16 ah my handwriting sucks okay 11
double<00:01:31.229> 22<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:32.850> forth<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.570> forth<00:01:33.600> if

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
double 22 and so forth and so forth if

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.240 
double 22 and so forth and so forth if
you're<00:01:34.560> lucky<00:01:35.220> enough<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.549> shoot<00:01:35.759> at<00:01:36.000> an

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
you're lucky enough to shoot at an

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.340 
you're lucky enough to shoot at an
aperture<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.520> f-stop<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:39.119> 32<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.110> would<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
aperture or f-stop of 32 that would be

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.639 
aperture or f-stop of 32 that would be
the<00:01:40.470> next<00:01:40.619> number<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.659> that's<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.990> these<00:01:43.500> are

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the next number and that's it these are

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
the next number and that's it these are
your<00:01:43.740> numbers<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.280> one<00:01:44.520> point<00:01:44.729> four<00:01:45.030> two<00:01:45.390> two

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
your numbers one one point four two two

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.560 
your numbers one one point four two two
point<00:01:45.990> eight<00:01:46.170> four<00:01:46.560> five<00:01:46.979> point<00:01:47.310> six<00:01:47.549> eight<00:01:47.850> 11

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
point eight four five point six eight 11

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.359 
point eight four five point six eight 11
16<00:01:49.140> 22<00:01:49.770> 32<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.909> if<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.149> had<00:01:51.270> 4<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.250> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
16 22 32 so if you had 4 and you want to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.999 
16 22 32 so if you had 4 and you want to
go<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.820> increase<00:01:54.570> your<00:01:54.840> let's<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.560> say<00:01:55.770> shut

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
go up increase your let's just say shut

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.630 
go up increase your let's just say shut
down<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.490> aperture<00:01:56.969> by<00:01:57.420> two<00:01:57.479> stops<00:01:58.159> one<00:01:59.159> two

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
down your aperture by two stops one two

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.420 
down your aperture by two stops one two
that<00:02:00.000> number<00:02:00.240> will<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.450> 8<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.860> have<00:02:01.979> 5<00:02:02.219> if

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that number will be 8 if you have 5 if

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.130 
that number will be 8 if you have 5 if
you're<00:02:02.670> wide<00:02:02.939> open<00:02:02.969> usually<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> people

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you're wide open usually a lot of people
