00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.650
 what is that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.370
 people with tuberculosis was also 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.150
 a prison many people died here you who 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:23.529
 we can enter not 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.529
 this place is haunted 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.590
 This good one was long wanted 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.720
 do as a true competition but 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 in the end we arrived as to the agreement that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.300
 it would be better how, if we did the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.060
 competition was going to be like more outside 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.100
 of the place and everything then we think that 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.690
 what better we wanted to show a little more 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 of what is costa rica true a little 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.490
 more than everything of all the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 stories that keep and we achieve the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.010
 permission to use all the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.010
 installation inside 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.590
 good at first it came as an idea 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.869
 a national project 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 together with my network mate bull who 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:38.140
 is this daniel he is from venezuela la 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.899
 idea came from the two of us together and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.450
 after this this when the video 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.200
 when the project was finished it showed 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.469
 aa 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.600
 projectile was shown the campaign let's say 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.149
 of international baseball they were left 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.039
 impressed they were moved with 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.320
 how was the video and was 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.320
 became an international project 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.560
 well first that sometimes the weather does not 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.870
 helps truth because he did a little 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.460
 foggy all the time this also 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.420
 had to be moving the plan camps 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.800
 and so the structure is a bit is a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.819
 little little then it was a bit 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.370
 difficult to be moving everything 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.349
 and also this dedicate all this leads 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.260
 time and as we have we are playing 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.060
 with one with only one time range was 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.499
 difficult to be true with everything 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.499
 but in the end is that achievement 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.840
 of filming we had we had only one 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.820
 boy in the cen we had a west 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.160
 we have another that was to build the one that 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.890
 he built the ramps we had a 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 photographer too and we had four 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.540
 colleagues who were the ones who helped us 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.030
 to move the ramps and the heads that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.910
 they even got into moving the 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.680
 ramps because they are quite heavy and 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.300
 even at other times they took 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.490
 the camera because the other was filming 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.620
 on the other side and said and takes help that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.090
 handle the other camera like that but I 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.270
 I think it was a joint work all 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.270
 yes
