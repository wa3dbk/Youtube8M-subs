00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
which is ridiculous this guy's probably

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.980 
which is ridiculous this guy's probably
the<00:03:01.640> right<00:03:01.820> amount<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.210> a<00:03:02.300> match<00:03:02.450> on<00:03:02.660> the<00:03:02.780> game

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
the right amount of a match on the game

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.570

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
one of the rose plays and again because

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.160 
one of the rose plays and again because
there's<00:03:04.820> hardly<00:03:05.090> any<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.390> them<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.870> now

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
there's hardly any of them and now

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.050 
there's hardly any of them and now
there's<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.380> to<00:03:06.530> be<00:03:06.590> literally<00:03:07.250> next<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
there's going to be literally next to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.820 
there's going to be literally next to
nom<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:08.660> eventually<00:03:08.750> i'll<00:03:09.260> probably<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.680> like

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
nom so eventually i'll probably do like

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.770
