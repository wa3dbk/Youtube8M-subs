00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.410
 has been registered with us 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.130
 how then stay with it 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.160
 whole 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.060
 have contracted one of the best midfielders from next season 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:14.329
 we make ourselves strong 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.939
 what goes with it is strong what exactly he adds everyone knows the qualities 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.310
 of course but what does he add 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.400
 as a precaution 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.779
 his football qualities are both 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.979
 in addition to a standard situation, but also simply along with position play 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:31.119
 with a good plan 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.010
 Once again you have already proven themselves at tno were of course also getting to know cup 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.960
 precisely in the actual 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 in a first proposal a number of storms is that big man of the 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.940
 the top business 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.230
 big competitions at the first hour of the track, he gets two fingers in it 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.390
 his nose very easily with it 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.310
 in addition, it is a type like him how he works turn the extrovert 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.530
 people 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.480
 and I do not mean the animals weird things we just have to right 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.780
 people sometimes 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 He opened up we can put in the right way in it's one 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.410
 the winner 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.920
 one I think we do not have too many types of it with the met 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.440
 louisse such a type 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.920
 that went so you have to have a good mix and intimidate with theo jansen 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 played there is also more to come in balance 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.189
 6 the Dutch national team he was immediately on it is he does not come from the 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.439
 training of ajax 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.789
 in the previous one you expect that you need time to master it 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:37.360
 after more than an hour and a half he is a player who sets himself apart very quickly 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.200
 the two that actually played a better set our country in it 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.030
 so I expected no adjustments at all 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.200
 words for 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 in it is a week after the competition 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.910
 actually 8 days now to the competition that went fast and got aware so fast 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.820
 acted 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.660
 yes so 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.160
 If the a topper like theirs the winner you should also be able to show it to him 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.800
 with a very happy will 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.209
 In addition, I want us to think so too 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.699
 other teams might also apply them abroad 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.660
 That's the astra that's important we get 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.909
 next year because they have become the first 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.109
 play with violence spring if you were 3 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.109
 water in the streams in the competition 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.749
 that was playing fifteen games 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.699
 late broken breakers 

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:34.969
 more important for everyone 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.139
 4 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.859
 continue to act at the very highest level to have very good players 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.709
 6 and also in the width 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.709
 for each position you see him choose 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.679
 That 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:51.099
 Ajax defender and midfielder but if that won't follow six 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.499
 the midfielder has midfield at the draw 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.499
 she can actually influence all those three positions 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.389
 We have been here for a few days but today in Amsterdam it is so delicious 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.769
 the last few days at that time it actually not at all 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.169
 Harbin first master the suit 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:12.169
 the temperatures there are mostly spoken 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:13.620
 you hear this be 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.270
 doing this would like to use and we also have today 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:17.940
 behind the wheel
