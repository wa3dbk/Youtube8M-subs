the<00:00:03.300> way<00:00:03.420> I<00:00:03.450> got<00:00:03.690> started<00:00:04.050> was<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.290> lived<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.590> a

00:00:04.639 --> 00:00:04.649 
the way I got started was I lived on a

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.910 
the way I got started was I lived on a
farm<00:00:04.710> and<00:00:05.220> my<00:00:05.370> parents<00:00:05.850> were<00:00:06.809> very<00:00:06.870> much<00:00:07.290> in

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:07.920 
farm and my parents were very much in

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.160 
farm and my parents were very much in
use<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.430> herbs<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.120> natural<00:00:09.300> healing<00:00:09.840> methods

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
use of herbs and natural healing methods

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.079 
use of herbs and natural healing methods
for<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.470> livestock<00:00:11.339> that<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.639> had<00:00:11.820> and

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:12.089 
for the livestock that we had and

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:14.089 
for the livestock that we had and
through<00:00:12.750> watching<00:00:12.959> all<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.379> this<00:00:13.589> and<00:00:13.860> Turing

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
through watching all of this and Turing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.739 
through watching all of this and Turing
watch<00:00:14.280> what<00:00:14.549> their<00:00:14.700> diet<00:00:14.910> did<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.299> raise<00:00:15.480> them

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:15.749 
watch what their diet did to raise them

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.900 
watch what their diet did to raise them
to<00:00:15.780> become<00:00:16.230> cattle<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:16.800> cows<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.760> could

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
to become cattle or cows that could

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.450 
to become cattle or cows that could
produce<00:00:18.080> milk<00:00:19.080> or<00:00:19.439> pigs<00:00:19.769> to<00:00:19.920> produce<00:00:20.189> pork

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
produce milk or pigs to produce pork

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.000 
produce milk or pigs to produce pork
chops<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.970> realized<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.990> their<00:00:22.230> diet<00:00:22.470> made<00:00:22.980> a

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
chops I realized that their diet made a

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.130 
chops I realized that their diet made a
very<00:00:23.490> big<00:00:23.699> difference<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.599> profitability

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
very big difference in the profitability

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.939 
very big difference in the profitability
of<00:00:25.349> how<00:00:25.619> we<00:00:25.679> live<00:00:26.130> day<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.429> day<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.689> dad<00:00:27.949> was

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of how we live day to day and my dad was

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859 
of how we live day to day and my dad was
very<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.460> into<00:00:29.789> using<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.480> these<00:00:30.660> natural

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
very much into using all these natural

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.749 
very much into using all these natural
things<00:00:31.259> because<00:00:31.589> of<00:00:31.740> cost-effectiveness<00:00:32.250> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
things because of cost-effectiveness and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.730 
things because of cost-effectiveness and
because<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.030> long-term<00:00:33.210> value<00:00:33.810> to<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> animal

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:34.740 
because of long-term value to the animal

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.380 
because of long-term value to the animal
that<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.100> saved<00:00:35.430> us<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.700> lot<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.850> money<00:00:36.060> and<00:00:36.300> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
that it saved us a lot of money and it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.270 
that it saved us a lot of money and it
was<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> right<00:00:36.780> way<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:36.960> go<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.100> age

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
was the right way to go and at the age

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.580 
was the right way to go and at the age
of<00:00:38.460> 14<00:00:38.910> years<00:00:38.940> old<00:00:39.360> they<00:00:39.810> told<00:00:40.080> me<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.410> had

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
of 14 years old they told me that I had

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.560 
of 14 years old they told me that I had
a<00:00:40.620> bad<00:00:40.860> heart<00:00:41.160> valve<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.210> needed<00:00:42.420> to

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
a bad heart valve and that I needed to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240 
a bad heart valve and that I needed to
have<00:00:42.720> this<00:00:42.870> heart<00:00:43.110> valve<00:00:43.320> replaced<00:00:43.890> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
have this heart valve replaced and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.850 
have this heart valve replaced and
replaced<00:00:45.210> with<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.420> pig<00:00:45.660> valve<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.590> asked

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
replaced with the pig valve and I asked

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.470 
replaced with the pig valve and I asked
the<00:00:46.950> doctor<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.460> tell<00:00:47.700> me<00:00:47.820> doc<00:00:47.970> how<00:00:48.180> long<00:00:48.360> would

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
might get eight years out of that and I

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.390 
might get eight years out of that and I
said<00:00:54.030> eight<00:00:54.240> years<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:55.170> imagine<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.130> horror

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
anything better than that and he said

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.639 
anything better than that and he said
well<00:01:08.549> by<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.479> may<00:01:09.659> have<00:01:09.810> new<00:01:09.990> technology

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
well by then we may have new technology

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.410 
well by then we may have new technology
and<00:01:10.829> I<00:01:10.920> said<00:01:11.159> hmm<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.789> then<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.390> course

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and I said hmm and then of course

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.240 
and I said hmm and then of course
something<00:01:12.840> came<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.229> me<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.710> think<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.100> was

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
something came to me and I think it was

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.730 
something came to me and I think it was
a<00:01:14.280> higher<00:01:14.609> power<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.659> said<00:01:15.899> to<00:01:16.079> me<00:01:16.229> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
a higher power and it said to me you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
a higher power and it said to me you
know<00:01:16.829> ask<00:01:17.070> him<00:01:17.399> what<00:01:17.850> if<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.060> technology<00:01:18.479> was

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
know ask him what if the technology was

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.510 
know ask him what if the technology was
that<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.530> weren't<00:01:19.710> supposed<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.219> have<00:01:20.310> had

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
that you weren't supposed to have had

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.359 
that you weren't supposed to have had
the<00:01:20.700> heart<00:01:20.939> valve<00:01:21.179> and<00:01:21.710> from<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.890> point<00:01:23.159> on<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
the heart valve and from that point on I

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
the heart valve and from that point on I
was<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.789> such<00:01:24.030> fear<00:01:24.329> such<00:01:24.689> anxiety<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.499> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
was in such fear such anxiety that I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
was in such fear such anxiety that I
started<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> research<00:01:26.189> any<00:01:26.729> other<00:01:27.210> method

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
started to research any other method

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.239 
started to research any other method
that<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:27.899> work<00:01:28.079> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.679> thought<00:01:28.859> about<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:29.249 
that could work and I thought about the

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:31.039 
that could work and I thought about the
animals<00:01:29.579> on<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.789> farm<00:01:29.969> and<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.359> I<00:01:30.390> found

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
animals on the farm and so I found

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
animals on the farm and so I found
something<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.590> was<00:01:31.799> called<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.159> curandero<00:01:32.729> in

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
something that was called a curandero in
