00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.839
 good afternoon dear friends today we have 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 meeting with you number 31 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.130
 today we will talk about very 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:16.289
 interesting number 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.380
 the fact is that besides the western 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.300
 numerology and psychomatrix in which we 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.930
 with you considered our previous 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.380
 meetings 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 There is still numerology Vedic code 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.019
 Vedic numerology claims that 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.390
 each of us has a number of souls what is 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.760
 soul number soul number is your day 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:41.640
 birth minimized prime 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.829
 that is, if you were born 1 10 19 28 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.070
 the amount is one 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:53.340
 that is, you have one soul number if you 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:54.149
 born 2 11 20 and 29 numbers tula number 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 souls 2 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.719
 what does the number of the soul indicate 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.609
 soul and has a huge impact on the same 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.670
 human and according to Vedic 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.159
 numerology is considered the most important little 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.200
 In addition, each of us has this number 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:17.360
 works very differently 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.390
 cards from one 127 years 25 years old but in 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.740
 anyway she works very hard 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.960
 the course of life is 27 years old and no matter how we 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.090
 wanted this number determines our lives 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.090
 our relationship with the outside world 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.119
 and our relationships with those around us 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.179
 people and according to the Vedic log number 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.000
 every soul number 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:44.509
 from is related to any planet or 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.229
 the sun and the moon in this case in this 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.270
 meeting in our current meeting I want with 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.569
 you talk and soul number two 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.989
 why this soul number is under 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.579
 influenced by the moon and the moon is a female planet 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:03.700
 and it turns out that people who were born 2 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:07.269
 11 20 29 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.560
 very much supported by the moon and 

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:12.079
 it is advisable not to decide on 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.290
 waning moon and especially when full 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:19.030
 the moon because the moon is special and the tides 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.170
 and the ebb about doing these people 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.350
 impermanent and most importantly what 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.239
 decisions that are made in descending order 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.299
 the moon then does not justify itself 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.350
 besides the moon is very strong 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:35.299
 on women 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:39.680
 if women gave birth from 2 11 29 years 20 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:42.350
 the number of them is very difficult and very 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:45.530
 interesting factors for people who 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.530
 soul number deuce is that they are at least 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 in their lives, they do everything twice and 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.769
 you did not try you get that 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.090
 career you can start twice and 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.880
 Solving personal issues I mean 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.750
 marriages can be twice that is 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.060
 whether you want it or not you want a deuce 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.280
 this will contribute to the maximum 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:10.549
 but if we pay attention then 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.010
 soul number 2 of those born 2 and those 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.319
 who was born 11 numbers plus 1 plus 1 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.160
 deuce twentieth and twenty ninth and 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.680
 it is considered that it is very hard of all these 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.830
 twos people born on the 20th 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:28.170
 here is a deuce of influence 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.580
 and 0 but since 0 can perform different 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.560
 function that is, it can be like 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:38.700
 emptiness is so true then sometimes by this 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.140
 people have enough 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.350
 problematic in addressing certain 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.780
 questions and people who were born 11 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.760
 numbers they have two ones and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.620
 here these two ones on the one hand 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.090
 require as twos this number 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.890
 peacemaker and people who are capable and not 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.330
 only negotiate possesses and 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:05.650
 patience and capable of empathy and 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:07.870
 very tolerant people who 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.240
 11 were born not only that this number 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.330
 mystics and these people need to think only 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.550
 oh good and god forbid about bad like this 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.660
 they still these two edinichki put pressure on them and 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.210
 causes them to be more inhale 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.870
 active and more 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:28.780
 intractable certain situations and 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:31.960
 people who were born on the 29th 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.210
 it is believed that they are lucky most 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 on the one hand it is 2 and 9 on the other 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.880
 sides from 11 and 11 says too 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.919
 that focus on the bad in no way 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:47.500
 case it is impossible very interesting that 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.400
 men who have the number of soul 2nd 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.190
 desirable issues to solve women 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.360
 any business why because somehow 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.850
 way this deuce contributes to 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.490
 their women perceives due to the fact that 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.400
 Moon is a very strong impact 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.010
 on us women and in general the moon is female 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.930
 beginning maternal therefore 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:15.790
 these people tend to care 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:20.260
 surrounding them they are just the way 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.960
 case will be persistent and may 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.290
 show aggression when for some 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.360
 reasons someone hurt them and trust me 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.360
 they will be able to fight back 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.560
 according to their people birth card 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.690
 which soul number is two 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.700
 they have a very strong inclination towards 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.290
 infectious disease about it need 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.830
 remember and 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.110
 This also applies to small children 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:49.390
 in periods when a is progressing and 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.120
 various infectious diseases 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:55.740
 these people should be removed as much as possible 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.520
 or from their environment must be 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:02.860
 cleaned and but those who are sick believe me 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.930
 they are not only ill with such promotions 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.700
 diseases it is very difficult for them 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:11.950
 them to go out besides people who have 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:19.390
 soul number 2 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:21.430
 they are very much tolerant or 

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:22.660
 they can always be given with people 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.460
 which is the soul number 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:31.710
 7 and it is believed that they are protected by this. 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.060
 number and by the way for choosing some 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:36.720
 when choosing a favorable date of the 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:40.840
 you need to consider that everyone who was born with 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.710
 number of souls 2nd preferably per month and 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:46.950
 choose days 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:51.550
 second 11 20 29 and also the seventh 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:55.720
 16 and 25 are the most favorable 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:59.010
 for you i want you to learn and 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.840
 use your card little by little 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.010
 learn to love not only that date 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.340
 birth a 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.830
