they have had a brain injury until they

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.709 
they have had a brain injury until they
start<00:00:39.070> to<00:00:39.190> go<00:00:39.309> to<00:00:39.370> school<00:00:39.730> for<00:00:40.000> example<00:00:40.300> and

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
start to go to school for example and

and learning difficulties at school I

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.160

believe<00:00:46.530> early<00:00:47.530> diagnosis<00:00:48.219> is<00:00:48.329> crucial<00:00:49.329> to<00:00:50.140> a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
believe early diagnosis is crucial to a

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.090 
believe early diagnosis is crucial to a
child's<00:00:51.070> well-being<00:00:52.379> for<00:00:53.379> their<00:00:53.530> development

so making sure that you don't just
downplay<00:00:59.379> just<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.710> bump<00:00:59.949> on<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.100> head<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:01.210> will

downplay just a bump on the head it will

downplay just a bump on the head it will
be<00:01:01.659> important<00:01:02.170> certainly<00:01:02.499> there's<00:01:02.920> clear

immediate memory loss and that's I think

immediate memory loss and that's I think
probably<00:03:54.109> one<00:03:54.379> of<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.530> big<00:03:54.739> challenges<00:03:54.980> in

probably one of the big challenges in

probably one of the big challenges in
treating<00:03:56.000> this<00:03:56.239> is<00:03:56.599> it's<00:03:56.930> not<00:03:57.169> just<00:03:57.500> people

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
treating this is it's not just people

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.319 
treating this is it's not just people
who<00:03:57.829> lose<00:03:58.160> consciousness<00:03:58.790> that<00:03:58.940> have<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> head

injury the three typical ways of the
most<00:04:01.340> prevalent<00:04:01.699> ways<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:02.329> children<00:04:02.690> get

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
most prevalent ways that children get

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.950 
most prevalent ways that children get
brain<00:04:03.049> injury<00:04:03.410> are<00:04:03.680> basically<00:04:04.549> Falls<00:04:05.269> because

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
brain injury are basically Falls because

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.810 
brain injury are basically Falls because
kids<00:04:06.230> are<00:04:06.440> at<00:04:06.560> high<00:04:06.710> risk<00:04:06.920> that<00:04:07.190> toddlers<00:04:07.640> are

kids are at high risk that toddlers are

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.060 
kids are at high risk that toddlers are
running<00:04:08.030> around<00:04:08.150> they<00:04:08.480> fall<00:04:08.720> a<00:04:08.750> lot<00:04:08.960> they<00:04:09.860> trip

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
running around they fall a lot they trip

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.620 
running around they fall a lot they trip
down<00:04:10.250> stairs<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.730> things<00:04:10.910> like<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.150> so

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
down stairs and things like that so

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.570 
down stairs and things like that so
Falls<00:04:12.110> is<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.380> number<00:04:12.710> one<00:04:12.860> way<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.250> kids

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580 
Falls is the number one way that kids

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.580 
Falls is the number one way that kids
get<00:04:13.790> an<00:04:13.880> injury<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:15.020> second<00:04:15.380> one<00:04:15.470> is
