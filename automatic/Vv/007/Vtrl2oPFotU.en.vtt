00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.769
 hi friends how are you now felipe de 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.510
 somerton urban and today in this reflection 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.720
 biblical I want to talk about the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.000
 story of Adam and Eve is a great 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.989
 history because we can learn many 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.550
 things but I just want to touch a point 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.380
 which I think can be a blessing 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.410
 for our life if we can 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:37.269
 learn from this I want that 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.930
 imagine yourself living in a world 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:44.329
 perfect in a paradise a place where no 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 there is pain there are no 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.410
 concerns all the wishes of the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.470
 life that one can have has it 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.890
 but God had said 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.520
 Adam and Eve 'who could enjoy everything 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.420
 less than one thing 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.790
 there was a tree with a fruit and god 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.050
 said of that tree you can not eat 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:14.250
 imagine a single thing could not 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 do because if they did that it was going to 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 to remove them from God was going to fail 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.590
 that confidence 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.970
 that love that union that communion that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.720
 they had with god 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:36.200
 it turns out that satan came 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.180
 like a snake he started talking to 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:43.910
 she and convinced her that there is what 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.340
 God does not want you to eat this fruit 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.760
 because if you eat it, it's going to be the same as 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.760
 the 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:57.730
 she was deceived she comes and convinces 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:01.880
 they gave and ate of that fruit and what 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:08.020
 they know the story he knows he left 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:10.270
 the sin that separated them from God 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.220
 and even they tried to hide 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.920
 God because they knew what 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.620
 had done now that what has to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 see this with our life is very 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.390
 simple friends 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:26.500
 there are times that we work 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.010
 strongly and we do all the possible 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.940
 to live a good life a life 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.940
 clean a life without vices try to be 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.970
 good dads good good brothers 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.060
 children fulfill all that we must 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.550
 fulfill read the bible as we should 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.870
 read learn your word go to the 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.760
 church try to be good Christians 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.910
 help the poor 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.080
 what's going on 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.570
 the devil knows our weaknesses he 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.870
 knows the weakness of each one because 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:10.030
 we each have a weakness each 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:14.050
 person is different and sooner or later 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:20.000
 satan is going to come and he is going to offer you 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:24.440
 he will offer something that will try to 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.930
 move away from the communion of presence 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.019
 of that friendship that you have with God 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:36.340
 and maybe at that moment you feel 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:38.590
 peace in your heart but suddenly it comes 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.750
 to someone a friend 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.750
 and offers you liquor they offer you drugs 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:53.660
 a woman comes and offers you sex and you 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.210
 He is married in a moment 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.330
 all that peace of mind that you had in 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:01.900
 your life all that work that you had 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.900
 fact 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.610
 it is destroyed 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.160
 lose your family after returning 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.380
 alcoholic after returning everything addicted 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.610
 you can lose your job you can lose 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:19.930
 Your Health 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:24.560
 just because you fell into a trap 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.960
 that satan I prepare for you 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:30.410
 many people think that just because 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.110
 someone is christian, nobody, we are never going to 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:37.160
 have temptations 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.770
 friends we are flesh and blood 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.650
 we have blood running for our 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.890
 veins we know what is good and 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.780
 what is bad there are people who say you have 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.050
 to be a Christian to know what he puts 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.970
 bad no no no no no no we no longer 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.310
 we do with that we know what 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.740
 it's good and bad 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.950
 good if they are not sociopaths because 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.440
 sociopaths do not know they are crazy 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.750
 they do not even feel anything 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.430
 but most people know what 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.930
 what is good and bad 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.449
 and only one error is taken up so that you 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:20.689
 life be here 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.339
 and fall completely down 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.459
 then we have to have 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:30.229
 very careful when someone comes and we 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:33.289
 offers something that seems rich that we 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:37.050
 they pay us happiness not for 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:41.479
 excite and not to give of everything 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.479
 but those things are temporary 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:50.980
 I use the example of a confection 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.830
 when someone gives you a confection you 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.729
 it feels so rich and you are not 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.249
 savoring 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:02.689
 but sooner or later dry confections will 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:06.110
 undo and already in your mouth that was nothing and 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:08.240
 this is sin sin and the rich man 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.559
 who tells you that he is not rich is a liar 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:14.889
 sin is rich but only hard lasts 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:18.669
 very little 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:21.849
 and then comes the circumstances that 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:25.389
 they destroy your life and the problem 

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:29.590
 Friends is that God forgives Jesus Christ 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:33.819
 sorry but that does not mean that the 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:36.930
 chaos that has been caused through 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:40.800
 your mistake will disappear 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:44.190
 because the human being does not forgive so 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.690
 easily the things you did in your 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:50.930
 life the disasters you did if 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.910
 losing your family will not be so easy 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.139
 recover them and lose your health for cause 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.370
 of drugs or alcohol will not be easy 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.000
 retrieve it and it may be that you're not going to 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.000
 can do 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.680
 then be careful 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.310
 friend keep your eyes keep your ears 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.050
 keep your mouth keep your mind and for 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:16.050
 please keep your heart 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:23.639
 because satan is going to attack you 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:28.870
 do not be like adam and eva ' 

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:33.380
 do not eat that forbidden fruit 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:36.380
 because that may be the fall of your life 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:41.380
 see you later, thank you for listening 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.380
