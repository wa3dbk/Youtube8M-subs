 yoda to create a special youtuber raid 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.550
 destiny for complaint laplane reasons the 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.170
 first is obviously to bring together 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.150
 a little bit this French community 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.000
 who really needs it 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.739
 we had already supported the project es batel 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.410
 that allowed players to come together 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.090
 around one and only community 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.190
 it was a great idea this time 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.989
 we want to create a raid 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.640
 special youtuber destiny so 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:54.250

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.989

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.059

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.670

 this will be the opportunity for us of their 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.880
 ask questions to know what has 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.259

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.119

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.750
 youtube channel and it will also be 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.550
 the opportunity for you to know 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.200
 new people so maybe that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.600

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.070
