00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.899
 Thumbs up and see you in the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.430
 next video video teams the exact one 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 quantities I have you in the info 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.970
 box packed which is very important that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.740
 you soft and have me liquid butter 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.049
 used so briefly in the microwave at 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 best buy and also brown sugar 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.619
 not replaced by the white sugar 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.259
 because the brown sugar for this soft 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.090
 Consistency, therefore , as well as natron 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.189
 has confused and not with baking powder 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.409
 baking powder leaves you cookies like that 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.460
 has and will be super crispy and that 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.409
 smartphone is then really right 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.909
 nice to go and that's why it comes 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.350
 in the middle also this soft core 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.869
 so to speak 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.369
 first of all is it the butter so 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.409
 a bit creamy that they are such a 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.600
 bright color takes and then goes the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 add sugar and the egg and the egg yolk 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.350
 and just stir it to one 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.659
 homogeneous mass next goes in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.700
 a crisis salt something and that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.979
 Fairy tale and pay attention to it 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.810
 that he does not feel too extreme about it 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.790
 So it's really only until the dough 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.259
 almost the whole thing more 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.860
 next you can co-drip your show 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.740
 Fold and another 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.450
 tip for shaping the cookies something for me 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.430
 the whole somehow whole process 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.500
 has accelerated extremely and that is 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.630
 So a shareholder and if you are there 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.160
 you just get the dough portioned 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.230
 any big cookies in the best 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.580
 case also be round and it is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.650
 just a lot more professional somehow 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.360
 out and go super fix the whole thing is 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.820
 their in the preheated oven at 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.770
 180 degrees for eight to ten minutes a 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.930
 and the watch I'm done when the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.070
 rand is a bit golden brown and 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.290
 Do not be surprised how cookies are then 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.520
 first great because I'm in the middle and 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.660
 they would crumble too if you take them 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.190
 would eat right away 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.450
 That's why I always leave them first 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.280
 a little bit from then they are 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.540
 perfect it really crispy on the outside and 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.540
 nice and soft on the inside
