00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 and make a remake of a video of how 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.319
 to be able to move our ps3 knob to 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.190
 play nintendo 64 with retro art that is 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.830
 right here 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.019
 although the first for users of 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.160
 windows 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.080
 it is a usb cable control 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.870
 and of course 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.180
 we will have to go to this page 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.720
 Once inside the download page 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.840
 this file we open it we install 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.370
 we connect the taking with the usb cable 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.920
 and we expect windows to install the 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.250
 controllers to recognize the 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.630
 system to the control once done that 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.580
 let's go to settings 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.530
 generate information and within 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.380
 information find the address of the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 device that they are using we copy it 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.240
 and we paste it into the application to 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.820
 windows and we give connect or charge 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.500
 Bluetooth address once done that 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 we can disconnect the control and 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.870
 right away it will tell you what is going on 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.800
 meanwhile they were amac what we're going 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 to make in your case download a file 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.420
 that will leave the link in the description 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.980
 is called expert or six yes I think that 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.040
 weeks and expert 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.950
 we're going to open it on the computer 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.880
 it is not open we are going to only our 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.640
 control of ps3 and the ipad or the ipod or the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.420
 iphone what they are using no matter what 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.150
 we connect to the computer and it's going to say 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.890
 the program because they recognized themselves 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.130
 once recognized we are going to chop in the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.290
 pre controller button to see the 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.010
 device once done that and it's going to 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.440
 say yes yes it was achieved was not achieved once 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.490
 accomplished 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.520
 that surely there is no problem 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 is going to say achieved and this we can 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.890
 disconnect both from the computer 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.730
 now if what we are going to do is say 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.730
 the retro art 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 front-end 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.100
 global card configuration 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:10.740
 let's go down we're going to chop in 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.740
 impute an input we are going to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:18.010
 they mapped their very simple buttons what 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.870
 first thing we're going to do is connect 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.879
 our control of ps3 we are going to press 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.799
 the ps button that is just in 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.750
 medium and how can you see before 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:29.019
 pressing the button is very important that 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:32.560
 be given that they are fixed upwards already 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:36.689
 start bluetooth of this which is this without 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.960
 The bluetooth are gray if activated 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.210
 so 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.990
 you have to press the ps button but not 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.180
 before because if they do not recognize themselves ok ya 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.000
 once done that we are going to press the 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.600
 button 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.900
 and ready 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.310
 they have already connected 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.880
 now let's move our buttons 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.970
 let's press 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.300
 let's chop the recognized until the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.470
 button in this case goes up I'll explain 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.470
 square 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.470
 select 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.730
 crosshead type is the kill 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.140
 right 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:28.300
 then on the button at 12 x lr are the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.720
 rectangular buttons are not the 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.720
 triggers 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.600
 l 2 hours and 2 10 and r2 are the triggers l 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.830
 two 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.610
 Warriors 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.730
 then our left analogue we use 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.500
 right 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.650
 left down and up and now put 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.220
 in the right right eye 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.220
 left 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.650
 and up ready once that's done 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.810
 we came back 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.670
 and we are going to 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.099
 I will show you the following 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.470
 configuration I did not do it right now because 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.540
 if I was not going to stop the audio then I would 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.820
 I'm going to show you how to configure 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.940
 Then if you have any questions 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.220
 comment something whatever it is leave it in the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.860
 comments area I will attend them what 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.690
 quickest possible and well then here 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.919
 ends the audio I'm sorry but it's that 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:36.060
 the program does not work well when 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:38.350
 active some game with sound ok 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.330
 then I will show you please put 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.330
 a lot of attention there is no lose is very 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:46.570
 simple let's load a game the one that 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.410
 be it from nintendo 64 obviously and 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:53.280
 let's give you more options of the 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.280
 control options
