00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.560
 12 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.689
 when we meditate plans seem super 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:20.750
 good electrical and we are continuing with 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.750
 series of babies attacked warfare 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.180
 brown to a million coins today up 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.480
 It sounds pro and well let's see how 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.090
 you see them is part number 2 and it was good 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.129
 tell them that one of the things one of the 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 big disadvantages that we're going to have in 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.809
 this series that I'm just giving 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.489
 account is that good basically because I 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.830
 I have to join the games but 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.510
 well let's say what I can not do 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:49.700
 is that I join one and play and get out 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.160
 you know because then you have already accumulated 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.809
 some success of coins and those coins 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 I would have accumulated them without 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.280
 you see then I want you to see 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.899
 absolutely everything that we get and 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.710
 good what I'm going to do in this case 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:02.710
 will be 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.479
 because it was practically to molar me now 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.270
 so we will not be able to do anything else 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.530
 more than to molar not sincerely like that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.170
 what is what we are going to do then 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.820
 good as we have a disadvantage that 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.390
 because I say it's a good disadvantage 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.149
 because practically the same and they join me 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.220
 a game in which they are already advanced 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.259
 20 deaths as it was on this occasion 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
 so then what do I have to 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.149
 do then hurry to try to kill the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 more than I can even though the game 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.159
 already started 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.159
 comes out 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.140
 let's go for lucid there is no right now 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.060
 he has to pay for the peas 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.580
 fire that also very lucid the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.580
 pretty lucid guy 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.119
 ok scouts 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.190
 so let's go around here this is one of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 the new maps mguez even from the dlc 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 that they took out recently 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.770
 relatively recently it is not either 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.770
 that does not take long 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.500
 Good thing, he already paid for it and he paid me the 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.500
 vicente 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.480
 and I swore that he had killed me 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.630
 pea but I did not stir it had 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.720
 contemplated 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.330
 I had not contemplated it and well 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.250
 Following mode of doormat followed 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.610
 broken by teams with just my 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.610
 Actions 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.500
 memory 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.520
 son of your mother 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.010
 and well practically if I'm doing well or 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.740
 wrong in the games, now it is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.450
 you will see no I can not skip any 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.100
 starting you will be realizing 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.209
 in the amount of coins you have 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.920
 just there so there's of me there's 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.750
 me where where to the trap tells me 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.240
 you realize 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.970
 and well I also hope not to spend on 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:23.190
 the coins because layers that are going away 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.190
 then the wave and goodbye to cartons 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.980
 it almost did not last 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.940
 and we lost our eyes and it's not that the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.890
 equipment son suitcase suitcase 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.840
 well, good means we can not do much 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.040
 because they put me in a starting match 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.140
 but I hope that they still have 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.470
 enjoyed and still started I was the 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.420
 first my team are the last but 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.190
 good so this is so do not forget 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.740

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.740
 series and see you in Part 3 ay
