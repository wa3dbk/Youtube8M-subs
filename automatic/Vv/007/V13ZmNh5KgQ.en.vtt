SS 396 but 469 there was nothing in the
vintag<00:00:26.490> specifying<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> SS<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.920> does

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
vintag specifying the SS but it does

have the single piston disc brakes down

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.760 
have the single piston disc brakes down
here<00:00:32.369> but<00:00:33.180> it's<00:00:33.420> got<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> few<00:00:33.989> things<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.590> we

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
here but it's got a few things that we

anybody's name it's an adjective for
poorer<00:00:42.739> for<00:00:43.739> example<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> car<00:00:44.640> has<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> tilt

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
poorer for example this car has a tilt

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.029 
poorer for example this car has a tilt
steering<00:00:45.360> column<00:00:46.110> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.379> nice<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.890> like

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
steering column which is nice we like

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.459 
steering column which is nice we like
those<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.489> it's<00:00:47.850> got<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> floor<00:00:48.300> shift<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.840> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
those and it's got a floor shift and the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.700 
those and it's got a floor shift and the
console<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> look<00:00:51.570> closely<00:00:52.350> down

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
console but if you look closely down

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.130 
console but if you look closely down
here<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.640> can<00:00:53.789> see<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.480> mess<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:57.140> steering

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
here you can see this mess is a steering

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.400 
here you can see this mess is a steering
column<00:00:58.800> shift<00:00:59.480> column<00:01:00.480> meaning<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.230> had<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
column shift column meaning it had a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.579 
column shift column meaning it had a
shift<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.719> wired<00:01:04.199> back

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
shift like this that they wired back

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
shift like this that they wired back
with<00:01:04.890> bailing<00:01:05.369> wire<00:01:05.689> I'm<00:01:06.689> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.960> guess

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
with bailing wire I'm going to guess

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
with bailing wire I'm going to guess
that<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.310> conversion<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.119> floor

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that they did a conversion to a floor

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.800 
that they did a conversion to a floor
shift<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.850> put<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.180> till<00:01:12.420> column

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
shift and you know put this till column

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.770 
shift and you know put this till column
in<00:01:13.159> because<00:01:14.159> there<00:01:14.340> is<00:01:14.460> no<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.090> know<00:01:15.210> handle

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
in because there is no you know handle

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.380 
in because there is no you know handle
over<00:01:15.900> here<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.250> Chad<00:01:17.520> but<00:01:18.299> it

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
over here so that's kind of Chad but it

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
over here so that's kind of Chad but it
does<00:01:18.509> are<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> 306<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.680> at<00:01:19.890> least<00:01:20.040> it's<00:01:20.159> got<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
does are the 306 or at least it's got a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
does are the 306 or at least it's got a
big-block<00:01:20.520> we're<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.000> sure<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> 396

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
big-block we're not sure that it's a 396

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
big-block we're not sure that it's a 396
we'll<00:01:22.590> find<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:22.979> later<00:01:23.330> because<00:01:24.330> we're<00:01:24.810> going

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
we'll find out later because we're going

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
we'll find out later because we're going
to<00:01:24.990> take<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> apart<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.220> check<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.610> stuff

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to take it apart but check this stuff

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.510 
to take it apart but check this stuff
out<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.479> kind<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.689> cool<00:01:28.159> this<00:01:29.159> piece<00:01:29.400> of

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
out this is kind of cool this piece of

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
out this is kind of cool this piece of
trim<00:01:30.229> says<00:01:31.490> SS<00:01:32.490> 396<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.659> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.560> start<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
trim says SS 396 and if you start to

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
trim says SS 396 and if you start to
decipher<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> little<00:01:36.119> bit<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.720> see

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
decipher this a little bit you can see

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.539 
decipher this a little bit you can see
it's<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> pitted<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:37.860> means<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.460> know

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
it's kind of pitted which means you know

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
it's kind of pitted which means you know
it's<00:01:38.640> probably<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.000> original<00:01:39.090> piece<00:01:39.509> but

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it's probably the original piece but

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's probably the original piece but
this<00:01:40.350> 396<00:01:40.979> part<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.400> nice<00:01:41.549> and<00:01:41.729> shiny<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this 396 part is nice and shiny so I

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.690 
this 396 part is nice and shiny so I
think<00:01:42.689> this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> reproduction<00:01:43.590> center<00:01:44.460> on

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
think this is a reproduction center on

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.100 
think this is a reproduction center on
the<00:01:44.729> original<00:01:45.180> piece<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.259> flip<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.560> over

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the original piece when you flip it over

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.960 
the original piece when you flip it over
this<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.350> interesting<00:01:49.860> GM<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.640> took<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this is interesting GM actually took the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.899 
this is interesting GM actually took the
time<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.570> cast<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> names<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.610> cars

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
time to cast in the names of the cars

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.580 
time to cast in the names of the cars
that<00:01:54.060> this<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.540> come<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> Malibu

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that this could have come on the Malibu

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.880 
that this could have come on the Malibu
the<00:01:55.740> Greenbrier<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:57.210> Concord<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> yes<00:01:58.590> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the Greenbrier the Concord and yes and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
the Greenbrier the Concord and yes and
SS<00:01:59.430> 396<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.100> tear<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.759> trim<00:02:02.969> apart<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
SS 396 so if you tear the trim apart you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.330 
SS 396 so if you tear the trim apart you
know<00:02:03.960> this<00:02:04.140> could<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.380> come<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.649> anything<00:02:04.860> so

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
know this could have come on anything so
