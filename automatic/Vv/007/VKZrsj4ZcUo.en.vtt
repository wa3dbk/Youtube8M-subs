00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:18.710
 motor mount fire flex 1.0 motor 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.710
 of 8 valves 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.280
 this engine it had a problem of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:40.150
 leakage of water was leaking through the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.770
 The water pump was leaking through the 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.190
 water temperature and some 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 hoses and was also consuming 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 excessive lubricating oil 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.589
 that is, it was burning oil and then we 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.809
 we must do 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:00.660
 we had to take out the engine 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.460
 removed engine for review 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.680
 serve rather a true review 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.860
 motor 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.610
 some vehicle owners there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.320
 do not find the burden heavy and the 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.149
 sometimes if you drive the car in some places 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.869
 The guy comes and says no to my boss I 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.030
 I will 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.039
 We're going to make the engine and take the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.050
 ball of the taltal segment exchange gasket 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.869
 says that motor made is part of the engine 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.910
 engine overhaul was nothing done so in 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.590
 truth was a work in a world 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.009
 little is going to work, is this you? 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.849
 disassemble the whole decarbonized cleaner 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.860
 You check all the breaks and if 

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:41.819
 example we had to change are 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.819
 on here 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:50.709
 that engine it being the cylinder and had 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.420
 to be rectified for 0 40 

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:58.179
 because when we check the shirts 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 we find craters holes that is the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.890
 excessive wear on cylinder cylinders 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.020
 were open valuation economicity 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.770
 outside the values ​​specified by 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.440
 manufacturer 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.940
 so we had no alternative to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.860
 Do not open the engine to make a 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.819
 real review do the repair 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.590
 complete process of reworking the 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.000
 motor 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.150
 we do not open hands we do not stop 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.620
 take into account all the criteria 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.290
 technical 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.730
 here is the head completely 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.830
 demeaned 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.730
 valves have not been replaced 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.930
 because they are in perfect condition 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.930
 we changed the clothes retainers 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.500
 and also something very important in that the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:57.830
 replacing following replace all 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:02.020
 the block and head seals all 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.020
 stamps are exchanged 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.880
 for the engine to become 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.880
 perfect again 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:24.520
 and the touches and grips 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.520
 we follow the technical literature 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:40.990
 nothing that is tight cloud the subway but 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:40.990
 yes tight with wrench 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.800
 the following I'm doing this 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.820
 video there that you are following 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.370
 on the fire motor assembly is from this 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.380
 pattern of attack behind actually a 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.780
 complete engine overhaul that the engine 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.610
 has more than 100 thousand kilometers 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.030
 and presents problems of oil consumption 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.190
 and water leakage clothes did not come 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.350
 complete showing some more tips there 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.440
 the repairing friend and for some 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.080
 owner of an automobile who wishes to have 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.200
 a memory of knowledge 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.130
 I work here based on literature 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.380
 technical 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.820
 I do not do anything in my head but I 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.370
 I want to show that this is the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.919
 engine of oil consumption but here it is 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:29.550
 cylinders were rectified to 0 49 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:32.870
 are working out and that 's what I do 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.550
 even having the confidence grind 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.760
 the same time the confidence grind 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.730
 I'm in charge of the final job. 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:46.310
 then what happens you want repairman 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:49.320
 There must be tools for you to hurt. 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:54.000
 and see if the work that really 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.730
 rectifies made is spotless sure if 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.620
 they did not get lost in the grinding 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.930
 of Chileans because I advise that 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.270
 you have the tool and do it for 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.750
 that you do not have a problem later 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.930
 and you how to repair the pain comes to pay 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.790
 the chat pay a monkey before the customer 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.650
 not only is life saved another tip that 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.750
 another tip I give is important here 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.350
 is the following to nerd consumer segment 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.450
 of oil 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.730
 staff picks up a worn cylinder and 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.320
 There is a mania about getting the client 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.860
 buy the spring of the segment put in the 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.160
 car 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.160
 the zanetti segment the nerd piston people 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.960
 for you exchange the piston ring on the engine 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.090
 you to check if the engine is in 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.460
 condition of receiving is new if the 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.370
 themselves are in condition and if here 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.280
 even I was not in the condition I had to 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.010
 to rectify changing the Christians of that engine 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.440
 you also need to understand 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:49.080
 especially if the ring type of the 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.640
 segment applies to that engine because 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.470
 there are several manufacturers leaving the 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.840
 parallel market manufacturing a lot of 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.820
 shit you say so I put a 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.100
 new segment ring but sometimes 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.480
 that engine does not use a trapezoidal ring 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.800
 does not use the ring the shape of the ring is 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.840
 approved is created and idealized in 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.820
 According the manufacturer the manufacturer makes 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.590
 according to the tone and sometimes and will mark 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.960
 parallel with the colonel of the segment 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:15.240
 does not have quality or did not obey 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.030
 strictly that standard required by the 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.490
 factory as'm all in and you boot 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.390
 car continues to consume oil 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.670
 lubricant 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.770
 so the tip is in check through 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.810
 manuals through tables 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.850
 through technical information that you 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:31.170
 can get from the manufacturer 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.630
 you have to run behind you have to 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.790
 monitor or evolution so that you 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.390
 can do a good service but another 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.450
 thing 

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:42.240
 some people have entered the channel there 

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.260
 and asked me about the hand of 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.310
 work my hand 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.320
 the current value is no use for you to stay 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.930
 down the canal asking how much is the 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:55.370
 service is 2,000 and 3,000 to 5,000 senile 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.500
 How much I do not answer this question. 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:01.560
 my manpower is a secret is a 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.710
 my client's subject and I in those 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:07.050
 26 years of profession has seen following 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.510
 Some people arrive in the 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.760
 value of labor to want to humiliate 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.510
 and demean another professional in the 

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.310
 front 

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.440
 So it's no use asking why I 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.290
 I'm not going to answer I can only say one 

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.230
 thing I charge that justice is right 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:24.570
 all I have in my workshop I 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.950
 I have bought is very expensive and I usually 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.350
 say that someone has to pay for it 

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:30.570
 who paid no mechanical I do not steal in 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.160
 event the service now my workmanship 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:33.120
 in justice but it's no good for you to stay 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.220
 wondering what I will not 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.680
 answer when the car is here that 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:40.200
 I make budget I say our goal is 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.510
 my service has to do this x 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.500
 Your friend wants to do great, if not 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.870
 want to do 

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.610
 God bless you the same, knowing that 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.520
 some have looked for me in my 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:53.160
 workshop and such I charge to do the 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.260
 budget and I'm not going to get here 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.450
 examine a car up the car just 

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:59.610
 in science, son, you're good, I 'll go 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:01.860
 buy the piece head and make 

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.600
 service out there negative I'm baiano 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:07.940
 but I'm not stupid 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.940
 Ok, a hug, everyone is on the page.
