think it will be very beautiful when
it's<00:03:26.450> relaxed<00:03:26.720> as<00:03:26.870> well<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.349> took<00:03:27.590> me<00:03:27.739> about<00:03:28.010> 20

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
it's relaxed as well it took me about 20

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.420 
it's relaxed as well it took me about 20
minutes<00:03:28.489> to<00:03:29.060> do<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.170> bones<00:03:30.349> in<00:03:30.620> my<00:03:30.769> hair<00:03:31.010> which

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
minutes to do the bones in my hair which

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.099 
minutes to do the bones in my hair which
is<00:03:31.579> about<00:03:31.819> as<00:03:32.000> long<00:03:32.150> as<00:03:32.209> it<00:03:32.420> takes<00:03:32.599> to<00:03:32.780> grow<00:03:32.959> our

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
is about as long as it takes to grow our

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.110 
is about as long as it takes to grow our
hair<00:03:33.290> with<00:03:33.409> a<00:03:33.530> curling<00:03:33.709> iron<00:03:33.889> now<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:34.730> think

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
hair with a curling iron now I think

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.720 
hair with a curling iron now I think
this<00:03:35.329> is<00:03:35.510> a<00:03:35.780> lot<00:03:36.260> better<00:03:36.440> because<00:03:36.709> my<00:03:37.220> hair

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
this is a lot better because my hair

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.300 
this is a lot better because my hair
doesn't<00:03:37.909> hold<00:03:38.150> curl<00:03:38.859> no<00:03:39.859> matter<00:03:40.040> what<00:03:40.280> I

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310

doesn't hold curl no matter what I
already<00:03:40.760> use<00:03:41.349> it<00:03:42.349> just<00:03:42.560> blown<00:03:42.859> hold<00:03:43.129> so<00:03:43.670> the

already use it just blown hold so the

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.970 
already use it just blown hold so the
only<00:03:44.810> way<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:44.959> can<00:03:45.230> grow<00:03:45.379> my<00:03:45.409> hair<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.829> by
