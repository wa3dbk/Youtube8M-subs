will be a link in the description
the<00:00:20.400> reason<00:00:20.640> they<00:00:20.760> cost<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.060> little<00:00:21.150> bit<00:00:21.270> more

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the reason they cost a little bit more

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.519 
the reason they cost a little bit more
than<00:00:21.630> some<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> average<00:00:22.109> ones<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.500> because

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
than some of the average ones is because

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.060 
than some of the average ones is because
they<00:00:23.039> come<00:00:23.279> included<00:00:23.730> with<00:00:23.910> a<00:00:24.439> NFC<00:00:25.439> tag<00:00:25.859> which

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
they come included with a NFC tag which

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.099 
they come included with a NFC tag which
is<00:00:26.099> actually<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.519> keychain<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:27.840> in<00:00:27.960> total

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
is actually a keychain and so in total

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.230 
is actually a keychain and so in total
it<00:00:28.289> comes<00:00:28.500> with<00:00:28.650> six<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.730> first<00:00:30.029> things<00:00:30.179> first

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it comes with six so first things first

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.299 
it comes with six so first things first

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this one is actually I'm gonna do a few

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.500 
this one is actually I'm gonna do a few
little<00:01:09.240> quick<00:01:09.479> things<00:01:09.830> such<00:01:10.830> as<00:01:11.240> we<00:01:12.240> go<00:01:12.360> into

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
little quick things such as we go into

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.820 
little quick things such as we go into
activity<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> bottom<00:01:13.409> right<00:01:13.590> that's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
activity at the bottom right that's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.510 
activity at the bottom right that's
where<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.040> gonna<00:01:14.130> add<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.369> your

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
where you're gonna add all your

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
where you're gonna add all your
different<00:01:15.150> features<00:01:15.439> but<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.470> want<00:01:16.799> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
different features but I want to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.770 
different features but I want to
actually<00:01:17.130> turn<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.820> Wi-Fi<00:01:18.360> hotspot

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
actually turn this into a Wi-Fi hotspot

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.890 
actually turn this into a Wi-Fi hotspot
so<00:01:19.560> I'm<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> toggle<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.220> on<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.900> will

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
so I'm going to toggle this on I will

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
so I'm going to toggle this on I will
then<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.290> need<00:01:22.799> my<00:01:24.979> ringer<00:01:25.979> mode<00:01:26.220> I'll<00:01:26.640> put

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
then also need my ringer mode I'll put

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.289 
then also need my ringer mode I'll put
it<00:01:26.939> by<00:01:27.270> brace<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.470> also<00:01:28.650> make<00:01:29.009> sure<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
it by brace we will also make sure that

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.580 
it by brace we will also make sure that
the<00:01:30.299> LED<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.659> pop<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:30.900> as<00:01:31.200> well

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
the LED will pop up as well

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.429 
the LED will pop up as well
so<00:01:31.710> probably<00:01:32.310> for<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> text<00:01:33.090> don't<00:01:33.360> say<00:01:33.570> turn

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
so probably for the text don't say turn

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.310 
so probably for the text don't say turn
Nick<00:01:34.920> did<00:01:35.460> too

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.600 

alright<00:01:42.320> then<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.250> next<00:01:43.400> thing<00:01:43.550> that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
alright then so the next thing that

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.860 
alright then so the next thing that
we're<00:01:43.790> gonna<00:01:43.850> need<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.120> do<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:44.390> we're<00:01:44.780> gonna

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
we're gonna need to do is we're gonna

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.450 
we're gonna need to do is we're gonna
add<00:01:44.990> actually<00:01:45.320> another<00:01:45.740> cycle<00:01:46.190> so<00:01:46.310> in<00:01:46.400> the

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
add actually another cycle so in the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.920 
add actually another cycle so in the
very<00:01:46.610> top<00:01:46.790> you're<00:01:47.000> gonna<00:01:47.090> see<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.300> word<00:01:47.420> cycle

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
very top you're gonna see the word cycle

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.920 
very top you're gonna see the word cycle
touch<00:01:48.650> that<00:01:48.950> add<00:01:49.190> new<00:01:49.610> cycle<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.690> what<00:01:50.780> this

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
touch that add new cycle and what this

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.469 
touch that add new cycle and what this

we have the typing white fire signal

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.140 
we have the typing white fire signal
that<00:02:48.049> says<00:02:48.200> right<00:02:48.349> there<00:02:48.560> so<00:02:48.769> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:48.980> see

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
go and adjust that since I've probably

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.740 
go and adjust that since I've probably
have<00:03:00.430> since<00:03:01.430> though<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.090> Wi-Fi<00:03:02.390> does<00:03:02.569> turn

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
have since though the Wi-Fi does turn
