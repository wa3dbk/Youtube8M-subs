this<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.170> my<00:00:07.259> feed<00:00:07.500> line<00:00:07.680> for<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> oil<00:00:08.510> it's<00:00:09.510> a

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
this is my feed line for the oil it's a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.540 
this is my feed line for the oil it's a
hard<00:00:09.780> line<00:00:10.019> it<00:00:10.710> goes<00:00:10.860> down<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> side

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
hard line it goes down to the side

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730 
hard line it goes down to the side
typical<00:00:12.269> port<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.929> everybody<00:00:13.259> uses<00:00:13.590> on

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
typical port that everybody uses on

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.039 
typical port that everybody uses on
these<00:00:13.889> LS<00:00:14.280> motors<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.509> phalange

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
these LS motors it's the phalange

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.599 
these LS motors it's the phalange
there's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.350> ginormous<00:00:17.190> hole<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.550> the

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
there's a ginormous hole for the

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.950 
there's a ginormous hole for the
turbo<00:00:20.000> it's<00:00:21.000> trying<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> drain<00:00:21.720> line

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
turbo it's trying to the drain line

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.960 
turbo it's trying to the drain line
right<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.289> as<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.590> feeds<00:00:22.800> done<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> ran

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
right now as the feeds done but I ran

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.519 
right now as the feeds done but I ran
into<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.180> little<00:00:24.269> problem<00:00:24.420> maybe<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.380> my<00:00:25.500> own

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
into a little problem maybe it's my own

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.279 
into a little problem maybe it's my own
stupidity<00:00:25.980> maybe<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.490> read<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.760> wrong<00:00:27.260> but<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
stupidity maybe I read it wrong but I

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.880 
stupidity maybe I read it wrong but I
thought<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:29.539> MPT<00:00:30.539> threaded<00:00:31.260> thing

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
thought there was a MPT threaded thing

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.170 
thought there was a MPT threaded thing
here<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> guess<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.669> guess<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.969> need<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
here I guess and I guess I need the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.870 
here I guess and I guess I need the
flange<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.739> would<00:00:34.890> go<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.309> said

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
flange and this would go into that said

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.000 
flange and this would go into that said
flange<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> 3/8<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.640> -<00:00:38.969> 10<00:00:40.010> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
flange this is 3/8 and this is - 10 the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.660 
flange this is 3/8 and this is - 10 the
flange<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.579> available<00:00:42.030> with<00:00:42.120> 1/2<00:00:42.329> inch<00:00:42.570> NPT<00:00:43.110> as

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
flange is available with 1/2 inch NPT as

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.900 
flange is available with 1/2 inch NPT as
well<00:00:44.670> as<00:00:48.079> 3/4<00:00:49.079> NPT<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
well as 3/4 NPT which is what this is so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
well as 3/4 NPT which is what this is so
I<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.329> order<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> flange<00:00:51.930> now<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.800> gonna

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
I just order the flange now I'm gonna

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.770 
I just order the flange now I'm gonna
put<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.340> link<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.000> eBay<00:00:54.329> in<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
guys get cut up this is an S 400 - turbo

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.230 
guys get cut up this is an S 400 - turbo
I<00:00:59.960> said<00:01:00.960> pretty<00:01:01.399> ok<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.910> t4<00:01:03.300> flange

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
I said pretty ok with the t4 flange

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:11.300 
I said pretty ok with the t4 flange
that's<00:01:06.240> where<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.570> are<00:01:09.890> not<00:01:10.890> sure<00:01:11.100> if<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.220> guys

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that's where we are not sure if you guys

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.800 
that's where we are not sure if you guys
know<00:01:11.520> us<00:01:11.580> from<00:01:11.670> my<00:01:11.790> other<00:01:11.880> video<00:01:12.210> transmission

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
know us from my other video transmission

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
know us from my other video transmission
was<00:01:12.930> shifting<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> vacuum<00:01:15.000> modulator

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
was shifting it's got a vacuum modulator

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.910 
was shifting it's got a vacuum modulator
so<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> probably<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.140> to<00:01:16.229> run<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.350> vacuum<00:01:16.710> line

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
so I probably got to run a vacuum line

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.789 
so I probably got to run a vacuum line
down<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.960> downpipe<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.470> all<00:01:19.619> that's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
down there the downpipe and all that's

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.120 
down there the downpipe and all that's
inside<00:01:19.979> I'm<00:01:20.549> just<00:01:20.580> modifying<00:01:21.210> my<00:01:21.360> hole<00:01:21.570> here

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
inside I'm just modifying my hole here

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.760 
inside I'm just modifying my hole here
so<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.250> fits<00:01:23.540> good<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.110> hard<00:01:25.350> line<00:01:25.590> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
so it fits good I like the hard line you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.330 
so it fits good I like the hard line you
know<00:01:25.890> why<00:01:27.020> what<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.170> think<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:29.009> sturdy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
know why what do you think good sturdy

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.499 
know why what do you think good sturdy
no<00:01:30.619> because<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.740> looks<00:01:31.890> cool<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> guess<00:01:32.579> not<00:01:32.850> why

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
no because it looks cool I guess not why

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.210 
no because it looks cool I guess not why
cuz<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.200> cheap<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.770> whole<00:01:34.950> line<00:01:35.189> is

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
cuz it's cheap the whole line is

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
cuz it's cheap the whole line is
$7.00<00:01:36.119> versus<00:01:38.060> an<00:01:39.060> hose<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:40.049> stainless<00:01:40.259> hose

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
$7.00 versus an hose or stainless hose

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.410 
$7.00 versus an hose or stainless hose
or<00:01:40.860> whatever<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.130> hell<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.310> call<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
or whatever the hell you call it that

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.660 
or whatever the hell you call it that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
fittings here I have a straight 45 or 90

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.380 
fittings here I have a straight 45 or 90
and<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> 45<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.370> between<00:02:11.610> those<00:02:11.819> three<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.150> should

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and a 45 so between those three I should

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.730 
and a 45 so between those three I should
be<00:02:12.480> able<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.720> figure<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.110> out

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
be able to figure it out

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.280 
be able to figure it out
but<00:02:14.520> uh<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:15.150> should<00:02:15.360> be<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:16.050> should<00:02:16.200> be

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
but uh this should be we should be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.930

I<00:02:18.840> just<00:02:19.350> need<00:02:19.470> my<00:02:19.560> flange<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.010> come<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.140> do

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
I just need my flange to come in and do

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.510 
I just need my flange to come in and do
those<00:02:22.230> miscellaneous<00:02:22.770> things<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.100> was<00:02:23.190> talking

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
those miscellaneous things I was talking

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.360 
those miscellaneous things I was talking
about<00:02:23.580> and<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.800> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
about and that is it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.510 
about and that is it
I<00:02:26.400> could<00:02:27.120> really<00:02:27.240> start<00:02:27.480> mocking<00:02:27.900> up<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
I could really start mocking up the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.460 
I could really start mocking up the
intercooler<00:02:29.520> line<00:02:30.060> that's<00:02:30.300> all<00:02:30.420> inside<00:02:30.720> I'll

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
intercooler line that's all inside I'll

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.630 
intercooler line that's all inside I'll
probably<00:02:31.800> have<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.250> like<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.510> hose<00:02:33.510> a

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
probably have to get like a hose a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
probably have to get like a hose a
silicone<00:02:35.640> thing<00:02:35.910> for<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.210> end<00:02:36.330> of<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.450> cuz

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
silicone thing for the end of that cuz

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.080 
silicone thing for the end of that cuz
that's<00:02:36.780> really<00:02:36.840> fat<00:02:37.170> compared<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.620> my<00:02:37.740> hose<00:02:38.090> my

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
that's really fat compared to my hose my

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.900 
that's really fat compared to my hose my
intercooler<00:02:39.480> piping<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.980> that's<00:02:41.670> about<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
intercooler piping but that's about it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.700 
intercooler piping but that's about it

oils<00:03:45.360> are<00:03:45.420> gonna<00:03:45.510> go<00:03:45.630> from<00:03:45.750> down<00:03:45.930> there<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.350> up

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
oils are gonna go from down there to up

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.740 
oils are gonna go from down there to up
here<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.670> wanted<00:03:47.910> to<00:03:48.000> keep<00:03:48.150> it<00:03:48.270> as<00:03:48.390> cheap<00:03:48.630> as

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
here and I wanted to keep it as cheap as

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.810 
here and I wanted to keep it as cheap as
possible<00:03:49.010> and<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.070> really<00:03:50.280> don't<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.550> to<00:03:50.610> run

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
possible and I really don't want to run

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.270 
possible and I really don't want to run
rubber<00:03:51.150> hose<00:03:51.420> through<00:03:51.720> here<00:03:52.080> because<00:03:53.040> this<00:03:53.190> is

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
rubber hose through here because this is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.220 
rubber hose through here because this is
where<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.520> headers<00:03:53.790> are<00:03:53.970> so<00:03:54.660> this<00:03:54.810> seems<00:03:55.050> nice

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
where the headers are so this seems nice

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.620 
where the headers are so this seems nice
and<00:03:55.410> safe<00:03:55.590> right<00:03:55.890> doesn't<00:03:56.430> it<00:03:56.700> not<00:03:57.150> really<00:03:57.420> I

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
and safe right doesn't it not really I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.250 
and safe right doesn't it not really I
really<00:03:58.590> don't<00:03:58.710> care<00:03:59.660> the<00:04:00.660> drain<00:04:00.900> lines<00:04:01.110> gonna

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
really don't care the drain lines gonna

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.990 
really don't care the drain lines gonna
go<00:04:01.410> out<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.680> down<00:04:01.860> there<00:04:02.100> which<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.730> still

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
go out there down there which I still

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.240 
go out there down there which I still
have<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.270> figure<00:04:03.540> out<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:04.020> that<00:04:04.770> this<00:04:04.950> is<00:04:05.070> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
have to figure out just that this is the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.240 
have to figure out just that this is the
adapter<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.210> I<00:04:06.330> have<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:07.350> there<00:04:08.070> are<00:04:08.160> my

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
adapter that I have and there are my

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.170 
adapter that I have and there are my
fittings<00:04:08.610> like<00:04:08.760> I<00:04:08.850> said<00:04:09.030> before<00:04:11.060> there's<00:04:12.060> no

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
fittings like I said before there's no

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.790 
fittings like I said before there's no
restrictor<00:04:12.750> this<00:04:12.930> this<00:04:13.320> is<00:04:13.440> kind<00:04:13.650> of<00:04:13.680> small

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
restrictor this this is kind of small

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.710 
restrictor this this is kind of small
already<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.490> just<00:04:15.000> meant<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.330> all<00:04:15.510> up<00:04:15.630> my

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
already I just meant this all up my

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.830 
already I just meant this all up my
hands<00:04:16.170> guys<00:04:16.530> don't<00:04:16.799> overthink<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.370> okay<00:04:17.840> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
hands guys don't overthink it okay the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.090 
hands guys don't overthink it okay the
drain<00:04:19.020> is<00:04:19.109> gonna<00:04:19.230> come<00:04:19.380> out<00:04:19.500> down<00:04:19.620> here

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
drain is gonna come out down here

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.090 
drain is gonna come out down here
there's<00:04:20.850> plenty<00:04:21.209> of<00:04:21.239> room<00:04:21.510> here<00:04:21.540> for<00:04:21.810> my<00:04:22.169> turbo

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there's plenty of room here for my turbo

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.379 
there's plenty of room here for my turbo
and<00:04:23.310> whatnot

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
and whatnot

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.270 
and whatnot
maybe<00:04:25.169> there's<00:04:25.409> room<00:04:25.470> for<00:04:25.710> a<00:04:25.740> filter<00:04:26.099> maybe

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
maybe there's room for a filter maybe

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.050 
maybe there's room for a filter maybe
not<00:04:26.550> doesn't<00:04:26.879> really<00:04:27.030> matter<00:04:27.770> but<00:04:28.770> uh<00:04:29.060> that's

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
not doesn't really matter but uh that's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.279 
not doesn't really matter but uh that's
all<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.330> is<00:04:30.449> to<00:04:30.659> it<00:04:30.780> I<00:04:30.840> mean<00:04:30.960> it's<00:04:31.050> kind<00:04:31.229> of

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:31.289 
all there is to it I mean it's kind of

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.390 
all there is to it I mean it's kind of
cool<00:04:31.500> because<00:04:31.530> I've<00:04:31.860> never<00:04:31.889> really<00:04:32.129> used

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
cool because I've never really used

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.999 
cool because I've never really used
hardline<00:04:32.819> well<00:04:33.169> hardline<00:04:34.169> there<00:04:34.349> there<00:04:34.650> there

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
hardline well hardline there there there

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.969 
hardline well hardline there there there
I'm<00:04:35.099> using<00:04:35.280> it<00:04:35.430> everywhere<00:04:35.699> now<00:04:36.830> because<00:04:37.830> it's

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
I'm using it everywhere now because it's

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.909 
I'm using it everywhere now because it's
hardline<00:04:38.430> right<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.780> cheap<00:04:40.139> you<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:40.830> have

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
hardline right it's cheap you don't have

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.790 
hardline right it's cheap you don't have
to<00:04:40.979> worry<00:04:41.159> about<00:04:41.250> it

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
to worry about it

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.839 
to worry about it
I'm<00:04:43.800> also<00:04:43.979> probably<00:04:44.310> gonna<00:04:44.400> use<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.639> for<00:04:44.669> my

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
I'm also probably gonna use it for my

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.249 
I'm also probably gonna use it for my
vacuum<00:04:45.270> line<00:04:45.419> that<00:04:45.599> runs<00:04:45.689> down<00:04:45.900> there<00:04:46.110> just

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
vacuum line that runs down there just

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.399 
vacuum line that runs down there just
put<00:04:46.379> rubber<00:04:46.949> on<00:04:47.189> the<00:04:47.310> ends<00:04:47.729> because<00:04:48.409> rubber

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
put rubber on the ends because rubber

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.399 
put rubber on the ends because rubber
hoses<00:04:49.800> crack<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:50.550> these<00:04:50.819> don't<00:04:51.000> crack

00:04:51.399 --> 00:04:51.409 
hoses crack and these don't crack

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.670 
hoses crack and these don't crack
they<00:04:52.409> stay<00:04:52.590> there<00:04:52.710> forever<00:04:52.830> so<00:04:54.500> that's<00:04:55.500> where

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
they stay there forever so that's where

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.059 
they stay there forever so that's where
we<00:04:55.800> are<00:04:55.830> there's<00:04:56.550> a<00:04:56.610> turbo<00:04:57.530> little<00:04:58.530> money<00:04:58.740> shot

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
we are there's a turbo little money shot

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.640 
we are there's a turbo little money shot
that<00:04:59.370> guy<00:04:59.490> is<00:04:59.969> humongous<00:05:00.629> look<00:05:01.440> at<00:05:01.560> my

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that guy is humongous look at my

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.790 
that guy is humongous look at my
alternator<00:05:02.099> look<00:05:02.699> at<00:05:02.789> my<00:05:02.849> turbo<00:05:03.770> but<00:05:04.770> uh

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
alternator look at my turbo but uh

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.830 
alternator look at my turbo but uh
that's<00:05:05.639> all<00:05:05.789> there<00:05:05.879> is<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.300> we're<00:05:06.750> gonna

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
get the drain line done then we could

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.119
