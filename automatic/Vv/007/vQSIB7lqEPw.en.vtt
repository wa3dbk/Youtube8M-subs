00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.670
 you probably think that I will 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.670
 telling you heating 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.770
 However, I have deceived you a little 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.930
 the fact is that such a go game is not 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:38.170
 there is an explanation in japan this game 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.620
 called him that is correct 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.690
 name 3 letter i go 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.780
 Well, finally we learned the truth 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.409
 actually mostly but because it plays on 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.909
 really chinese and correct 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:56.290
 name of egg or vinci 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:01.049
 but nevertheless in russia we call it 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.820
 and generally let it remain this game 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.860
 outer city in this way we see 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.439
 before a gump board it is called 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.159
 the pebbles they put on the curb line 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:15.070
 everything just seems so simple to me 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.490
 in fact this game is the hardest here 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 a lot of scenarios 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.650
 let's try to figure them out 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 historians argue but generally speaking from 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.460
 two to five thousand years of history that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.480
 huge time is one of the most 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.480
 the oldest game on the planet 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.170
 It is possible that this game is considered by many 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:40.240
 for the low aliens I'm not quite with 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.640
 they agree but such versions have the right to 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.290
 the existence of others say that 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.370
 once it was a board at all 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.340
 square doll all collections such a stump 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:54.370
 it exposed stones on attachments 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.979
 annual rings someone thinks that this 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.740
 there were some guesswork exercises 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.680
 divinations by and yawned that is man 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.030
 put up pebbles on the point here on these 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:11.290
 they are called stars and how would the game 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 against your fate there is another such 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.049
 probably already closer to the truth reliable 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.349
 theory in her is the chinese emperor i 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.510
 of his 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.310
 not very smart son 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.019
 decided to somehow educate and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.099
 came up with this game for him she reminds 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.230
 called china vinci or sign language 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.209
 that is, we play hands here because I 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 put pebbles and see that one hand 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.349
 partner game they create such a common 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.819
 drawing with hand movement as well 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.840
 by the movement of moves you can understand the character 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.140
 a man from the very first moves have already 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.569
 some basic idea is captured 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.060
 aggressive this man calm can 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.920
 be he greedy in on the beard then sandwiched 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.230
 humble here it all becomes visible in 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.230
 this game but no wonder she is so long 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 history and she during this time of course already 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.040
 myself 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.799
 revealed that here it is still important somewhere 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.579
 say this game is very complicated see 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:21.370
 how much is here 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.049
 fields here are 19 lines 19 is 361 when you 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.139
 it even implies a calendar year 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.260
 that is, how would the gods play among themselves 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.660
 one of the gods suddenly losing the party 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.569
 had to give a few days 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.079
 361 days left so here options 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.489
 there are lots of lots here 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.889
 if you take the famous chess games there 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.819
 greenville there are checkers and there is something on 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:48.569
 reverse take and all the taboo will be 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:51.400
 much more complicated by the number of options 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.849
 this is a number that can be drawn 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.829
 it will have so many zeros so what 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.840
 here we do not know such numbers if we take 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.329
 These all the pebbles represent that it is zero 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.169
 then that's all here is nuri 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.250
 and and Chernobyl more this purely which 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.299
 doesn't fit in the universe 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.370
 so the supercomputer is here for now 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.319
 whipping boy 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.269
 For about fifty years, programmers have been writing 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.190
 write write and and so far nothing can 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.000
 write so serious to beat 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.419
 champion like let's say caspar chess 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.449
 advanced already 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:28.090
 but at the same time this is the last game on 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.000
 a planet that didn't give up 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.759
 supercomputer is very important to us 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.439
 where would say even differently 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:38.830
 it's not about the computer 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:41.979
 the last man is a game that is out 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.639
 there are some parallels with the soul of man with 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.860
 him somehow 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.879
 intuitive thinking is not here 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.889
 only math 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.569
 here rather a kind of imagery but karting 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.269
 which we are here here gradually with you 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:05:03.669
 I see hope to help you with this 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:05:07.360
 make sure russia game came somewhere in 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.159
 mid-twentieth century 75 76 year were 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.699
 made the first publications of the journal science 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:11.889
 and life 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.289
 and after that a lot of things opened here 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.599
 clubs self-development game yes it is 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:19.199
 was sir well how do you understand we 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.669
 picked up this baton and successful and 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:24.339
 continue europe game appeared in 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.839
 the beginning of the 20th century, that is, a little bit earlier 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:28.329
 sleep and Europe with already caught up 

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:30.669
 worry and our players on this 

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:32.499
 the moment is already so probably they are years brother 

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.129
 twenty in front 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:38.589
 not the whole planet on ahead of Europe for sure 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:41.860
 ahead of the planet go koreans japanese 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:42.579
 and the Chinese are more precisely Koreans and Chinese and 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.089
 the japanese him 

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:49.469
 the Japanese are already so politely sent but we 

00:05:46.089 --> 00:05:51.969
 we also hope to win them someday 

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:54.789
 the most important homework which 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.289
 I wanted to file it at home not very wife 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.809
 nice I would love this 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:06:01.179
 would get to school look at the house 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:02.860
 Cartoon language cartoon is called 

00:06:01.179 --> 00:06:06.159
 hikaru no go 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.739
 This cartoon or anime more precisely 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:12.809
 who talks about boy hikaru 

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:18.129
 who met with such a magic 

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:22.289
 ghostly spirit master ember and 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:24.789
 the past and their joint adventures 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.189
 homework we already got you 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:28.749
 she is pleasant in the second part we 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:33.209
 talk to you about the rules of the game and 

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:33.209
 I promise you that it will be just
