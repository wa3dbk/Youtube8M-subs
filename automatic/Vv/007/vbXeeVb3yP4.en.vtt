00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.300 
stability so they don't worry about one
of<00:04:14.650> my<00:04:14.709> knees<00:04:14.890> getting<00:04:19.709> perches<00:04:20.709> into<00:04:21.010> place

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
of my knees getting perches into place

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.159 
of my knees getting perches into place
we<00:04:21.820> use<00:04:22.030> brackets<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.100> sides<00:04:24.900> so<00:04:25.900> we<00:04:26.020> could

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
we use brackets on the sides so we could

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:34.709 
we use brackets on the sides so we could
just<00:04:26.350> drop<00:04:26.560> them<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.890> there

00:04:34.709 --> 00:04:34.719 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:41.119 

so<00:04:35.259> that<00:04:35.439> just<00:04:35.739> leaves<00:04:37.589> cutting<00:04:38.589> the<00:04:39.089> hole<00:04:40.089> for

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
so that just leaves cutting the hole for

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.819 
so that just leaves cutting the hole for
the<00:04:42.129> ramp<00:04:42.719> and<00:04:43.719> putting<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.349> corrugated

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:44.829 
the ramp and putting the corrugated

00:04:44.829 --> 00:04:49.769 
the ramp and putting the corrugated
roofing<00:04:45.219> on<00:04:45.839> and<00:04:46.839> then<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.319> think<00:04:47.589> we're<00:04:48.779> done

00:04:49.769 --> 00:04:49.779 
roofing on and then I think we're done

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:55.259 
roofing on and then I think we're done
and<00:04:50.079> ready<00:04:50.199> for<00:04:50.349> move-in<00:04:53.279> okay<00:04:54.279> all<00:04:54.610> the

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:55.269 
and ready for move-in okay all the

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:58.619 
and ready for move-in okay all the
hardware<00:04:55.629> is<00:04:55.839> in<00:04:56.139> place<00:04:56.409> and<00:04:56.889> the<00:04:56.949> response<00:04:57.789> so

00:04:58.619 --> 00:04:58.629 
hardware is in place and the response so

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.889 
hardware is in place and the response so
it's<00:04:59.110> a<00:04:59.229> 15<00:04:59.889> I'm<00:05:00.399> cutting<00:05:00.699> nothing<00:05:00.969> right<00:05:01.059> we

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:01.899 
it's a 15 I'm cutting nothing right we

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.889 
it's a 15 I'm cutting nothing right we
are<00:05:02.110> now<00:05:02.259> done<00:05:03.179> now<00:05:04.179> we<00:05:04.239> probably<00:05:04.479> won't<00:05:04.659> cut

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:04.899 
are now done now we probably won't cut

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:07.619 
are now done now we probably won't cut
the<00:05:05.019> way<00:05:05.139> up<00:05:05.289> until<00:05:05.499> the<00:05:06.300> trip<00:05:07.300> these<00:05:07.479> are

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:07.629 
the way up until the trip these are

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.649 
the way up until the trip these are
actually<00:05:07.869> old<00:05:08.019> enough<00:05:08.259> for<00:05:08.289> outside<00:05:09.509> which<00:05:10.509> is

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659 
actually old enough for outside which is

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.009 
actually old enough for outside which is
it's<00:05:11.050> not<00:05:11.229> for<00:05:11.439> another<00:05:11.469> three<00:05:11.860> weeks<00:05:11.889> I

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:13.019 
it's not for another three weeks I

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.669 
it's not for another three weeks I
really<00:05:14.019> think<00:05:14.259> we're<00:05:15.249> done<00:05:15.429> for<00:05:15.610> now
