00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
pretty cool so there's that and by the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
pretty cool so there's that and by the
way<00:02:06.600> calm<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.049> mental<00:02:07.380> hospital<00:02:07.890> does<00:02:08.190> not

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
way calm would mental hospital does not

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.089

have<00:02:08.670> any<00:02:09.000> building<00:02:09.539> animation<00:02:10.470> just<00:02:10.830> yet

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
have any building animation just yet

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.550 
have any building animation just yet
because<00:02:11.459> no<00:02:11.910> character<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.629> least<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.379> mine

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
because no character at least to mine

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.860 
because no character at least to mine
all

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
all

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.960 
all
can<00:02:14.110> go<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.409> there<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.920> we<00:02:15.580> don't<00:02:15.760> know<00:02:15.819> what

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
can go in there so we don't know what

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.220 
can go in there so we don't know what
happens<00:02:16.239> when<00:02:16.299> a<00:02:16.420> character<00:02:16.629> goes<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.110> there

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
happens when a character goes in there

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.770 
happens when a character goes in there
but<00:02:17.379> i'm<00:02:17.470> guessing<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> lights<00:02:18.190> will<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
but i'm guessing the lights will just

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.720 
but i'm guessing the lights will just
soar<00:02:19.780> around<00:02:19.959> and<00:02:20.440> look<00:02:20.590> for<00:02:20.620> somebody<00:02:21.040> sort

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
soar around and look for somebody sort

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.649 
soar around and look for somebody sort
of<00:02:21.819> similar<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.720> penitentiary<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:26.310> and

of similar to the penitentiary and and

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.880
