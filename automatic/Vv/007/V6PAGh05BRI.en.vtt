00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
amount of array of little problems that

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.900 
amount of array of little problems that
I'm<00:00:22.650> having<00:00:22.800> because<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.340> course<00:00:23.550> I'm<00:00:23.670> growing

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
I'm having because of course I'm growing

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.960 
I'm having because of course I'm growing
just<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.449> sand<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.590> 30<00:00:25.920> days<00:00:27.080> 30<00:00:28.080> days<00:00:28.199> from

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
just in sand but in 30 days 30 days from

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.500 
just in sand but in 30 days 30 days from
sowing<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.599> seed<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.560> actually<00:00:32.160> now<00:00:32.880> it's

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
sowing the seed to actually now it's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.510 
sowing the seed to actually now it's
grown<00:00:33.960> about<00:00:34.079> two<00:00:34.410> feet<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.890> some<00:00:35.070> place<00:00:35.280> it's

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
grown about two feet in some place it's

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.630 
grown about two feet in some place it's
just<00:00:35.579> incredible<00:00:37.190> anyway<00:00:38.190> let's<00:00:38.430> take<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
just incredible anyway let's take a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.240 
just incredible anyway let's take a
closer<00:00:38.940> look<00:00:39.649> right<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> want<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.980> talk<00:00:41.100> about

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
closer look right I want to talk about

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.060 
closer look right I want to talk about
the<00:00:41.430> problems<00:00:41.910> first<00:00:42.230> obviously<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.950> know

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the problems first obviously you know

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.720 
the problems first obviously you know
having<00:00:44.430> grown<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:46.110> 30<00:00:46.739> days<00:00:47.010> it's

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
having grown this in 30 days it's

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.119 
having grown this in 30 days it's
amazing<00:00:48.180> you<00:00:48.539> know<00:00:48.660> but<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.140> also<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.100> to

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
amazing you know but I also want to

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.369 
amazing you know but I also want to
teach<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.719> problems<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.230> I'm

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
teach the kind of problems that I'm

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.160 
teach the kind of problems that I'm
having<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.860> we<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.340> learn<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.850> and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
having so we all can learn from it and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
having so we all can learn from it and
basically<00:00:55.170> problem<00:00:56.010> number<00:00:56.160> one<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.699> that

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
basically problem number one is that

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.290 
basically problem number one is that
when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> grow<00:00:58.350> in<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:59.039> sand<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.149> not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
when you grow in just sand and I'm not

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
when you grow in just sand and I'm not
even<00:01:00.510> talking<00:01:00.600> about<00:01:00.719> salmon<00:01:01.170> soy<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:02.100> grow

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
even talking about salmon soy just grow

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
even talking about salmon soy just grow
in<00:01:02.430> pure<00:01:02.640> sand<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.809> do<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> on<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
in pure sand and I do that on the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.719 
in pure sand and I do that on the
grounds<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.680> add<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.040> compost<00:01:05.369> but<00:01:05.640> if

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
grounds that I add some compost but if

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.120 
grounds that I add some compost but if
you<00:01:05.820> grow<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.390> sand<00:01:06.659> when<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.650> rains<00:01:07.890> it

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
you grow and just sand when it rains it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.179 
you grow and just sand when it rains it
becomes<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.880> much<00:01:09.439> like<00:01:10.439> quicksand<00:01:10.860> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
becomes pretty much like quicksand and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
becomes pretty much like quicksand and
that<00:01:11.939> means<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.600> plants<00:01:13.020> are<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that means that the plants are going to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
that means that the plants are going to
fall<00:01:13.619> over<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.070> sweet<00:01:14.310> corn<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.700> course<00:01:14.729> being

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
fall over now sweet corn of course being

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.010 
fall over now sweet corn of course being
a<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:16.110> tall<00:01:16.409> plant<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.509> we're<00:01:18.509> of<00:01:18.810> course

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a very tall plant and we're of course

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
a very tall plant and we're of course
fall<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.430> kind<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.729> rocks

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
fall over and if it if it kind of rocks

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.090 
fall over and if it if it kind of rocks
around<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.380> means<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
around a lot that means it's going to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
around a lot that means it's going to
get<00:01:23.250> stressed<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.909> any<00:01:24.240> plant<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.630> gets

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
get stressed and any plant that gets

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
get stressed and any plant that gets
stressed<00:01:25.320> whether<00:01:26.220> through<00:01:26.580> drought<00:01:26.970> under

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
stressed whether through drought under

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.890 
stressed whether through drought under
watering<00:01:28.430> over<00:01:29.430> watering<00:01:29.880> can<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.299> stressful

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
watering over watering can be stressful

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.490 
watering over watering can be stressful
none<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.560> nutrients<00:01:32.540> shaking<00:01:33.540> about<00:01:33.659> too<00:01:34.320> much

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
none of nutrients shaking about too much

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.730 
none of nutrients shaking about too much
at<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> roots<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.540> what<00:01:36.540> can<00:01:36.720> happen<00:01:36.930> is<00:01:37.290> that

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
at the roots and what can happen is that

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
at the roots and what can happen is that
it<00:01:38.040> gets<00:01:38.189> stress<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.759> goes<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:39.060> seed<00:01:39.240> early

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it gets stress and it goes to seed early

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
it gets stress and it goes to seed early
and<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:40.200> course<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.530> don't<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.040> because

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and of course we don't want that because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.719 
and of course we don't want that because
we<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.729> get<00:01:41.880> any<00:01:42.150> proper<00:01:43.079> crops<00:01:43.729> especially

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
we don't get any proper crops especially

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.830 
we don't get any proper crops especially
with<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> Suika

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
with the Suika

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
with the Suika
so<00:01:46.799> problem<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.729> problem<00:01:48.119> number<00:01:48.180> one

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
so problem that's problem number one

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.109 
so problem that's problem number one
solution<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.110> course<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.740> put<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> stake<00:01:50.310> on

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
solution of course is I put a stake on

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990 
solution of course is I put a stake on
either<00:01:51.299> side<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> string<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.520> either

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
either side and I put a string on either

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
either side and I put a string on either
side<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.659> sweet<00:01:55.020> corn<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.350> that's<00:01:55.530> kind

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
side of the sweet corn and that's kind

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
side of the sweet corn and that's kind
of<00:01:55.920> holding<00:01:56.189> them<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.430> place<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.450> can

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
of holding them in place now and I can

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.410 
of holding them in place now and I can
also<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.990> course<00:01:58.049> twist<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> string<00:01:59.640> at<00:02:00.060> some

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
also of course twist the string at some

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.690 
also of course twist the string at some
point<00:02:00.659> when<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.200> get<00:02:01.350> thicker<00:02:01.590> or<00:02:02.399> taller

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
point when they get thicker or taller

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789 
point when they get thicker or taller
and<00:02:03.420> tie<00:02:03.600> maybe<00:02:03.810> another<00:02:04.079> string<00:02:04.350> across<00:02:04.560> as

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
and tie maybe another string across as

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.750 
and tie maybe another string across as
well<00:02:05.009> and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
well and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.810 
well and
hold<00:02:05.910> them<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.180> place<00:02:07.130> now<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.190> second

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
hold them in place now the second

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.110 
hold them in place now the second
problem<00:02:08.940> brings<00:02:09.420> me<00:02:09.630> on<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:10.010> this<00:02:11.010> lovely<00:02:11.790> bed

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
problem brings me on to this lovely bed

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
problem brings me on to this lovely bed
that<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> showed<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.660> also<00:02:13.140> as<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.350> kind<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.650> an

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that I showed you also as a kind of an

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.060 
that I showed you also as a kind of an
example<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.090> first<00:02:15.330> video<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.860> see

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
example and the first video you can see

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.100 
example and the first video you can see
of<00:02:17.190> course<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.700> have<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.000> do<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.810> kind<00:02:18.990> of<00:02:19.020> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
of course I have to do the kind of a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.560 
of course I have to do the kind of a
climbing<00:02:19.530> structure<00:02:19.980> around<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.360> beans

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
climbing structure around the the beans

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.510 
climbing structure around the the beans
because<00:02:22.080> I<00:02:22.260> planted<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> beans<00:02:23.040> when<00:02:23.370> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
because I planted the beans when the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.710 
because I planted the beans when the
sweet<00:02:23.730> corn<00:02:23.940> was<00:02:24.180> about<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.480> high<00:02:24.690> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
sweet corn was about that high and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.560 
sweet corn was about that high and
normally<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.680> enough<00:02:26.330> because<00:02:27.330> beans

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
normally that is enough because beans

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.110 
normally that is enough because beans
are<00:02:27.780> much<00:02:27.960> slower<00:02:28.350> compared<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.820> sweet

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
are much slower compared to the sweet

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.150 
are much slower compared to the sweet
corn<00:02:30.480> in<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.020> West<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.560> they<00:02:31.680> would<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.980> in

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
corn in the West then they would be in

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.250 
corn in the West then they would be in
the<00:02:32.280> tropics<00:02:32.640> now<00:02:32.700> in<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.000> tropics<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:34.050> just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
the tropics now in the tropics they just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.560 
the tropics now in the tropics they just
grow<00:02:34.440> like<00:02:34.650> crazy<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:35.160> beans<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.180> they<00:02:36.300> really

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
grow like crazy the beans so they really

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.870 
grow like crazy the beans so they really
outgrow<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.320> week<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.280> there's<00:02:38.490> all<00:02:38.640> kind

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
outgrow this week on so there's all kind

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.730 
outgrow this week on so there's all kind
of<00:02:38.940> three<00:02:39.270> sister<00:02:39.660> thing<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> tropics<00:02:40.530> is

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
of three sister thing in the tropics is

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.340 
of three sister thing in the tropics is
much<00:02:41.370> more<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.760> challenge<00:02:41.970> because<00:02:42.570> you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
much more of a challenge because you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.960 
much more of a challenge because you
need<00:02:43.500> to<00:02:43.650> wait<00:02:43.860> until<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.760> week

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
need to wait until it and this week

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.460 
need to wait until it and this week
comes<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.360> least<00:02:45.510> two<00:02:45.720> feet<00:02:45.900> well<00:02:46.170> that's<00:02:46.380> why

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
comes at least two feet well that's why

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.090 
comes at least two feet well that's why
you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.740> actually<00:02:46.860> plant<00:02:47.400> your<00:02:47.610> beans<00:02:47.930> now

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
you can actually plant your beans now

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.040 
you can actually plant your beans now
this<00:02:50.100> brings<00:02:50.340> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.850> my<00:02:51.030> my<00:02:51.450> real<00:02:51.750> problem

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
this brings going to my my real problem

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.490 
this brings going to my my real problem
which<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.770> lack<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.570> magnesium<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.140> probably

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
which is lack of magnesium and probably

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.890 
which is lack of magnesium and probably
boron<00:02:55.890> as<00:02:56.100> well<00:02:56.310> in<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.880> actual<00:02:57.270> sandy<00:02:57.630> soil

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
boron as well in the actual sandy soil

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.930 
boron as well in the actual sandy soil
that's<00:02:58.230> quite<00:02:58.440> common<00:02:58.680> with<00:02:58.920> sandy<00:02:59.520> soil<00:02:59.760> is

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
that's quite common with sandy soil is

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.610 
that's quite common with sandy soil is
that<00:03:00.120> these<00:03:00.690> nutrients<00:03:01.260> are<00:03:01.320> actually

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
that these nutrients are actually

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.640 
that these nutrients are actually
missing<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.240> in<00:03:03.510> order<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.750> remedy<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.230> I've

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
missing and in order to remedy that I've

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.340 
missing and in order to remedy that I've
taken<00:03:05.130> just<00:03:05.730> yesterday<00:03:06.630> I<00:03:06.690> got<00:03:06.900> some<00:03:07.050> epsom

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
taken just yesterday I got some epsom

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.690 
taken just yesterday I got some epsom
salts<00:03:07.680> I'm<00:03:07.830> going<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.040> spray<00:03:08.250> some<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.580> that

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
salts I'm going to spray some of that

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.160 
salts I'm going to spray some of that
onto<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.090> leaves<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.600> I'm<00:03:09.720> also<00:03:09.870> going<00:03:10.080> to

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
onto the leaves and I'm also going to

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.460 
onto the leaves and I'm also going to
water<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:13.910> sauce<00:03:14.910> is<00:03:15.090> pure<00:03:15.300> magnesium<00:03:15.470> so

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
water the sauce is pure magnesium so

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.580 
water the sauce is pure magnesium so
that<00:03:16.650> should<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:18.780> they're<00:03:18.959> making<00:03:19.260> flowers

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
that should but they're making flowers

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.120 
that should but they're making flowers
already

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
already

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.130 
already
so<00:03:20.280> if<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.670> can<00:03:20.850> just<00:03:21.000> get<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.269> few<00:03:21.510> beans<00:03:21.780> from

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
so if I can just get a few beans from

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.699 
so if I can just get a few beans from
these<00:03:22.769> Madeira<00:03:23.420> gonna<00:03:24.420> be<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.959> mean<00:03:25.290> beans

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
these Madeira gonna be I mean beans

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.190 
these Madeira gonna be I mean beans
coming<00:03:26.130> beans<00:03:26.310> then<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.180> will<00:03:27.360> actually<00:03:27.750> be

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
coming beans then I will actually be

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.840 
coming beans then I will actually be
doing<00:03:28.230> really<00:03:28.620> well<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.430> start<00:03:30.060> again

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
doing really well and I can start again

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.850 
doing really well and I can start again
toys<00:03:32.850> that<00:03:33.030> have<00:03:33.209> some<00:03:33.420> clay<00:03:33.660> added<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.590> that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
toys that have some clay added and that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.040 
toys that have some clay added and that
is<00:03:38.160> basically<00:03:38.550> the<00:03:38.760> real<00:03:38.910> fixes<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.570> have<00:03:39.750> well

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
is basically the real fixes to have well

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.050 
is basically the real fixes to have well
broken<00:03:40.440> down<00:03:40.530> compass<00:03:41.010> back<00:03:41.610> to<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> whole

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
broken down compass back to the whole

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:52.699 
broken down compass back to the whole
thing<00:03:42.239> but<00:03:42.300> I<00:03:42.480> didn't<00:03:42.780> have<00:03:42.870> it<00:03:51.290> right<00:03:52.290> what's

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
thing but I didn't have it right what's

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.650

this<00:04:33.470> one<00:04:33.680> I<00:04:33.710> don't<00:04:33.860> know<00:04:34.010> how<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.280> survived

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
this one I don't know how it survived

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.540 
this one I don't know how it survived
but<00:04:35.330> I<00:04:35.389> can't<00:04:36.110> envision<00:04:36.410> it<00:04:36.650> doing<00:04:36.950> much<00:04:37.190> it's

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
but I can't envision it doing much it's

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.030 
but I can't envision it doing much it's
been<00:04:37.760> that<00:04:38.300> size<00:04:38.600> for<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:39.020> last<00:04:39.230> I<00:04:39.620> don't<00:04:39.860> know

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
been that size for the last I don't know

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.150 
been that size for the last I don't know
two<00:04:40.520> to<00:04:40.940> three<00:04:41.210> weeks<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> I<00:04:42.680> can't<00:04:42.919> see<00:04:43.070> it

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
two to three weeks so I can't see it

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.580 
two to three weeks so I can't see it
doing<00:04:43.400> much<00:04:43.639> hence<00:04:44.600> my<00:04:44.810> reason<00:04:45.110> for<00:04:45.139> planting

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
doing much hence my reason for planting

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.370 
doing much hence my reason for planting

from<00:04:59.360> this<00:05:00.290> Peter<00:05:03.370> wow<00:05:04.370> it's<00:05:04.610> hot<00:05:04.790> so<00:05:05.570> the

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
from this Peter wow it's hot so the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:20.170 
from this Peter wow it's hot so the
problem<00:05:09.250> is<00:05:10.250> due<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.150> stress<00:05:18.460> these<00:05:19.460> guys<00:05:19.790> are

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
problem is due to stress these guys are

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.969 
problem is due to stress these guys are
actually<00:05:20.240> tussling<00:05:20.990> up<00:05:21.200> too<00:05:21.410> soon<00:05:21.680> and<00:05:21.860> that

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
actually tussling up too soon and that

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.950 
actually tussling up too soon and that
means<00:05:22.250> basically<00:05:22.520> that<00:05:22.880> they're<00:05:23.630> growing

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
means basically that they're growing

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.170 
means basically that they're growing
these<00:05:24.140> tassels<00:05:25.040> at<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.250> top<00:05:25.460> which<00:05:25.820> is<00:05:26.000> where

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
these tassels at the top which is where

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.080 
these tassels at the top which is where
the<00:05:26.300> more<00:05:26.510> male<00:05:27.020> pollen<00:05:27.640> actually<00:05:28.640> is

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
the more male pollen actually is

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.860 
the more male pollen actually is
produced<00:05:29.710> and<00:05:30.710> when<00:05:30.890> that<00:05:31.010> happens<00:05:31.340> too<00:05:31.520> soon

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
produced and when that happens too soon

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.750 
produced and when that happens too soon
it's<00:05:32.870> not<00:05:33.229> good<00:05:33.500> because<00:05:33.950> it<00:05:34.190> kind<00:05:34.460> of<00:05:34.550> shows

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
it's not good because it kind of shows

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.360 
it's not good because it kind of shows
that<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:35.900> plant<00:05:36.289> wants<00:05:36.500> to<00:05:36.680> go<00:05:36.800> to<00:05:36.860> sea<00:05:37.100> too

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
that the plant wants to go to sea too

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.610 
that the plant wants to go to sea too
soon<00:05:37.640> and<00:05:38.060> they<00:05:38.720> haven't<00:05:38.930> informed

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
soon and they haven't informed

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.230 
soon and they haven't informed
crops<00:05:39.919> yet<00:05:40.160> and<00:05:40.490> this<00:05:40.700> won't<00:05:40.880> be<00:05:41.000> a<00:05:41.030> problem

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
crops yet and this won't be a problem

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.719 
crops yet and this won't be a problem
because<00:05:41.479> they're<00:05:41.720> still<00:05:41.840> going<00:05:42.080> to<00:05:42.200> grow<00:05:42.410> a

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
because they're still going to grow a

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.310 
because they're still going to grow a
good<00:05:43.729> bit<00:05:44.030> before<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.660> tassel<00:05:45.050> actually

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
good bit before the tassel actually

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.800 
good bit before the tassel actually
grows<00:05:45.560> but<00:05:46.310> usually<00:05:46.669> it<00:05:46.729> happens<00:05:46.880> at<00:05:47.210> about<00:05:47.390> 3

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810
