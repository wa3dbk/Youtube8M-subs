00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it's just a piece of fabric and it has

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's just a piece of fabric and it has
rice<00:01:25.080> inside<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.619> but<00:01:26.220> for<00:01:26.520> hers<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.939> made<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
rice inside of it but for hers I made a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
rice inside of it but for hers I made a
little<00:01:27.450> fleece<00:01:27.780> cover<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> but<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> comes

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
little fleece cover for it but it comes

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.710 
little fleece cover for it but it comes
off<00:01:30.030> like<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.369> then<00:01:32.369> here's<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.090> actual

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
off like this and then here's the actual

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.480 
off like this and then here's the actual
thing<00:01:34.200> itself<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
thing itself and you put this in the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.390 
thing itself and you put this in the
microwave<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.329> then<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:37.680> gets<00:01:37.829> nice<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.040> hot

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
microwave and then it gets nice and hot

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.630 
microwave and then it gets nice and hot
so<00:01:38.430> your<00:01:38.880> Hedgehog<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.079> warm

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
so your Hedgehog can go on and get warm

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.130 
so your Hedgehog can go on and get warm
but<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.390> guys<00:01:42.570> are<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:42.930> thinking

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
but so you guys are probably thinking

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
but so you guys are probably thinking
you<00:01:43.560> won't<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:43.920> microwave<00:01:44.310> because<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
you won't have a microwave because the

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.660 
you won't have a microwave because the
power<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.210> be<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.100> do<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
power will be out but what you can do is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.179 
power will be out but what you can do is
take<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.979> big<00:01:49.979> pot<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.460> water<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.829> I'm<00:01:52.829> filled

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
take a big pot of water and I'm filled

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.069 
take a big pot of water and I'm filled
up<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> fair<00:01:54.119> amount<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.479> water<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
up like with a fair amount of water and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.080 
up like with a fair amount of water and
put<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.979> barbeque<00:01:56.490> until<00:01:56.880> it<00:01:56.969> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
of the strainer and then the steam rises

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.150 
of the strainer and then the steam rises
up<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.270> it'll<00:02:09.780> heat<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.470> heating<00:02:10.649> pad<00:02:10.920> so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
up and it'll heat up the heating pad so

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.800 
up and it'll heat up the heating pad so
if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.340> have<00:02:11.520> any<00:02:11.760> kind<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.060> heating<00:02:12.420> pad<00:02:12.599> for

power is gonna be out for a couple days

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.700 
power is gonna be out for a couple days
then<00:02:44.480> use<00:02:45.480> your<00:02:45.660> cell<00:02:45.840> phone<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.290> call<00:02:46.320> a

their power is still on and ask you you

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.790 
their power is still on and ask you you
can<00:02:51.180> leave<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.540> hedgehog<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.230> them<00:02:52.440> for<00:02:52.770> a

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
can leave your hedgehog with them for a

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.320 
can leave your hedgehog with them for a
few<00:02:52.860> days<00:02:53.040> until<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.610> power<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:53.940> back<00:02:54.120> on

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
few days until the power is back on

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.020 
few days until the power is back on
because<00:02:54.570> if<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.620> temperature<00:02:56.370> drops<00:02:56.400> too

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
because if the temperature drops too

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.930 
because if the temperature drops too
much<00:02:57.320> then<00:02:58.320> it'll<00:02:58.740> get<00:02:58.830> very<00:02:59.160> cold<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.700> your

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
much then it'll get very cold and your

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.460 
much then it'll get very cold and your
Hedgehog<00:03:00.270> could<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.540> into<00:03:00.660> hibernation<00:03:00.840> mode

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
Hedgehog could go into hibernation mode

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.260 
Hedgehog could go into hibernation mode
and<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.730> not<00:03:03.000> good<00:03:03.270> so<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.090> really

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
and that is not good so that is really

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.510 
and that is not good so that is really
what<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.630> need<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.960> do<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.830> can<00:03:08.010> also<00:03:08.160> have

heating pad to go right inside so your

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.620 
heating pad to go right inside so your
Hedgehog<00:03:53.010> stays<00:03:53.280> warm<00:03:53.610> because<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.180> very

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
use for humans because that is going to

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.950 
use for humans because that is going to
be<00:04:59.800> very<00:05:00.099> bad<00:05:00.310> for<00:05:00.370> your<00:05:00.699> hedgehog<00:05:00.909> and<00:05:01.419> it's
