that was invented by a guy who was a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.310 
that was invented by a guy who was a
fireman

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320

now this fireman he actually originally
found<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.479> when<00:01:13.140> wood<00:01:13.470> was<00:01:13.799> exposed<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
found that when wood was exposed to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.740 
found that when wood was exposed to
really<00:01:14.970> high<00:01:15.330> temperatures<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.590> fires<00:01:17.070> and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
really high temperatures in fires and

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
really high temperatures in fires and
that<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.740> exposed<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.280> these<00:01:20.460> high

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
that also was exposed to these high

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.289 
that also was exposed to these high
temperatures<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.630> there<00:01:21.810> was<00:01:21.900> no<00:01:22.170> oxygen

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
temperatures when there was no oxygen

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:24.590 
temperatures when there was no oxygen
environment

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
environment

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.130 
environment
or<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.119> when<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> fire<00:01:27.540> had<00:01:27.840> eaten

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
or you know when when the fire had eaten

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.859 
or you know when when the fire had eaten
up<00:01:28.259> all<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.650> oxygen<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.689> and<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
up all the oxygen and and the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.260 
up all the oxygen and and the
temperatures<00:01:31.380> were<00:01:31.560> still<00:01:31.860> hot<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
temperatures were still hot that the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.440 
temperatures were still hot that the
wood<00:01:33.540> turned<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.350> dark<00:01:34.740> brown<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:36.299> was

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
wood turned really dark brown and it was

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.149 
wood turned really dark brown and it was
still<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:36.960> solid<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:37.890> still

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
still really solid and it was still

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.190 
still really solid and it was still
really<00:01:38.400> good<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.299> was<00:01:39.420> great<00:01:39.869> for

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
really good and it was great for

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.889 
really good and it was great for
woodworking<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:41.970> what<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.270> started<00:01:42.720> doing

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
woodworking and so what he started doing

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
woodworking and so what he started doing
was<00:01:43.259> he<00:01:43.560> started<00:01:43.829> taking<00:01:44.340> large<00:01:44.640> batches<00:01:45.030> of

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
was he started taking large batches of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.080 
was he started taking large batches of
wood<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> baking<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.860> low<00:01:47.280> oxygen

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
wood and baking it in low oxygen

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.510 
wood and baking it in low oxygen
environments<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:48.930> he<00:01:49.649> called<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.250> wood

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
environments and he called this wood

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
environments and he called this wood
cambium<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.950> so<00:01:53.600> that's<00:01:54.600> what<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.079> wood<00:01:55.380> is

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
cambium and so that's what this wood is

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.819 
cambium and so that's what this wood is
is<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.189> cambia<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.509> particular<00:01:57.960> cambia

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
is it's cambia in this particular cambia

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.510 
is it's cambia in this particular cambia
is<00:01:59.009> actually<00:01:59.790> poplar<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.770> know<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:02.310> it's

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
is actually poplar and I know that it's

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.130 
is actually poplar and I know that it's
silly<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:04.979> fires<00:02:05.399> me<00:02:05.790> up<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.869> we

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
silly but that just fires me up that we

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.320 
silly but that just fires me up that we
have<00:02:07.350> poplar<00:02:08.069> cambia<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.349> poplar<00:02:10.349> wood<00:02:11.330> and

have poplar cambia and poplar wood and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700 
have poplar cambia and poplar wood and
that<00:02:12.870> makes<00:02:13.200> up

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that makes up

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.670 
that makes up

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
changed the student flute from being

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.210 
changed the student flute from being
just<00:02:34.020> oh<00:02:34.440> yeah

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
you know kind of a whatever flute to be

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.310 
you know kind of a whatever flute to be
in<00:02:37.500> something<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.010> was<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.490> proud<00:02:38.730> of<00:02:38.790> and

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
in something I was really proud of and

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720 
in something I was really proud of and
not<00:02:40.320> only<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:41.040> wasn't<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.610> only

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
not only that that wasn't the only

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.940 
not only that that wasn't the only
change<00:02:42.090> we<00:02:42.270> made<00:02:42.480> but<00:02:43.050> this<00:02:43.320> other<00:02:43.530> change

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
change we made but this other change

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.010 
change we made but this other change
really<00:02:44.610> helped<00:02:44.850> me<00:02:44.940> be<00:02:45.120> proud<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.510> it<00:02:45.630> too<00:02:45.810> and

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
really helped me be proud of it too and

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.070 
really helped me be proud of it too and
that<00:02:46.590> was<00:02:46.830> we<00:02:47.220> decided<00:02:47.730> that<00:02:47.760> we<00:02:48.270> just<00:02:48.480> had<00:02:48.810> to

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
that was we decided that we just had to

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.690 
that was we decided that we just had to
put<00:02:49.290> finish<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.950> mouthpiece<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.580> the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
put finish on the mouthpiece of the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.450 
put finish on the mouthpiece of the
student<00:02:51.150> flute<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:52.410> reason<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.950> is<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
student flute and the reason is is that

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.550 
student flute and the reason is is that
the<00:02:53.550> finish<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.090> really<00:02:54.660> an<00:02:54.780> important<00:02:55.320> part

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
the finish is really an important part

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.650 
the finish is really an important part
of<00:02:55.680> what<00:02:55.860> we<00:02:56.070> do<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.520> wood<00:02:56.730> sounds<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
of what we do with wood sounds the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.420 
of what we do with wood sounds the
finish<00:02:58.050> provides<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.740> layer<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.280> protection

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
finish provides a layer of protection

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.450 
finish provides a layer of protection
for<00:02:59.940> our<00:03:00.210> flute<00:03:00.540> players<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.560> protects<00:03:02.280> the

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
for our flute players it protects the

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.360 
for our flute players it protects the
flute<00:03:02.700> pair<00:03:02.970> from<00:03:03.590> allergic<00:03:04.590> reaction<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.220> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
flute pair from allergic reaction to the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.210 
flute pair from allergic reaction to the
woods<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:06.480> woods<00:03:06.750> all<00:03:07.110> woods<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.800> in<00:03:08.010> them

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
woods the woods all woods have in them

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.510 
woods the woods all woods have in them
things<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.630> trees<00:03:10.040> grow<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.280> them

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
things that the trees grow in them

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.570 
things that the trees grow in them
lignans<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.840> things<00:03:13.080> like<00:03:13.230> this<00:03:13.890> and<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
lignans and things like this and the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.020 
lignans and things like this and the
trees<00:03:14.910> they<00:03:15.690> grow<00:03:16.050> in<00:03:16.740> them<00:03:17.030> natural

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
trees they grow in them natural

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.530 
trees they grow in them natural
protections<00:03:18.750> from<00:03:19.350> insect<00:03:20.160> infestations<00:03:21.090> and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
protections from insect infestations and

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.130 
protections from insect infestations and
from<00:03:21.900> bacteria<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.190> fungal<00:03:24.030> infections

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
from bacteria and and fungal infections

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.710 
from bacteria and and fungal infections
and<00:03:25.140> things<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.530> this<00:03:25.860> trees<00:03:26.310> have<00:03:26.720> are

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
and things like this trees have are

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420 
and things like this trees have are
they're<00:03:28.020> really<00:03:28.290> smart<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> they<00:03:28.950> they

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
they're really smart and they they

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.810 
they're really smart and they they
protect<00:03:29.880> themselves<00:03:30.060> from<00:03:30.660> other<00:03:31.820> invasions

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
protect themselves from other invasions

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.070 
protect themselves from other invasions
of<00:03:33.030> other<00:03:33.690> species<00:03:34.140> and<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:36.480> woods<00:03:36.720> have

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
of other species and so the woods have

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.620 
of other species and so the woods have
those<00:03:37.380> things<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:37.950> them<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.760> may<00:03:38.940> know<00:03:39.210> that

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
those things in them you may know that

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.960 
those things in them you may know that
if<00:03:40.110> you<00:03:40.290> put<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> cedar<00:03:40.890> log<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.700> ground

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
if you put a cedar log in the ground

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.750 
if you put a cedar log in the ground
it'll<00:03:42.600> last<00:03:43.020> for<00:03:43.380> a<00:03:43.410> long<00:03:43.680> time<00:03:44.100> well<00:03:44.580> the

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it'll last for a long time well the

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.670 
it'll last for a long time well the
reason<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.420> is<00:03:45.660> because<00:03:45.690> of<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> things

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
reason for that is because of the things

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.940 
reason for that is because of the things
that<00:03:47.010> are<00:03:47.100> in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.520> cedar<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.960> protect<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.620> from

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that are in the cedar to protect it from

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.260 
that are in the cedar to protect it from
rotting<00:03:50.220> well<00:03:51.210> that<00:03:51.930> kind<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.470> stuff<00:03:52.860> is<00:03:53.160> not

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
rotting well that kind of stuff is not

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.990 
rotting well that kind of stuff is not
necessarily<00:03:54.270> good<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.570> us<00:03:55.020> to<00:03:55.290> ingest<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.130> so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
necessarily good for us to ingest and so

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.350 
necessarily good for us to ingest and so
when<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.900> provide<00:03:58.380> a<00:03:58.410> layer<00:03:58.830> of<00:03:59.040> protection

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
when we provide a layer of protection

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.160 
when we provide a layer of protection
with<00:04:00.360> our<00:04:00.570> acrylic<00:04:00.930> finish<00:04:01.970> then<00:04:02.970> it<00:04:03.480> it

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
with our acrylic finish then it it

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.020 
with our acrylic finish then it it
protects<00:04:04.740> us<00:04:04.980> from<00:04:05.450> from<00:04:06.450> from<00:04:07.200> as<00:04:08.070> a<00:04:08.640> flute

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
protects us from from from as a flute

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.290 
protects us from from from as a flute
player<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.450> protects<00:04:09.870> us<00:04:10.110> from<00:04:10.820> anything<00:04:11.820> that

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
player it protects us from anything that

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.960 
player it protects us from anything that
is<00:04:12.570> in<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.930> wood<00:04:13.140> and<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.220> why<00:04:14.490> we<00:04:14.760> pur
