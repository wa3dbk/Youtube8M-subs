our Moses rocks if you struck them the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.470 
our Moses rocks if you struck them the
rock<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:25.019> how<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.260> came<00:00:25.410> water<00:00:26.150> but<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.269> looks

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
rock and how it came water but it looks

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
rock and how it came water but it looks
pretty<00:00:27.750> fancy<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.470> can<00:00:28.619> see<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> water

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
pretty fancy you can see the water

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.820 
pretty fancy you can see the water
coming<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.760> both<00:00:30.060> sides<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.320> natural

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
coming out both sides this is a natural

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.799 
coming out both sides this is a natural
piece<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.219> limestone<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:33.210> found<00:00:33.480> and

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
piece of limestone that we found and

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.680 
piece of limestone that we found and
freshly<00:00:34.770> picked<00:00:35.010> out<00:00:35.280> for<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.540> what

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
freshly picked out for this but what

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.860 
freshly picked out for this but what
we've<00:00:36.899> done<00:00:37.200> here<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.739> we've<00:00:38.489> got<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.790> hole<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
we've done here is we've got a hole that

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.950 
we've done here is we've got a hole that
we<00:00:40.050> dug<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.739> can't<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.340> see<00:00:41.960> that's

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
we dug that you can't really see that's

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.119 
we dug that you can't really see that's
probably<00:00:43.320> Oh<00:00:44.239> six<00:00:45.239> feet<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.690> frost<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.440> about

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
probably Oh six feet of frost and about

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.340 
probably Oh six feet of frost and about
three<00:00:47.489> feet<00:00:47.789> deep<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.539> then<00:00:48.930> we've<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
three feet deep and then we've got a

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950 
three feet deep and then we've got a
rubber<00:00:50.010> liner<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:50.910> if<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.239> look<00:00:51.390> close<00:00:51.719> you

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
rubber liner which if you look close you

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
rubber liner which if you look close you
can<00:00:52.020> see<00:00:52.250> showing<00:00:53.250> through<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.520> rocks<00:00:53.850> right

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
can see showing through the rocks right

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.939 
can see showing through the rocks right
there<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.960> buried<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.710> can't

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there it should be buried so you can't

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.430 
there it should be buried so you can't
see<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.000> rubber<00:00:57.600> liner<00:00:57.840> keeps<00:00:58.230> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
see that but that rubber liner keeps the

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
see that but that rubber liner keeps the
water<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:59.039> there<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.579> then<00:01:00.180> down<00:01:00.510> in<00:01:00.750> here

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
water in there and then down in here

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.429 
water in there and then down in here
under<00:01:01.230> these<00:01:01.559> rocks<00:01:01.920> we've<00:01:02.670> got<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> pump<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
under these rocks we've got a pump in a

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.070 
under these rocks we've got a pump in a
little<00:01:04.739> cylinder<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.390> can<00:01:06.600> kind<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.930> imagine

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
little cylinder you can kind of imagine

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.670 
little cylinder you can kind of imagine
a<00:01:07.710> five<00:01:08.520> gallon<00:01:08.909> bucket<00:01:09.240> with<00:01:10.049> holes<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
a five gallon bucket with holes in it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.250 
a five gallon bucket with holes in it
it's<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.520> little<00:01:11.790> fancier<00:01:12.390> than<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.659> but<00:01:12.990> same

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
it's a little fancier than that but same

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740 
it's a little fancier than that but same
idea<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.610> keeps<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> rocks<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
idea and it keeps all the rocks and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.560 
idea and it keeps all the rocks and
things<00:01:15.930> away<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> so<00:01:17.670> what<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.420> we

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
things away from it so what we do is we

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.929 
things away from it so what we do is we
put<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.020> pump<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.590> there<00:01:19.890> run<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.759> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
put that pump in there run it to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
put that pump in there run it to
electricity<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.530> then<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.830> cover<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.400> with

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
electricity and then we cover it up with

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.050 
electricity and then we cover it up with
rocks<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.689> all<00:01:24.930> those<00:01:25.229> voids<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.610> rocks

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
rocks so all those voids in the rocks

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.840 
rocks so all those voids in the rocks
and<00:01:27.330> leaves<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.720> lot<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> larger<00:01:28.530> rock<00:01:28.829> down<00:01:29.579> in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
and leaves a lot of larger rock down in

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.960 
and leaves a lot of larger rock down in
the<00:01:29.970> base<00:01:30.380> all<00:01:31.380> those<00:01:31.829> voids<00:01:32.220> are<00:01:32.549> filled<00:01:32.790> with

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the base all those voids are filled with

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.289 
the base all those voids are filled with
water<00:01:33.409> they<00:01:34.409> flow<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:35.070> into<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.670> pump<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
water they flow right into the pump the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.410 
water they flow right into the pump the
pump<00:01:36.329> pumps<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.110> out<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.799> recirculate

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
pump pumps them out so just recirculate

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.090 
pump pumps them out so just recirculate
right<00:01:39.420> back<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.110> when<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.470> rains<00:01:40.770> it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
right back in there when it rains it

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.639 
right back in there when it rains it
fills<00:01:41.369> up<00:01:41.579> itself<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.630> we're<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.170> drought<00:01:43.439> in

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
fills up itself if we're in a drought in

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.969 
fills up itself if we're in a drought in
the<00:01:43.740> middle<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> summer

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
the middle of summer

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:48.950 
the middle of summer
get<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.189> either<00:01:47.579> need<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.030> replenished<00:01:48.780> by

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
get it either need to be replenished by

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.870 
get it either need to be replenished by
our<00:01:49.710> pond<00:01:50.520> water<00:01:50.909> or<00:01:51.180> something<00:01:51.600> else<00:01:52.189> we<00:01:53.189> when

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
our pond water or something else we when

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.749 
our pond water or something else we when
this<00:01:54.000> gets<00:01:54.270> really<00:01:54.659> old<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:56.070> it's<00:01:56.189> really<00:01:56.520> hot

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
this gets really old and it's really hot

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.430 
this gets really old and it's really hot
a<00:01:57.000> lot<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.240> times<00:01:57.479> we'll<00:01:57.750> just<00:01:58.229> try

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
a lot of times we'll just try

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.770 
a lot of times we'll just try
a little<00:01:58.740> bit<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.010> chlorine<00:01:59.430> bleach<00:01:59.760> then<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
a little bit of chlorine bleach then the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020 
a little bit of chlorine bleach then the
water<00:02:01.050> and<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.440> cleans<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:01.980> up<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:02.880> don't

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
water and it cleans it up if you don't

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.200 
water and it cleans it up if you don't
like<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.720> darkness<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.800> rocks<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.370> do<00:02:05.580> but

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
like the darkness on the rocks I do but

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.420 
like the darkness on the rocks I do but
if<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.480> don't<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.170> clean<00:02:07.800> that<00:02:07.830> off<00:02:08.190> of

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
if you don't you can clean that off of

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.060 
if you don't you can clean that off of
cleats<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.910> well<00:02:09.180> a<00:02:09.479> real<00:02:10.080> simple<00:02:10.470> thing<00:02:10.680> to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
cleats as well a real simple thing to

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.580 
cleats as well a real simple thing to
make<00:02:11.360> depending<00:02:12.360> on<00:02:12.480> how<00:02:12.660> big<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:12.990> hole<00:02:13.290> is

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
make depending on how big the hole is

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.150 
make depending on how big the hole is
and<00:02:13.860> how<00:02:14.010> big<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.000> rocks<00:02:15.210> are<00:02:15.770> it's<00:02:16.770> something

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and how big the rocks are it's something

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.660 
and how big the rocks are it's something
you<00:02:17.250> could<00:02:17.430> even<00:02:17.610> do<00:02:17.940> at<00:02:18.690> home<00:02:19.310> what<00:02:20.310> we<00:02:20.490> have

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
you could even do at home what we have

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.500 
you could even do at home what we have
here<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.930> waterfall<00:02:22.920> feature<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
here is a waterfall feature this is a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.780 
here is a waterfall feature this is a
little<00:02:24.900> more<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.260> depth<00:02:25.590> than<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:25.980> timeless

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
little more in depth than the timeless

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.880 
little more in depth than the timeless
waterfall<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.780> bubbling<00:02:28.230> rock<00:02:28.500> that<00:02:28.770> we

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
waterfall the bubbling rock that we

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.160 
waterfall the bubbling rock that we
looked<00:02:29.130> at<00:02:29.310> before<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:30.480> actually<00:02:30.960> has<00:02:31.140> a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
looked at before this actually has a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.960 
looked at before this actually has a
pond<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> reservoir<00:02:32.760> of<00:02:32.850> water<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.970> we

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
pond with a reservoir of water and we

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.840 
pond with a reservoir of water and we
actually<00:02:36.210> sucked<00:02:36.840> water<00:02:37.650> for<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.400> out<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
actually sucked water for this out of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.370 
actually sucked water for this out of
the<00:02:38.940> pond<00:02:39.210> and<00:02:39.510> we'll<00:02:39.630> show<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.050> in<00:02:40.320> a

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
the pond and we'll show you that in a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.350 
the pond and we'll show you that in a
minute<00:02:40.500> we<00:02:41.190> pump<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:42.060> up<00:02:42.710> underneath<00:02:43.710> here

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
minute we pump that up underneath here

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.200 
minute we pump that up underneath here
into<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.390> box<00:02:45.930> called<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.620> vial<00:02:46.920> Falls<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.850> box

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
into a box called a vial Falls but a box

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.510 
into a box called a vial Falls but a box
it<00:02:48.570> actually<00:02:49.290> pumps<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.740> water<00:02:49.770> over<00:02:50.370> this

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it actually pumps the water over this

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.700 
it actually pumps the water over this
falls<00:02:50.850> back<00:02:51.270> here<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.470> water

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
falls back here so that water

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.790 
falls back here so that water
recirculation<00:02:53.580> in<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.210> case<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:55.320> use<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
recirculation in this case we use the

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.750 
recirculation in this case we use the
pond<00:02:56.040> water<00:02:56.550> here<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:58.110> our<00:02:58.410> nursery<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:59.580> be

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
pond water here at our nursery to be

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.150 
pond water here at our nursery to be
able<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.150> do<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> we<00:03:00.990> just<00:03:01.230> cut<00:03:01.740> this<00:03:01.920> out

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
able to do that and we just cut this out

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.850 
able to do that and we just cut this out
put<00:03:02.489> these<00:03:02.700> big<00:03:02.970> rocks<00:03:03.239> around<00:03:03.660> here<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.739> it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
put these big rocks around here get it

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.640 
put these big rocks around here get it
with<00:03:05.010> some<00:03:05.190> heavy<00:03:05.400> equipment<00:03:06.230> now<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.290> pond

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
with some heavy equipment now the pond

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.670 
with some heavy equipment now the pond
that<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.340> here<00:03:08.730> we<00:03:09.570> use<00:03:09.810> for<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.170> lot<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that we have here we use for a lot of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.100 
that we have here we use for a lot of
different<00:03:11.040> reasons<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:12.750> really

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
different reasons and it's really

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.680 
different reasons and it's really
important<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.550> landscape<00:03:15.120> nursery<00:03:15.540> like

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
important that a landscape nursery like

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.530 
important that a landscape nursery like
ours<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.140> have<00:03:16.320> ponds<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.700> be<00:03:17.880> able<00:03:18.030> to<00:03:18.239> keep

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
ours to have ponds to be able to keep

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.850 
ours to have ponds to be able to keep
the<00:03:18.870> plants<00:03:19.260> alive

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
the plants alive

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.720 
the plants alive
so<00:03:20.100> let's<00:03:20.310> go<00:03:20.459> look<00:03:20.640> at<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> time<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.700> I

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
so let's go look at the time so what I

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.180 
so let's go look at the time so what I
just<00:03:24.090> like<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.600> see<00:03:25.170> is<00:03:25.410> kind<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.860> size

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
just like you to see is kind of the size

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.640 
just like you to see is kind of the size
of<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> pond<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.150> we<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.570> here<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.500> can

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
of the pond that we have here you can

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.710 
of the pond that we have here you can
kind<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:29.010> notice<00:03:29.400> if<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.239> look<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.600> the

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
kind of notice if you look at the

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.990 
kind of notice if you look at the
shoreline<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.680> waters<00:03:32.220> down<00:03:32.550> here<00:03:32.910> in

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
shoreline that the waters down here in

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.600 
shoreline that the waters down here in
the<00:03:33.120> summer<00:03:33.420> time<00:03:33.780> we<00:03:34.350> begin<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.709> use<00:03:35.130> up<00:03:35.430> this

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
the summer time we begin to use up this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.180 
the summer time we begin to use up this
massive<00:03:35.940> reservoir<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.930> water<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.650> we're

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
massive reservoir of water and we're

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.400 
massive reservoir of water and we're
very<00:03:38.220> careful<00:03:38.760> about<00:03:39.150> how<00:03:39.480> we<00:03:39.510> use<00:03:39.690> our<00:03:40.200> water

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
very careful about how we use our water

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.770 
very careful about how we use our water
because<00:03:40.980> we<00:03:41.160> really<00:03:41.580> have<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> finite<00:03:42.750> amount

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
because we really have a finite amount

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.690 
because we really have a finite amount
we<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.680> use<00:03:44.040> each<00:03:44.310> season<00:03:44.910> so<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:47.190> a<00:03:47.220> well

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
we can use each season so we have a well

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.100 
we can use each season so we have a well
in<00:03:48.150> here<00:03:48.600> called<00:03:48.870> a<00:03:48.989> lake<00:03:49.230> well<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.890> this<00:03:50.580> pond

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
in here called a lake well in this pond

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.350 
in here called a lake well in this pond
with<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.140> filtering<00:03:52.830> system<00:03:52.860> it's<00:03:53.580> a<00:03:53.730> big<00:03:54.000> pump

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
with a filtering system it's a big pump

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.580 
with a filtering system it's a big pump
down<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.110> water<00:03:55.910> submersible<00:03:56.910> pump

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
down in the water submersible pump

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.440 
down in the water submersible pump
gravel<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.709> around<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.280> another<00:03:59.670> kind<00:04:00.390> of

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
gravel all around it another kind of

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.830 
gravel all around it another kind of

only<00:04:10.519> it<00:04:10.730> pops<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.330> up<00:04:11.450> to<00:04:11.510> pipes<00:04:11.959> that<00:04:12.319> we<00:04:12.470> have

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
only it pops it up to pipes that we have

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.440 
only it pops it up to pipes that we have
underground<00:04:13.250> we<00:04:13.459> still<00:04:13.730> all<00:04:13.879> around<00:04:14.120> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
underground we still all around the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.890 
underground we still all around the
nursery<00:04:14.900> here<00:04:15.170> so<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:16.519> water<00:04:16.820> we<00:04:17.150> use<00:04:17.479> at<00:04:17.750> this

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
nursery here so the water we use at this

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.409 
nursery here so the water we use at this
nursery<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.709> big<00:04:19.130> majority<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:20.030> it<00:04:20.150> goes<00:04:20.389> back

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
nursery a big majority of it goes back

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.439 
nursery a big majority of it goes back
into<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.169> pond<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.859> another<00:04:22.669> larger<00:04:23.180> fund

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:23.449 
into this pond and another larger fund

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:25.780 
into this pond and another larger fund
that<00:04:23.630> we<00:04:23.780> have<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:25.010> reuse<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:25.729> water

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
that we have and we reuse that water

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.270 
that we have and we reuse that water
over<00:04:26.449> and<00:04:26.600> over<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.199> again<00:04:27.500> we<00:04:27.740> want<00:04:27.979> to<00:04:28.070> take

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
over and over so again we want to take

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.090 
over and over so again we want to take
really<00:04:28.610> good<00:04:28.760> care<00:04:28.820> of<00:04:29.090> our<00:04:29.389> water<00:04:30.100> because

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
really good care of our water because

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.800 
really good care of our water because
we're<00:04:31.370> going<00:04:31.550> to<00:04:31.610> use<00:04:31.669> it<00:04:31.910> again<00:04:32.150> specifically

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
we're going to use it again specifically

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.379 
we're going to use it again specifically
for<00:04:33.139> us<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.590> for<00:04:33.740> our<00:04:33.800> plants<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.490> we<00:04:35.090> found

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
for us and for our plants and we found

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.840 
for us and for our plants and we found
that<00:04:35.810> although<00:04:36.229> we<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.889> by<00:04:37.100> city<00:04:37.550> water

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
that although we can by city water

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.170 
that although we can by city water
obviously<00:04:38.240> is<00:04:38.750> expensive<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.729> fact<00:04:41.000> that

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
obviously is expensive but the fact that

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.990 
obviously is expensive but the fact that
we<00:04:41.450> can<00:04:41.660> use<00:04:41.900> lake<00:04:42.320> water<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:43.100> even<00:04:43.790> more

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
we can use lake water is even more

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.020 
we can use lake water is even more
beneficial<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:45.050> our<00:04:45.080> plants<00:04:45.770> we<00:04:46.550> have<00:04:46.700> fish<00:04:47.000> in

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
beneficial to our plants we have fish in

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.590 
beneficial to our plants we have fish in
the<00:04:47.330> pond<00:04:47.570> and<00:04:47.870> they<00:04:47.990> make<00:04:48.260> some<00:04:48.500> nitrogen

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
the pond and they make some nitrogen

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.100 
the pond and they make some nitrogen
there's<00:04:50.600> other<00:04:51.160> bacteria<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:53.660> are<00:04:53.870> in<00:04:54.020> the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
there's other bacteria that are in the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.080 
there's other bacteria that are in the
pond<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:54.620> they're<00:04:54.770> all<00:04:54.889> beneficial<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.970> the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
pond and they're all beneficial to the

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.659 
pond and they're all beneficial to the
plant<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:56.770> that's<00:04:57.770> all<00:04:57.979> I've<00:04:58.130> got<00:04:58.160> for<00:04:58.370> you
