00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
leaked to the previous tumbles there you

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.970 
leaked to the previous tumbles there you
know<00:01:58.510> bit<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> master<00:01:59.140> of<00:01:59.200> disguise<00:01:59.290> but<00:01:59.950> I

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
know bit of a master of disguise but I

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.440 
know bit of a master of disguise but I
don't<00:02:00.190> think<00:02:00.370> these<00:02:00.490> judges<00:02:00.790> will<00:02:01.120> be<00:02:01.240> fooled

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
don't think these judges will be fooled

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.990 
don't think these judges will be fooled
Chris<00:02:01.810> no<00:02:02.710> but<00:02:02.950> they<00:02:03.100> did<00:02:03.130> they<00:02:03.460> all<00:02:03.670> saying

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
Chris no but they did they all saying

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.480 
Chris no but they did they all saying
that<00:02:04.300> if<00:02:04.450> you<00:02:04.600> dance<00:02:04.930> out<00:02:05.350> of<00:02:05.650> the<00:02:05.830> tumble<00:02:06.220> you

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
that if you dance out of the tumble you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.280 
that if you dance out of the tumble you
know<00:02:06.820> her<00:02:06.970> opening<00:02:07.330> tumble<00:02:07.690> as<00:02:08.050> she

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
know her opening tumble as she

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.260 
know her opening tumble as she
landed<00:02:08.710> she's<00:02:08.950> jumped<00:02:09.310> straight<00:02:09.580> into<00:02:10.060> a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
landed she's jumped straight into a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.640 
landed she's jumped straight into a
legal<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:10.959> therefore<00:02:11.380> there's<00:02:11.590> no

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
legal and therefore there's no

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.180 
legal and therefore there's no
deductions<00:02:12.550> for<00:02:12.910> a<00:02:13.090> bad<00:02:13.300> landing<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:14.190> yes

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
deductions for a bad landing and yes

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.140 
deductions for a bad landing and yes
she's<00:02:15.459> cleverly<00:02:16.060> doing<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.910> there

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
she's cleverly doing that not there

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.510 
she's cleverly doing that not there
though<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:20.080> was<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> definite<00:02:20.800> step<00:02:21.040> out<00:02:21.280> and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
though that was a definite step out and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.660 
though that was a definite step out and
we<00:02:22.030> said<00:02:22.209> yesterday<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:23.200> step<00:02:23.590> back<00:02:24.010> is<00:02:24.280> wider

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
we said yesterday the step back is wider

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.150 
we said yesterday the step back is wider
than<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.150> gymnast<00:02:25.540> shoulders<00:02:26.080> it's<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.830> point

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
than the gymnast shoulders it's a point

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.699 
than the gymnast shoulders it's a point
three<00:02:27.459> deduction<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.090> medium<00:02:28.570> deduction<00:02:29.170> so<00:02:29.680> I

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
three deduction a medium deduction so I

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.720 
three deduction a medium deduction so I
think<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.280> definitely<00:02:30.310> was<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.150> of<00:02:31.270> those

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
think that definitely was one of those

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.210 
think that definitely was one of those
but<00:02:33.730> this<00:02:33.910> was<00:02:34.180> much<00:02:34.450> much<00:02:34.690> cleaner<00:02:35.070> just<00:02:36.070> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
but this was much much cleaner just a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.180 
but this was much much cleaner just a
tiny<00:02:36.459> hop<00:02:36.790> forward<00:02:37.090> a<00:02:37.480> very<00:02:38.230> small<00:02:38.590> deduction

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
tiny hop forward a very small deduction

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.060 
tiny hop forward a very small deduction
just<00:02:39.430> point<00:02:39.670> one<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:41.590> she's<00:02:41.770> in<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.950> very

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
just point one but she's in a very

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.530 
just point one but she's in a very
strong<00:02:42.459> second<00:02:42.910> half<00:02:42.940> of<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:43.209> competition

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
strong second half of the competition

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.130 
strong second half of the competition
isn't<00:02:43.959> she<00:02:44.940> actually<00:02:45.940> competing<00:02:46.570> with<00:02:46.720> them

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
isn't she actually competing with them

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.870 
isn't she actually competing with them
