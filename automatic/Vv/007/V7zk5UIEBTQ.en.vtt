 I will explain how to solve the problem 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.749
 of the windows 7 installation 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:26.570

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:30.019
 driver missing in the cd dvd drive 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 well I did quaest only for 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:36.210
 because all the forums 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.890
 I saw myself explaining that for the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.600
 super problem it was enough to load the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.550
 in the operating system well no to me does not have 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.290

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.530
 proceeding one hundred per cent 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.420
 one hundred 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.760

 you have to click on download pam and then 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.609
 the installation is very simple enough 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.359
 always do next next next because it is 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:27.140
