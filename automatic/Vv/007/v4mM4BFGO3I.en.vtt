00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 

the<00:01:04.949> excavator<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.760> was<00:01:06.000> he<00:01:06.210> put<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> stick

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the excavator did was he put a stick

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.960 
the excavator did was he put a stick
here<00:01:07.050> the<00:01:07.619> stakes<00:01:07.979> marking<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.670> end<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
here the stakes marking the end of the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.540 
here the stakes marking the end of the
footer<00:01:09.240> pipe<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.840> now<00:01:09.990> eventually<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.280> drain

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
footer pipe for now eventually the drain

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.430 
footer pipe for now eventually the drain
will<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.850> extended<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.300> down<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:13.110> yard<00:01:13.259> a

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
will be extended to down the yard a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.520 
will be extended to down the yard a
little<00:01:13.680> farther<00:01:13.950> but<00:01:15.170> during<00:01:16.170> construction

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
little farther but during construction

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.130 
little farther but during construction
are<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.369> framing<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.940> they<00:01:18.540> often<00:01:18.750> drive

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
are the framing and they often drive

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.320 
are the framing and they often drive
Pettibone<00:01:19.770> which<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> large<00:01:20.460> forklifts<00:01:21.210> they

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Pettibone which is large forklifts they

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
Pettibone which is large forklifts they
people<00:01:21.720> flip<00:01:22.020> back<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> forth<00:01:23.039> here<00:01:23.550> and<00:01:23.820> we

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
people flip back and forth here and we

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
people flip back and forth here and we
don't<00:01:24.090> want<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.390> have<00:01:24.539> the<00:01:24.810> possibility<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
don't want to have the possibility of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:02:20.319 
don't want to have the possibility of
light<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.100> crushed<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.820> will<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:29.060> back<00:01:30.060> here

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.610 

so<00:02:21.329> here<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.690> don't<00:02:21.870> need<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.110> worry<00:02:22.290> about<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
so here we don't need to worry about the

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.319 
so here we don't need to worry about the
water<00:02:22.799> draining<00:02:23.250> into<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.670> we<00:02:23.880> need<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.150> have

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
water draining into here we need to have

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:24.800 
water draining into here we need to have
a<00:02:24.360> setup

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
a setup

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.470 
a setup
your<00:02:25.709> radon<00:02:26.070> plate<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:27.000> we<00:02:27.150> still<00:02:27.329> get

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
your radon plate we can see we still get

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.660 
your radon plate we can see we still get
out<00:02:27.600> of<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.810> stone<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.140> little<00:02:28.320> bit<00:02:28.680> when<00:02:29.489> it's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
out of the stone a little bit when it's

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.880 
out of the stone a little bit when it's
a<00:02:29.820> perforated<00:02:30.510> pipe<00:02:30.750> with<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.110> holes<00:02:31.320> facing

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
a perforated pipe with the holes facing

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.699 
a perforated pipe with the holes facing
down<00:02:32.070> and<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.489> cap<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.060> end<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.720> then<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.440> in

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
down and a cap on the end and then if in

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.650 
down and a cap on the end and then if in
the<00:02:34.799> future<00:02:35.010> Pennsylvania<00:02:36.000> especially<00:02:36.540> is

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
the future Pennsylvania especially is

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.289 
the future Pennsylvania especially is
well<00:02:36.870> known<00:02:37.079> for<00:02:37.410> having<00:02:37.860> radon<00:02:38.430> gas<00:02:38.459> pockets

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
well known for having radon gas pockets

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.180 
well known for having radon gas pockets
so<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:40.079> would<00:02:40.230> test<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.829> if<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.040> have<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
so you would test to see if you have a

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.920 
so you would test to see if you have a
radon<00:02:41.610> issue<00:02:41.850> or<00:02:42.090> not<00:02:42.269> every<00:02:42.540> house<00:02:42.720> is

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
radon issue or not every house is

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.810 
radon issue or not every house is
different<00:02:42.959> and<00:02:43.590> if<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.070> would<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:44.579> put<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
different and if you would you can put a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.360 
different and if you would you can put a
pipe<00:02:45.060> right<00:02:45.329> into<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.690> tank<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.040> fan

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
pipe right into this tank and with a fan

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.110 
pipe right into this tank and with a fan
ventilating<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.090> after<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> roof

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
ventilating it after the roof

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.960 
ventilating it after the roof
this<00:02:49.540> pipe<00:02:50.340> prevents<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:51.459> from<00:02:51.489> having<00:02:51.819> to

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
this pipe prevents you from having to

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:29.190 
this pipe prevents you from having to
cut<00:02:52.180> your<00:02:53.879> so<00:03:27.840> obviously<00:03:28.840> we're<00:03:29.019> going<00:03:29.110> to

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
cut your so obviously we're going to

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.289 
cut your so obviously we're going to
begin<00:03:29.349> framing<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.519> we'll<00:03:30.730> come<00:03:30.910> back<00:03:31.090> if

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
begin framing and we'll come back if

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:32.580 
begin framing and we'll come back if
you're<00:03:31.420> going<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.599> show<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.870> going<00:03:32.110> forward

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
you're going to show you going forward

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.430 
you're going to show you going forward
