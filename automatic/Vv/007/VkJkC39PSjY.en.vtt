year we added the new Passat which was
specifically<00:00:27.390> designed<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.080> market

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
specifically designed for this market

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
specifically designed for this market
and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> beetle<00:00:29.720> really<00:00:30.720> the

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and then and the beetle really the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.680 
and then and the beetle really the
third-generation<00:00:31.610> beetle<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:33.090> its<00:00:33.300> history

third-generation beetle in its history

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.260 
third-generation beetle in its history
and<00:00:33.960> so<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> has<00:00:35.610> really

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
and so all of that has really

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
and so all of that has really
contributed<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.840> think<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.110> marketing<00:00:37.500> has

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
contributed I think the marketing has

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.380 
contributed I think the marketing has
been<00:00:37.649> pretty<00:00:37.890> smart<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> top<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.760> it<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.210> you've

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
been pretty smart on top of it so you've

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
been pretty smart on top of it so you've
got<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> product<00:00:39.899> obviously<00:00:40.469> but<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> said

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
got the product obviously but you said

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
got the product obviously but you said
that<00:00:41.129> really<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.610> know<00:00:41.730> you've<00:00:41.879> done<00:00:41.910> some

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
that really you know you've done some

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.549 
that really you know you've done some
really<00:00:42.360> innovative<00:00:42.570> things<00:00:42.809> with<00:00:43.110> marketing

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
really innovative things with marketing

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.260 
really innovative things with marketing
talk<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:44.070> bit<00:00:44.219> about<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.760> why<00:00:44.969> has

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
talk a little bit about that and why has

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.470 
talk a little bit about that and why has
that<00:00:45.420> been<00:00:45.480> driving<00:00:46.850> or<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.090> extent<00:00:48.360> has

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that been driving or to what extent has

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
that been driving or to what extent has
that<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:48.750> driving<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.230> really<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.219> mean<00:00:50.370> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that been driving this really I mean I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.510 
that been driving this really I mean I
think<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> couple<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> things<00:00:52.250> when<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.370> look

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
think a couple of things when you look

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
think a couple of things when you look
at<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> VW<00:00:54.510> advertising<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.109> VW

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.069 
at the at the VW advertising the VW
communications<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:57.300> tell<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.719> simple

communications we tell very simple

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.009

stories and we talk about human stories

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.009 
stories and we talk about human stories
told<00:01:01.230> simply<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.149> messaging<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> not

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
told simply and so the messaging is not

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.350 
told simply and so the messaging is not
overly<00:01:04.379> hyperbolic<00:01:05.190> it's<00:01:05.370> not<00:01:05.580> sort<00:01:06.270> of

extent we were gonna make Darth Vader

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080 
extent we were gonna make Darth Vader
too<00:01:51.900> so<00:01:52.260> we<00:01:52.410> started<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:53.190> the<00:01:53.310> dogs<00:01:53.520> barking

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.360 
too so we started with the dogs barking
the<00:01:54.840> Imperial<00:01:55.260> March<00:01:55.440> and

way your target consumer I think the way

way your target consumer I think the way
the<00:03:16.970> consumer<00:03:17.970> today<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.239> consuming<00:03:18.930> media<00:03:19.110> is

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the consumer today is consuming media is

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.040 
the consumer today is consuming media is
is<00:03:20.340> quite<00:03:20.580> different<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.209> mean<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.540> advent<00:03:21.930> of

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
is quite different I mean the advent of

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.050 
is quite different I mean the advent of
mobile<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.770> the<00:03:23.220> access<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.820> information

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
mobile and the access to information

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.620 
mobile and the access to information
really<00:03:24.950> allows<00:03:25.950> us<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.370> think<00:03:26.610> beyond<00:03:27.450> just

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
really allows us to think beyond just

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.720 
really allows us to think beyond just
the<00:03:28.170> TV<00:03:28.530> screen<00:03:28.950> we<00:03:29.160> did<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.400> think<00:03:29.459> an

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
the TV screen we did I think an

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.180 
the TV screen we did I think an
interesting<00:03:30.510> integration<00:03:31.380> last<00:03:31.650> year<00:03:32.040> when

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
interesting integration last year when

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.280 
interesting integration last year when
the<00:03:32.280> beetle<00:03:32.580> was<00:03:32.700> launched<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.750> mean<00:03:34.170> what

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
the beetle was launched so I mean what

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.570 
the beetle was launched so I mean what
do<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.380> say<00:03:34.590> about<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.950> beetle<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.370> it's

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
do you say about the beetle it's it's

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.910 
do you say about the beetle it's it's
it's<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:36.090> it's<00:03:36.239> an<00:03:36.420> iconic<00:03:36.780> model<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.770> we

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
it's it's it's an iconic model and so we

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.009 
it's it's it's an iconic model and so we
we<00:03:38.430> launched<00:03:38.910> with<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.330> theme<00:03:39.600> it's<00:03:39.840> back

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
we launched with this theme it's back

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.530 
we launched with this theme it's back
and<00:03:40.430> there<00:03:41.430> was<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.550> spot<00:03:41.790> called<00:03:42.030> high<00:03:42.269> five

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
and there was a spot called high five

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.840 
and there was a spot called high five

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
shot here in New York with the vehicle

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.280 
shot here in New York with the vehicle
kind<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.150> running<00:03:45.420> through<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.660> streets<00:03:45.900> but

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
kind of running through the streets but

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.900 
kind of running through the streets but
there<00:03:46.410> were<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> variety<00:03:46.739> of<00:03:47.190> integrations<00:03:47.790> and

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
there were a variety of integrations and

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.550 
there were a variety of integrations and
one<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> biggest<00:03:48.720> changes<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.440> the

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
one of the biggest changes to the

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.070 
one of the biggest changes to the
physical<00:03:49.830> product<00:03:50.400> was<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.810> slight

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
physical product was the the slight

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.500 
physical product was the the slight
shape<00:03:52.410> it<00:03:52.650> had<00:03:52.800> gone<00:03:52.980> more<00:03:53.340> back<00:03:53.580> or<00:03:54.239> back<00:03:54.450> to

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
shape it had gone more back or back to

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.449 
shape it had gone more back or back to
kind<00:03:54.959> of<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.170> original<00:03:55.200> kind<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.070> bit<00:03:56.250> more

kind of the original kind of a bit more

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.660 
kind of the original kind of a bit more
to<00:03:56.670> the<00:03:56.790> first-generation<00:03:57.330> beetle<00:03:58.550> so<00:03:59.550> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
to the first-generation beetle so the

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.400 
to the first-generation beetle so the
headline<00:03:59.970> was<00:04:00.090> profile<00:04:00.600> update<00:04:01.019> now<00:04:01.260> that

important new advertising I mean what
we've<00:04:37.120> done<00:04:37.300> we<00:04:37.900> started<00:04:38.200> this<00:04:38.290> process<00:04:38.500> when

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
we've done we started this process when

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.830 
we've done we started this process when
I<00:04:38.920> arrived<00:04:39.160> last<00:04:39.340> year<00:04:39.670> of<00:04:39.760> planning<00:04:40.450> out<00:04:40.600> our

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
I arrived last year of planning out our

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.070 
I arrived last year of planning out our
messaging<00:04:41.740> over<00:04:41.950> 24<00:04:42.670> months<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:43.750> we<00:04:43.870> sit

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
messaging over 24 months and so we sit

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.660 
messaging over 24 months and so we sit
down<00:04:44.260> mid<00:04:44.530> year<00:04:44.740> we're<00:04:45.130> actually<00:04:45.280> getting

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
down mid year we're actually getting

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.350 
down mid year we're actually getting
ready<00:04:45.790> to<00:04:45.910> kick<00:04:46.240> that<00:04:46.480> off<00:04:46.510> now<00:04:47.050> our<00:04:47.770> plans<00:04:48.100> are

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
ready to kick that off now our plans are

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.400 
ready to kick that off now our plans are
fundamentally<00:04:49.360> locked<00:04:49.600> for<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.930> end<00:04:50.140> of<00:04:50.290> the

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
fundamentally locked for the end of the

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.500 
fundamentally locked for the end of the
year<00:04:50.650> and<00:04:51.460> then<00:04:51.670> we'll<00:04:51.790> take<00:04:51.970> a<00:04:52.030> look<00:04:52.300> at<00:04:52.390> the

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:52.510 
year and then we'll take a look at the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.480 
year and then we'll take a look at the
entire<00:04:52.780> next<00:04:53.170> year<00:04:53.410> calendar<00:04:53.860> year<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.130> then

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
entire next year calendar year and then

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.460 
entire next year calendar year and then
as<00:04:54.640> often<00:04:54.910> happens<00:04:55.330> it<00:04:55.510> crashes<00:04:55.990> down<00:04:56.170> to<00:04:56.380> the

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
as often happens it crashes down to the

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.770 
as often happens it crashes down to the
end<00:04:56.620> of<00:04:56.830> January<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.640> December<00:04:57.820> 31st<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:58.660> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
end of January to December 31st and and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.120 
end of January to December 31st and and
so<00:04:59.260> then<00:04:59.410> you<00:04:59.470> really<00:04:59.500> need<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.890> think<00:05:00.010> about

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
so then you really need to think about

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.440 
so then you really need to think about
what's<00:05:00.400> gonna<00:05:00.490> happen<00:05:00.580> in<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.000> front<00:05:01.240> of<00:05:01.360> the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
what's gonna happen in the front of the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.030 
what's gonna happen in the front of the
next<00:05:01.690> year<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:01.900> that's<00:05:02.050> why<00:05:02.200> we<00:05:02.350> have<00:05:02.470> a<00:05:02.500> 24

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
next year so that's why we have a 24

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.770 
next year so that's why we have a 24
month<00:05:03.190> planning<00:05:03.970> horizon<00:05:04.390> with<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.510> heavy

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
month planning horizon with a heavy

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.470 
month planning horizon with a heavy
emphasis<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.470> what<00:05:05.590> happens<00:05:05.920> next<00:05:06.160> year<00:05:06.480> we

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
emphasis on what happens next year we

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.670 
emphasis on what happens next year we
have<00:05:07.630> some<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.870> think<00:05:08.050> interesting<00:05:08.260> stuff

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
have some I think interesting stuff

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.190 
have some I think interesting stuff
that'll<00:05:08.920> come<00:05:09.420> towards<00:05:10.420> the<00:05:10.540> fall<00:05:10.750> around<00:05:11.080> the

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
that'll come towards the fall around the
