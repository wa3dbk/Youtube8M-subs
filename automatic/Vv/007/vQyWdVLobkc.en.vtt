00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
camera location unfortunately as it

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.709 
camera location unfortunately as it
stands<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.250> gameplay<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> quite<00:00:45.480> awkward

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
stands the gameplay is quite awkward

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.080 
stands the gameplay is quite awkward
when<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.590> done<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.430> who<00:00:47.579> knows<00:00:47.760> what

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
when this is done but who knows what

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.790 
when this is done but who knows what
improvements<00:00:48.450> could<00:00:48.840> be<00:00:48.899> made<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> future

improvements could be made in the future

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
improvements could be made in the future
so<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.550> concept<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.270> think<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so in concept I think this is a

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.750 
so in concept I think this is a
fantastic<00:00:52.320> idea<00:00:52.710> being<00:00:53.250> able<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> play

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
fantastic idea being able to play

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.369 
fantastic idea being able to play
through<00:00:53.969> dark<00:00:54.239> souls<00:00:54.449> from<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> first<00:00:55.020> person

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
through dark souls from the first person

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.380 
through dark souls from the first person
perspective<00:00:55.530> would<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> huge<00:00:56.940> challenge

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
perspective would be a huge challenge

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.290 
perspective would be a huge challenge
and<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.930> lot<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.199> fun<00:00:59.149> unfortunately<00:01:00.149> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and a lot of fun unfortunately in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
and a lot of fun unfortunately in
execution<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.079> looks<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> plays<00:01:02.129> like

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
execution this looks and plays like

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.549 
execution this looks and plays like
total<00:01:02.879> garbage<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:03.719> I've<00:01:03.840> seen<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.379> the
