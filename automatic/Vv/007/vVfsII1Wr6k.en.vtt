these<00:00:32.099> guys<00:00:32.309> were<00:00:32.489> all<00:00:32.669> imitating<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.329> same

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600

these guys were all imitating the same
blues<00:00:33.870> sound<00:00:34.110> so<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:34.620> get<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> same<00:00:35.250> rhythm

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
blues sound so you get the same rhythm

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
blues sound so you get the same rhythm
and<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.090> infectious<00:00:36.600> shuffle<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.710> to

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and this infectious shuffle I like to

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.369 
and this infectious shuffle I like to
think<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.100> playing<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.879> shuffle<00:00:39.210> rhythm

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 
think about playing the shuffle rhythm

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.680 
think about playing the shuffle rhythm
like<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.440> drummer<00:00:40.770> plays<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.070> ride<00:00:41.370> cymbal<00:00:41.690> we

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
like a drummer plays a ride cymbal we

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.049 
like a drummer plays a ride cymbal we
have<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> quarter<00:00:43.379> note<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> then<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.879> have

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have the quarter note and then we have

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
have the quarter note and then we have
the<00:00:45.210> pickup<00:00:45.539> beat<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.530> hear<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> pickup

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
the pickup beat but we hear the pickup

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.819 
the pickup beat but we hear the pickup
beat<00:00:47.340> as<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:48.300> sort<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> kick<00:00:49.020> off<00:00:49.200> into<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.590> next

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
beat as a sort of kick off into the next

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.830 
beat as a sort of kick off into the next
quarter<00:00:50.100> note<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.180> instead<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.570> thinking

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
quarter note so instead of thinking

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.209 
quarter note so instead of thinking
about<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:53.390> triple<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.629> triple<00:00:54.870> n<00:00:55.469> triple<00:00:55.920> n

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
about it like triple a triple n triple n

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.270 
about it like triple a triple n triple n
triple<00:00:56.640> n<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.329> stopping<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.199> each<00:00:58.350> time<00:00:58.620> we

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
triple n but stopping them each time we

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.090 
triple n but stopping them each time we
think<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.379> let<00:01:01.379> triple<00:01:01.859> let

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
think about it as like let triple let

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
think about it as like let triple let
triple<00:01:02.579> let<00:01:02.820> triple<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:04.170> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
triple let triple and that that that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
triple let triple and that that that
last<00:01:05.040> eighth<00:01:05.369> note<00:01:05.670> pushes<00:01:06.180> into<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> next

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
last eighth note pushes into the next

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.660 
last eighth note pushes into the next
quarter<00:01:06.960> note<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> idea<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.549> can

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
quarter note so the idea is that you can

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.469 
quarter note so the idea is that you can
play<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.840> down<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.470> pentatonic<00:01:11.430> escale<00:01:12.240> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
play maybe down a pentatonic escale and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.510 
play maybe down a pentatonic escale and
you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.930> play<00:01:19.189> something<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
you can play something like that

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.910 
you can play something like that
something<00:01:20.880> as<00:01:20.970> simple<00:01:21.119> as<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:22.770> used

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
something as simple as that to get used

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
something as simple as that to get used
to<00:01:23.040> playing<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> sound<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.360> trick<00:01:24.689> is

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
to playing that sound now the trick is

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
to playing that sound now the trick is
as<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.619> bass<00:01:25.920> player<00:01:26.040> sometimes<00:01:26.520> we'll<00:01:26.909> only<00:01:27.180> be

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
as a bass player sometimes we'll only be

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.120 
as a bass player sometimes we'll only be
playing<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> quarter<00:01:28.140> note<00:01:28.350> maybe<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
playing the quarter note maybe it's the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
playing the quarter note maybe it's the
drummer's<00:01:29.520> job<00:01:29.729> or<00:01:30.000> maybe<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> job<00:01:30.720> of

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
drummer's job or maybe it's the job of

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
drummer's job or maybe it's the job of
the<00:01:31.020> guitar<00:01:31.350> player<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:31.890> someone<00:01:32.520> else<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the guitar player or someone else to

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090 
the guitar player or someone else to
really<00:01:33.150> be<00:01:33.270> playing<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.200> push

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
really be playing a lot of those push

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
really be playing a lot of those push
ups<00:01:35.310> into<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.610> next<00:01:35.850> beat<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.140> trick<00:01:37.290> is

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
ups into the next beat so one trick is

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.890 
ups into the next beat so one trick is
to<00:01:37.530> even<00:01:38.070> heat<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.210> audible<00:01:39.570> even

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
to even heat have that be audible even

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
to even heat have that be audible even
you<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.439> shuffle<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:40.890> audible<00:01:41.340> when

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
you have the shuffle be audible when

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.750 
you have the shuffle be audible when
you're<00:01:42.270> playing<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:43.020> quarter<00:01:43.439> notes

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.190 

you<00:01:49.760> really<00:01:50.030> need<00:01:50.180> to<00:01:50.270> have<00:01:50.360> internalized<00:01:50.990> the

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
you really need to have internalized the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.630 
you really need to have internalized the
beat<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:51.860> really<00:01:52.100> need<00:01:52.250> to<00:01:52.340> be<00:01:52.430> able<00:01:52.520> to

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
beat and you really need to be able to

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.060 
beat and you really need to be able to
feel<00:01:52.880> the<00:01:53.000> shuffle<00:01:53.360> deep<00:01:53.780> inside<00:01:53.960> once<00:01:54.950> you

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
feel the shuffle deep inside once you

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.130 
feel the shuffle deep inside once you
have<00:01:55.250> that<00:01:55.430> internalized<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.660> can<00:01:56.810> hear<00:01:57.020> it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
have that internalized you can hear it

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.600 
have that internalized you can hear it
even<00:01:57.290> if<00:01:57.500> you're<00:01:57.620> not<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:57.920> subdividing

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
even if you're not really subdividing

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:13.600 
even if you're not really subdividing
the<00:01:58.640> beat<00:01:58.729> as<00:01:58.970> a<00:01:59.000> shuffle<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:13.459> how<00:02:13.550> you

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the beat as a shuffle and that's how you
