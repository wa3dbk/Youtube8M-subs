our<00:00:05.160> bodybuilders<00:00:05.790> week<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.600> something

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
our bodybuilders week that is something

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.020 
our bodybuilders week that is something
I<00:00:07.080> get<00:00:07.350> to<00:00:07.500> hear<00:00:07.830> from<00:00:07.859> time<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.000> time

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
I get to hear from time to time

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.660 
I get to hear from time to time
especially<00:00:09.570> from<00:00:10.290> power<00:00:10.590> lifters<00:00:11.100> who

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
especially from power lifters who

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.720 
especially from power lifters who
believe<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.349> bodybuilders<00:00:13.349> only<00:00:14.040> train<00:00:14.340> for

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
believe that bodybuilders only train for

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.150 
believe that bodybuilders only train for
size<00:00:15.000> but<00:00:15.030> behind<00:00:15.719> that<00:00:15.900> size<00:00:16.349> there<00:00:16.920> is

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
size but behind that size there is

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.660 
size but behind that size there is
little<00:00:17.670> real<00:00:18.540> strength<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.130> tackle<00:00:20.490> this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
little real strength and to tackle this

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.060 
little real strength and to tackle this
subject<00:00:21.240> I<00:00:21.330> give<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.779> two<00:00:22.080> bullet<00:00:22.470> points<00:00:22.500> to

subject I give you two bullet points to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.179 
subject I give you two bullet points to

6 to 12 rep range your muscles store a
bit<00:00:44.010> more<00:00:44.489> liquid<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.480> makes<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.050> muscles

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
bit more liquid that makes the muscles

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.700 
bit more liquid that makes the muscles
look<00:00:46.559> bigger<00:00:47.070> without<00:00:47.719> them<00:00:48.719> having<00:00:49.200> gained

look bigger without them having gained

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.020 
look bigger without them having gained
more<00:00:50.399> strength

but<00:00:56.690> mutter<00:00:57.020> powerlifters<00:00:57.680> like<00:00:57.920> to<00:00:58.129> forget

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
but mutter powerlifters like to forget

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.689 
but mutter powerlifters like to forget
is<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.840> muscle<00:01:00.140> fiber<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:01.010> is<00:01:01.070> where<00:01:01.370> the

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
is that a muscle fiber that is where the

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.660 
is that a muscle fiber that is where the
liquid<00:01:02.030> gets<00:01:02.180> stored<00:01:02.539> can<00:01:03.140> only<00:01:03.320> take<00:01:03.680> up<00:01:04.190> that

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
liquid gets stored can only take up that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.510 
liquid gets stored can only take up that
much<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.180> that<00:01:05.210> liquid<00:01:05.780> before<00:01:06.229> it<00:01:06.830> has<00:01:07.340> to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
much of that liquid before it has to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.149 
much of that liquid before it has to
become<00:01:07.909> bigger<00:01:08.390> so<00:01:08.990> when<00:01:09.560> a<00:01:09.590> bodybuilder

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
become bigger so when a bodybuilder

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.820 
become bigger so when a bodybuilder
trains<00:01:10.490> he<00:01:10.940> gains<00:01:11.210> real<00:01:11.750> strength<00:01:12.229> the

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
trains he gains real strength the

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.060 
trains he gains real strength the
strength<00:01:14.110> happens<00:01:15.110> because<00:01:15.320> his<00:01:15.710> muscle

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
strength happens because his muscle

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.399 
strength happens because his muscle
fibers<00:01:16.399> become<00:01:16.580> larger<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:17.300> larger<00:01:17.409> muscle

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
fibers become larger and larger muscle

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.730 
fibers become larger and larger muscle
fibers<00:01:18.799> can<00:01:19.190> then<00:01:19.399> again<00:01:19.850> store<00:01:20.450> more<00:01:21.020> liquid

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
fibers can then again store more liquid

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.940 
fibers can then again store more liquid
only<00:01:22.340> a<00:01:22.369> fraction<00:01:22.880> of<00:01:23.240> his<00:01:23.810> arm<00:01:24.110> or<00:01:24.500> leg<00:01:24.710> or

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
only a fraction of his arm or leg or

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.900 
only a fraction of his arm or leg or
chest<00:01:25.220> size<00:01:25.490> or<00:01:25.790> whatever<00:01:26.000> is<00:01:26.479> down<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.799> him

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
chest size or whatever is down to him

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.650 
chest size or whatever is down to him
storing<00:01:29.660> more<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.649> the<00:01:30.860> useless<00:01:31.369> fluid<00:01:32.000> inside

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
storing more of the useless fluid inside

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.170 
storing more of the useless fluid inside
his<00:01:32.899> muscles

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.660 

I<00:01:38.270> hope<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:39.350> clear<00:01:39.680> there's<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:40.040> bit<00:01:40.400> but

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
I hope that this clear there's a bit but

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.370 
I hope that this clear there's a bit but
of<00:01:40.850> course<00:01:41.150> I<00:01:41.300> don't<00:01:41.660> doubt<00:01:41.870> that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
of course I don't doubt that

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.460 
of course I don't doubt that
