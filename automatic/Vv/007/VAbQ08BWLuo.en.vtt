00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
really intense at the end but it was a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.370 
really intense at the end but it was a
lot<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.170> fun<00:00:28.260> actually<00:00:29.000> the<00:00:30.000> xm25<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.960> really

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
lot of fun actually the xm25 is a really

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
lot of fun actually the xm25 is a really
weird<00:00:31.560> gun<00:00:31.859> especially<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:32.850> looking<00:00:33.270> i

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
weird gun especially we're looking i

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.150 
weird gun especially we're looking i
mean<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.660> fucking<00:00:33.989> scope<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.590> bigger<00:00:34.980> than

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
mean that fucking scope is bigger than

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.180 
mean that fucking scope is bigger than
the<00:00:35.309> gun<00:00:35.489> itself<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.960> using<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> scope<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the gun itself but using the scope is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
the gun itself but using the scope is
actually<00:00:38.489> pretty<00:00:38.640> cool<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.750> unique

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
actually pretty cool it's a very unique

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.660 
actually pretty cool it's a very unique
scope<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.829> think<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.250> might<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.610> only

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
scope it's I think it might be the only

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
scope it's I think it might be the only
one<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.120> full<00:00:42.300> screen<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> game<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one that's full screen in the game it

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.959 
one that's full screen in the game it
might<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:43.950> be<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.340> only<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.730> that<00:00:44.850> has

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
might actually be the only one that has

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
might actually be the only one that has
full<00:00:45.180> screen<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:46.200> really<00:00:46.410> cool<00:00:46.590> i'm

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
full screen and it's really cool i'm

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.680 
full screen and it's really cool i'm
using<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> scope<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> actually<00:00:48.510> really

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
using the scope is actually really

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.880 
using the scope is actually really
really<00:00:48.840> helpful<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.350> you're<00:00:49.379> getting<00:00:49.559> kills

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
really helpful when you're getting kills

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.680 
really helpful when you're getting kills
with<00:00:50.010> this<00:00:50.160> gun<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.300> makes<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.570> lot

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
with this gun because it makes a lot

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.299 
with this gun because it makes a lot
more<00:00:51.750> accurate<00:00:52.320> because<00:00:52.649> when<00:00:53.070> you're<00:00:53.190> not

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
more accurate because when you're not

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.220 
more accurate because when you're not
using<00:00:53.489> scope<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:54.090> hip<00:00:54.239> firing<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
using scope your hip firing this is a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470 
using scope your hip firing this is a
shitload<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> recoil<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.850> not<00:00:57.449> very

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
shitload of recoil and it's not very

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.630 
shitload of recoil and it's not very
predictable<00:00:58.199> where<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> bullets

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
predictable where the where the bullets

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
predictable where the where the bullets
going<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.879> go<00:01:00.000> from<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> long<00:01:00.510> distance<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.559> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
going to go from a long distance so the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.039 
going to go from a long distance so the
scope<00:01:01.859> is<00:01:02.010> definitely<00:01:02.370> helpful<00:01:02.579> i<00:01:02.960> didn't<00:01:03.960> use

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
scope is definitely helpful i didn't use

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.810 
scope is definitely helpful i didn't use
it<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.320> much<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.739> game<00:01:04.949> but<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.729> was

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it that much this game but it was

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
it that much this game but it was
definitely<00:01:06.000> always<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.479> back<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.810> mind

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
definitely always in the back of my mind

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
definitely always in the back of my mind
and<00:01:07.380> i<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.549> pretty<00:01:08.700> accurate<00:01:09.150> kills

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and i got some pretty accurate kills

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
and i got some pretty accurate kills
using<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.750> scope<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> scope<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
using the scope so the scope is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.120 
using the scope so the scope is
definitely<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.220> good<00:01:11.340> thing<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> um<00:01:13.130> just

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
make that much logical sense it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.070

definitely<00:03:47.430> makes<00:03:47.550> sense<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.930> get<00:03:49.050> a

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 
definitely makes sense that if you get a

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.660

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
but I don't understand why it takes

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.020 
but I don't understand why it takes
three<00:03:52.739> hit<00:03:52.950> markers<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.430> kill<00:03:53.580> somebody<00:03:53.820> with

machine<00:06:39.340> take<00:06:39.670> a<00:06:39.700> guess<00:06:39.940> and<00:06:40.180> say<00:06:40.240> okay

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
machine take a guess and say okay

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.890 
machine take a guess and say okay
actually<00:06:40.930> my<00:06:41.200> cat<00:06:41.380> rs16<00:06:42.160> that's<00:06:42.970> I<00:06:43.270> you<00:06:43.870> know

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
actually my cat rs16 that's I you know

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.170 
actually my cat rs16 that's I you know
hmm<00:06:44.470> I<00:06:45.160> don't<00:06:45.400> know<00:06:45.490> the<00:06:45.610> thing<00:06:45.790> about<00:06:45.820> that

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
hmm I don't know the thing about that

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.410 
hmm I don't know the thing about that
the<00:06:46.990> gun<00:06:47.140> is<00:06:47.170> really<00:06:47.530> weak<00:06:47.740> so<00:06:48.550> 16<00:06:49.150> is<00:06:49.270> out<00:06:49.390> a

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:49.420 
the gun is really weak so 16 is out a

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.100 
the gun is really weak so 16 is out a
lot<00:06:49.660> if<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.470> under<00:06:50.680> stronger<00:06:51.040> 16<00:06:51.400> be<00:06:51.580> too<00:06:51.760> much

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
lot if the under stronger 16 be too much

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.270 
lot if the under stronger 16 be too much
but<00:06:53.110> it<00:06:53.290> should<00:06:53.470> definitely<00:06:53.560> have<00:06:53.860> more<00:06:53.950> ammo

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:54.280 
but it should definitely have more ammo

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.820 
but it should definitely have more ammo
and<00:06:54.520> I<00:06:54.880> actually<00:06:55.030> I<00:06:55.270> think<00:06:55.840> I'm<00:06:56.140> scavenger<00:06:56.710> on

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
and I actually I think I'm scavenger on

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.430 
and I actually I think I'm scavenger on
too<00:06:57.070> so<00:06:57.430> on<00:06:57.910> that<00:06:57.970> note<00:06:58.600> I'm<00:06:58.990> gonna<00:06:59.110> guess<00:06:59.410> that

00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 
too so on that note I'm gonna guess that

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.310 
too so on that note I'm gonna guess that
it<00:06:59.770> has<00:06:59.890> eight<00:07:00.160> normally<00:07:00.760> which<00:07:01.510> is<00:07:01.870> way<00:07:02.260> too

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
it has eight normally which is way too

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.650 
it has eight normally which is way too
low<00:07:02.500> and<00:07:03.340> they<00:07:03.520> should<00:07:03.700> probably<00:07:04.000> fix<00:07:04.390> that

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 
low and they should probably fix that

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.710 
low and they should probably fix that
because<00:07:05.200> it's<00:07:05.380> gone<00:07:05.530> is<00:07:05.650> so<00:07:06.070> weak<00:07:06.720> maybe

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:07.720 
because it's gone is so weak maybe

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.990 
because it's gone is so weak maybe
that's<00:07:07.990> 12<00:07:08.260> it<00:07:09.220> would<00:07:09.400> be<00:07:09.520> a<00:07:09.550> little<00:07:09.700> bit<00:07:09.880> too

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 
that's 12 it would be a little bit too

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.840 
that's 12 it would be a little bit too
little<00:07:10.270> I<00:07:10.450> have<00:07:10.750> no<00:07:10.960> idea<00:07:10.990> I<00:07:11.640> don't<00:07:12.640> even<00:07:12.700> know

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850 
little I have no idea I don't even know

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.300
