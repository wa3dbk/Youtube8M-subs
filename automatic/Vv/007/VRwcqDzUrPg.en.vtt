00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.360
 the food trek it is a trend 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:20.570
 gastronomic that is arriving in the streets 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.700
 now of course thinking of trek 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.460
 thinking and in the production kitchen in 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.380
 All this we have to untie is 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.720
 the favorite is that it gives production that people 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.130
 It's here for difference of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.489
 car and a kitchen from a restaurant 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.800
 where you have all the support of cameras 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.160
 refrigerators and a large space of 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.969
 where you can prepare 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.100
 position and release 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.339
 you have logistics and an exchange 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.309
 of the main salon and kitchen functions 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.539
 deputy a stockist and here not on the street 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.399
 we have a little bit of everything 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.769
 in fact the whole day on the street we have 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.530
 They make a change because every place 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.050
 each terrain provides a framework for 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.460
 that we have to take a table sometimes 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.690
 chair and umbrella is the excess of rubbish 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.090
 and we have to have a lot of support 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.509
 great for all of this to work 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.479
 do not you 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.240
 is our car is only a space of 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.450
 product finalization is here enough 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.689
 everything previously sanitized 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.030
 It's the best for us to have a 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.119
 only a termination service that the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.399
 we have different people about the kitchen 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.380
 and the kitchen of a car 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:33.469
 on wheels, the biggest difficulty is the 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.210
 Logistics actually because so it is nothing 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:36.829
 What do you cook inside the car you? 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.600
 can stay inside the car if he 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.740
 not connected to the power so 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780
 You have to worry a lot about the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.729
 temperature of food is with 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.640
 preserving them in a water bath or 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.979
 then coolers when the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.920
 I serve the masses that are already in 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.630
 I use a water bath that I 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.750
 I've already been able to conserve the above food. 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.670
 of 80 degrees nÃ© that also does not exist 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.159
 the proliferation of bacteria is not 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.390
 so the car will give him my car 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.900
 It has a refrigerator has a sink 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.250
 and a stove and a bath then 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.289
 basically this is what i need to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.289
 ride with my car in fortaleza 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.640
 we created olaf depac inspired the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.520
 already happening in southeastern Brazil that 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.959
 is the meeting of adapted cars 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.970
 bicycle in tasmania office for sale 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.950
 of food in the environment as if it were a 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 food court open sky 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.660
 promotes gastronomy as main 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.400
 element of union of the invited public 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.810
 access is free and is within the 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.420
 parking shopping mall 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.950
 there is different is different so the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.630
 preparation of the food because you are 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.910
 directly with the public because you see 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.370
 You produce it, you see. 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.410
 that you take care of all the affection that 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.090
 the food and, moreover, it has to 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.739
 interacting with the public is a 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.170
 very big difference has to make in the 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.690
 time is real happening, see you 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.700
 eating has events that have it already 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.200
 provide generator events major ports 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.010
 die out there that big events 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.870
 postage 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.360
 it already offers a generator for us 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.650
 was a player that we even did a little 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.680
 easier to see the places that people 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.180
 there are people in the street who organize 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.970
 expels an extension of there an obsession 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.310
 but there is a problem that is a 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 rising power is such knife 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.630
 places ends up falling because the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.640
 resistance can not withstand the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 some food terms then there is 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.780
 recommended a freezer generator 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.540
 own each with our car 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.310
 that it works on all terrains 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.590
 We have a generator that does not 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.880
 I work here with a 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.359
 full kitchen 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.590
 I have a freezer plate hood 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.760
 reservoir clean water reservoir 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.019
 of dirty water 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.030
 for us to be totally 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.269
 independently we made our first 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.850
 the trip is the time we got the 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.560
 road and felt how it works is 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.109
 throw of the road to travel arrive 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.060
 different place and it was so 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.019
 now we are super in love with you 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.019
 Do you want to get like this?
