00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
just being awesome for Southampton and

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
just being awesome for Southampton and
Liverpool<00:02:06.329> are<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.869> trying<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> get<00:02:07.740> him

which<00:02:08.399> would<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.849> pretty<00:02:09.090> good<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.479> them<00:02:09.599> I

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
which would be pretty good for them I

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.570 
which would be pretty good for them I
guess<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.080> Lane<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.770> Baynes<00:02:10.950> are<00:02:11.190> left<00:02:11.370> back

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
guess so Lane and Baynes are left back

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.490 
guess so Lane and Baynes are left back
we<00:02:11.790> could<00:02:12.030> use<00:02:12.209> Luke<00:02:12.450> Shaw<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.110> well

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
we could use Luke Shaw here as well

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170 
we could use Luke Shaw here as well
18<00:02:13.740> years<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.040> age<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.250> he's<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.150> a

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.690 
18 years of age and he's going to a
World<00:02:15.480> Cup<00:02:15.690> absolutely<00:02:16.680> ridiculous<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:17.310> fair

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700

of<00:02:19.410> Southampton<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.390> obviously<00:02:21.390> Phil

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
of Southampton and obviously Phil

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.420 
of Southampton and obviously Phil
Jagielka<00:02:21.870> will<00:02:22.470> be<00:02:22.590> one<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.100> starting

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
Jagielka will be one of the starting

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.400 
Jagielka will be one of the starting
center<00:02:23.670> backs<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.120> well<00:02:24.270> as<00:02:24.360> Joe<00:02:24.540> Hart<00:02:24.810> in<00:02:24.990> Gaza

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
at right wing he can actually paint the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.080 
at right wing he can actually paint the
center<00:02:40.530> as<00:02:40.650> well<00:02:40.770> as<00:02:40.830> as<00:02:41.190> he<00:02:41.370> showed<00:02:41.610> Arsenal

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
center as well as as he showed Arsenal

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.790 
center as well as as he showed Arsenal
not<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.300> greatest<00:02:42.630> set<00:02:42.810> but<00:02:43.080> he's<00:02:43.440> better<00:02:43.650> a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
but anyway James Miller left MIT had a

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.880 
but anyway James Miller left MIT had a
bit<00:03:23.580> more<00:03:23.760> pace<00:03:24.030> back<00:03:24.330> then<00:03:24.570> on<00:03:24.690> FIFA<00:03:25.230> Frank

Lampard<00:03:26.370> had<00:03:26.610> insane<00:03:27.360> stats<00:03:27.780> just<00:03:28.160> ridiculous

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
Lampard had insane stats just ridiculous

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.190

obviously<00:03:29.610> he's<00:03:29.790> gone<00:03:30.330> down<00:03:30.600> over<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.959> years

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
obviously he's gone down over the years

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800 
obviously he's gone down over the years
due<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.440> his<00:03:31.709> age<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.100> whatnot<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:33.299> had<00:03:33.450> Wayne

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
due to his age and whatnot we had Wayne

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.120 
due to his age and whatnot we had Wayne
Rooney<00:03:34.200> in<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.470> center

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
Rooney in the center

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.160 
Rooney in the center
he<00:03:35.730> had<00:03:35.820> more<00:03:36.000> pace<00:03:36.209> back<00:03:36.420> then<00:03:36.600> as<00:03:36.720> well<00:03:36.930> Yai's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
he had more pace back then as well Yai's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.110 
he had more pace back then as well Yai's
logic<00:03:37.560> is<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> older<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.250> get<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.519> more<00:03:38.730> pace

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
logic is the older you get the more pace

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.580 
logic is the older you get the more pace
you<00:03:39.299> lose<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.750> anyway<00:03:39.989> Rooney<00:03:40.290> ain't<00:03:40.470> in<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you lose but anyway Rooney ain't in the

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.110 
you lose but anyway Rooney ain't in the
fastest<00:03:40.920> player<00:03:41.130> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.310> world<00:03:41.489> Steven

this<00:04:59.580> one<00:04:59.880> is<00:05:00.210> better<00:05:00.600> than<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.020> current<00:05:01.350> one

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
this one is better than the current one

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.320 
this one is better than the current one
no<00:05:02.220> way<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.400> mean<00:05:02.640> any<00:05:02.880> team<00:05:03.150> with

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.330 
Heskey in my opinion so I'm gonna
