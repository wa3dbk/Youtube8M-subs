00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.590
 that is bouncing 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.940

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.950
 nice goal by the Honduran team 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.100
 a combination that was created precisely 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.590
 in the middle of the field there we have it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.530
 the ball for beloved leaves Mauricio 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.500
 guevara cristian santamaría and I think 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:48.070
 that there is a Velázquez own goal there 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.989
 becomes an own goal and alfredo 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.050
 moral the man who is not moral in 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.930
 against but a very good combination 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.280
 between cristian santamaría between 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.739
 already defined with the men who play 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.800
 to football and is also loved guevara that 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.050
 was the one who played the one from the vol 1 to 0 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.520
 is winning a goal with a very good 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.840
 which was with against a good 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.400
 Grant had careful attention 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.910
 armed carnal 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.910

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.120
 honduras 1 lasted little the joy did not last 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.970
 little came out again in depth between 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.370
 a man in the middle 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.650
 is the number 5 that is going to attack 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.920
 arnáez 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.560
 and touch on the chocolate outlet 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.480
 flowers the great advantage at the wheel 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.090
 accompanies nobody nobody frame nobody 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:49.600
 followed and draw true I'm diego 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.600

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.890
 carson 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.890
 with 2 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.570
 The goal 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.020
 robert karlsson goal depth all 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 toric 1 we made that in doubts there was 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.770
 increased the regime was playing with 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.320
 balls a little longer now 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.620
 the center here is that it stopped her as 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.320
 what he knows and his reasons for putting the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.900
 2 a few well for pre lake high there was 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.030
 similar to the game but that always 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:37.030
 it was near the side arc as you see 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.800
 like letting the waiting bounce 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 take the time that well that well that the 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.450
 for himself with this ease they gave him 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.150
 advantage they tightened us but very well the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.790
 perfect definition of three led carson 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.920
 that puts the 2 to 1 for Honduras to 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.120
 start of the second half 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.190
 Well, we have two by one the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:58.270
 scoreboard at nicoya stadium 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.040
 guanacaste costa rica honduras surpassing 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.040
 2 to 1 to the home team 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.190
 already about 23 minutes attention honduras 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.060
 prepares a pitch with a goal idea 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.750
 may be 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.750
 beloved guevara 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.260
 carlton the peck adopted cristian 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.930
 they still call it a garzo 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.300
 higher output Wilmer López finish his 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.250
 first break 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.890
 there is always an excellent service 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.510
 carson enabling wilmer and is 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.390
 what 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.170
 He did not intend to vary how excellent the 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.940
 idea 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.880
 Front changes do not deal 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.620
 results 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.000
 in short 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.830
 and take care of it go well in height because 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.900
 who looks at it seems to me that he puts a name 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.240
 of costing the man who is marking 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.320
 if it is not marked, 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.320
 no no no no 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.410
 the care 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:12.410
 the header 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.290
 The hit 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:25.900
 probable carson with the selection of 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:29.930
 honduras 3 costa rica 1 in carson 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.610
 there wilmer velásquez sent a shot 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.039
 that went to the corner kick and it appears 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.949
 carson in a second instance and 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.919
 nod in front of a disorganized 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.370
 defense of costa rica and this Honduras 3 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.229
 to 1 good the result for the whole 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.969
 Hondurans do not want to believe it 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.439
 Costa Rican 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:52.939
 there's the membreño corner shot 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.639
 I think that Honduras meets 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.889
 responsibility this commitment and coast 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.229
 rich then try to do an experiment 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.639
 and tests some players that 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.099
 We definitely saw it in the first 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.719
 period are not the size of those who 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:07.549
 they were doing time with the rate of 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:10.830
 same as well as the case of odd lopez and 

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:14.670
 improving what happens in the team 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.050
 Now it's myers wilmer lopez soccer 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.350
 unproductive to bed that in this 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.650
 moment harold wallace attention wilber 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.690
 lopez changes the ball right for the left 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:28.460
 I was leaving here excellent the 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.460
 half turn I was looking for price 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.450
 he did not let him finish but this ball is 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:36.110
 definitely spectacular to go back 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.110
 coat is going to paste 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.319
 a spectacular ball sent to 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.650
 windows 1000 velazquez honduras 4 coast 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:53.240
 rich 1 book I believe that there is no 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.240
 say that we had already sung 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:04.080
 the pique as it takes out and there when the 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.830
 touches one meter almost to 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.980
 madrigal 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.360
 and defines superbly over the 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.360
 contraction output
