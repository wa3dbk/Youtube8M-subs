00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
that I wanted to do there's this really

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.920 
that I wanted to do there's this really
absurd<00:00:22.020> set<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.650> had<00:00:22.800> some<00:00:23.930> improvisation

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
absurd set that had some improvisation

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
absurd set that had some improvisation
it<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.680> pretty<00:00:25.890> perfect<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:26.849> remember

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
it was pretty perfect but I remember

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.140 
it was pretty perfect but I remember
walking<00:00:27.269> off<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.720> be<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:28.340> okay<00:00:29.340> now<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:29.939> got

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
walking off and be like okay now I got

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849 
walking off and be like okay now I got
to<00:00:30.210> figure<00:00:30.330> out<00:00:30.480> how<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.599> do<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> more<00:00:31.260> like

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
to figure out how to do this more like

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.530 
to figure out how to do this more like
you're<00:00:32.340> immediately<00:00:32.880> onto<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> next<00:00:33.300> thing

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
you're immediately onto the next thing

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.760 
you're immediately onto the next thing
so<00:00:34.260> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.770> addictive<00:00:36.320> thing<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
so it's a very addictive thing and

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.860 
so it's a very addictive thing and
that's<00:00:38.579> why<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> picked<00:00:39.149> such<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.450> recent

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that's why I picked such a recent

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.139 
that's why I picked such a recent
experience<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.530> probably<00:00:40.890> junky<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.940> like
