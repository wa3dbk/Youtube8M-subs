battlefield 3 the AK was ridiculous it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.080 
battlefield 3 the AK was ridiculous it
was<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.650> good<00:01:11.450> had<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.659> recoil<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.200> all<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
was very good had no recoil at all and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.920 
was very good had no recoil at all and
it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.299> just<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:16.220> gun<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:18.509> didn't

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
it was just a gun that you just didn't

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990 
it was just a gun that you just didn't
want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.170> mess<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.830> close<00:01:20.220> range<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
want to mess with at close range but you

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.390 
want to mess with at close range but you
just<00:01:21.150> really<00:01:21.600> didn't<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.799> battlefield<00:01:23.100> 4<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
just really didn't and a battlefield 4 I

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.679 
just really didn't and a battlefield 4 I
really<00:01:23.790> think<00:01:23.970> they<00:01:24.119> did<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> good<00:01:24.479> job<00:01:24.540> of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
really think they did a good job of

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.420 
really think they did a good job of
keeping<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> gun<00:01:25.380> violence<00:01:25.619> compared<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> all

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
keeping the gun violence compared to all

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.190 
keeping the gun violence compared to all
the<00:01:26.460> other<00:01:26.580> guns<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:28.049> famas<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.220> know<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:30.200> just

the other guns the famas I know is just

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
the other guns the famas I know is just
as<00:01:31.380> good<00:01:31.560> as<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.009> AK<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:32.610> used<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:33.000> it

and<00:03:48.919> apparently<00:03:49.919> what<00:03:50.159> I've<00:03:50.250> heard<00:03:50.370> dice<00:03:50.639> is

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and apparently what I've heard dice is

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.149 
and apparently what I've heard dice is
going<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.150> patch<00:03:51.299> this<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:51.840> guess<00:03:52.319> but<00:03:53.009> they're

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
going to patch this I guess but they're

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.039 
going to patch this I guess but they're
going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.340> keep<00:03:53.489> it<00:03:53.609> in<00:03:53.759> hardcore<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.870> whenever

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
going to keep it in hardcore so whenever

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.610
