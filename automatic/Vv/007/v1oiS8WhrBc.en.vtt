00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.770
 the time will stop 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.740
 and we bring to pomegranates 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.820
 and to give it to that 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.180
 frozen in time and trapped in 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.789
 this book 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.949
 with few benefits 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.070
 that is, they are all characters of 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.660
 stories we will upload ernesto of our 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.720
 days 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.310
 when you will remember that we met him 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.400
 mikel or beloved 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.880
 and that they know about their past they do not remember 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.880
 who are they 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 105 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.829
 one week 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.140
 Y 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.829
 victorious 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.460
 but only you can change what 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.460
 it happens here 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.090
 on this computer that is written no 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 we will see the happy endings 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.310
 why do you think the characters 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
 of stories there are 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240
 there must be something more 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.780
 if it's the last thing I do the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.650
 actions are 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:34.310
 you are changing things you weaken 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.310
 the spell 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.240
 Once upon a time there was a town 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.390
 where all the cult characters that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 you know 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.990
 they are trapped between two worlds 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.380
 and only one person will be able to break their 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.360
 spell and nobody look at me from the person 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.240
 changes 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.640
 but in the end it is veritas welcome to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:05.280
 a fairy world where the finals 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 happy do not exist
