cook the plant-based food the
phytochemical<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.100> not<00:00:44.250> active<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.760> said

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
phytochemical is not active they said

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.330 
phytochemical is not active they said
absolutely<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.829> said<00:00:46.829> well<00:00:46.980> then<00:00:47.100> why<00:00:47.280> are

click tomatoes you have no
phytochemicals<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.329> don't<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.230> guy

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
phytochemicals and you don't and the guy

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.200 
phytochemicals and you don't and the guy
left<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.340> said<00:00:53.520> let<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.789> tell<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> story

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
and I know I'm wrong doctor I said

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.960 
and I know I'm wrong doctor I said
forgive<00:01:37.770> me<00:01:37.890> but<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> have<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> say<00:01:38.820> this

forgive me but I have to say this

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.039 
forgive me but I have to say this
because<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.329> what<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.600> was<00:01:39.810> training

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
because this is what I was training

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.600 
because this is what I was training
everyone<00:01:40.380> else<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.860> said<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.400> cook

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
everyone else I said when you cook

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.219 
everyone else I said when you cook
something<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:42.150> destroy<00:01:42.509> elements

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
something to destroy elements

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
something to destroy elements
you<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:43.979> manifest<00:01:44.310> something<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.000> wasn't

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you don't manifest something that wasn't

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.240 
you don't manifest something that wasn't
there<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.479> begin<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:46.049> said<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.070> must

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
there to begin I said there you must

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.590 
there to begin I said there you must
have<00:01:47.430> found<00:01:47.549> something<00:01:47.880> can<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.210> come<00:01:48.420> down<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
have found something can I come down and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.300 
have found something can I come down and
study<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.470> said<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.159> what

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
study with you I said because what

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.679 
study with you I said because what
you're<00:01:50.490> saying<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.939> when<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.210> cook<00:01:51.390> something

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
you're saying is when you cook something

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.139 
you're saying is when you cook something
not<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.619> do<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:53.009> destroy<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:53.939> now<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
not only do not destroy it but now you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.399 
not only do not destroy it but now you
create<00:01:54.540> things<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.930> weren't<00:01:55.110> there<00:01:55.259> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
create things that weren't there to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.200 
create things that weren't there to
begin<00:01:55.530> with

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
begin with

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.819
