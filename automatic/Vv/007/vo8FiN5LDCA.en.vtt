00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:10.919
 Hello 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.119
 with you taras oleynik project of the region these 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.089
 series 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.789
 and new LCD production monitors 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.119
 kaljir electronics company 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.659
 Plato models up to more than 80 6 cells 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.899
 one of the first mass LCD monitors 

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:25.049
 equipped technology 

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:26.779
 led backlight 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.310
 let's see what it gives in practice 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.729
 m 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.499
 the appearance of these monitors is typical for 

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:34.780
 premium korean products 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.770
 manufacturers 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.950
 many glossy surfaces smooth 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.460
 hull lines original parts 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.980
 design 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.610
 attracts attention rather 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.860
 slim body only 20 millimeters thick 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.690
 in USA 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.450
 but the year the device power supply design 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.780
 made external 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 and stand design 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.440
 involves only tilt adjustment 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.650
 before this boundary limits 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.420
 management of Beslan is made with 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.680
 using the touch buttons on the front 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.760
 panels 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.220
 thanks to the light sensor function, their backlighting 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.380
 it turns on only when 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.540
 user brings their hand to them 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.540
 m 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.810
 LED backlight technology using in 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.070
 as a light source for the LCD panel 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.820
 LEDs instead of fluorescent lamps 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.400
 White is used in these devices. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.050
 high brightness LEDs placed in 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 share rulers top 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.930
 their main advantages are 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.070
 efficiency and environmental friendliness because 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.540
 that unlike so much trouble 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.700
 they contain mercury 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.040
 unfortunately technology 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 led backlight popularly 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.130
 already prepare many myths 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.400
 sometimes quite as far as reality 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.310
 their debunking as well as in-depth 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.180
 analysis of the topics we have dedicated 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.490
 special article 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.220
 read on the website computer 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.420
 review and third force 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.600
 m 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 in the lineup fleet rondo of battle 86 5 course of twenty 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.549
 four fifteen will be a new model 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.549
 main treasurer screen resolution 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.159
 of the interesting features and here is the sensor 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.750
 exterior lighting and here is upright 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.200
 automatically adjusts the brightness 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.370
 screen 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.840
 and also there is a control timer periodically 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.910
 reminding the user of 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.469
 need to take a break 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.309
 it was a little rest 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:13.469
 m 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:14.919
 both monitors are based on 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.689
 technology three political forces 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:17.969
 it means that they cannot 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.299
 boast of 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.729
 extensive viewing angles 

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:23.839
 for further tests we connect 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.189
 calorimeter 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.759
 and checking the monitor tool 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.439
 calorimeter recorded noticeable 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.479
 deviations from this transfer started 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.029
 and pretty starts color gamut 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.879
 on the other hand, the response time in these 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.909
 monitors just 2 milliseconds 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:39.569
 and really motion blur 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.539
 here is minimal 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.449
 which means they are not bad for games and 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:45.449
 watching video 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.290
 algeria photo rum much more than 24 86 great and yes 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.799
 was 22 86 l 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.930
 this is one of the first mass monitors 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.380
 using led technology 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.479
 backlight on white LEDs 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.669
 she has an undeniable 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.129
 dignity such as low consumption 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.259
 environmental friendliness no harmful 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:06.019
 substances 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.650
 however, the image quality 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.569
 everything has a far greater impact 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:10.959
 same factors as 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.019
 type mounted LCD panels 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.669
 and quality and customization at the factory 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.370
 therefore it is not necessary to consider years 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.099
 technology pon stocks 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.699
 Thank you for your attention to new meetings
