00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
going to be a very tough race so it's

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.609 
going to be a very tough race so it's
gonna<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.090> challenging<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.050> think<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
gonna be challenging I think for the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.160 
gonna be challenging I think for the
drivers<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.130> teams<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:33.149> like<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
drivers and teams are like it's going to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
drivers and teams are like it's going to
be<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.380> very<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:35.489> eight<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.450> humidity<00:00:36.870> is

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
be a very very eight but the humidity is

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.990 
be a very very eight but the humidity is
high<00:00:37.440> probably<00:00:37.950> feels<00:00:38.160> slightly<00:00:38.489> cooler<00:00:38.820> than

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
high probably feels slightly cooler than

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.729 
high probably feels slightly cooler than
other<00:00:39.629> evenings<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.200> might<00:00:40.379> give<00:00:40.590> them

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
other evenings which might give them

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.500 
other evenings which might give them
half<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.129> chance<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.180> course<00:00:42.360> we've<00:00:42.480> seen

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
half a chance and of course we've seen

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.900 
half a chance and of course we've seen
how<00:00:42.840> bumpy<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.129> gonna<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> long<00:00:44.700> race

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
how bumpy it is so gonna be a long race

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
how bumpy it is so gonna be a long race
one<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:45.329> three<00:00:45.510> quarter<00:00:45.899> hours<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.520> they're

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
using tinted is it a problem with the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
using tinted is it a problem with the
reflections<00:01:21.390> narrow<00:01:21.780> no<00:01:22.409> force<00:01:22.799> other<00:01:22.920> clean

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
reflections narrow no force other clean

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.950 
reflections narrow no force other clean
visor<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> better<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.090> visibility<00:01:24.750> so

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
visor is better for the visibility so

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.469 
visor is better for the visibility so
you<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.680> see<00:01:25.860> everything<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> for<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you can see everything and is for the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.420 
you can see everything and is for the
moment<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.049> not<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> problem<00:01:28.560> bumps<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
moment it was not a problem bumps and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
moment it was not a problem bumps and
humidity<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.600> everybody<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.200> cope

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
humidity can is everybody going to cope

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.870 
humidity can is everybody going to cope
with<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.619> will<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> factor<00:01:32.490> later<00:01:32.700> in

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
with that will it be a factor later in

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.319 
we're talking about the plank we're and
all<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.009> the<00:03:48.189> challenges<00:03:48.759> of<00:03:48.939> the<00:03:49.120> race

tonight<00:03:49.720> do<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.900> think<00:03:50.049> there<00:03:50.139> could<00:03:50.169> be<00:03:50.290> an

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 
tonight do you think there could be an

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:53.649 
tonight do you think there could be an
issue

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:53.659 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:54.910 

I<00:03:53.689> think<00:03:54.170> of<00:03:54.260> trouble<00:03:54.500> is<00:03:54.590> if<00:03:54.739> there's<00:03:54.860> any

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
I think of trouble is if there's any

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.500 
I think of trouble is if there's any
racing<00:03:55.400> going<00:03:55.549> on<00:03:55.730> and<00:03:55.909> they<00:03:55.969> get<00:03:56.090> off<00:03:56.239> line

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
racing going on and they get off line

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.599 
racing going on and they get off line
then<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:56.959> could<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:57.260> pretty<00:03:57.500> eventful<00:03:57.709> going

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
then it could be pretty eventful going

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.190 
then it could be pretty eventful going
into<00:03:58.849> seven<00:03:59.209> there's<00:03:59.390> only<00:03:59.510> one<00:03:59.719> line<00:03:59.930> if<00:04:00.140> you

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
into seven there's only one line if you

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.869 
into seven there's only one line if you
go<00:04:00.290> offline<00:04:00.620> they're<00:04:00.829> in<00:04:00.920> trouble<00:04:01.069> already

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
go offline they're in trouble already

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.630 
go offline they're in trouble already
now<00:04:02.030> what<00:04:02.209> about<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:03.079> break<00:04:03.769> where<00:04:04.069> breaks

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
now what about a break where breaks

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.970 
now what about a break where breaks
critical<00:04:05.260> they're<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.439> the<00:04:06.560> limit<00:04:06.829> it's

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
critical they're on the limit it's

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.429 
critical they're on the limit it's
probably<00:04:07.250> hard<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.519> circuit<00:04:07.939> of<00:04:08.120> the<00:04:08.329> season<00:04:09.260> so

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
probably hard a circuit of the season so

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:10.420 
probably hard a circuit of the season so
we're<00:04:09.560> gonna<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:09.829> manage<00:04:10.159> them<00:04:10.280> in<00:04:10.340> the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
you think people got the right amount of

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.719 
you think people got the right amount of
blanking<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:14.540> don't<00:04:15.439> know<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.620> be<00:04:15.799> honest<00:04:16.039> where
