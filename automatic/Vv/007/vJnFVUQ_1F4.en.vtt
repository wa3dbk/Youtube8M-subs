00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.840 

set<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:02.190> we<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.580> them<00:02:04.460> they<00:02:05.460> are<00:02:05.580> good<00:02:05.790> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
set like we want them they are good to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.720 
set like we want them they are good to
go<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:07.440> now<00:02:08.360> what<00:02:09.360> we're<00:02:09.509> gonna<00:02:09.600> do<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:11.340> take

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
go so now what we're gonna do is take

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.380 
go so now what we're gonna do is take
this<00:02:12.330> seven<00:02:12.720> strand<00:02:12.989> 550<00:02:13.620> paracord<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.550> this

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
this seven strand 550 paracord and this

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.440 
this seven strand 550 paracord and this
is<00:02:15.510> actually<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:15.989> bungee<00:02:16.950> cord<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.270> only

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
is actually a bungee cord so it's only

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
is actually a bungee cord so it's only
1/8<00:02:18.810> inch<00:02:19.080> thick<00:02:19.170> I<00:02:19.530> wish<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.830> were<00:02:19.920> 1/4<00:02:20.340> inch

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
1/8 inch thick I wish it were 1/4 inch

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.150 
1/8 inch thick I wish it were 1/4 inch
but<00:02:21.330> we're<00:02:21.480> probably<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.959> double<00:02:22.350> wrap<00:02:22.680> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
but we're probably a double wrap the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.190 
but we're probably a double wrap the
whole<00:02:23.489> area<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.600> basically<00:02:24.840> what<00:02:24.989> we're<00:02:25.080> going

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
whole area so basically what we're going

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.870 
whole area so basically what we're going
to<00:02:25.230> do<00:02:25.350> is<00:02:25.470> take<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.769> cord<00:02:26.160> tie<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.610> to

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
to do is take this cord tie it to

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.880 
to do is take this cord tie it to
probably<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.930> corner<00:02:28.260> right<00:02:28.500> here<00:02:28.560> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
probably to this corner right here and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.750 
probably to this corner right here and
then<00:02:29.700> run<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> all<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.300> way<00:02:30.540> around<00:02:30.660> and

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
then run it all the way around and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
then run it all the way around and
that's<00:02:32.760> what<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.239> what<00:02:33.360> what<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.380> going<00:02:34.440> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that's what that's what what is going to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's what that's what what is going to
allow<00:02:34.860> us<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.220> strap<00:02:35.790> our<00:02:36.769> or<00:02:37.769> zip<00:02:38.069> tie<00:02:38.280> our

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
allow us to strap our or zip tie our

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.520 
allow us to strap our or zip tie our
mesh<00:02:40.459> fencing<00:02:41.459> to<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> we're<00:02:43.080> at<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> end<00:02:43.380> of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
mesh fencing to so we're at the end of

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.420 
mesh fencing to so we're at the end of
day<00:02:43.680> one<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.600> have<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.810> bungee<00:02:46.140> cable<00:02:46.290> on<00:02:47.010> the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
day one I have the bungee cable on the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.870 
day one I have the bungee cable on the
boat

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
boat

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
boat
you<00:02:48.150> see<00:02:48.420> I've<00:02:48.540> ran<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> through<00:02:49.260> every<00:02:50.250> one<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you see I've ran it through every one of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.820 
you see I've ran it through every one of
the<00:02:50.550> pad<00:02:50.790> eyes<00:02:51.030> on<00:02:51.330> here

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
the pad eyes on here

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.640 
the pad eyes on here
and<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.100> way<00:02:53.190> around<00:02:53.459> the<00:02:53.550> lip<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.880> that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
and all the way around the lip of that

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.050 
and all the way around the lip of that
then<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.739> came<00:02:55.890> back<00:02:55.950> around<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.760> ran<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:56.970> all

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
then I came back around and ran it all

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.449 
then I came back around and ran it all
the<00:02:57.269> way<00:02:57.360> across<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.840> top<00:02:58.049> here<00:02:58.190> on<00:02:59.190> both

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the way across the top here on both

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.180 
the way across the top here on both
sides<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.269> now<00:03:00.329> I've<00:03:01.320> just<00:03:01.350> got<00:03:01.650> it<00:03:01.680> tied<00:03:01.950> off

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
sides and now I've just got it tied off

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.740 
sides and now I've just got it tied off
here<00:03:02.400> on<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:02.640> end<00:03:02.790> until<00:03:03.090> I<00:03:03.120> decide<00:03:03.510> exactly

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
here on the end until I decide exactly

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.620 
here on the end until I decide exactly
what<00:03:04.170> length<00:03:04.470> since<00:03:05.310> that's<00:03:05.519> only<00:03:05.760> 8<00:03:05.940> inch<00:03:06.239> I

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
what length since that's only 8 inch I

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.810 
what length since that's only 8 inch I
may<00:03:07.230> go<00:03:07.410> back<00:03:07.650> around<00:03:07.829> with<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.340> one<00:03:08.459> more<00:03:08.610> time

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
may go back around with it one more time

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.970 
may go back around with it one more time
as<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.180> can<00:03:09.299> see<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.480> still<00:03:09.750> got<00:03:09.959> quite<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.739> bit

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
as you can see I still got quite a bit

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.890 
as you can see I still got quite a bit
of<00:03:11.420> rope<00:03:12.420> left<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:14.030> alright<00:03:15.030> as<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.570> see

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
of rope left so alright as you can see

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.890 
of rope left so alright as you can see
we've<00:03:16.140> got<00:03:16.170> our<00:03:16.380> knitting<00:03:17.070> on<00:03:17.690> and<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.750> can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
we've got our knitting on and you can

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.020 
we've got our knitting on and you can
see<00:03:19.110> we've<00:03:19.640> attached<00:03:20.640> it<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:21.870> top<00:03:22.170> and

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
see we've attached it to the top and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.150 
see we've attached it to the top and
we've<00:03:24.030> attached<00:03:24.329> it<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.660> bottom<00:03:25.070> once<00:03:26.070> I

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
we've attached it to the bottom once I

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.650 
we've attached it to the bottom once I
had<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.340> fully<00:03:26.549> attached<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.239> went<00:03:27.390> ahead<00:03:27.450> and

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
had it fully attached I went ahead and

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.470 
had it fully attached I went ahead and
trimmed<00:03:27.840> it<00:03:28.049> right<00:03:28.200> here<00:03:28.530> at<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.680> waterline

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
trimmed it right here at the waterline

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.250 
trimmed it right here at the waterline
and<00:03:30.500> so<00:03:31.500> that's<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.739> kind<00:03:32.040> of<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> sides<00:03:33.260> so

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and so that's just kind of the sides so

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.220 
and so that's just kind of the sides so
essentially<00:03:34.620> we<00:03:34.799> have<00:03:34.920> both<00:03:35.190> sides

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
essentially we have both sides

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.449 
essentially we have both sides
completely<00:03:37.230> netted<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:37.859> our<00:03:37.980> brush<00:03:38.250> is

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
completely netted so our brush is

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.039 
completely netted so our brush is
actually<00:03:38.579> ready<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.060> go<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:42.049> now

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
actually ready to go on there and now

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.479 
actually ready to go on there and now
it's<00:03:43.410> time<00:03:43.620> to<00:03:44.090> figure<00:03:45.090> out<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> netting<00:03:47.310> on

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
it's time to figure out the netting on

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.970 
it's time to figure out the netting on
the<00:03:47.820> front<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.390> then<00:03:49.140> on<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.380> back<00:03:49.590> back

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
the front and then on the back back

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.720 
the front and then on the back back
there<00:03:51.890> so<00:03:52.890> as<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.070> can<00:03:53.190> see<00:03:53.370> we've<00:03:53.519> got<00:03:53.549> our

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
there so as you can see we've got our

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.280 
there so as you can see we've got our
netting<00:03:54.180> completely<00:03:54.810> on<00:03:54.959> front<00:03:55.769> back

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
netting completely on front back

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.170 
netting completely on front back
I<00:03:58.290> didn't<00:03:58.769> zip<00:03:59.040> tie<00:03:59.220> it<00:03:59.280> down<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.670> here<00:03:59.879> because

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
I didn't zip tie it down to here because

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.980 
I didn't zip tie it down to here because
I<00:04:00.989> won't<00:04:01.530> have<00:04:01.709> access<00:04:02.129> to<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.400> little

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
I won't have access to that little

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.890 
I won't have access to that little
apartment<00:04:04.320> right<00:04:04.410> there<00:04:04.470> so<00:04:06.980> as<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.250> see

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
apartment right there so as you can see
