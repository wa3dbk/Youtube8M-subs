00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.649
 this fish with you elena sudakova today 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.469
 I will teach you how to curl a doll's hair and 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.990
 curls we need dolls boiling water 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.730
 scissors foil or waste fabric 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.680
 some still take cocktail tubules 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.920
 and toothpicks but I donâ€™t 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.600
 comfortable but don't forget the comb 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.670
 let's go considering the fact that the doll 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.650
 maybe a game on dusty elizovo china 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.599
 I advise you to properly wash her head 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.789
 or at least moisten with warm water because 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.070
 that wet hair is easier to pour 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.559
 combing cut into squares foil 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.239
 and we roll it in a long sausage if 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.460
 no love and chop or 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.649
 the fabric is a long strip and both of us 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.840
 gives effect curlers now decide what 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.000
 size curls we need if a lot 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.520
 small we take a small strand if 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.320
 little big big then reel 5 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.899
 on the foil sausage we prepared 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.000
 fold the cloth or the foil tube 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 duck does not tie the ends of the tube 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.109
 fix a toothpick tip on 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 bottom hide and seek can be a little salt and 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.219
 make them bigger on top of paros 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.260
 especially you are my ears and must pass 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.030
 carefully when all the strands are ready 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.710
 secured recruit glass again 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.720
 hot water because it's gone already 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 could well cool down and do not drop there 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.490
 doll head knit no more than a minute 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 further we lift the dolls to the glass 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.869
 dry until morning in a natural way 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.030
 You can basically dry your head and hair dryer 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.350
 on not bringing the hair dryer very close to the hair 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
 otherwise you can burn them 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.240
 we curls down enjoy the moment 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 personal opinions best not to comb but 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.439
 if you need not curls and hair sells 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.600
 of course you can also lay 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.579
 their mousse or styling gel only 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.150
 without fanaticism even small ones are enough 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.860
 droplets 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 I warn that toy manufacturers 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.939
 use for firmware completely different 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.770
 materials so the level of success on 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.840
 different corners different best 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.880
 of course the originals are the monster high and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.500
 ever after high from mattel 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 well that's all hope my lesson was like 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.759
 interesting and useful with you 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 Elena such love their dolls and 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.920
 make them most extraordinary on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920
 the light
