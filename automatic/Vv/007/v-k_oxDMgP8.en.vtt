00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 It's not easy to do what you're doing. 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.450
 He made a clown from my people, 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
 as if they were plain safe. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
 He hurt him. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.750
 Would you tell me where you were trained? 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 Afghanistan? 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.750
 Or in Chechnya? 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.000
 Who are you? 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 I made a lot of sacrifice for peace. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.750
 Thor, your selfishness 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.000
 and because of your stupidity 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.750
 it covers this innocent countryside 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.250
 the horror and destruction of war. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.500
 You're a vain, compassionate and cruel son! 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.500
 You and just a crazy old man! 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.000
 You're not worthy! 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.500
 Father ... 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.750
 Back! 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.500
 You're depriving yourself of power, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 and I exile you! 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.500
 Please open your eyes! 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 Oh, no, this Earth, right? 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.750
 Where did he come from? 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.250
 Your ancestors called magic 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
 you science. 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 Ahon I come, the two are one and the same. 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.500
 Refused to King 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.250
 so is the fate of his own. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.250
 I'll end this!
