00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.460

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 to use for our recipe is a box of 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.359

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.330
 concentrated passion fruit or else you 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.039
 They can use passionfruit even if you take 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 the pulp of the fruit beaten in the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 blender with a little water up to 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.540
 achieve that amount that we are 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.170
 needing for the recipe 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.730
 here we have half a teaspoon of 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.899
 emulsifier it is very important in the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.719
 ice cream 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.480
 the ice cream gets creamy and here we have 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 a pack of 12 grams of gelatin 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.820
 colorless and tasteless already prepared 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.600

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.199
 cake putin and transparent paper 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.789
 to cover our revenue when it was the 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.500
 freezer 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.380
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.530
 use for our recipe that today we 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.540
 Let's put the juice in the blender. 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.890
 passion fruit concentrate 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.650

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.159
 now we are going to put the emulsifier 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.650
 we can not put much and mousse 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.220
 does not have to be the right measure 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.340
 to get creamy enough 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.439

 with the help of a paper towel we go 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.630
 joining force with butter or margarine 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.390
