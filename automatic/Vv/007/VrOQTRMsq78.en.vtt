00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.929 
now I'm at the stove I have to let my
gas<00:01:43.180> which<00:01:45.299> sometimes<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.509> little<00:01:46.750> bit<00:01:46.899> tricky

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
gas which sometimes a little bit tricky

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.469 
gas which sometimes a little bit tricky
there<00:01:48.939> we<00:01:49.030> go

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.420 

I'm<00:01:52.479> simply<00:01:52.869> going<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.350> put<00:01:53.619> all<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.979> these

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
I'm simply going to put all of these

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:15.320 
I'm simply going to put all of these
four<00:01:54.939> ingredients<00:01:56.310> into<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.729> saucepan

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.900 

that's<00:02:16.330> what<00:02:16.540> it<00:02:16.660> looks<00:02:16.870> like<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.790> can

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
that's what it looks like and you can

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.350 
that's what it looks like and you can
see<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.270> sugar<00:02:19.600> has<00:02:19.780> yet<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.200> dissolve<00:02:20.620> so<00:02:21.360> I'm

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
see the sugar has yet to dissolve so I'm

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.290 
see the sugar has yet to dissolve so I'm
just<00:02:22.570> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> stir<00:02:23.230> that<00:02:23.260> for<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.640> minute<00:02:25.030> or

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
just going to stir that for a minute or

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.740 
just going to stir that for a minute or
so<00:02:25.540> while<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.950> the<00:02:27.760> sugar<00:02:28.030> dissolves<00:02:28.600> and

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
so while the the sugar dissolves and

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.550 
so while the the sugar dissolves and
then<00:02:29.260> I'm<00:02:29.620> going<00:02:29.860> to<00:02:30.010> leave<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.660> about<00:02:32.020> 10

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
then I'm going to leave it for about 10

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.070 
then I'm going to leave it for about 10
to<00:02:32.680> 15<00:02:32.830> minutes<00:02:33.490> until<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:34.150> sauce<00:02:34.360> has<00:02:34.390> boiled

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
to 15 minutes until the sauce has boiled

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.990 
to 15 minutes until the sauce has boiled
down<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.530> become<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.830> bit<00:02:36.040> syrupy<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.880> I'll

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
down and become a bit syrupy so I'll

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.780 
down and become a bit syrupy so I'll
come<00:02:37.210> back<00:02:37.390> then<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> I've<00:02:42.280> had<00:02:42.580> this

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
come back then so I've had this

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.830 
come back then so I've had this
simmering<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.780> very<00:02:44.710> lowest<00:02:45.300> heat<00:02:46.300> for

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
simmering on the very lowest heat for

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.080 
simmering on the very lowest heat for
about<00:02:47.080> 10<00:02:47.440> minutes<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.460> sugar<00:02:48.850> has<00:02:49.060> dissolved

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
about 10 minutes the sugar has dissolved

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.230 
about 10 minutes the sugar has dissolved
look<00:02:49.930> at<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.140> lovely<00:02:50.500> rich<00:02:50.860> color<00:02:51.250> as<00:02:51.520> it
