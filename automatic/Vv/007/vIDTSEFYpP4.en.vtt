00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.069 
ability there and then she's going to
take<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.780> everything<00:01:43.140> else<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.960> here<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:45.990> was

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
take out everything else and here I was

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
take out everything else and here I was
worried<00:01:46.439> about<00:01:46.590> traps<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.130> here<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.850> do<00:01:47.970> run

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
worried about traps up here we do run

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.910 
worried about traps up here we do run
into<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.360> bomb<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.659> two<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.200> she's<00:01:49.409> okay<00:01:49.740> I

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
into a bomb or two but she's okay I

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.260 
into a bomb or two but she's okay I
thought<00:01:50.280> these<00:01:50.490> were<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> last<00:01:51.030> two

inside this clan castle that we ended up
fighting<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.640> then<00:03:00.150> here's<00:03:00.450> why<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.630> was<00:03:00.750> like

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
fighting and then here's why I was like

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.090 
fighting and then here's why I was like
there's<00:03:01.019> no<00:03:01.080> way<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.410> can<00:03:01.500> do<00:03:01.590> there's<00:03:01.800> they're

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
there's no way we can do there's they're

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.680 
there's no way we can do there's they're
just<00:03:02.250> all<00:03:02.400> gonna<00:03:02.519> melt<00:03:02.760> or<00:03:02.940> something<00:03:03.269> they're

just all gonna melt or something they're

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.240 
just all gonna melt or something they're
actually<00:03:04.050> super<00:03:04.410> duper<00:03:04.709> tanky<00:03:04.980> though<00:03:05.100> even

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
actually super duper tanky though even

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.620 
actually super duper tanky though even
that<00:03:05.370> bomb<00:03:05.700> isn't<00:03:05.970> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.300> enough<00:03:06.330> for

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
that bomb isn't going to be enough for

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.000 
that bomb isn't going to be enough for
them<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:06.959> take<00:03:07.260> a<00:03:07.290> lot<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:07.530> damage<00:03:07.769> from
