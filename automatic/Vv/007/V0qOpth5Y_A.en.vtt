00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.060

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:24.350
 28 days wrong that one day well that for 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.290
 cramming into the subway at the hours of 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.850

 the poor man discovered the bag of the month 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.379
 while it would be enough for him to wait for 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.150
 times two months to have a month 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.349
 advanced 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.930

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.989
 less in advance then it's not complicated 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.310

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.629
 nothing to do by what annoys me the most 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.530
 it's that the poor 30 year old acquires 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:09.819

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.599
