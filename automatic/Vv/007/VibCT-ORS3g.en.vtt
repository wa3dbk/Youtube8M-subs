00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.860
 comes from playing the World Cup in Brazil 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.020
 with Uruguay country that left with so 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.020
 only 22 years to cross the pond and 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.760
 try his luck in European football 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.440
 arrived in Spain from the hand of the Albacete and 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.630
 then he went through lift and racing 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.020
 Santander before signing up in the summer 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.480
 of 2012 by the Spanish 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.760
 about to turn 28 and after dialing 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.130
 14 goals in his two campaigns as 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.080
 Espanyol aims to improve its 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.840
 benefits and help the 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.880
 Spanish achieves a comfortable salvation is 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.270
 christian stuani the protagonist of the 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.110
 week in our test 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.110
 i 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.329
 a porter 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.880
 boxes 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.970
 is a great goalkeeper and the time that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.150
 I've been here and I've always liked 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.730
 much the part because 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.350
 it also transmits many 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.490
 to his partner saying that I think that 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.490
 this goalkeeper 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.520
 a defense 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.480
 I would say that sergio ramos cried 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.730
 because I see it very strong I think that 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.770
 has the ability 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.620
 to make a good of the best 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.290
 defenses of the world and 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.710
 that has everything to remain still 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.710
 best 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 a midfielder 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.990
 midfielder would be xabi has 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.560
 very high quality and has shown all 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.560
 this years 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.010
 a forward 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.450
 is a forward month and I think that 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.710
 the best player what 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.700
 I have seen what I have 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.700
 of career and 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.899
 have discussion 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.220
 a coach 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.240
 and also because the person 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.790
 coach who has that is very daring 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.159
 and what he likes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.129
 attack with many people although sometimes 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.700
 that football that really can be 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.700
 complicated 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.780
 a stadium 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.319
 save me I always liked to play there 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:46.629
 He always liked to do whether 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.629
 goals and hopefully I can repeat 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:55.700
 a hobby plus the hobby of bilbao 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.400
 I think it's a vision 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:03.239
 there is a lot of example because I think that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.980
 the team always clothes it up and it shows 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.319
 very much in his field 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.680
 Now that is a vision of the bad 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.680
 hundreds
