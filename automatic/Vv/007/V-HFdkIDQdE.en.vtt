staff she gone and we all decided we
would<00:01:05.820> participate<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.870> we<00:01:07.020> would<00:01:07.200> learn<00:01:07.470> and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:07.800 
would participate and we would learn and

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.780

we<00:01:08.040> would<00:01:09.020> spend<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.140> lot<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.320> time<00:01:10.650> finding<00:01:11.460> out

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
we would spend a lot of time finding out

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.539 
we would spend a lot of time finding out
what<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> merits<00:01:12.570> were<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.200> ourselves<00:01:13.549> prior

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
what the merits were for ourselves prior

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.179 
what the merits were for ourselves prior
to<00:01:14.759> having<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.180> athletes<00:01:15.600> go<00:01:15.840> through<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.259> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
to having the athletes go through it and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.179 
to having the athletes go through it and
indeed<00:01:17.850> every<00:01:18.780> single<00:01:19.170> coach<00:01:19.439> was<00:01:19.799> able<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
indeed every single coach was able to

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.050 
indeed every single coach was able to
gain<00:01:20.490> major<00:01:21.420> benefits<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> from<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.220> health

gain major benefits for it from a health

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.350 
gain major benefits for it from a health
perspective<00:01:24.329> from<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.170> fitness<00:01:25.590> perspective

from an ability to relax and reduce

from an ability to relax and reduce

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
stress in our daily lives so we felt it

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.510 
stress in our daily lives so we felt it
was<00:01:33.180> absolutely<00:01:33.899> an<00:01:34.140> edge<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.829> if<00:01:35.100> we<00:01:35.280> could

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
was absolutely an edge that if we could

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.240 
was absolutely an edge that if we could
capture<00:01:36.240> with<00:01:36.630> our<00:01:36.810> athletes<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.860> perhaps

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
capture with our athletes that perhaps

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.550 
capture with our athletes that perhaps
it<00:01:39.210> would<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> kind<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.320> could

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
it would be the kind of thing they could

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.219 
it would be the kind of thing they could
bring<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.280> meet<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.270> tough<00:01:42.899> competition

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
bring to a meet to a tough competition

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.730 
bring to a meet to a tough competition
and<00:01:44.030> have<00:01:45.030> an<00:01:45.479> edge<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.930> their<00:01:46.110> competitors

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and have an edge that their competitors

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.120 
and have an edge that their competitors
don't<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:48.140> do<00:01:49.140> something<00:01:49.469> that<00:01:49.770> nobody

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
don't have be do something that nobody

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.459 
don't have be do something that nobody
else<00:01:50.280> was<00:01:50.490> doing<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.659> use<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.350> their

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
else was doing and use it to their

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:54.649 
else was doing and use it to their
advantage<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.310> think<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.729> has<00:01:53.850> proven<00:01:54.479> in

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
advantage and I think it has proven in

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.709 
advantage and I think it has proven in
our<00:01:55.200> case<00:01:55.759> especially<00:01:56.759> for<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> athletes

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
our case especially for the athletes

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.219 
our case especially for the athletes
that<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.759> bought<00:01:59.759> into<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.719> enjoyed

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that have bought into it that enjoyed

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.440 
that have bought into it that enjoyed
doing<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:02.130> allowed<00:02:02.460> them<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.700> stay

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
doing it it's allowed them to stay

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.080 
doing it it's allowed them to stay
healthier<00:02:04.460> swim<00:02:05.460> faster<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.590> focus<00:02:07.590> better

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
healthier swim faster and focus better

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.600 
healthier swim faster and focus better
