like<00:02:31.780> he<00:02:31.900> just<00:02:32.110> zipped<00:02:32.920> over<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.220> track

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
like he just zipped over the track

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.790 
like he just zipped over the track
wanted<00:02:34.270> to<00:02:34.330> do<00:02:34.390> more<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.930> we<00:02:35.200> didn't<00:02:35.500> let<00:02:35.650> him

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
wanted to do more and we didn't let him

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.490 
wanted to do more and we didn't let him
so<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.670> think<00:02:36.850> you<00:02:37.330> know<00:02:37.450> mount<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.810> quarter<00:02:38.200> it's

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
so I think you know mount a quarter it's

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.330 
so I think you know mount a quarter it's
gonna<00:02:38.620> be<00:02:38.800> a<00:02:38.830> big<00:02:39.040> test<00:02:41.010> actually<00:02:42.010> hep<00:02:42.160> till

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
gonna be a big test actually hep till

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.770 
gonna be a big test actually hep till
tomorrow<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.790> make<00:02:42.910> up<00:02:43.060> my<00:02:43.180> mind<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.510> put<00:02:43.690> him

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
tomorrow to make up my mind to put him

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.460 
tomorrow to make up my mind to put him
on<00:02:43.870> the<00:02:43.930> plane<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.500> you<00:02:44.920> know<00:02:45.850> it's<00:02:46.180> it's

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
on the plane but you know it's it's

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.900 
on the plane but you know it's it's
jumping<00:02:47.470> from<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:47.800> Haskell<00:02:48.370> off<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.610> big

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
jumping from the Haskell off a big

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.010 
jumping from the Haskell off a big
effort<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.480> travelers<00:02:52.480> mile<00:02:52.780> and

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
effort to the to the travelers mile and

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.949 
effort to the to the travelers mile and
quarter<00:02:53.350> it's<00:02:54.270> you<00:02:55.270> know<00:02:55.360> we<00:02:55.480> have<00:02:55.570> two<00:02:55.750> things

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
fast racetrack we need a great break get

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.120 
fast racetrack we need a great break get
him<00:03:04.450> going<00:03:04.630> he<00:03:04.959> likes<00:03:05.170> it<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.530> run<00:03:05.739> he's<00:03:05.950> like

faster he goes the better he is and we
trying<00:03:10.270> to<00:03:10.300> hold<00:03:10.420> him<00:03:10.540> back<00:03:10.690> he<00:03:10.900> won't<00:03:11.080> run<00:03:11.260> so

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
trying to hold him back he won't run so

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.000 
trying to hold him back he won't run so
it's<00:03:12.489> um<00:03:12.820> you<00:03:13.170> know<00:03:14.170> mount<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.560> quarter<00:03:14.920> we

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
it's um you know mount a quarter we

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.979 
it's um you know mount a quarter we
don't<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:15.640> he<00:03:15.760> can<00:03:15.970> you<00:03:16.450> know<00:03:16.480> he's<00:03:16.750> shown

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
don't know if he can you know he's shown

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.770 
don't know if he can you know he's shown
us<00:03:17.640> that<00:03:18.640> Mountain<00:03:19.000> eighth<00:03:19.120> last<00:03:19.420> race<00:03:19.630> he

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
us that Mountain eighth last race he

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.580 
us that Mountain eighth last race he
looked<00:03:19.930> like<00:03:20.020> he<00:03:20.140> handled<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:20.500> pretty<00:03:20.709> well

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
looked like he handled that pretty well

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.930 
looked like he handled that pretty well
so<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:24.900> just<00:03:25.900> really<00:03:26.320> think<00:03:26.560> that<00:03:26.650> he's<00:03:27.549> up<00:03:27.730> for

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
so I just really think that he's up for

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
so I just really think that he's up for
it<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.269> think<00:03:28.750> he<00:03:28.900> can<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.320> think<00:03:29.799> he's<00:03:29.920> that<00:03:30.070> good

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
it I think he can I think he's that good

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.820 
it I think he can I think he's that good
