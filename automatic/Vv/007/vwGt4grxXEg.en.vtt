lemon flavored beurre blanc and this is
going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.169> be<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.589> water<00:00:31.980> base<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.640> this<00:00:33.000> is

going to be my water base and this is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.090 
going to be my water base and this is
what<00:00:33.720> you<00:00:33.810> call<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.140> continuous<00:00:34.710> phase<00:00:34.860> for

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
what you call your continuous phase for

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.410 
what you call your continuous phase for
your<00:00:35.190> emulsion<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> whole<00:00:36.000> video<00:00:36.270> that

come to a simmer you're going to take

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.520 
come to a simmer you're going to take
that<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> add<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.010> into<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> blender<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.530> since

that and add it into a blender and since
I'm<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:19.740> citrus<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.790> form<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.120> lemon

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
I'm using citrus in the form of lemon

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
I'm using citrus in the form of lemon
juice<00:01:21.540> I<00:01:21.720> like<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.620> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:23.070> bit<00:01:23.159> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
juice I like to have a little bit of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
juice I like to have a little bit of
extra<00:01:24.270> fresh<00:01:25.050> lemon<00:01:25.500> juice<00:01:25.530> squeezed<00:01:26.070> in

extra fresh lemon juice squeezed in

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.250 
extra fresh lemon juice squeezed in
right<00:01:26.909> before<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.479> emulsification<00:01:27.930> process

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
right before the emulsification process

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.649 
right before the emulsification process
but<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> is<00:01:29.400> important<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.940> your<00:01:30.150> water<00:01:30.390> base

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
but it is important that your water base

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.390 
but it is important that your water base
is<00:01:30.870> nice<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.350> hot<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.860> close<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
is nice and hot you know close to that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.510 
is nice and hot you know close to that
simmering<00:01:32.820> point<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.380> butter<00:01:34.740> will

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
simmering point because the butter will

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.520 
simmering point because the butter will
cool<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.180> down<00:01:36.210> as<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.750> emulsifies<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
cool it down as it emulsifies in and it

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.399 
cool it down as it emulsifies in and it
could<00:01:37.650> seize<00:01:37.920> your<00:01:38.190> blender<00:01:38.900> now<00:01:39.900> I'm<00:01:40.049> going

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
could seize your blender now I'm going

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.500 
could seize your blender now I'm going
to<00:01:40.620> season<00:01:41.370> with<00:01:41.640> just<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.330> of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
to season with just a little bit of

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.750 
to season with just a little bit of
kosher<00:01:42.690> salt<00:01:42.900> and<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.770> tiny<00:01:43.979> bit<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.280> sugar<00:01:44.490> and

kosher salt and a tiny bit of sugar and
the<00:01:44.850> sugars<00:01:45.150> just<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> counterbalance

the sugars just there to counterbalance

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.590 
the sugars just there to counterbalance
the<00:01:46.549> lemon<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.760> acidity<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.479> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
the lemon and the acidity not to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.570 
the lemon and the acidity not to
actually<00:01:48.810> make<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> sweet<00:01:49.320> now<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.460> I'm

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
actually make it sweet now here I'm

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.820 
actually make it sweet now here I'm
going<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.909> add<00:01:51.090> my<00:01:51.299> hydrocolloid<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.350> my

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
going to add my hydrocolloid and my

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.670 
going to add my hydrocolloid and my
stabilizer<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.940> anthem<00:01:54.060> gum<00:01:54.450> and

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
stabilizer which is the anthem gum and

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.180 
stabilizer which is the anthem gum and
xanthan<00:01:55.680> gum

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
xanthan gum

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.370 
xanthan gum
needs<00:01:56.940> some<00:01:57.150> sheering<00:01:57.630> power<00:01:57.900> but<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.260> can

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
needs some sheering power but it can

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.890 
needs some sheering power but it can
hydrate<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:58.920> both<00:01:59.040> hot<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.369> cold<00:01:59.850> water<00:01:59.940> so<00:02:00.690> to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
hydrate in both hot and cold water so to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.859 
hydrate in both hot and cold water so to
hydrate<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.220> to<00:02:02.310> drop<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.000> directly

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
hydrate it I'm going to drop it directly

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.700 
hydrate it I'm going to drop it directly
into<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.549> center<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.119> this<00:02:06.450> vortex<00:02:07.200> that's

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
into the center of this vortex that's

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169 
into the center of this vortex that's
being<00:02:07.830> created<00:02:08.159> by<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.280> spinning<00:02:08.610> blade<00:02:08.970> of

being created by the spinning blade of

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.320 
being created by the spinning blade of
my<00:02:09.349> blender<00:02:10.349> now<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.370> don't<00:02:11.640> measure<00:02:12.060> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
my blender now I don't measure this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.289 
my blender now I don't measure this
because<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.290> little<00:02:13.830> tiny<00:02:14.310> tablespoon<00:02:15.209> or

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
because just a little tiny tablespoon or

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.300 
because just a little tiny tablespoon or
a<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.569> not<00:02:15.810> even<00:02:15.840> teaspoon<00:02:16.530> probably<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
a little not even teaspoon probably a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.070 
a little not even teaspoon probably a
quarter<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.790> teaspoon<00:02:17.970> will<00:02:18.300> be<00:02:18.390> enough<00:02:18.690> to

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
quarter of a teaspoon will be enough to

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.170 
quarter of a teaspoon will be enough to
emulsify<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.890> entire

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
emulsify this entire

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.300 
emulsify this entire
batch<00:02:21.480> in<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.319> blender<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:22.680> I<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.099> give<00:02:23.280> a

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
batch in the blender so I just give a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.699 
batch in the blender so I just give a
little<00:02:23.579> sprinkle<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.329> then<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:24.900> start<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.439> drop

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
little sprinkle and then I start to drop

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.089 
little sprinkle and then I start to drop
in<00:02:25.980> my<00:02:26.879> whole<00:02:27.150> chunks<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.719> butter<00:02:27.840> and<00:02:28.140> as<00:02:28.890> it

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
in my whole chunks of butter and as it

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.280 
in my whole chunks of butter and as it
becomes<00:02:29.430> thicker<00:02:29.819> I'm<00:02:30.180> going<00:02:30.569> to<00:02:30.689> continue<00:02:31.079> to

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
becomes thicker I'm going to continue to

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.990 
becomes thicker I'm going to continue to
turn<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.650> blender<00:02:31.980> blade<00:02:32.189> up<00:02:32.340> until<00:02:32.969> I

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
turn that blender blade up until I

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.509 
turn that blender blade up until I
finally<00:02:33.390> hit<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.810> highest<00:02:34.140> speed<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> you'll

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
finally hit the highest speed and you'll

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.270 
finally hit the highest speed and you'll
notice<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.959> whole<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.439> vortex<00:02:37.739> hole

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
notice that the whole that vortex hole

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.699 
notice that the whole that vortex hole
is<00:02:38.519> becoming<00:02:39.299> smaller<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.200> smaller<00:02:40.469> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
is becoming smaller and smaller the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.679 
is becoming smaller and smaller the
width<00:02:40.950> will<00:02:41.250> become<00:02:41.519> smaller<00:02:41.939> and<00:02:42.180> smaller<00:02:42.239> as

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
width will become smaller and smaller as

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.509 
width will become smaller and smaller as
the<00:02:43.260> beurre<00:02:43.379> blanc<00:02:43.620> becomes<00:02:43.980> thicker<00:02:44.280> and

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
the beurre blanc becomes thicker and

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.280 
the beurre blanc becomes thicker and
this<00:02:44.609> is<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:44.879> you<00:02:44.939> know<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.719> thickness<00:02:46.139> now

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
this is how you know the thickness now

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.470 
this is how you know the thickness now
here<00:02:46.739> I<00:02:46.859> have<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> perfect<00:02:47.849> amount<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.420> know

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
here I have a perfect amount that I know

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.039 
here I have a perfect amount that I know
of<00:02:48.810> water<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.500> butter<00:02:50.159> ratio<00:02:50.579> for<00:02:50.790> flavor<00:02:51.060> so

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
of water and butter ratio for flavor so

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.990 
of water and butter ratio for flavor so
I'm<00:02:52.170> going<00:02:52.439> to<00:02:52.469> add<00:02:52.769> more<00:02:53.040> xanthan<00:02:53.549> gum<00:02:53.579> to

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
I'm going to add more xanthan gum to

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.099 
I'm going to add more xanthan gum to
slightly<00:02:54.659> thicken<00:02:55.079> it<00:02:55.169> more<00:02:56.090> costly<00:02:57.090> but<00:02:57.599> if<00:02:58.019> I

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
slightly thicken it more costly but if I

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.020 
slightly thicken it more costly but if I
add<00:02:58.260> more<00:02:58.500> butter<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:59.069> run<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.700> risk<00:02:59.849> of

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
add more butter I run the risk of

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.940 
add more butter I run the risk of
deadening<00:03:00.389> the<00:03:00.629> flavors<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.230> my<00:03:01.409> water<00:03:01.650> base

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
deadening the flavors of my water base

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.409 
deadening the flavors of my water base
which<00:03:02.159> is<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> white<00:03:02.579> wine<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> lemon

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
which is the white wine and the lemon

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.270 
which is the white wine and the lemon
juice<00:03:03.599> now<00:03:03.810> when<00:03:04.409> you<00:03:04.500> turn<00:03:04.769> it<00:03:04.919> off<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
juice now when you turn it off you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.679 
juice now when you turn it off you
should<00:03:05.459> see<00:03:05.609> this<00:03:05.730> little<00:03:05.909> glub-glub<00:03:06.389> just

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
should see this little glub-glub just

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:08.300 
should see this little glub-glub just
like<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:07.019> where<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> bubbles<00:03:07.980> kind<00:03:08.189> of

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
like that where the bubbles kind of

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.459 
like that where the bubbles kind of
percolate<00:03:09.269> up<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.629> the<00:03:09.719> top<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.139> then<00:03:10.230> shows

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
percolate up to the top and then shows

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.610 
percolate up to the top and then shows
that<00:03:10.620> you<00:03:10.709> have<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.980> nice<00:03:11.359> stable<00:03:12.359> emulsion<00:03:12.840> now

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
that you have a nice stable emulsion now

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.899 
that you have a nice stable emulsion now
I'm<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.829> to<00:03:13.889> pour<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.310> through<00:03:14.669> a<00:03:14.700> chinois

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
I'm going to pour this through a chinois

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.330 
I'm going to pour this through a chinois
and<00:03:15.840> that's<00:03:16.290> just<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.650> make<00:03:16.680> sure<00:03:16.829> that<00:03:17.069> I<00:03:17.159> have

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
and that's just to make sure that I have

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.789 
and that's just to make sure that I have
a<00:03:17.370> nice<00:03:17.609> fine<00:03:18.000> consistency<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:19.079> I'm<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
a nice fine consistency and I'm going to

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.849 
a nice fine consistency and I'm going to
reserve<00:03:20.129> this<00:03:20.569> over<00:03:21.569> a<00:03:21.599> double<00:03:22.139> boiler<00:03:22.349> where

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
reserve this over a double boiler where

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.899 
reserve this over a double boiler where
I<00:03:22.919> basically<00:03:23.069> I'm<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.579> fit<00:03:23.760> this

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
I basically I'm going to fit this

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.479 
I basically I'm going to fit this
bain-marie<00:03:24.150> into<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> second<00:03:25.319> bain<00:03:25.470> marie<00:03:25.500> that

keep this covered over a low flame for
dinner<00:03:31.739> service<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.310> you'll<00:03:32.489> notice<00:03:32.760> that

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
dinner service and you'll notice that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.759 
dinner service and you'll notice that
this<00:03:33.150> consistency<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.169> complete<00:03:34.620> control

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
this consistency I have complete control

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:37.219 
this consistency I have complete control
over<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.669> I<00:03:36.150> wanted<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:36.720> can<00:03:36.959> make<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:37.229 
over it if I wanted to I can make it

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:38.839 
over it if I wanted to I can make it
thicker<00:03:37.439> by<00:03:37.769> adding<00:03:38.069> more<00:03:38.159> xanthan<00:03:38.579> gum<00:03:38.609> or

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
thicker by adding more xanthan gum or

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.270 
thicker by adding more xanthan gum or
more<00:03:39.479> butter<00:03:39.750> or<00:03:40.379> I<00:03:40.409> can<00:03:40.680> thin<00:03:40.919> it<00:03:40.949> out<00:03:41.099> by

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
more butter or I can thin it out by

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.089 
more butter or I can thin it out by
adding<00:03:41.639> more<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:42.000> my<00:03:42.120> water<00:03:42.389> base<00:03:42.979> but<00:03:43.979> will

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
adding more of my water base but will

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.610 
adding more of my water base but will
