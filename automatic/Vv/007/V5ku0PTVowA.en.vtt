00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
network let's go ahead and take a look

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.270 
network let's go ahead and take a look
at<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.569> the<00:02:22.690> connectors<00:02:23.500> on<00:02:23.739> this

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
at some of the connectors on this

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
at some of the connectors on this
particular<00:02:24.760> television<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:26.080> you're<00:02:26.290> going

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
particular television now you're going

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.470 
particular television now you're going
to<00:02:26.530> notice<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.980> way<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.549> connectivity<00:02:28.390> on

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
to notice the way the connectivity on

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.199 
to notice the way the connectivity on
this<00:02:28.629> is<00:02:28.780> arranged<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.409> so<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.489> TV<00:02:31.030> can

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
this is arranged is so that this TV can

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.420 
this is arranged is so that this TV can
be<00:02:31.239> mounted<00:02:31.510> flush<00:02:32.319> on<00:02:32.590> your<00:02:32.890> wall<00:02:33.129> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
be mounted flush on your wall because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.070 
be mounted flush on your wall because
that's<00:02:33.610> obviously<00:02:33.940> how<00:02:34.540> it's<00:02:34.690> going<00:02:34.870> to<00:02:34.959> look

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
that's obviously how it's going to look

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.350 
that's obviously how it's going to look
its<00:02:35.379> best<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.310> all<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.640> connectors<00:02:37.030> are<00:02:37.209> going

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
its best so all the connectors are going

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.410 
its best so all the connectors are going
to<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.540> found<00:02:37.860> lining<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:39.069> right<00:02:39.489> or<00:02:39.760> right
