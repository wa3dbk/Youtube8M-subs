00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello my name is crafting 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.460
 Today we will consider the gentle options 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.099
 wedding nail design with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.660
 using gel varnishes gel 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:18.300
 twitter and rhinestones and so let's get our hands on 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.439
 my model is already prepared also 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.460
 put on base 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.680
 go directly to the color we put 62 number 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 this trouble that you can 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.349
 use as a monochromatic coating so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.390
 and foundation under design and french inflicts 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.780
 gel varnish on the entire surface of the nail 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 plate and butt then polymerize 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:45.450
 blatt apparatus 30 seconds or 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.750
 ultraviolet device two minutes in 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.910
 we draw a white line to the cuticle area 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.000
 duplicating the line at the so-called cuticle 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.770
 anti front or reverse french 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 I recommend to apply white color in advance 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.469
 on the palette so he managed a little 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.780
 thicken further duplicate our line on 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.220
 middle of the nail and send in years 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.220
 unit for 30 seconds 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.539
 On the next nail we draw two lines from 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.750
 thick thin and reduce them to 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:23.180
 free edge of the nail without connecting them 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.289
 then polymerize and go to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.289
 next design 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.850
 using white gel varnish draw 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 fine lines for future mesh 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 first one way duplicating them then 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.960
 to another 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.429
 before you can continue a little 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.429
 to polymerize the mesh 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.300
 starting from the cuticle lines to the right a 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.840
 then to the left we draw a thin line 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.069
 completing it on the free edge of the nail 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.550
 polymerize thirty seconds of years 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.550
 machine 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:44.600
 draw a line from cuticle to free 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:47.360
 we polymerize the edge of the nail using 86 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.210
 the color of this trouble with light mother of pearl and 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.270
 chimera fill the empty part between 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.090
 two lines on the first nails then 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.820
 blank areas on the second color 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.370
 finely ordinary brush for artistic 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.370
 the murals on the last nails also 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.350
 fill the empty part with a light flickering 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.350
 we polymerize with a shimmer 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.870
 in order to perform invoice 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.000
 we need a glitter design 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.460
 top nails 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 we put a top on all surface nail 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.860
 plate and torez then polymerize for 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.320
 create a textured design to us 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.690
 it will take years active gel intence 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.980
 white and white gel polish about bidet 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:51.570
 mix them on a palette remove sticky 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.570
 dispersion layer and go to design 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.520
 on the first nails draw curls in 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.760
 chaotic order in different directions 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.340
 creating a volumetric design then not 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.310
 drying sprinkle our design with small 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.830
 glitter after which we will polymerize one 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.690
 minute in years of apparatus as we have 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.690
 there is years active gel 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.030
 on the next nail in white 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.000
 we draw laces we draw thin 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.990
 lines then using dots set 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.990
 point line 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.790
 without drying we sprinkle the nail with fine 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.220
 glitter and polymerize also this 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:42.110
 design option can be made in the technique 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:44.750
 casting in the next nail with dots 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.139
 randomly dot the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:51.310
 the grid then also sprinkle them with glitter 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.310
 and polymerize 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:12.990
 go to our latest design 

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:14.720
 draw two small commas and circle 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.750
 you with thicker lines 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:21.750
 creating small stencil roses 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:24.300
 above and below we duplicate them further in the 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.260
 sprinkle the design with glitter and 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.260
 polymerize 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:09.679
 brush dust carefully remove residues 

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:10.330
 glitter from the nail plate at all 

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.550
 nails 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:15.259
 after polymerization, this design is no longer 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.899
 need cover top 

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:19.819
 the video may not see shine 

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:24.020
 textured design but in life he 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:26.599
 shimmers very nicely in the end 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.770
 with glue we put rhinestones on the nails 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.770
 on the white line 

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:46.660
 so today we looked at possible 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:49.210
 options for both wedding design so 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.220
 and for everyday life beautiful 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.470
 volumetric texture with glitter will 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:56.560
 the perfect decoration for your pens and 

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:59.020
 pens your customers using various 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.510
 shades can please every whim 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.150
 I wish your customers creative 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:06.150
 success and prosperity to new meetings
