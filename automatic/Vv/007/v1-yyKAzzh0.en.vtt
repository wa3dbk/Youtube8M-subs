00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600 

yeah<00:00:00.319> so<00:00:01.319> from<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.890> colonel<00:00:02.250> point<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.520> view

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
yeah so from the colonel point of view

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.849 
yeah so from the colonel point of view
of<00:00:02.669> like<00:00:02.959> focusing<00:00:03.959> on<00:00:04.080> Numa<00:00:04.380> that's<00:00:04.620> much

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
of like focusing on Numa that's much

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.860 
of like focusing on Numa that's much
more<00:00:05.040> even<00:00:05.460> though<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.730> client<00:00:06.359> your<00:00:06.480> system

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
more even though my client your system

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.080 
more even though my client your system
is<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.259> new<00:00:07.500> machine<00:00:07.740> yeah<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.550> not<00:00:08.700> nearly<00:00:08.970> as

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
is a new machine yeah it's not nearly as

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.290 
is a new machine yeah it's not nearly as
Numa<00:00:09.480> as<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.960> 64<00:00:10.769> way<00:00:10.920> Numa<00:00:11.250> box<00:00:11.490> absolute

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
Numa as a 64 way Numa box absolute

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
Numa as a 64 way Numa box absolute
memory<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.620> latency<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.070> between

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
memory is the latency is between

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.530 
memory is the latency is between
memories<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.849> different<00:00:15.150> nodes<00:00:15.299> is

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
memories of different nodes is

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.620 
memories of different nodes is
significant<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.430> you've<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.119> to

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
significant and you've got it to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.300 
significant and you've got it to
maximize<00:00:19.320> performance<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:19.949> machine<00:00:20.070> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
maximize performance on that machine you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.640 
maximize performance on that machine you
really<00:00:20.520> need<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> colonel<00:00:21.869> but<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
really need to have the colonel but the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.900 
really need to have the colonel but the
scheduler<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.340> memory<00:00:23.580> manager

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
scheduler and the memory manager

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
scheduler and the memory manager
understand<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.510> topology<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.230> machine<00:00:25.500> so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
understand the topology the machine so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.529 
understand the topology the machine so
it<00:00:25.800> can<00:00:25.949> move<00:00:26.099> things<00:00:26.310> around<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.939> keep

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
it can move things around and keep

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
it can move things around and keep
things<00:00:28.519> colocated<00:00:29.519> intelligently<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:31.189> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
things colocated intelligently so that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.090 
things colocated intelligently so that
is<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> Numa<00:00:33.059> work<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.530> mostly<00:00:34.530> focused

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
is like the Numa work is mostly focused

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.440 
is like the Numa work is mostly focused
on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:36.120> server<00:00:36.390> side<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.809> things<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:38.450> there's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
on the server side of things the there's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
on the server side of things the there's
Pete<00:00:39.719> there's<00:00:40.050> security<00:00:40.860> stuff<00:00:41.219> you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Pete there's security stuff you

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
Pete there's security stuff you
mentioned<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.059> security<00:00:42.750> is<00:00:42.809> important<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
mentioned and security is important for

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.209 
mentioned and security is important for
client<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.309> server<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.930> ASL<00:00:46.530> are<00:00:46.680> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
client and server so the ASL are the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
client and server so the ASL are the
address<00:00:47.489> space<00:00:47.640> log<00:00:47.910> randomization<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
address space log randomization and the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.040 
address space log randomization and the
data<00:00:49.950> execution<00:00:50.190> prevention<00:00:50.480> stuff<00:00:51.480> applies

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
data execution prevention stuff applies

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.740 
data execution prevention stuff applies
to<00:00:52.260> both<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:53.309> service<00:00:53.969> security<00:00:54.390> hardening

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
to both the service security hardening

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
to both the service security hardening
stuff<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.260> some<00:00:56.250> stuff<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.489> was

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
stuff which is some stuff that was

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
stuff which is some stuff that was
introduced<00:00:57.120> in<00:00:57.329> Vista<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.530> evolved<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
introduced in Vista and has evolved a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.619 
introduced in Vista and has evolved a
little<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.280> further<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.820> server<00:01:00.480> 2008<00:01:01.109> where

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
little bit further in server 2008 where

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.520 
little bit further in server 2008 where
especially<00:01:03.629> on<00:01:03.899> servers<00:01:04.229> you've<00:01:04.379> got

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
especially on servers you've got

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.410 
especially on servers you've got
services<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.640> are<00:01:05.760> sitting<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.270> on<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
services that are sitting out on the

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
services that are sitting out on the
network<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:07.100> somebody<00:01:08.100> figures<00:01:08.640> out<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.790> way

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
network and somebody figures out a way

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.550 
network and somebody figures out a way
to<00:01:09.030> exploit<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.900> get<00:01:10.020> code<00:01:10.200> running<00:01:10.439> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to exploit them and get code running in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.200 
to exploit them and get code running in
them<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.830> want<00:01:11.040> even<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.580> spy<00:01:11.790> days<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> learn

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
them you want even to spy days to learn

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.870 
them you want even to spy days to learn
def<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> constrain<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
def you want to constrain that

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
def you want to constrain that
infestation<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.540> process<00:01:16.020> ingest

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
infestation to just that process ingest

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.410 
infestation to just that process ingest
the<00:01:16.530> resources<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.369> service<00:01:17.759> would

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the resources that that service would

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.929 
the resources that that service would
require<00:01:18.780> access<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.729> we've<00:01:20.850> got

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
require access to so the so we've got

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.570 
require access to so the so we've got
this<00:01:21.030> principle<00:01:21.450> at<00:01:21.509> least<00:01:21.689> privileged

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
this principle at least privileged

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.780 
this principle at least privileged
around<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.700> services<00:01:24.320> really<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.770> see<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.670> as

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
around the services really I see that as

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
around the services really I see that as
more<00:01:26.939> server<00:01:27.299> focused<00:01:27.869> than<00:01:28.080> client<00:01:28.710> focused

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
more server focused than client focused

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.359 
more server focused than client focused
but<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.579> applies<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.270> both<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.960> that's<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.710> step

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
but it applies to both and that's a step

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.920 
but it applies to both and that's a step
in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> evolution<00:01:32.640> further<00:01:33.270> down<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.689> path

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
in the evolution further down that path

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.069 
in the evolution further down that path
that<00:01:34.320> we've<00:01:34.470> made<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.680> server<00:01:34.950> 2008<00:01:35.960> some<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that we've made in server 2008 some of

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.050 
that we've made in server 2008 some of
the<00:01:37.140> changes<00:01:37.500> actually<00:01:37.890> apply<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.369> client<00:01:38.880> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the changes actually apply to client and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.539 
the changes actually apply to client and
server<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.689> work<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.590> need<00:01:40.770> both<00:01:40.950> sides<00:01:41.250> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
server and work you need both sides to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
server and work you need both sides to
really<00:01:42.150> work<00:01:42.299> well<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.110> big

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
really work well so one of the big

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.859 
really work well so one of the big
investments<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> brand<00:01:44.820> new<00:01:44.909> network

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
investments is in a brand new network

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.859 
investments is in a brand new network

there<00:03:55.959> was<00:03:56.109> a<00:03:56.139> crash<00:03:56.470> or<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:58.180> you'd<00:03:59.049> get<00:03:59.260> back

00:03:59.399 --> 00:03:59.409 
there was a crash or that you'd get back

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:00.960 
there was a crash or that you'd get back
into<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.680> bootable<00:03:59.889> state<00:04:00.159> but<00:04:00.669> it's

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
into a bootable state but it's

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.300 
into a bootable state but it's
impossible<00:04:01.299> to<00:04:01.629> really<00:04:01.870> do<00:04:02.079> that<00:04:02.109> and<00:04:02.739> service

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
impossible to really do that and service

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.780 
impossible to really do that and service
these<00:04:04.090> pieces<00:04:04.389> with<00:04:05.229> a<00:04:05.310> in<00:04:06.310> a<00:04:06.430> way<00:04:06.579> that<00:04:06.760> you

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
these pieces with a in a way that you

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.059 
these pieces with a in a way that you
can<00:04:06.879> guarantee<00:04:07.359> across<00:04:07.659> that<00:04:07.870> whole<00:04:08.109> update

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
can guarantee across that whole update

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.520 
can guarantee across that whole update
that<00:04:09.310> that's<00:04:09.459> going<00:04:09.609> to<00:04:09.669> happen<00:04:10.049> excellent<00:04:11.049> so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
that that's going to happen excellent so

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.740 
that that's going to happen excellent so
what<00:04:11.769> transactions<00:04:12.340> do<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:12.790> make<00:04:13.269> it<00:04:13.419> so<00:04:13.569> that

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
what transactions do is make it so that

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.529 
what transactions do is make it so that
you<00:04:14.650> make<00:04:14.949> those<00:04:15.129> changes<00:04:15.400> they<00:04:16.000> actually<00:04:16.359> go

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
you make those changes they actually go

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.769 
you make those changes they actually go
into<00:04:16.900> a<00:04:17.199> log<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:19.720> only<00:04:20.139> when<00:04:20.380> the

into a log and it's only when the

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.180 
into a log and it's only when the
transaction<00:04:22.779> is<00:04:22.810> committed<00:04:23.080> those<00:04:23.800> changes

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
transaction is committed those changes

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.020 
transaction is committed those changes
get<00:04:24.340> actually

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
get actually

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.820

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.300 
up here on the file in the file system
registry<00:04:31.090> so<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.380> crash<00:04:32.620> before<00:04:32.920> the
