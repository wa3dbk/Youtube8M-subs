arm muscles actually do and how to

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.290 
arm muscles actually do and how to
better<00:00:21.600> emphasize<00:00:22.260> lagging<00:00:23.039> areas<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.029> sit

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
better emphasize lagging areas so sit

back relax and let's learn something
today<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.539> want<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.960> talk<00:00:28.109> about<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
today first I want to talk about the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
today first I want to talk about the
triceps<00:00:28.710> why<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:29.849> they're<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.660> biggest

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
triceps why well they're the biggest

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.510 
triceps why well they're the biggest
muscle<00:00:31.320> groups<00:00:31.470> when<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> comes<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> your<00:00:32.160> arms

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
muscle groups when it comes to your arms

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.299 
muscle groups when it comes to your arms
and<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> name<00:00:33.510> implies<00:00:33.870> triceps<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.860> three

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
and as the name implies triceps as three

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.950 
and as the name implies triceps as three
different<00:00:35.520> heads<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.630> right<00:00:36.809> here

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
different heads so we have right here

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.540 
different heads so we have right here
the<00:00:37.170> lateral<00:00:37.350> head<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.980> closest<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the lateral head which is closest to the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.889 
the lateral head which is closest to the
brachialis<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
brachialis right here you have the

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.360 
brachialis right here you have the
medial<00:00:40.320> head<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> can't<00:00:41.070> really<00:00:41.250> see

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
medial head which you can't really see

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.310 
medial head which you can't really see
but<00:00:42.000> kind<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.270> protrudes<00:00:42.600> out<00:00:42.780> down<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.170> so

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
but kind of protrudes out down like so

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.170 
but kind of protrudes out down like so
it's<00:00:43.440> responsible<00:00:43.860> for<00:00:43.920> thickness<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.760> then

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's responsible for thickness and then

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.420 
it's responsible for thickness and then
lastly<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> have<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.110> long<00:00:46.469> head<00:00:46.770> right<00:00:47.160> back

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
lastly you have the long head right back

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.940 
lastly you have the long head right back
here<00:00:47.789> now<00:00:48.270> what<00:00:48.809> makes<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.170> interest<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.860> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
here now what makes this interest in the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.319 
here now what makes this interest in the
three<00:00:50.190> different<00:00:50.340> heads<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> said<00:00:51.149> before

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
three different heads like I said before

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.299 
three different heads like I said before
you<00:00:51.629> can't<00:00:51.899> isolate<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> can't<00:00:53.039> only

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
you can't isolate so you can't only

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.729 
you can't isolate so you can't only
target<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> lateral<00:00:54.329> head<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:55.020> by<00:00:55.440> learning

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
target the lateral head but by learning

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.099 
target the lateral head but by learning
the<00:00:56.190> function<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.600> different<00:00:57.930> heads

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the function of what the different heads

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.080 
the function of what the different heads
do<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.739> can<00:00:58.890> better<00:00:59.039> emphasize<00:00:59.550> particular

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
do you can better emphasize particular

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.630 
do you can better emphasize particular
areas<00:01:00.809> here's<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.410> perfect<00:01:01.800> example<00:01:01.829> what's

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
areas here's a perfect example what's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.520 
areas here's a perfect example what's
the<00:01:02.699> function<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> tricep<00:01:03.750> well<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.379> you

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the function of the tricep well as you

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.320 
the function of the tricep well as you
might<00:01:04.769> guess<00:01:05.010> it's<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> extension<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> form

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
might guess it's the extension the form

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.230 
might guess it's the extension the form
down<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.200> cool<00:01:07.770> okay<00:01:08.280> but<00:01:08.790> what's

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
down like so cool okay but what's

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
down like so cool okay but what's
special<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.930> long<00:01:10.170> head<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.710> was

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
special about the long head as I was

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
special about the long head as I was
just<00:01:10.830> saying<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.939> also<00:01:12.150> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
just saying is that it also is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.789 
just saying is that it also is
responsible<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.840> extension<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
responsible for extension of the

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.859 
responsible for extension of the
shoulder<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> want<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.540> grow<00:01:15.720> your

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
shoulder so if you want to grow your

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.740 
shoulder so if you want to grow your
long<00:01:16.170> head<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.740> back<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.729> should<00:01:17.970> try

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
long head right back here you should try

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.050 
long head right back here you should try
and<00:01:18.960> incorporate<00:01:19.229> exercises<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and incorporate exercises that put it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.480 
and incorporate exercises that put it
edited<00:01:21.540> advantage<00:01:22.080> so<00:01:22.409> overhead<00:01:23.040> tricep

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
edited advantage so overhead tricep

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280 
edited advantage so overhead tricep
extensions<00:01:24.030> or<00:01:24.299> skull<00:01:24.600> crushers<00:01:25.020> where<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
extensions or skull crushers where you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.740 
extensions or skull crushers where you
go<00:01:25.439> behind<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.460> head<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.880> that's<00:01:27.270> where

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
go behind the head and that's where

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
go behind the head and that's where
gets<00:01:27.990> interesting<00:01:28.680> because<00:01:28.710> let's<00:01:29.159> say<00:01:29.250> your

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
gets interesting because let's say your

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.580 
gets interesting because let's say your
lateral<00:01:30.060> medial<00:01:30.479> head<00:01:30.720> which<00:01:30.960> usually<00:01:31.350> work

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
lateral medial head which usually work

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.920 
lateral medial head which usually work
together<00:01:31.740> quite<00:01:32.420> synergistically<00:01:33.420> or<00:01:33.659> like

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
together quite synergistically or like

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.719 
together quite synergistically or like
so<00:01:34.200> right<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.740> area<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.250> need<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> grow

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
so right here this area you need to grow

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.090 
so right here this area you need to grow
well<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.600> close<00:01:36.900> grip<00:01:37.140> bench<00:01:37.259> press<00:01:37.710> is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
well the close grip bench press is

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.760 
well the close grip bench press is
really<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.390> emphasizing<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.350> lateral

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
really good for emphasizing the lateral

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.370 
really good for emphasizing the lateral
head<00:01:40.890> instead<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.939> long<00:01:42.270> head<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.320> know

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
head instead of the long head and I know

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
head instead of the long head and I know
it's<00:01:43.619> not<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> popular<00:01:44.369> exercise<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.030> kind<00:01:45.180> of

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
it's not a popular exercise it's kind of

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's not a popular exercise it's kind of
been<00:01:45.390> blacklisted<00:01:45.960> but<00:01:46.680> tricep<00:01:47.189> kickbacks

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
been blacklisted but tricep kickbacks

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
been blacklisted but tricep kickbacks
also<00:01:48.420> emphasize<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.380> lateral<00:01:49.860> head<00:01:49.979> instead

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
also emphasize the lateral head instead

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.760 
also emphasize the lateral head instead
of<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.700> long<00:01:50.880> head<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.020> other<00:01:52.170> hand<00:01:52.619> if

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
of the long head on the other hand if

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.499 
of the long head on the other hand if
we're<00:01:52.950> talking<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> long<00:01:53.820> head<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
we're talking about the long head of the

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.030 
we're talking about the long head of the
tricep<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.020> narrow<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.439> need<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.680> improve<00:01:55.920> upon

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
tricep a narrow we need to improve upon

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.010 
tricep a narrow we need to improve upon
remember<00:01:56.549> long<00:01:56.880> had<00:01:57.119> not<00:01:57.299> really<00:01:57.570> emphasized

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
remember long had not really emphasized

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
remember long had not really emphasized
either<00:01:58.350> an<00:01:58.530> horizontal<00:01:58.860> pressing<00:01:59.460> or

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
either an horizontal pressing or

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.340 
either an horizontal pressing or
vertical<00:02:00.149> pressing<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:00.840> got<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.110> focus

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
vertical pressing you got to focus

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.219 
vertical pressing you got to focus
instead<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.280> doing<00:02:03.030> overhead<00:02:03.659> tricep

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
instead on doing overhead tricep

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.039 
instead on doing overhead tricep
exercises<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:06.180> doesn't<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.600> mean<00:02:06.780> doing

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
exercises and it doesn't just mean doing

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.240 
exercises and it doesn't just mean doing
it<00:02:07.140> directly<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:07.649> your<00:02:07.860> head<00:02:08.009> against

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it directly over your head against

it directly over your head against
gravity<00:02:08.700> as<00:02:08.849> I<00:02:09.149> just<00:02:09.330> said<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.989> set<00:02:10.140> up

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
gravity as I just said you can set up

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
gravity as I just said you can set up
the<00:02:10.349> skull<00:02:10.619> Crusher's<00:02:11.039> when<00:02:11.370> you<00:02:11.520> bring<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
remember your triceps you should do

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.470 
remember your triceps you should do
different<00:02:24.260> exercises<00:02:24.740> variations<00:02:25.490> and<00:02:25.670> you

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
a big peak now as this name implies

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.780 
a big peak now as this name implies
biceps<00:02:45.230> as<00:02:45.410> two<00:02:45.739> different<00:02:45.950> heads<00:02:46.280> as<00:02:46.459> the

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
biceps as two different heads as the

biceps as two different heads as the
long<00:02:47.000> head<00:02:47.360> which<00:02:47.810> is<00:02:47.959> out<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:48.680> located

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
long head which is out like so located

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.220 
long head which is out like so located
here<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.850> have<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.060> short<00:02:50.390> head<00:02:50.540> inside

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
here and you have the short head inside

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.740 
here and you have the short head inside
here<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.130> their<00:02:52.760> function<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.600> is

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
here and their function this is

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.780 
here and their function this is
virtually<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.350> same<00:02:54.470> but<00:02:55.190> as<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.519> explained

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
virtually the same but as I explained

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.729 
virtually the same but as I explained
once<00:02:56.030> again<00:02:56.360> you<00:02:56.720> could<00:02:56.870> choose<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.170> emphasize

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
once again you could choose to emphasize

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.340 
once again you could choose to emphasize
one<00:02:58.160> area<00:02:58.550> over<00:02:58.910> the<00:02:59.060> other<00:02:59.209> if<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.019> get<00:03:00.230> your

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
one area over the other if you get your

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.930 
one area over the other if you get your
exercise<00:03:00.650> choices<00:03:01.310> correct

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
exercise choices correct

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.000 
exercise choices correct
okay<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.269> what<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> biceps<00:03:03.350> actually<00:03:03.769> do

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
okay so what do the biceps actually do

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.100 
okay so what do the biceps actually do
well<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.910> first<00:03:05.120> one<00:03:05.269> is<00:03:05.300> everybody<00:03:05.870> knows

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
well the first one is everybody knows

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.110 
well the first one is everybody knows
its<00:03:06.350> flexion<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.280> actual<00:03:07.670> form<00:03:07.910> so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
its flexion of the actual form so

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.240 
its flexion of the actual form so
bringing<00:03:08.330> up<00:03:08.510> like<00:03:08.660> so<00:03:08.810> krob<00:03:09.110> we<00:03:09.260> got<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.590> but<00:03:10.069> a

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
bringing up like so krob we got it but a

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.940 
bringing up like so krob we got it but a
little<00:03:10.819> less<00:03:11.480> known<00:03:11.780> fact<00:03:12.110> of<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.410> bicep

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
little less known fact of the bicep

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.550 
little less known fact of the bicep
itself<00:03:13.610> is<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.450> turn<00:03:14.780> your<00:03:14.989> arm<00:03:15.170> from<00:03:15.470> a

itself is to turn your arm from a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.650 
itself is to turn your arm from a
neutral<00:03:15.860> position<00:03:16.010> like<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.880> supernate<00:03:17.480> so

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
neutral position like so to supernate so

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.500 
neutral position like so to supernate so
from<00:03:17.810> here<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.350> here<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.190> fact<00:03:19.700> if<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.180> want<00:03:20.420> to

from here to here in fact if we want to

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.390 
from here to here in fact if we want to
target<00:03:20.900> in<00:03:21.049> particular<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.799> long<00:03:22.010> head<00:03:22.280> or

an incline dumbbell curl it's actually

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.880 
an incline dumbbell curl it's actually
quite<00:03:44.090> effective<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.750> putting<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> greater

all<00:03:48.709> right<00:03:48.799> now<00:03:49.040> we<00:03:49.100> get<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.549> your<00:03:49.850> biceps<00:03:50.299> are

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
all right now we get it your biceps are

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.569 
all right now we get it your biceps are
responsible<00:03:51.049> for<00:03:51.200> form<00:03:51.470> flexion<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.130> also

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
responsible for form flexion and also

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.400 
responsible for form flexion and also

rotating your hand from a neutral to
super<00:03:54.709> native<00:03:54.980> position<00:03:55.370> so<00:03:55.790> as<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:56.299> see<00:03:56.450> we

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
super native position so as you see we

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.150 
super native position so as you see we
got<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.810> standard<00:03:57.170> exercises<00:03:57.859> right<00:03:57.980> of

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
got the standard exercises right of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.979 
got the standard exercises right of
course<00:03:58.430> you<00:03:58.640> got<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.880> do<00:03:59.030> barbell<00:03:59.600> curls

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
course you got to do barbell curls

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.949 
course you got to do barbell curls
incline<00:04:00.590> curls<00:04:00.920> EZ<00:04:01.190> bar<00:04:01.549> curls<00:04:02.000> but<00:04:02.630> what<00:04:02.930> I

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
incline curls EZ bar curls but what I

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.410 
incline curls EZ bar curls but what I
wanted<00:04:03.320> to<00:04:03.380> say<00:04:03.709> if<00:04:03.950> you're<00:04:04.310> long<00:04:04.609> head<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.120> if

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
wanted to say if you're long head so if

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.000 
wanted to say if you're long head so if
this<00:04:05.690> portion<00:04:06.019> right<00:04:06.290> here<00:04:06.350> is<00:04:06.680> lagging

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
this portion right here is lagging

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.530 
this portion right here is lagging
compared<00:04:07.579> to<00:04:07.670> your<00:04:07.820> short<00:04:08.120> head<00:04:08.329> that's

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
compared to your short head that's

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.289 
compared to your short head that's
because<00:04:09.200> you<00:04:09.320> should<00:04:09.530> focus<00:04:09.739> more<00:04:09.980> on

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
because you should focus more on

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.870 
because you should focus more on
supinated<00:04:11.299> bicep<00:04:11.780> exercises<00:04:12.440> so<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.340> barbell

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
supinated bicep exercises so a barbell

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.670 
supinated bicep exercises so a barbell
curl<00:04:14.090> supinated<00:04:14.750> that's<00:04:14.900> great<00:04:15.260> right<00:04:15.530> it

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
curl supinated that's great right it

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.500 
curl supinated that's great right it
works<00:04:16.190> both<00:04:16.400> but<00:04:16.729> perhaps<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.209> little<00:04:17.269> bit<00:04:17.450> more

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
works both but perhaps a little bit more

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.599 
works both but perhaps a little bit more
the<00:04:17.780> long<00:04:17.959> head<00:04:18.200> if<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.650> do<00:04:18.769> an<00:04:18.890> EZ<00:04:19.190> curl<00:04:19.489> bar

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
the long head if you do an EZ curl bar

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.370 
the long head if you do an EZ curl bar
because<00:04:20.120> you<00:04:20.209> have<00:04:20.329> wrist<00:04:20.570> problems<00:04:21.019> well

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
because you have wrist problems well

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.690 
because you have wrist problems well
that's<00:04:21.530> putting<00:04:21.709> your<00:04:21.950> hand<00:04:22.159> almost<00:04:22.520> in<00:04:22.640> a

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
that's putting your hand almost in a

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.490 
that's putting your hand almost in a
neutral<00:04:23.120> position<00:04:23.240> that's<00:04:23.990> going<00:04:24.229> to<00:04:24.289> target

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
neutral position that's going to target

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.360 
neutral position that's going to target
more<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:24.950> shore

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
more the shore

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.640 
more the shore
and<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.880> exercises<00:04:26.750> like<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> preacher<00:04:27.260> curl

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
and so exercises like the preacher curl

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.320 
and so exercises like the preacher curl
the<00:04:28.130> incline<00:04:28.730> curl

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
the incline curl

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.120 
the incline curl
you<00:04:29.510> know<00:04:29.630> supinated<00:04:30.260> just<00:04:30.440> dumbbell<00:04:30.860> curls

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
you know supinated just dumbbell curls

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.640 
you know supinated just dumbbell curls
are<00:04:31.280> very<00:04:31.760> effective<00:04:32.330> for<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.780> long<00:04:33.110> head<00:04:33.530> of

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
are very effective for the long head of

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.340 
are very effective for the long head of
the<00:04:33.740> bicep<00:04:34.490> now<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:34.910> last<00:04:35.330> area<00:04:35.930> muscle<00:04:36.229> group

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
the bicep now the last area muscle group

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.900 
the bicep now the last area muscle group
I<00:04:36.470> want<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.860> mention<00:04:37.190> is<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.400> brachialis

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
I want to mention is the brachialis

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.390 
I want to mention is the brachialis
right<00:04:38.360> so<00:04:38.540> right<00:04:38.930> here<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.680> responsible<00:04:40.340> for

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
right so right here it's responsible for

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.000 
right so right here it's responsible for
thickness<00:04:41.150> of<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.720> arm<00:04:41.960> because<00:04:42.560> it's<00:04:42.710> mostly

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
thickness of the arm because it's mostly

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.800 
thickness of the arm because it's mostly
hidden<00:04:43.250> behind<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.910> bicep<00:04:44.270> in<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.419> triceps

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
hidden behind the bicep in the triceps

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.860 
hidden behind the bicep in the triceps
this<00:04:45.110> outside<00:04:45.560> portion<00:04:45.830> like<00:04:46.100> so<00:04:46.340> and<00:04:46.699> it<00:04:47.389> does

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
this outside portion like so and it does

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.450 
this outside portion like so and it does
similar<00:04:48.320> function<00:04:48.770> to<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.979> biceps<00:04:49.370> right

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
similar function to the biceps right

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.430 
similar function to the biceps right
flexion<00:04:50.000> of<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.150> forearm<00:04:50.389> but<00:04:50.960> there's<00:04:51.169> one

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
flexion of the forearm but there's one

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.920 
flexion of the forearm but there's one
fundamental<00:04:51.889> difference<00:04:52.660> instead<00:04:53.660> of<00:04:53.780> having

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
fundamental difference instead of having

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.510 
fundamental difference instead of having
your<00:04:54.139> arm<00:04:54.260> supinated<00:04:54.919> as<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.100> just<00:04:55.280> have<00:04:55.400> to

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
your arm supinated as I just have to

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.610 
your arm supinated as I just have to
palm<00:04:55.760> up<00:04:55.940> or<00:04:56.150> neutral<00:04:56.810> you're<00:04:57.169> instead<00:04:57.470> have

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
palm up or neutral you're instead have

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.980 
palm up or neutral you're instead have
it<00:04:57.740> pronated<00:04:58.370> so<00:04:58.610> back<00:04:58.850> like<00:04:59.090> so<00:04:59.330> so<00:04:59.720> instead

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
it pronated so back like so so instead

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.379 
it pronated so back like so so instead
you<00:05:00.169> do<00:05:00.350> a<00:05:00.380> reverse<00:05:01.010> curl<00:05:01.520> remember<00:05:02.120> when<00:05:02.270> you

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:02.389 
you do a reverse curl remember when you

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.629 
you do a reverse curl remember when you
do<00:05:02.510> any<00:05:02.780> curl<00:05:03.260> it's<00:05:03.410> working<00:05:03.950> all<00:05:04.220> these<00:05:04.430> guys

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
do any curl it's working all these guys

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:05.200 
do any curl it's working all these guys
right<00:05:04.880> here

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
right here

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.550 
right here
but<00:05:05.330> it's<00:05:05.450> what<00:05:05.600> we're<00:05:05.750> trying<00:05:05.930> to<00:05:06.080> emphasize

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
but it's what we're trying to emphasize

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.950 
but it's what we're trying to emphasize

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
so we have the Zalman curl where it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.659 
so we have the Zalman curl where it
reverse<00:05:09.380> down<00:05:09.950> like<00:05:10.190> so

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669
