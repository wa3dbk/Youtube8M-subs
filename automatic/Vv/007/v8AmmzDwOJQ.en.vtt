 I think it's a turbine is small I 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.290
 I caught her 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.439
 I got the proof to show you 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.050
 how is the turbine inside 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.600
 crazy right 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.600
 people 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.760
 We always want to keep imagining 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.000
 how is the turbine inside is 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.000
 like this 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.680
 know by law 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:33.040
 let's take a walk 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.040
 basic boot today 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.049
 without many even in the league 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.700
 the car is a little cold 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.769
 have spirit 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.500
 I ask you 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.780
 I will dedicate 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.190
 Any questions 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:03.030
 I can help the former Corinthians there 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.030
 it is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.109
 It's a boot she's already wearing today. 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.940
 on thorn seab salgadinho 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.330
 the game thus hops the system 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.330
 and is 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:47.390
 silent 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.980
 We only have the wire. 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.140
 I'm going to give you a low pressure. 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.760
 because how did the original for year 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:57.160
 and a dangerous way breaks so that's when I 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.720
 taste 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.720
 the pitchfork has 40 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.639
 the market there 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.590
 the tank she 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.410
 the attacker will make the return 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:27.410
 then if you make a new engine it 's more kenton 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.410
 knows labor 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.930
 The doc is to change 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.160
 I said there on the project and I think I'm going 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.620
 put the nativitaten that is 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:42.540
 the next five years is an attempt in 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.800
 beautiful is a project that sealed 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.800
 spend only the car 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.240
 only in the case of honda 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.760
 It is very worn car brought wheels always 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.250
 want more more more more 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.440

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.220

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:11.510
 half in less than a year is August 8 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.510
 now make 1 to 0 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.210
 to see if it will give subsidies to 18 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.210
 August 2001 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.169
 and was one of the pieces 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.300
 but what have I done 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:31.310
 There are many people on the air 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.310
 the group only plays first 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.840
 car but looks 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.080
 has few opportunities of life 

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:46.430
 realize our dreams 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.780
 So say buy a lot of fans, Adam. 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.789

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:57.199
 talk of my will I have to go 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:59.950
 there and bought the barrel 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:03.160
 I'm happy, God dammit. 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:08.590
 I said fucking annoyed not the project 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:10.450
 echo in five years because it is expensive and I go 

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.880
 see relief now in the next decade 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.160
 that curitiba oo detail the case during 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.210

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.729
 is 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:22.610
 I already checked once 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:25.900
