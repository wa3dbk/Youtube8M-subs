00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.470
 Y 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.949
 how is the spiritual friend in this 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.710
 I bring you the special video 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.230
 number 15 where we will talk about the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:35.800
 problems on the iphone 5 so 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.360
 let's start now apple broke its own 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.519
 sales records with the iphone 5 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.830
 they managed to capture the attention of 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.019
 consumer with 16 despite not counting 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.820
 with great changes and with its sensation 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:49.059
 at the time they radically changed the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.640
 way of using maps however despite 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.620
 of all the above is good or bad the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 iPhone 5 does not escape from the problems 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.320
 aesthetics and software like any other 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.479
 terminal let's start with the screen that 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.760
 it's nothing new because with the iphone 4s 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.680
 Yellow marks were also seen but 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.320
 with so much gala that is made of the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.780
 technology the density pixels and everything 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.850
 what is integrated can still be seen as 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.920
 there are flaws in the iphone 5 screen 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.260
 some videos have been published for 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.390
 show certain blinks and a the 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.180
 Bubble effect that is appreciated so 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.549
 general in resistive screens or lcd 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.620
 naked that were not designed with 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.500
 touch support 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.360
 the keyboard is another one of the effects that 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 has been publishing and of course 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.680
 leads to complaints it seems that it is about 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.200
 a bug in the software and not 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.150
 directly from the screen a few lines 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.400
 appear when trying to enter the 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.650
 password in the appstore are kept 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.560
 static the reaction of the line only 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.390
 appears on the 16 grand of the iphone 5 already 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.600
 what sources say that you have installed 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.660
 them on an ipad2 and on an iphone 4s and not 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.580
 they see any kind of error the material of 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.040
 manufacturing seems to be another of the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.710
 problems in the design of the iphone 5 by 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.960
 at least in the black model there is fit if 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.760
 did one of the most practical tests the 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.679
 they delivered some arrivals and one and a 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.600
 ring a little girl to make 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.690
 yours with the iphone 5 and an iphone 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.420
 4s the result of resistance to 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 remarkable scratches because the material 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.350
 of the iPhone 5 case is made of 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.540
 aluminum and therefore the scratches are 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.000
 much more pronounced the result is 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.280
 pretty clear and therefore the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.470
 recommendation is to buy your perspective 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.470
 found before leaving the store
