whole<00:00:19.980> song<00:00:26.599> so<00:00:27.599> they<00:00:27.720> could<00:00:27.840> go<00:00:27.930> from<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> D<00:00:28.349> in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
whole song so they could go from a D in

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.540 
whole song so they could go from a D in
the<00:00:28.529> end<00:00:28.650> of<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.800> C<00:00:31.070> just<00:00:32.070> bring<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.369> whole

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
the end of a C just bring the whole

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
and the bridge of course in the in the

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.880 
and the bridge of course in the in the
verse<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:54.900> do<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.080> verse<00:03:55.200> first<00:03:55.530> it's<00:03:55.770> all

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
verse we do the verse first it's all

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.880 
verse we do the verse first it's all
sevenths<00:03:56.720> d7<00:03:57.720> g7<00:03:58.130> so<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.190> got<00:04:00.320> D<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.530> 7

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
sevenths d7 g7 so you got D to the 7

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.620 
sevenths d7 g7 so you got D to the 7
just<00:04:02.040> come<00:04:02.220> down<00:04:02.460> to<00:04:02.610> the<00:04:02.700> C<00:04:03.710> type<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.890> G<00:04:05.450> up<00:04:06.450> to

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
just come down to the C type to G up to

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.390 
just come down to the C type to G up to
the<00:04:06.720> high<00:04:06.870> G<00:04:07.640> find<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.730> 7<00:04:09.030> is<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.300> F<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:11.250> it's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
the high G find the 7 is that F so it's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.449 
the high G find the 7 is that F so it's
a<00:04:11.520> d7<00:04:12.770> g7<00:04:15.680> so<00:04:16.680> that's<00:04:16.860> the<00:04:16.980> B<00:04:17.100> we're<00:04:17.250> looking

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
a d7 g7 so that's the B we're looking

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:51.980 
a d7 g7 so that's the B we're looking
for<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.760> ready

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.860 

so<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.040> pretty<00:04:53.250> much<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.640> verse<00:04:53.870> taken

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
so that's pretty much the verse taken

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:08.899 
so that's pretty much the verse taken
away<00:04:58.670> I'll<00:04:59.670> raise<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.940> banner<00:05:00.180> as<00:05:00.390> a

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:12.389 

so<00:05:09.909> you<00:05:10.029> can<00:05:10.270> either<00:05:10.649> start<00:05:11.649> softly<00:05:12.279> and

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:12.399 
so you can either start softly and

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:17.030 
so you can either start softly and
building
