00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
come on here and the passcode is Desmond

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.240 
come on here and the passcode is Desmond
so<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.550> searched<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.940> Desmond<00:00:46.100> little<00:00:47.100> load

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
so we searched up Desmond little load

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.020 
so we searched up Desmond little load
now<00:00:47.460> this<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.920> i<00:00:49.920> think<00:00:50.399> i'm<00:00:50.730> pretty<00:00:50.969> sure

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.740 
couldn't save the world how the hell are
we<00:02:23.850> supposed<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.210> swing<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:26.480> there's<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.540> little

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
we supposed to swing it there's a little

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.400 
we supposed to swing it there's a little
hyphen<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.470> I'm<00:02:28.560> not<00:02:28.650> too<00:02:28.710> sure<00:02:28.950> whether

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
hyphen there so I'm not too sure whether

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.830 
hyphen there so I'm not too sure whether
that's<00:02:32.150> saying<00:02:33.150> that's<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> different

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that's saying that's the different

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.020 
that's saying that's the different
sentence<00:02:34.350> I'm<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:34.980> too<00:02:35.100> sure<00:02:35.280> but<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.940> also

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
sentence I'm not too sure but you also

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.340 
sentence I'm not too sure but you also
said<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.300> type<00:02:36.540> into<00:02:36.720> everything<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.170> let's

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
said to type into everything so let's

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.240 
said to type into everything so let's
let's<00:02:37.920> try<00:02:38.130> some<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.430> others<00:02:39.950> so<00:02:40.950> let's<00:02:41.100> go

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
let's try some of the others so let's go

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:51.350 
let's try some of the others so let's go
with<00:02:41.900> 9<00:02:42.900> /<00:02:43.740> 11<00:02:45.170> so<00:02:46.170> this<00:02:46.290> comes<00:02:46.500> up<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:46.770> E<00:02:50.360> it's

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
with 9 / 11 so this comes up with E it's

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.280 
with 9 / 11 so this comes up with E it's

come<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.120> with<00:03:51.269> deciphering<00:03:51.900> complete<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.439> to

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
come up with deciphering complete is to

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.949 
come up with deciphering complete is to
fly<00:03:52.709> that<00:03:52.829> one<00:03:53.040> up<00:03:53.159> yeah<00:03:54.150> it's<00:03:54.329> often<00:03:54.569> complete

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
fly that one up yeah it's often complete

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:03.850 
fly that one up yeah it's often complete
so<00:03:55.890> that's<00:03:57.650> okay
