00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.120
 healthy little brother with you bits of hours 701 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.120
 and in this video I will tell you how you can 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 get policy qms for home delivery 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.570
 without hemorrhoids 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.759
 I know that most of you 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.359
 still enjoy old 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.189
 green cards that are nowhere 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:26.699
 really except in the city of Moscow 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:28.130
 that's actually what is fraught with possible 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.630
 what will you refuse in medical 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.730
 service in other cities for example 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 went to the grandmother you grabbed there 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.579
 kidney brought you for example on 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.040
 operating table and bam surgeon looking 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.739
 on your policy and says about anka 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.960
 politics in Moscow to be treated here he is not 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.960
 indeed, this is actually the main one 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:55.020
 the reason why you need to change it at the very 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.199
 It's easy to find the right campaign. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.579
 I used mert for example 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:06.540
 fear she offers delivery services 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:08.640
 policies on the house that is worth it 380 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.140
 rubles but 380 rubles you need to pay two 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.630
 times why because they bring two 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.380
 Poles first time policy is brought 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.500
 temporary which is given to you bye 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.619
 made constantly constantly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.100
 It made about a month and 10 days 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.310
 well at least it was so with me and for 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.630
 this time you can enjoy 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.900
 temporary than bad temporary policy 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.340
 that firstly he doesn't have a barcode 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.890
 need to call the registry and through it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 recorded secondly sometimes 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.119
 This policy is not in the database most often 90 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:55.380
 percent of the cases that is you need to go 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:59.250
 in the office in a separate register there 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.460
 there and then with a passport to give 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.969
 temporary policy and you will be added to the database 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.090
 we have no such permanent crap 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.150
 at least with me as i got it 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:17.010
 just went to these as well number 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.540
 abbas I already estimate in the database so here is 380 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.099
 rubles will have to pay twice the first 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.269
 once a temporary policy a second time 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:27.989
 constant better of course this month is not 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:31.109
 hurt because the queue 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:37.079
 usually come to kill yourself 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:41.670
 base plus as if by barcode and without 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:43.650
 numbers of some kind cannot be recorded through 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.349
 there are various programs that are there 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.329
 and Android-8 general gimor this 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:52.620
 temporary so it's best to wait for a permanent 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.120
 I basically did fit 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.349
 permanent then decided to go a 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 sign up for an appointment with the doctor 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.889
 I just had nothing like that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.019
 urgent 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.900
 what else what else bullets myself with you i'm not 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.000
 I show because it shows my 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 personal data plus barcode barcode 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.909
 it works even if it is not original 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.959
 that is, for example, I go to the clinic with 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:23.010
 a copy because the policy itself but 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:26.000
 the original is like an ordinary 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:29.699
 a piece of paper on which the water gets and all 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.889
 fell apart that's why I go with a copy there 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:35.870
 barcode is the company name and 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.970
 tsiferki wheels with them I go and 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.900
 in fact, everything is fine everyone accepts 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.960
 everyone is happy everyone is happy what more would you like 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:51.480
 say what I wanted to say 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.090
 and to get for example this belt 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.420
 navy in companies fear me just 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.210
 it took to write a statement online 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.060
 statements that they have on the site I 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.510
 kept your personal data needed 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:11.190
 enter correctly that is all the letters 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:15.720
 must be written in this form in 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.420
 which for example you have what surname for 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.030
 Kiselev yes if you write Kiselev then 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:23.100
 there will not be given to you through this insurance policy if 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.960
 you will it to say that you 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.610
 wrong 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.210
 that is, wrongly written that is and and 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.160
 they are very different at the very 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.610
 business 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.170
 so be careful with this so 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.150
 here is an online application form you are waiting for one 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.120
 a day until you answer later two 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.750
 things will surely tell you are ready 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.690
 bring 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.120
 temporary evidence they cite 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.510
 flesh 380 rubles 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:58.140
 wait and then another month and 10 days for you 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.160
 leads a constant pole and then already 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.340
 all you will not need anything I hope 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.410
 I helped you hope someone will decide 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.710
 change policy because with the old 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:15.600
 probably already walk 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:20.660
 good not very cool that's thanks for 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.660
