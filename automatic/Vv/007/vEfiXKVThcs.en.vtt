anything<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.860> Bluetooth<00:01:11.869> there<00:01:12.869> we<00:01:12.990> go

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.039 

popping<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.369> connected<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.180> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
popping up it's connected and that's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.899 
popping up it's connected and that's
pretty<00:01:19.320> much<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.590> I've<00:01:20.009> connected<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.549> before

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
pretty much it I've connected it before

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.880 
pretty much it I've connected it before
if<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> asks<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.630> for<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> passcode<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
if it asks you for a passcode it's just

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.740 
if it asks you for a passcode it's just
four<00:01:23.100> zeros<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.640> most<00:01:23.970> bluetooth<00:01:24.390> devices

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
four zeros like most bluetooth devices

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.679 
four zeros like most bluetooth devices
and<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:26.220> about<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and that's about it so now you can just

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.870 
and that's about it so now you can just
play<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.170> music<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.310> created

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
play some music and I just created

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.920 
play some music and I just created
something<00:01:30.119> quickly<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.630> GarageBand<00:01:31.229> I

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
something quickly in GarageBand I

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.870 
something quickly in GarageBand I
control<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> volume<00:01:34.229> right<00:01:34.619> here

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.800 

you<00:01:41.880> can<00:01:42.060> also<00:01:42.210> do<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.630> same<00:01:42.950> right<00:01:43.950> here

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.480 

actually<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> apologize<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.740> doesn't<00:01:50.280> move

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
actually I apologize that doesn't move

actually I apologize that doesn't move
the<00:01:50.670> volume<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.060> actually<00:01:51.479> moves<00:01:51.690> the<00:01:51.900> track

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the volume that actually moves the track

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.100 
the volume that actually moves the track
to<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> next<00:01:52.770> track<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:53.700> iOS<00:01:54.299> 8<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.840> actually

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
to the next track in iOS 8 I actually

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560 
to the next track in iOS 8 I actually
use<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.770> before<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.490> iOS<00:01:56.790> 7<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.240> appeared

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
use this before with iOS 7 it appeared

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
use this before with iOS 7 it appeared
to<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> volume<00:01:58.050> so<00:01:58.320> maybe<00:01:58.470> they<00:01:58.619> made<00:01:58.740> some

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
to do the volume so maybe they made some

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.639 
to do the volume so maybe they made some
changes<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.690> but<00:02:00.690> let's<00:02:00.869> play<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.229> again

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
changes there but let's play that again

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.040 
changes there but let's play that again
we<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.580> hear<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> different<00:02:03.300> song<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.720> created

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
better strangely enough you will get a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.060 
better strangely enough you will get a
little<00:03:21.780> bit<00:03:21.930> more<00:03:22.049> bass<00:03:22.350> out<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.709> this<00:03:22.859> just

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
little bit more bass out of this just

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.009 
little bit more bass out of this just
due<00:03:23.220> to<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.489> size<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.390> drivers<00:03:24.840> but

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
due to the size of the the drivers but

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.680 
due to the size of the the drivers but
otherwise<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:26.430> okay<00:03:26.760> and<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.239> definitely

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
otherwise it's okay and it's definitely

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.380 
otherwise it's okay and it's definitely
worth<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.019> $15<00:03:28.950> anyway<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:29.910> sure<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.180> check
