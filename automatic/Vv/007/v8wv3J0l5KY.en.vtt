00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:07.210

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.230
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com when
mercedes-benz wanted to make a full size

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.250
SUV the result was the seven-seat
gl-class

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.720
now the GL 550 see here top sufferings
that includes the diesel GL 320

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.220
and BHEL 450 and this video gonna take
you over how it drives a look at

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.450
somebody interior features

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.030
but check out our other video for an
overview of seating and cargo space

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.310
right away it's really easy to tell the
GL is a Mercedes

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.570
the logo on our test car is so big the
logos and other cars stay awake at night

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.489
wondering when this will accompany them

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.519
rest assured though that the logo on the
GL 450

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.749
is a bit smaller the back sort things
out nicely with that in the Boxee

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:47.879
endings that really define an SUV like
the Cadillac Escalade at the Lincoln

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.569
Navigator

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:51.579
this GL 550 as monster 21-inch wheels

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.639
that means your kids friends might think
you're the course mama down the block

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:59.399
your kids will still think you're
old-fashioned and stingy inside leather

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.379
wood trim abound

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.579
I'm actually everything's pretty well
arranged now there's another rapping on

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.680
top of the dashboard and stuff on the
steering wheels release of one thing we

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.450
are crazy about his glove compartment
cover

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.380
by keyword: meets the dashboard others
remain consistent gap is it comes up

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.570
an eighty thousand dollar SUV that's not
something you really wanna see

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.770
recognition buttons are simple they
really get when you press it down

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.120
the climate thousand cells have a little
bit clunky feel when you turned

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.810
Mercedes needs to send a memo to the
rest the auto industry that says

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.440
look you don't need to put silver plated
plastic all over your center controls

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.760
plain old black and still look very good
but doesn't look so that is a navigation

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.150
system

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.450
the graphics are really pixelated and
there's no touchscreen interface instead

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.960
you have to use these tiny little
buttons

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.440
alongside another awkward control is the
overhead map light

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.150
you think they're here seeing as the
buttons are here but they're actually

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.060
appear

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.370
underneath the rear view mirror and
they're not really very bright at night

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.360
either visibility in back as great pics
below headrests and the large side and

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.960
rear windows

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.610
but for full size SUV side there's a
smaller Justin Bassett

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.710
now under the hood is the v8 from the
s-class there's a seven-speed automatic

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.520
that you shift using this electronic
stock and the steering wheel

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.409
it's a pretty seamless operation and
what's nice is so short summer the gears

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:08.750
are

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.230
which gives you access to Quikr experts
to move right past the semis on the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.790
highway

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.129
now overall jails a handsome SUV that's
also quite capable

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.659
in the year so it's been our liabilities
proven pretty bad but it's not very good

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:20.819
for the Escalade either

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.709
that's the jails primary competitor this
SUV we think is pretty well constructed

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.780
it looks good on the inside the outside
and it's fun to drive to

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.950
says a pure luxury cars you can afford
something in this price range it's

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.650
probably worth checking out for
additional information on this car or

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.319
any other

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.139
got a car start com on our blog kicking
tires
