00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
could even have taken the the eye shadow

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.029 
could even have taken the the eye shadow
along<00:05:21.449> the<00:05:21.599> lower<00:05:21.750> lash<00:05:21.840> line<00:05:22.199> as<00:05:22.320> well<00:05:22.470> but<00:05:22.979> I

along the lower lash line as well but I

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.969
