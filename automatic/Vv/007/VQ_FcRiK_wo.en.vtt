really<00:00:06.540> really<00:00:06.839> long<00:00:07.109> time<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.880> decided

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
really really long time so I decided

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.610 
really really long time so I decided
that<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.719> was<00:00:09.870> going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> make<00:00:10.200> one<00:00:10.260> on

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
that I was going to make one on

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
that I was going to make one on
something<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.190> I'm<00:00:11.460> doing<00:00:11.750> really

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
something that I'm doing really

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.110 
something that I'm doing really
different<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.290> hair<00:00:13.320> it's<00:00:14.000> going<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.059> be

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
different to my hair it's going to be

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.609 
different to my hair it's going to be
hot<00:00:15.389> more<00:00:15.570> drastic<00:00:16.049> than<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.289> ever<00:00:16.379> has<00:00:16.590> been

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.519 
hot more drastic than it ever has been
before<00:00:16.800> and<00:00:17.390> I<00:00:18.390> figured<00:00:18.900> why<00:00:19.230> not<00:00:19.260> make<00:00:19.500> a

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
before and I figured why not make a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
before and I figured why not make a
video<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.189> since<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.850> haven't<00:00:21.000> had
