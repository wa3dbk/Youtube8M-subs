00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 after the strong accident recorded 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.270
 yesterday on the road toluca ex la huaca 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 ricardo compean aid coordinator 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.349
 of the red cross Toluca delegation gave to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.179
 know that it is already part of the 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.400
 most dangerous roads between 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.750
 roads we have three roads that 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.609
 they have always presented an index 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.650
 important accident 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.359
 this is the temascaltepec highway the 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.029
 Mexican-Toluca highway and obviously by 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.260
 its density of circulation also the 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.590
 distant road waka 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:32.900
 they are not relatively 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.820
 strong the impacts we have had 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.620
 however, good if they are of the three 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 roads that more problematic 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.070
 present in a matter of accidents 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.840
 vehicular the holiday period is 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.820
 where there are more incidents about 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.739
 this road despite this the 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.150
 Mexico-Toluca continues to lead the 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.340
 greater number of accidents 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.290
 registered car registrations 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.510
 institution the main factor that 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.550
 causes accidents in this way are 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.739
 the climatological ones that remember that that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 road presented conceivably to much 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.610
 very important is the whole year in its in 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.309
 the whole year we have presence 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.170
 of important banks of fog and good 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.399
 sometimes the excesses of 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.680
 speed that you get to handle in 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:11.030
 all the roads especially in this 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 Toluca academic water and nobody 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.410
 Temascaltepec however for some 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.810
 motorists the important factor is 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.550
 speeding mainly in 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.860
 the trailers that drive by this 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.890
 road is that we are in 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.229
 busy one and in another we are already many 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.090
 and they do not respect us the limit of 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.440
 good speed on the highway as 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.420
 is in good condition then the 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.909
 problem is from us the drivers 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.690
 depending on how we handle a sign 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.690
 social southern speeding 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.330
 has to do with accidents after 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.210
 the good road is in good condition 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.210
 what he needs me sometimes I see is 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.300
 the signs that you need many 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.010
 signs and cars are the trailers 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:59.410
 they go over or be ugly and very fast is the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.530
 of low indeed take it as the game 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.480
 high and it's not like that everything is and you 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.710
 you need signs with claudia
