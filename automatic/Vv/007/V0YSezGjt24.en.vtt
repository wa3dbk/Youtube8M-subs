00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.440
 it started to erode especially for 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 the video of the day so here I am in 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.599
 my garden we will meet after 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.910
 elsewhere for the video I take advantage of 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.870
 this to tell you how to explain 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.029
 why are not there a video these two 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.609
 last days just the redis eats 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:27.869
 not when you saw in the day set 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.460
 I thought you are the sale on Friday 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 and saturday so we really did and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.110
 the two nights so tell me I was 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.660
 not in a position to shoot a video and 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.010
 I do not necessarily want and as I 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 start from the principle like youtuber noise 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.739
 than to make videos only when 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.800
 I want it 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 I did not do it yesterday then ben the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.379
 file was corrupted in fact of the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.090
 video of the day I shot the same 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.590
 video that today to my files of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.370
 corrupted yesterday so I could not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.780
 applaud what I could not avoid 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.199
 so today I'm returning the video of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.910
 day from yesterday the same thing so a 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.640
 subscriber asked me where a subscriber in 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.189
 made sure management there is especially of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 new acts sir the good cat on 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:11.880
 the cat us on the cat or in a dream a 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 asked in today's video be 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.810
 style thing if I could enjoy 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.710
 a video 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.299
 if I could enjoy a video of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.229
 day to talk about mac os x 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.759
 factor and that I received at the same time 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.990
 that the package so the answer is yes 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.570
 so I'm going to do that today I 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.670
 found it was a good idea 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.070
 it's better than what I told him about 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.329
 two I do not know what else excuse me 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.210
 if I look down what is the cat 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.990
 who gives me only listens to the villa 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 and when young man has it they give me 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 claw shots provides the line 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 listened to 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.840
 so you have proof that they do not like 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.860
 really neither known 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.290
 and so here I go right away 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.689
 in my room to continue this 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.590
 video she has right now so that's like 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.880
 I told you we are in my 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.000
 room I still can not see if 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.590
 a carton of my keyboard and 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.960
 and so that's why I do not have 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.550
 decided on this video why I 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.850
 decided earlier to make this video in 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.260
 city ​​of the day just because I have 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.150
 not order a doubling this time 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.590
 I chose factory and I do not think that 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.900
 it was worth a whole video it will be 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.209
 quickly introduced so here I was returning 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.180
 camera so here I had like a 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.500
 duck so I'm going to enjoy and this by 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.450
 piece what I bought in your mouth 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.709
 of trial the spreaders so I 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.550
 ordered a spreader also thousand letters 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:36.750
 like this so it's a little ev focus 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.750
 of voice it is a simple housing in 6 mm 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.860
 with a little word say no Zionism 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.610
 and I have great hope too because they 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.310
 made me think of their delusions going 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 we wanted to take a tunnel while 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.830
 simple you know ah yeah I'm going 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.970
 not dwell on all the pieces 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.130
 used simple steel 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.360
 surgical is still in the boxes 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.360
 like that here then comes night 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.209
 jean company would have these are our voices 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.019
 are disgusting because I had to 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.959
 working out stuff and where the 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.989
 ja was crying a short woman 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.690
 then I ordered this so gave up 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.360
 you know the idron species of elk 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.400
 a slip in progress but for the expands 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.380
 the some other that other sensors 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.030
 in Geneva it is not because I have 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.370
 there you can tell at the default 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.640
 of always the hypers in vain of 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.700
 always make them fall 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.780
 and since then only found 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 then I ordered a lot of rings 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:40.230
 which you depend on this one kim bac all 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.100
 simple threat the mcs any simple she 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.330
 a little pompous but must 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.070
 but I left it once it's after 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.570
 a like that still simple too 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.720
 so just years so I recommended some 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.720
 fairly simple waves this time 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.720
 here 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:07.920
 a little small for this brief duty 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.850
 a ring like this one like this cyclo 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.200
 which is also so julia so 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.720
 it was a novelty until October 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.250
 I will test 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.489
 yes, I have three more in all 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:25.350
 case an image was not the andes and I 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.350
 found me cac40 lease on the name 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.560
 then one like that so it's down there 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.910
 frankly I'll never give it enough 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.720
 often 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.420
 so it's a ring she's not 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.490
 completely closed in fact I suspect 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.580
 a little style so I'm talking about traces 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:44.290
 of water but not if I can to a mass 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.060
 hot so here I have the same not bad 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.240
 often sanofi in as surgical 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.980
 it's not bad and so is everything 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.270
 is there so not if they 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.390
 do not know that they are doing a site 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.040
 piercing one can order plenty of 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.230
 different things and paiva carter everything 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.340
 that and it's really really cheap 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.230
 to tell you the waves 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.200
 I think the most expensive country to pay that 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.910
 must be this one maybe to 4 or 4 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.470
 euros 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.600
 she is where and then I ordered 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.100
 this one here but who does not have it too much with 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.180
 a little too big in fact I would have 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.040
 differently on the serious image then 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.430
 I ordered my full but as 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.910
 I say it's really full of 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:28.090
 piercing accessories from the real 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.130
 the one who stands up all that I put in 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.080
 made for maxime will actually find I 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.160
 put the game but that his head had led as 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.210
 I do not have a normal golden ball 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.160
 because I speak to you I prefer that we 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.010
 put it that's more practical actually the 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.890
 long, so that's how much power there is 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.030
 full full full full full I have not 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:54.720
 all the same how I had already 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:57.940
 left the wii so that's it really 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.620
 small and it's really convenient because 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.220
 that it costs nothing at all so I think 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.870
 one like that the green like any simple 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:11.860
 I had to call there but I think about 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.360
 changes aim to pay her 13 cents 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.330
 or all of the style that tells me something 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.039
 very satisfied well possible and so 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.340
 so here are the more expensive ones who can see 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.289
 in there 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:24.729
 continue like that it's m in europe it 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.110
 So here we were used before 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:28.900
 that video cuts because I did 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:34.030
 more room it was that to what they 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.770
 did I think so that's all 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:38.560
 for this video of the day 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.050
 already today I do not do much 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.250
 just go after a 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.370
 generator so here's to see 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.820
 of electricity how caps have 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.780
 organized a party with kevin 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.039
 hill did not find and all that 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.450
 finished school at the same time as we did 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:56.530
 so much class and it's a sacred 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:01.660
 evening and we absolutely need 

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:02.590
 electricity lahoud which one has one has 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.810
 someone who lend us a 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.760
 generator so that really really 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.930
 to be well and we will look for that 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.850
 after I will tell you more 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.260
 deepened tomorrow I thought 

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.370
 today no matter how a 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:17.220
 good excuse but I do you have little 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:20.460
 tired and I think of myself and so here we go 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.460
 that's all go
