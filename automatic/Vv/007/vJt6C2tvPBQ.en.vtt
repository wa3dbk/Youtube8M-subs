00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.459 
clad aluminum cable folks I'm telling
you<00:00:59.030> right<00:00:59.210> now<00:00:59.450> if<00:00:59.750> you<00:00:59.870> know<00:01:00.110> what<00:01:00.290> I<00:01:00.320> know

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
you right now if you know what I know

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.970 
you right now if you know what I know
about<00:01:00.739> wire<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:01.850> won't<00:01:02.120> use<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.450> wire<00:01:02.980> okay

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
about wire you won't use that wire okay

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.030 
about wire you won't use that wire okay
so<00:01:04.040> here<00:01:05.000> we<00:01:05.119> go<00:01:05.299> we're<00:01:06.049> testing<00:01:06.590> eight<00:01:06.770> gauge

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
so here we go we're testing eight gauge

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.949 
so here we go we're testing eight gauge

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
voltage drops and gets hot really

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.449 
voltage drops and gets hot really
quickly<00:01:23.869> now<00:01:24.079> look<00:01:24.560> at<00:01:24.679> the<00:01:24.799> temperature<00:01:25.310> of

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
quickly now look at the temperature of

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
hotter and hotter and the voltage drop

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.819 
hotter and hotter and the voltage drop
becomes<00:01:55.429> greater<00:01:55.999> and<00:01:56.270> greater<00:01:56.810> which<00:01:57.560> means

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that the output power of the amplifier

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.769 
that the output power of the amplifier
becomes<00:02:00.590> more<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:01.340> more<00:02:01.429> limited<00:02:02.179> output<00:02:02.689> of
