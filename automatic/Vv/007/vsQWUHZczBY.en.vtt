for us to have this kind of device that
allows<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.280> display<00:01:06.430> such<00:01:07.560> such<00:01:08.560> huge<00:01:09.340> images

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
allows to display such such huge images

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.139 
allows to display such such huge images
in<00:01:10.149> fact<00:01:11.310> traditionally<00:01:12.310> our<00:01:12.399> customers<00:01:12.970> have

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
in fact traditionally our customers have

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.460 
in fact traditionally our customers have
been<00:01:13.180> in<00:01:13.659> in<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.049> in<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.409> industry<00:01:14.950> so<00:01:15.190> it's

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
been in in the in the industry so it's

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.480 
been in in the in the industry so it's
heavily<00:01:17.470> biased<00:01:18.369> towards<00:01:19.350> automotive

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
heavily biased towards automotive

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.749 
heavily biased towards automotive
aerospace<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:22.600> Asia<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:24.250> predominantly

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
aerospace in Asia it's predominantly

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.700 
aerospace in Asia it's predominantly
electronic<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:25.990> is<00:01:26.170> people<00:01:26.380> who<00:01:26.530> make

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
electronic so this is people who make

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.300 
electronic so this is people who make
these<00:01:26.860> plays<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.960> electronic<00:01:29.649> components

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
these plays and electronic components

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.540 
these plays and electronic components
anything<00:01:30.819> that<00:01:31.000> involves<00:01:31.450> lights<00:01:31.720> or<00:01:32.020> objects

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
anything that involves lights or objects

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.940 
anything that involves lights or objects
we<00:01:33.550> want<00:01:34.000> to<00:01:35.369> create<00:01:36.369> new<00:01:36.460> new<00:01:37.090> ways<00:01:37.330> that<00:01:37.950> they

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
we want to create new new ways that they

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.520 
we want to create new new ways that they
can<00:01:39.009> use<00:01:39.340> our<00:01:39.490> technology<00:01:39.789> our<00:01:40.569> traditional

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
can use our technology our traditional

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.120 
can use our technology our traditional
job<00:01:41.830> is<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.580> create<00:01:43.030> images<00:01:43.750> not<00:01:44.409> in<00:01:44.619> real<00:01:44.890> time

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
job is to create images not in real time

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.910 
job is to create images not in real time
but<00:01:45.640> now<00:01:45.880> we<00:01:46.720> want<00:01:46.899> to<00:01:47.020> introduce<00:01:47.140> real<00:01:47.679> time

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
but now we want to introduce real time

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.649 
but now we want to introduce real time
to<00:01:48.130> alp<00:01:48.369> them<00:01:48.670> to<00:01:49.000> design<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.860> product<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:52.119> to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
to alp them to design the product and to

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.619 
to alp them to design the product and to
detect<00:01:52.989> some<00:01:53.950> issues<00:01:54.369> at<00:01:54.879> the<00:01:55.119> beginning<00:01:55.479> of

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:55.629 
detect some issues at the beginning of

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.920 
detect some issues at the beginning of
the<00:01:55.780> process<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:56.979> think

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
the process I think

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.590 
the process I think
the<00:01:59.260> products<00:01:59.770> that<00:01:59.860> we<00:02:00.100> show<00:02:00.310> today<00:02:00.670> LC<00:02:01.300> graph

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
the products that we show today LC graph

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.510 
the products that we show today LC graph
that<00:02:02.500> they<00:02:02.800> really<00:02:03.190> are<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:05.650> result<00:02:06.070> of<00:02:06.220> many

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
that they really are the result of many

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.060 
that they really are the result of many
many<00:02:06.820> years<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.420> experience<00:02:07.990> from<00:02:08.500> our<00:02:08.770> part

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
many years of experience from our part

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.250 
many years of experience from our part
and<00:02:09.460> then<00:02:09.670> keeping<00:02:10.060> up<00:02:10.210> with<00:02:10.330> technology<00:02:10.510> so

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
and then keeping up with technology so

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.980 
and then keeping up with technology so
we're<00:02:11.440> able<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.740> do<00:02:12.040> today<00:02:12.730> what<00:02:13.300> was<00:02:13.480> taking

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
we're able to do today what was taking

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.310 
we're able to do today what was taking
weeks<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:15.100> minutes<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.180> think<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.810> terms<00:02:17.020> of

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
weeks in minutes so I think in terms of

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.060 
weeks in minutes so I think in terms of
a<00:02:18.330> leap<00:02:19.330> forward<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.050> progress<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:21.010> don't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
a leap forward in progress and I don't

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.800 
a leap forward in progress and I don't
think<00:02:21.370> there's<00:02:21.520> many<00:02:21.640> places<00:02:22.030> right<00:02:22.390> now<00:02:22.450> that

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
think there's many places right now that

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.360 
think there's many places right now that
you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.140> improve<00:02:23.500> processes<00:02:24.220> in

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you can improve processes in

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.240 
you can improve processes in
manufacturing<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.750> designing<00:02:26.140> parts<00:02:26.470> but

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
manufacturing and in designing parts but

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.400 
manufacturing and in designing parts but
but<00:02:27.430> certainly<00:02:27.850> what<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.240> shown<00:02:28.540> today<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.990> is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
but certainly what we shown today is is

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.860 
but certainly what we shown today is is
a<00:02:29.440> very<00:02:29.890> big<00:02:30.250> leap<00:02:30.430> forward<00:02:30.820> where<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.720> were

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
a very big leap forward where we were

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.510 
a very big leap forward where we were
saving<00:02:32.140> weeks<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.100> particular<00:02:33.460> task<00:02:35.490> so<00:02:36.490> I

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
saving weeks for a particular task so I

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.490 
saving weeks for a particular task so I
think<00:02:36.820> we<00:02:37.120> were<00:02:37.330> still<00:02:37.390> pulling<00:02:37.990> as<00:02:38.260> much

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
think we were still pulling as much

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.550 
think we were still pulling as much
efficiency<00:02:39.430> out<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.180> out<00:02:40.870> of<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.170> process

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
efficiency out of the out of the process

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.980 
efficiency out of the out of the process
as<00:02:41.710> we<00:02:41.860> can<00:02:42.160> supported<00:02:43.030> by<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.330> technology<00:02:43.960> I

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
as we can supported by this technology I

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.340 
as we can supported by this technology I
think<00:02:44.380> this<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> key<00:02:44.980> thing<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:46.350> we've

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
think this is a key thing that we've

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.320 
think this is a key thing that we've
shown<00:02:47.620> with<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> products<00:02:48.460> is<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.850> people

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
shown with the products is that people

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.890 
shown with the products is that people
are<00:02:49.690> now<00:02:50.020> able<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.710> work<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.900> validate

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
are now able to work and validate

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.770 
are now able to work and validate
designs<00:02:53.670> immediately<00:02:54.670> where<00:02:55.300> where<00:02:55.600> there

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
designs immediately where where there

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.000 
designs immediately where where there
was<00:02:56.070> traditionally<00:02:57.070> there's<00:02:57.280> been<00:02:57.580> a

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
was traditionally there's been a

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.839 
was traditionally there's been a
days<00:02:59.640> weeks<00:03:00.500> been<00:03:01.500> waiting<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.129> discover<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
days weeks been waiting to discover and

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.520 
days weeks been waiting to discover and
if<00:03:02.940> it's<00:03:03.090> discovered<00:03:03.569> too<00:03:03.720> late<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:04.379> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
if it's discovered too late in the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.580 
if it's discovered too late in the
process<00:03:04.739> that<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.909> price<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.720> compounding

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
process that the price is is compounding

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.500 
process that the price is is compounding
so<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> think<00:03:08.040> we<00:03:08.370> were<00:03:09.209> offering<00:03:09.569> tools<00:03:11.510> that

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
so I think we were offering tools that

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.869 
so I think we were offering tools that
even<00:03:12.840> last<00:03:13.080> year<00:03:13.200> weren't<00:03:13.560> available<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.310> it's

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
even last year weren't available so it's

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.520 
even last year weren't available so it's
exciting<00:03:15.390> for<00:03:15.420> us<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:17.250> judging<00:03:18.030> by<00:03:18.060> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
exciting for us and judging by the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.110 
exciting for us and judging by the
people<00:03:19.530> that<00:03:19.680> have<00:03:19.799> seen<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.129> products<00:03:20.549> and

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
people that have seen the products and

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.430 
people that have seen the products and
the<00:03:21.330> show<00:03:21.569> even<00:03:21.840> today<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.530> first<00:03:22.680> day

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
the show even today on the first day

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.050 
the show even today on the first day
existing<00:03:25.440> customers<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:26.280> see<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.819> we've

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
existing customers can see that we've

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.699 
existing customers can see that we've
really<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.860> potential<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.489> there<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:30.290> a<00:03:31.290> much

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
really the potential is there for a much

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:37.760 
really the potential is there for a much
quicker<00:03:34.040> design<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.250> development<00:03:35.610> process
