00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
because again there's probably been

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.830 
because again there's probably been
maybe<00:00:38.190> even<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.550> much<00:00:38.670> as<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> month<00:00:39.180> since<00:00:39.629> this

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
maybe even as much as a month since this

mod<00:00:42.629> allows<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.559> just<00:00:44.219> explore<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
mod allows you to just explore the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.520 
mod allows you to just explore the
entire<00:00:44.850> map<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.360> never<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.379> leave

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
entire map you never have to leave

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.740 
entire map you never have to leave
already<00:00:47.520> explored<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.090> these<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.450> fact<00:00:48.629> we've

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
already explored all these in fact we've

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.910 
already explored all these in fact we've
already<00:00:48.840> explored<00:00:49.110> pretty<00:00:49.260> much<00:00:49.530> everything

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
already explored pretty much everything

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.810 
already explored pretty much everything
so<00:00:50.100> i<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.219> i'm<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> next

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
so i think i'm going to go to the next

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.660 
so i think i'm going to go to the next
place<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:53.010> there's<00:00:53.160> no<00:00:53.309> work<00:00:53.430> there's<00:00:53.579> no

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
place and there's no work there's no

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.979 
place and there's no work there's no
rebel<00:00:53.910> fleet<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.899> go

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
rebel fleet so we can just going to go

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.220 
rebel fleet so we can just going to go
over<00:00:55.020> wherever<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.829> want<00:00:56.840> that's<00:00:57.840> nice<00:00:58.050> we're

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
over wherever we want that's nice we're

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
over wherever we want that's nice we're
probably<00:00:58.379> gonna<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.710> blown<00:00:58.829> up<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.340> here

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
probably gonna get blown up right here

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.610 
probably gonna get blown up right here
actually<00:00:59.789> considering<00:01:00.780> we<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.230> new

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
actually considering we have a new

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.229 
actually considering we have a new
sector<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.980> space<00:01:02.070> your<00:01:02.460> sensors<00:01:02.760> pick<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
sector of space your sensors pick up a

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
sector of space your sensors pick up a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
large cruiser class ship your crew

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
reports an incoming transmission we have
no<00:01:08.189> interest<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.760> doing<00:01:08.820> business<00:01:09.030> with

anyone outside of our own race we find

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.100 
anyone outside of our own race we find
it's<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> lot<00:01:11.520> safer<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:12.000> way<00:01:12.030> you're<00:01:12.960> about

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it's a lot safer that way you're about

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
it's a lot safer that way you're about

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you receive another transmission we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.690 
you receive another transmission we
cannot<00:01:16.140> trust<00:01:16.380> your<00:01:16.680> race<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.130> must<00:01:17.340> destroy

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
cannot trust your race we must destroy

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
cannot trust your race we must destroy
you<00:01:18.000> before<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.990> try<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> destroy<00:01:19.650> us<00:01:19.830> they

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
you before you try to destroy us they

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280 
you before you try to destroy us they
cut<00:01:20.220> transmission<00:01:20.520> Wow<00:01:21.090> fantastic<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.110> I'm

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
cut transmission Wow fantastic so I'm

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.080 
cut transmission Wow fantastic so I'm
gonna<00:01:22.439> definitely<00:01:22.590> pause<00:01:22.890> right<00:01:23.130> away<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.490> saw

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.350 
briefly before they started a cloak they
had<00:01:25.680> eight<00:01:25.920> crystal<00:01:26.610> people<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> looks

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
had eight crystal people and it looks

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.450 
had eight crystal people and it looks
like<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.540> combat<00:01:28.200> drone<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.680> coming<00:01:28.979> down<00:01:29.159> and

interesting okay so it's just a combat
drone<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.869> boarding<00:01:40.229> drawn<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.500> least

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
drone it's not a boarding drawn at least

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.319 
drone it's not a boarding drawn at least
so<00:01:40.860> that's<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.220> let's<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.820> full<00:01:42.030> power<00:01:42.060> on

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
so that's good let's go full power on

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.380 
so that's good let's go full power on
the<00:01:42.570> shields<00:01:43.579> we've<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.909> our<00:01:45.030> lasers

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
evasion not bad evasion I'm kind of

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.039 
evasion not bad evasion I'm kind of
worried<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:02.939> missiles<00:02:03.360> looks<00:02:03.899> like

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
worried about these missiles looks like

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.480 
worried about these missiles looks like
there's<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.290> least<00:02:04.740> maybe<00:02:04.950> one<00:02:05.189> missile

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
there's a least maybe one missile

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.059 
there's a least maybe one missile
launcher<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.149> missiles<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.259> laser

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
launcher that missiles so that laser

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.949

what<00:02:09.579> do<00:02:09.670> we<00:02:09.700> got<00:02:09.849> there<00:02:09.999> far<00:02:10.390> away<00:02:10.479> fire<00:02:10.719> fire

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
what do we got there far away fire fire

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.129 
what do we got there far away fire fire
how<00:02:11.349> does<00:02:11.469> he<00:02:11.530> misses<00:02:12.209> nope<00:02:13.209> that's<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.540> crystal

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:14.139 
how does he misses nope that's a crystal

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.140 
how does he misses nope that's a crystal
beam<00:02:14.469> weapon<00:02:14.889> of<00:02:15.010> some<00:02:15.189> sort<00:02:15.219> so<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:16.659> just<00:02:16.840> uh

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
beam weapon of some sort so we just uh

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.580 
beam weapon of some sort so we just uh
for<00:02:19.150> damn<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.659> like<00:02:19.749> a<00:02:19.840> crystal<00:02:20.109> missile

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
for damn it's like a crystal missile

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.119 
for damn it's like a crystal missile
yikes<00:02:21.450> I've<00:02:22.450> got<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.599> breach<00:02:22.900> and<00:02:23.319> shields<00:02:24.010> are

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
yikes I've got a breach and shields are

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.459 
yikes I've got a breach and shields are
down<00:02:24.159> by<00:02:24.430> two<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:25.569> we've<00:02:25.689> got<00:02:25.840> two<00:02:25.989> mantises

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
down by two and we've got two mantises

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.619 
down by two and we've got two mantises
so<00:02:26.650> this<00:02:26.799> will<00:02:26.920> be<00:02:27.010> fun<00:02:27.189> to<00:02:27.310> repair<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.879> don't

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
so this will be fun to repair I don't

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.379 
so this will be fun to repair I don't
think<00:02:28.659> we're<00:02:28.840> gonna<00:02:28.900> be<00:02:29.079> able<00:02:29.109> to<00:02:30.180> get<00:02:31.180> a<00:02:31.209> whole

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
think we're gonna be able to get a whole

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.030 
think we're gonna be able to get a whole
laser<00:02:31.599> crystal<00:02:32.139> is<00:02:32.439> I'm<00:02:32.560> gonna<00:02:32.709> wait<00:02:32.829> for<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
laser crystal is I'm gonna wait for the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.140 
laser crystal is I'm gonna wait for the
glade<00:02:33.219> beam<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.549> be<00:02:33.670> up<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.909> the<00:02:34.000> off<00:02:34.120> chance

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
glade beam to be up on the off chance

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.000 
glade beam to be up on the off chance
that<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.569> can<00:02:34.659> actually<00:02:34.870> kind<00:02:35.620> of<00:02:35.650> trade<00:02:35.859> all

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
that we can actually kind of trade all

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.420 
that we can actually kind of trade all
shields<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.669> then<00:02:36.760> get<00:02:36.879> the<00:02:36.969> glaive<00:02:37.150> beam<00:02:37.359> off

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
shields and then get the glaive beam off

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.770 
shields and then get the glaive beam off
but<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.519> next<00:02:39.790> volley<00:02:40.030> from<00:02:40.269> them<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.659> going

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
but the next volley from them is going

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.849 
but the next volley from them is going
to<00:02:40.870> be<00:02:40.930> brutal<00:02:42.870> alright<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.049> we're<00:02:44.500> ready<00:02:44.650> so

that<00:03:20.409> evasion<00:03:20.790> oxygens<00:03:21.790> down<00:03:22.030> apparently

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
that evasion oxygens down apparently

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.300 
that evasion oxygens down apparently
because<00:03:23.229> of<00:03:23.349> the<00:03:23.409> breach<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:23.979> it's<00:03:24.129> coming

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
because of the breach but it's coming

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.729 
because of the breach but it's coming
back<00:03:24.489> up<00:03:24.549> should<00:03:25.150> be<00:03:25.500> should<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.680> be

back up should be should it not be
what's<00:03:27.400> going<00:03:27.579> on<00:03:27.609> with<00:03:27.729> oxygen<00:03:30.030> yeah<00:03:31.030> those

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
what's going on with oxygen yeah those

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.539 
what's going on with oxygen yeah those
breaches<00:03:31.569> are<00:03:31.659> just<00:03:31.810> taking<00:03:31.989> oxygen<00:03:32.439> out

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
breaches are just taking oxygen out

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.559 
breaches are just taking oxygen out
alright<00:03:33.549> quickly<00:03:33.939> let's<00:03:34.150> try<00:03:34.329> to<00:03:34.389> get<00:03:34.509> another

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
alright quickly let's try to get another

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.069 
alright quickly let's try to get another
fire<00:03:34.870> off<00:03:35.049> oh<00:03:35.939> it's<00:03:36.939> auto<00:03:37.090> fire<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.509> perfect<00:03:37.840> ok

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
fire off oh it's auto fire in perfect ok

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.839 
fire off oh it's auto fire in perfect ok
and<00:03:38.290> we<00:03:38.829> won't<00:03:38.919> go<00:03:39.069> here<00:03:39.280> in<00:03:39.430> here<00:03:39.759> and<00:03:41.849> we're

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
and we won't go here in here and we're

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.089 
and we won't go here in here and we're
down<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.060> one<00:03:43.299> leave<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:44.139> glaive<00:03:44.439> beam<00:03:44.739> can

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:45.099 
down to one leave the glaive beam can

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.179 
down to one leave the glaive beam can
penetrate<00:03:45.699> I<00:03:45.819> almost<00:03:46.599> sure<00:03:46.859> so<00:03:47.859> let's<00:03:48.009> just

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:48.189 
penetrate I almost sure so let's just

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:52.619 
penetrate I almost sure so let's just
try<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:50.650> three<00:03:50.889> damage<00:03:51.299> we<00:03:52.299> can<00:03:52.419> hit<00:03:52.509> the

really<00:05:53.620> display<00:05:54.130> through<00:05:54.370> so<00:05:55.240> I<00:05:55.800> don't<00:05:56.800> know

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
really display through so I don't know

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.280 
really display through so I don't know
though<00:05:57.040> victory<00:05:57.940> through<00:05:58.150> association<00:05:58.780> maybe

00:05:59.280 --> 00:05:59.290 
though victory through association maybe

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.010 
though victory through association maybe
I<00:05:59.320> should<00:05:59.470> just<00:05:59.530> go<00:05:59.710> back<00:05:59.740> to<00:05:59.950> playing<00:06:00.070> regular

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
I should just go back to playing regular

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.010 
I should just go back to playing regular
regular<00:06:02.020> mode<00:06:02.440> I<00:06:03.540> don't<00:06:04.540> play<00:06:04.630> the<00:06:04.750> skin<00:06:04.900> to

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
regular mode I don't play the skin to

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.350

wats<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.260> lot<00:06:05.380> of<00:06:05.440> fun<00:06:05.880> although<00:06:06.880> the<00:06:07.030> infinite

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
wats a lot of fun although the infinite

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.420 
wats a lot of fun although the infinite
space<00:06:07.570> pods<00:06:07.810> pretty<00:06:08.080> cool<00:06:08.229> too<00:06:08.410> and<00:06:08.620> I<00:06:09.220> think<00:06:09.370> I

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
space pods pretty cool too and I think I

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.469 
space pods pretty cool too and I think I
could<00:06:09.550> have<00:06:09.640> done<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.760> lot<00:06:09.850> better<00:06:09.910> if<00:06:10.180> I<00:06:10.240> hadn't

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
could have done a lot better if I hadn't

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:11.460 
could have done a lot better if I hadn't
