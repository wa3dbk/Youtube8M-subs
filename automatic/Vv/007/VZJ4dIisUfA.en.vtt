my akashi

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.990 
my akashi
traded<00:00:37.829> food<00:00:38.370> waste<00:00:39.110> into<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> soil<00:00:40.500> and

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
traded food waste into the soil and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.100 
traded food waste into the soil and
sometimes<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.150> question<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.629> asked<00:00:42.930> when<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
sometimes the question is asked when I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.079 
sometimes the question is asked when I
just<00:00:43.409> marry<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.769> food<00:00:43.980> waste<00:00:44.190> directly<00:00:44.870> well

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
the beneficial microbes in the Bokashi

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.849 
the beneficial microbes in the Bokashi
do<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.329> fermentation<00:00:52.109> process<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> we

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
do that fermentation process that we

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.090 
do that fermentation process that we
talked<00:00:53.160> about<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:55.320> material<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.890> ready

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
talked about and the material is ready

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.889 
talked about and the material is ready
to<00:00:56.370> go<00:00:56.519> to<00:00:56.579> compost<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.420> quickly<00:01:02.300> and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.660> 10

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to go to compost very quickly and the 10

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.020 
to go to compost very quickly and the 10
days<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.289> so<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.009> to<00:01:05.190> ferment<00:01:05.429> in<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
days or so you want it to ferment in the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.150 
days or so you want it to ferment in the
bucket<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.259> couple<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.710> weeks<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
bucket and then a couple of weeks in the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.749 
bucket and then a couple of weeks in the
soil<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.539> you'll<00:01:09.750> have<00:01:09.929> dark<00:01:10.289> rich<00:01:10.649> ready<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
soil and you'll have dark rich ready to

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:14.540 
soil and you'll have dark rich ready to
go<00:01:11.880> soil<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.929> do<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> typical<00:01:13.740> composting

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
go soil if you do a typical composting

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.469 
go soil if you do a typical composting
aerobically<00:01:15.619> it's<00:01:16.619> 3-4<00:01:17.460> months<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.300> get<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
aerobically it's 3-4 months to get to

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.200 
aerobically it's 3-4 months to get to
the<00:01:18.720> same<00:01:18.960> place<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> it's<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.939> very

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the same place so it's just a very

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
the same place so it's just a very
efficient<00:01:21.900> way<00:01:48.079> kocchi<00:01:49.079> during<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.649> winter

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
efficient way kocchi during the winter

efficient way kocchi during the winter
time<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:51.270> fact<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.750> little<00:01:51.990> section<00:01:52.200> I'm

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
time in fact this little section I'm

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.069 
time in fact this little section I'm
going<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.649> dig<00:01:52.860> up<00:01:53.009> right<00:01:53.219> here<00:01:53.430> for<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.820> was

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
going to dig up right here for you was

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
going to dig up right here for you was
added<00:01:55.079> about<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> week<00:01:55.649> ago<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.520> it's<00:01:56.670> only

underneath but here the moisture was

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.610 
underneath but here the moisture was
still<00:02:20.760> on<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:20.970> surface

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620

the worms love fermented Bokashi food

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:58.160 
the worms love fermented Bokashi food
waste<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.879> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:56.299> you<00:02:57.299> can<00:02:57.450> also<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.989> that

waste so you can you can also see that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.949 
waste so you can you can also see that
the<00:02:58.349> soil<00:02:58.650> is<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.400> loose<00:02:59.849> and<00:03:00.269> it's<00:03:01.200> looking

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
the soil is is loose and it's looking

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.410 
the soil is is loose and it's looking
and<00:03:04.280> it's<00:03:05.280> looking<00:03:05.549> much<00:03:05.730> better<00:03:06.030> for<00:03:06.390> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and it's looking much better for a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:15.289 
and it's looking much better for a
growth<00:03:06.750> medium<00:03:09.890> than<00:03:10.890> this<00:03:11.129> soil<00:03:14.269> which<00:03:15.269> is

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
growth medium than this soil which is

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.949 
growth medium than this soil which is
still<00:03:15.690> fairly<00:03:16.019> hard<00:03:16.470> and<00:03:17.360> lighter<00:03:18.360> in<00:03:18.540> color

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
waste of course those will break down

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.780 
waste of course those will break down
over<00:04:03.599> the<00:04:03.810> years<00:04:03.840> and<00:04:04.230> release<00:04:04.500> calcium<00:04:05.159> so
