00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that it's just all about managing a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.660 
that it's just all about managing a
small<00:01:56.820> number<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.240> humans<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.430> get<00:01:59.610> to

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
small number of humans so you can get to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.310 
small number of humans so you can get to
the<00:02:00.020> wave<00:02:01.020> 7<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.619> finish<00:02:01.890> it

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
the wave 7 and finish it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.660 
the wave 7 and finish it
so<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.470> only<00:02:04.620> in<00:02:04.770> way<00:02:04.890> too<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.280> I'm<00:02:05.340> letting

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
so I'm only in way too and I'm letting

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
so I'm only in way too and I'm letting
the<00:02:05.700> zombies<00:02:06.270> infect<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.230> humans<00:02:07.560> here

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
the zombies infect the humans here

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.630 
the zombies infect the humans here
because<00:02:08.670> it'll<00:02:08.820> be<00:02:08.880> easier<00:02:09.300> on<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.660> me<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.640> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
because it'll be easier on for me and as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.190 
because it'll be easier on for me and as
I<00:02:11.760> go<00:02:11.880> along<00:02:12.000> i'm<00:02:12.240> clicking<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.720> many<00:02:12.870> kringle

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
I go along i'm clicking as many kringle

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.360 
I go along i'm clicking as many kringle
bombs<00:02:13.410> as<00:02:13.530> i<00:02:13.560> can<00:02:13.770> because<00:02:13.920> i'm<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.280> use

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
bombs as i can because i'm going to use

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:23.210 
bombs as i can because i'm going to use
those<00:02:14.550> as<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.940> know<00:02:15.060> as<00:02:15.690> backup<00:02:16.080> measures<00:02:22.220> so

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
those as you know as backup measures so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.820 
those as you know as backup measures so
it<00:02:24.060> looks<00:02:24.330> like<00:02:24.690> i<00:02:24.959> have<00:02:24.990> a<00:02:25.110> good<00:02:25.320> clump<00:02:25.680> of

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
it looks like i have a good clump of

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.740 
it looks like i have a good clump of
humans<00:02:26.190> up<00:02:26.370> on<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.790> north<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> map<00:02:27.480> and

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
humans up on the north of the map and

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.510 
humans up on the north of the map and
that's<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.680> be<00:02:28.770> really<00:02:28.920> easy<00:02:29.040> for<00:02:29.280> me<00:02:29.490> to

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
that's going to be really easy for me to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.250 
that's going to be really easy for me to
manage<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.450> all<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
manage because all I'm going to do is

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.510 
manage because all I'm going to do is
going<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.470> hover<00:02:31.680> around<00:02:31.800> that<00:02:32.160> clump<00:02:32.430> of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
going to hover around that clump of

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.660 
going to hover around that clump of
humans<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.030> kill<00:02:33.540> any<00:02:33.720> zombies<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:34.670> come
