00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.130
 we come to the bkf tv vehicle test in 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.920
 this show in this vehicle test 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.850
 we have a toyota racing toyota 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.850
 tuesay you now 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.390
 we come to the pkf tv vehicle test and 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.920
 In this show we take care of the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.000
 toyota pro so this vehicle is 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.900
 would of course say a lot 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.140
 I know him from somewhere else where the 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.910
 explain you the same, yes it is known 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 that vehicle one sees the silhouette 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.910
 and so on you have the whole 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.260
 ingredient and so on, of course 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.180
 seen a thousand times 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.369
 Clearly the vehicle will be in cooperation 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 Made with fiat that means you know 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.080
 him as the fourth one knows him as a person 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.570
 one knows him also as citroen that is 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.729
 now as a fourth variant of toyota and 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 Toyota said not wrong 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.920
 such a friend said so rich 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.160
 concept there we would like to be there and that 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 the answer is from toyota 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.680
 toyota is the professionals is therefore 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.680
 nothing else like that is that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.350
 commercial vehicle from toyota and as I said 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.350
 proven technology proves the vehicle 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.020
 that is the 94 kw version in the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.539
 high roof version and this vehicle has 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:57.119
 us yes I'll say several hundred already 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.740
 accompanied over 1000 kilometers and we 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.780
 so have nothing to remember it is 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.750
 wonderfully run very reliable and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.729
 with just 77 times liters per 100 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.300
 kilometer to these we are quite good 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.459
 what came to me personally 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.230
 The two were very enthusiastic 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.510
 so push once on the left 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.560
 page and on the right and to 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.560
 loaded optimally 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.710
 and that's how it should be 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.720
 very nice is up here in the higher 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.850
 vehicle that means we have the variant 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.920
 with the high roof an additional compartment 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.990
 with subjects where you still stuff like that 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.760
 can reinbringen small things one but has 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.740
 also a bit nice on the technology 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.630
 thought so thought better and has that 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.790
 better laid because earlier you recognize 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.709
 that was yes, everyone just came up here 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.350
 Excited here is this 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.140
 a proper plastic panel where 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.450
 everything is hidden in it 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.300
 left side much to be solved right side 4 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.739
 so to solve are a total of eight each 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.989
 but it was counted on the right 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.270
 thanks so that means nothing else 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.230
 I have much more here than in 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.300
 some vehicles 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.340
 but what is nice between them 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.320
 we have him so much wheel arches 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.290
 place that cross here a europalette 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.630
 in between fits this 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.370
 Vehicle class, of course, very much 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.200
 important that you name on europallets 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.640
 can and as you already see three 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 So fit across a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.330
 so that's full exploit that 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.830
 only thing you notice at first 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.110
 It must be that you are here a bit 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.150
 under this ball from the partition wall 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.190
 So that means you're in here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.100
 small stop there you have to look 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.480
 that one just holds the right one 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.950
 europalette is the first to take that 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.820
 little space for this partition 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.500
 creates with 1000 to 1200 kilograms 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.739
 Of course, payload is one, too 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.269
 nice thing especially with this size 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.450
 vehicle size and I think with the 94 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.100
 kw So engine power comes with 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.459
 safety even with the weight 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.940
 along very well in the rest has luther 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.880
 We even put the poet to that 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:03.720
 in England in a race series a 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.820
 and what the pictures looked like 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.820
 we introduce you on bkf tv.de 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.510
 disposal that was really hot on the 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.989
 vehicle 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.579
 that was a total of three yes that 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.959
 It was already again and that too 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:18.450
 here from the beautiful location of 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.190
 gambler drinks gmbh in schortens where 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.169
 We were allowed to turn the wise 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.729
 Many many thanks always with 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.240
 no joke aside they are unfortunately 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.640
 empty 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.070
 but that was it from the toyota 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.080
 process that we were allowed to test 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.520
 and i would say vehicle has fun 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.080
 we have many many kilometers 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.900
 done with that and I would say 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.840
 turns on again when it's called bkf tv 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.400
 test and there we are the next vehicle for 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.500
 Test yourself on heart and kidney 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.510
 My name is a long one and behind the name 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.900
 Camera always disturbed and I would say 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.900
 up soon
