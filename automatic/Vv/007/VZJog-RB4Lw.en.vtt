ro I took the idea of him using a pivot
point<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:12.600> turned<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:12.960> look<00:01:13.080> into<00:01:13.380> my<00:01:13.500> own

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
point and I turned to look into my own

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.320 
point and I turned to look into my own
because<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.220> didn't<00:01:14.490> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.730> sound<00:01:14.880> like<00:01:15.000> King

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330

day like I wanted to take his licks and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.190 
day like I wanted to take his licks and
expand<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.140> so<00:01:28.890> I'll<00:01:28.979> show<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.190> what<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.400> did

expand on it so I'll show you what I did

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.310 
expand on it so I'll show you what I did
so<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.320> using<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.710> pivot<00:01:31.920> point

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 

pulling<00:01:37.920> off<00:01:38.100> backwards<00:01:38.730> the<00:01:39.300> string<00:01:39.570> above

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
pulling off backwards the string above

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:47.570 
pulling off backwards the string above
it<00:01:40.050> into<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> open<00:01:41.040> strength

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:59.840 

then<00:01:48.580> I<00:01:48.700> move<00:01:48.909> it<00:01:49.060> up

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.820 

and<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.180> move<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.510> around<00:02:00.630> like<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.050> using

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
and I move it around like that using

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.190 
and I move it around like that using
that<00:02:01.860> first<00:02:02.310> finger<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> pivot<00:02:03.270> point<00:02:03.300> in

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that first finger as a pivot point in

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.150 
that first finger as a pivot point in
between<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.830> play<00:02:05.040> force<00:02:05.960> scales

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.340 

slide<00:02:12.160> them<00:02:12.310> up<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:13.000> to<00:02:13.090> get<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.930> I<00:02:13.960> can<00:02:14.230> move

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
slide them up just to get so I can move

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.400 
slide them up just to get so I can move
the<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.130> pattern<00:02:15.370> around<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:17.170> was<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the the pattern around and that was the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.680 
the the pattern around and that was the
beginning<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.250> lead<00:02:18.460> and<00:02:19.300> I<00:02:19.390> hope<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
beginning of the lead and I hope that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.230 
beginning of the lead and I hope that
gives<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.990> ideas<00:02:20.470> take<00:02:21.190> people's<00:02:21.580> licks<00:02:21.880> and
