00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
well because our nape area is very

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.780 
well because our nape area is very
fragile<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:18.180> sensitive<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:20.250> easy

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
fragile and very sensitive and very easy

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.830 
fragile and very sensitive and very easy
to<00:01:21.450> break<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.250> why<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.689> times

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
to break and this is why a lot of times

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.749 
to break and this is why a lot of times
we<00:01:25.560> don't<00:01:25.650> see<00:01:25.979> our<00:01:26.220> full<00:01:26.759> nape<00:01:27.750> growth

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
we don't see our full nape growth

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.170 
we don't see our full nape growth
potential<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.439> I'm<00:01:31.619> being<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.520> careful

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
potential so here I'm being very careful

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.679

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and as you can see the twists started

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.100 
and as you can see the twists started

and this also prevents single strand
knots

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820

keeps<00:06:35.760> it<00:06:36.060> at<00:06:36.300> a<00:06:36.510> minimal

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100
