or<00:00:28.970> mount<00:00:29.970> them<00:00:30.240> into<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> frame<00:00:31.460> sometimes

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
or mount them into the frame sometimes

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.389 
or mount them into the frame sometimes
in<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.960> situation<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
in the situation of this one this is a

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.850 
in the situation of this one this is a
plastic<00:00:35.880> frame<00:00:36.620> something<00:00:37.620> could<00:00:37.770> have

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
plastic frame something could have

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.400 
plastic frame something could have
happened<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:39.510> accident<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.110> lens

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
happened a little accident in lens

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.959 
happened a little accident in lens
popped<00:00:40.950> out<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:43.250> it<00:00:44.250> always<00:00:44.399> seems<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
popped out and so it always seems that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.450 
popped out and so it always seems that
the<00:00:45.239> lens<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.750> bigger<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> rim<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.340> it

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
the lens is bigger than the rim and it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.279 
the lens is bigger than the rim and it
just<00:00:47.670> doesn't<00:00:48.059> go<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.629> there's<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.870> secret

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
just doesn't go in but there's a secret

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.810 
just doesn't go in but there's a secret
to<00:00:49.410> putting<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.070> here's<00:00:50.250> here's<00:00:50.640> how

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
to putting it in and here's here's how

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.350 
to putting it in and here's here's how
it<00:00:50.940> goes<00:00:51.120> we're<00:00:52.110> basically<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.829> take

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
it goes we're basically going to take

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.569 
it goes we're basically going to take
the<00:00:54.360> temporal<00:00:54.809> side<00:00:54.989> or<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> outer<00:00:56.160> side<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the temporal side or the outer side of

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.000 
the temporal side or the outer side of
the<00:00:56.789> lens<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.329> put<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> into<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> temple<00:00:58.770> part

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the lens and put it into the temple part

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
the lens and put it into the temple part
and<00:00:59.670> see<00:00:59.969> now<00:01:00.120> we've<00:01:00.329> seeded<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.840> lens<00:01:01.050> inside

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and see now we've seeded the lens inside

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.799 
and see now we've seeded the lens inside
the<00:01:01.890> bevel<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.430> then<00:01:03.090> with<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
the bevel and then with a little bit of

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.600 
the bevel and then with a little bit of
pressure<00:01:04.110> see<00:01:04.739> where<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:05.010> thumb<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.430> we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
pressure see where my thumb is we're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
pressure see where my thumb is we're
going<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.760> push<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> front<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:07.080> see<00:01:07.380> how

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
going to push the front in and see how

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.390 
going to push the front in and see how
it<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.189> snaps<00:01:08.970> right<00:01:09.270> in<00:01:09.740> that<00:01:10.740> snapped<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it just snaps right in that snapped it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.539 
it just snaps right in that snapped it
right<00:01:11.580> back<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.090> now<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:12.990> how<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.229> would

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
right back in now that's how we would

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.149 
right back in now that's how we would
take<00:01:14.549> out<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> actually<00:01:15.360> put<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.049> lens<00:01:16.830> into<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
take out I actually put in a lens into a

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.780 
take out I actually put in a lens into a
plastic<00:01:17.610> frame<00:01:17.729> however<00:01:18.540> metal<00:01:19.170> frames<00:01:19.790> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
plastic frame however metal frames the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.300 
plastic frame however metal frames the
same<00:01:21.000> thing<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.360> happen<00:01:21.420> we<00:01:22.350> can<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.130> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
same thing can happen we can just have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.070 
same thing can happen we can just have
an<00:01:23.430> accident<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> lens<00:01:24.420> might<00:01:24.689> just

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
an accident where the lens might just

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.490 
an accident where the lens might just
pop<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:27.299> course<00:01:27.570> trying

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
pop out like that and of course trying

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.620 
pop out like that and of course trying
to<00:01:28.650> get<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> metal<00:01:29.490> frame<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.270> lens

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
to get it into a metal frame the lens

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.359 
to get it into a metal frame the lens
doesn't<00:01:31.079> stretch<00:01:31.409> or<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> frame<00:01:32.040> doesn't

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
doesn't stretch or the frame doesn't

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.179 
doesn't stretch or the frame doesn't
stretch<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.150> we're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.079> have<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.530> use<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
stretch so we're going to have to use a

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.450 
stretch so we're going to have to use a
screwdriver<00:01:35.659> to<00:01:36.659> reinsert<00:01:37.140> this<00:01:37.380> lens<00:01:37.619> we'll

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
screwdriver to reinsert this lens we'll

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.999 
screwdriver to reinsert this lens we'll
be<00:01:38.729> able<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.259> reinsert<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> lens<00:01:40.619> just<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
be able to reinsert the lens just like

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.380 
be able to reinsert the lens just like
we<00:01:41.220> did<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> plastic<00:01:41.909> one<00:01:42.060> we're<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.299> to

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
we did the plastic one we're going to

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.460 
we did the plastic one we're going to
put<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> temporal<00:01:43.409> side<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.939> and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
put the temporal side in like so and

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
put the temporal side in like so and
then<00:01:46.470> push<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:46.890> our<00:01:46.979> thumb<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.270> front

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
then push with our thumb on the front

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.910 
then push with our thumb on the front
and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.869> hurt<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.350> heard<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.649> snap

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and then you hurt you heard the snap

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.429 
and then you hurt you heard the snap
that<00:01:50.700> means<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> there<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.780> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
that means it's all in there and of

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.420 
that means it's all in there and of
course<00:01:52.680> we're<00:01:52.829> going<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> take<00:01:53.280> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
course we're going to take the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.580 
course we're going to take the
screwdriver<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.180> we're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.200> tighten

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
screwdriver and we're going to tighten

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.160 
screwdriver and we're going to tighten
it<00:01:55.619> right<00:01:55.680> back<00:01:56.070> up

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.800 

and<00:02:03.359> that<00:02:04.359> is<00:02:04.929> how<00:02:05.200> we<00:02:05.579> reinsert<00:02:06.579> an<00:02:07.360> eyeglass

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
and that is how we reinsert an eyeglass

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:16.400 
and that is how we reinsert an eyeglass
lens

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.470
