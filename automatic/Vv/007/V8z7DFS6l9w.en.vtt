00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.639
 milk becomes fat or lose weight is the 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.529
 Danger 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.619
 I want to talk to you on this video 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.619
 on milk and the complications of its 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.630
 Feed use in day to day is 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.430
 common sense or most of the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 people think that the consumption of milk is 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.269
 with your health 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.289
 when any patient or student in the book 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.059
 digital 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.950
 stay lean with the doctor asks me rock 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.040
 doctor rock milk cow is healthy for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.559
 health or fattening milk slim 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.390
 I usually play with her saying that 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.750
 it's healthy yes but only if you are a 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.879
 calf and leaving good mood a little 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.070
 as breast milk is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.469
 baby 's milk is healthy. 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.899
 healthy for calves our genetics 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.610
 is not adapted for the consumption of 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.579
 cow's milk that generates a series of 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.050
 health problems at present is 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.609
 interesting because the marketing of 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 industry puts milk as food 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.490
 healthy and nutritious and that you are 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.350
 My blog reader already knows what the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 the industry's only concern. 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 food profit and what will the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.000
 studies of high level of evidence 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 concern us with the consumption of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 of cow's milk to human health 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.420
 a recent study by two 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.400
 scientists at Harvard University 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.680
 shows that the benefits attributed to 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.860
 cow's milk as the strongest coast 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.210
 due to calcium present in milk is 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.490
 completely false 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 know that milk consumption can 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.350
 lead to more fragile bones that increase the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.380
 risk of fractures in adult children 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.259
 the elderly may also increase the risk of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.630
 cancer and fat because the milk is 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.240
 rich in actor 11 a sugar that besides 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.000
 lead to insulin in the blood leads to 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.149
 series of problems for many children and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.860
 adults such as lactose intolerance 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.360
 can lead to colic diarrhea 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.009
 intestinal inflammation 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.040
 according to the degree of intolerance of each 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.170
 one that varies and as if the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.119
 regular consumption of milk can lead to 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.610
 other problems such as bleeding 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.380
 intestinal and children can lead to 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.780
 anemia and iron deficiency 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.570
 and can often be a bleeding 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.460
 may not appear in the stool 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.980
 milk can also increase the 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.160
 incidence of spines on the skin 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.800
 also incidence of migraine from asthma 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.270
 allergies and 15 more than the 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.000
 skin change 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.620
 a recent study showed that consumption 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.470
 sporadic cow's milk 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.660
 about twice a week increases the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.370
 risk of developing type 2 diabetes in 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.680
 33% 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.230
 I already know if the consumption is regulated around 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.500
 five times a week the risk of you 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.200
 developing type 2 diabetes rises to 66 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.250
 percent a scary number is not 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.500
 same 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.500
 consumption of skimmed milk is 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.270
 even worse than whole milk 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.060
 because you remove the natural fat from the 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.910
 milk and adds disguised sugars 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.240
 fattening and leaving quickly with 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.250
 famine because there is no society without fat and 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.960
 this favors the consumption of carbohydrates 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.340
 refined as breads sweet pastries 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.890
 hindering and even hindering you 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.240
 enjoy healthy and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.920
 sustainable 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.040
 Another serious problem is the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.930
 of hormones present in cow 's milk 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.790
 Do you have any idea how much hormone you have? 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.380
 ingest when taking a glass of 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.500
 Milk because I'll tell you 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.430
 about 60 different types of 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.230
 hormones 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.600
 This is because the cows that 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.180
 produce milk are usually pregnant 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.820
 and this huge amount of hormones 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.020
 will certainly deregulate your 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.880
 hormonal metabolism 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.130
 antibiotics that these poor people 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.380
 kitties I take for usually they are 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.900
 with the inflamed teats of both milking 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.390
 which causes infections and the producers 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.820
 antibiotics in them because they 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.790
 milk production can not stop 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.070
 then the great response is this the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.470
 milk becomes fat and makes you ill 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.170
 and still has more to not let 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.280
 This very long cast video I'm going to 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.350
 staying here 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.940
 and then I'll do another one 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.130
 video cast for this subject so 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.989
 important to finish understand that 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.270
 Cow's milk is not good for your health 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.970
 cause a series of problems like you 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.470
 watched along this video cast 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.820
 I prefer the consumption of dairy products 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.040
 with cheese 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.810
 bush natural curd and that son 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.630
 also try to know the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.790
 of these dairy products that you will consume 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.440
 avoiding the most industrial and 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:39.540
 preference for organic dairy products 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.640
 liked the video 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.610

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.140
