one like those me bout ease to video so

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.429 
one like those me bout ease to video so
maybe<00:00:24.150> that's<00:00:24.300> just<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.630> one<00:00:24.840> off<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.050> something

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
maybe that's just a one off of something

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.279 
maybe that's just a one off of something
that<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:26.480> glitches<00:00:27.480> happen<00:00:27.779> every<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that a glitches happen every now and

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.359 
that a glitches happen every now and
again<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:30.500> the<00:00:31.500> tracks<00:00:31.859> are<00:00:32.009> definitely

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
again but the tracks are definitely

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.530 
again but the tracks are definitely
looking<00:00:32.520> better<00:00:34.610> like<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.760> actual<00:00:36.120> track

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
looking better like the actual track

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.889 
looking better like the actual track
itself<00:00:36.989> it's<00:00:37.410> looking<00:00:37.860> dirtier<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.149> more

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
itself it's looking dirtier and more

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.850 
itself it's looking dirtier and more
used<00:00:40.469> than<00:00:41.090> in<00:00:42.090> previous<00:00:42.510> mo<00:00:42.870> GP<00:00:43.230> games<00:00:43.379> which

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
used than in previous mo GP games which

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.060 
used than in previous mo GP games which
is<00:00:44.040> always<00:00:44.219> good<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.500> as<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is always good and as you can see the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.020 
is always good and as you can see the
person<00:00:47.550> who's<00:00:47.670> playing<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.420> at<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.690> moment

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
person who's playing this at the moment

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
person who's playing this at the moment
isn't<00:00:51.030> gun<00:00:51.660> pulls<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> done<00:00:52.680> for<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
isn't gun pulls out and done for a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.549 
isn't gun pulls out and done for a
decent<00:00:53.370> lap<00:00:53.760> time<00:00:54.289> just<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.469> much

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
decent lap time just pretty much

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.240 
decent lap time just pretty much
cruising<00:00:56.190> round<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:58.039> unfortunately<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
cruising round and unfortunately the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.099 
cruising round and unfortunately the
foot<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> still<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.390> wrong<00:01:00.539> way<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
foot is still going the wrong way and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.660 
foot is still going the wrong way and
maybe<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:02.039> something<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.340> they're

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
maybe that's something that they're

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.200 
maybe that's something that they're
working<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.519> fixin<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.729> when<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> games

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
working on and fixin to when the games

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.609 
working on and fixin to when the games
actually<00:01:06.420> released<00:01:06.930> maybe<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.380> what<00:01:07.530> is

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
actually released maybe that's what is

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
actually released maybe that's what is
delayed<00:01:07.950> out<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.430> maybe<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> something

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
delayed out of a maybe it's something

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.429 
delayed out of a maybe it's something
you<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.170> choose<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.920> game<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.450> can

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
you can choose in the game and you can

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.630 
you can choose in the game and you can
now<00:01:13.590> fever<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.220> race<00:01:15.740> or<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> proper<00:01:17.490> one

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
now fever the race or the proper one

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.950 
now fever the race or the proper one
that<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.939> MotoGP<00:01:18.509> goes<00:01:19.290> use<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
that the MotoGP goes use or just the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.010 
that the MotoGP goes use or just the
road<00:01:21.960> animation<00:01:23.390> I'm<00:01:24.390> hoping<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
road animation I'm hoping that is

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.070 
road animation I'm hoping that is
something<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.250> fixed<00:01:27.090> or<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.689> you<00:01:27.840> can

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
something that is fixed or that you can

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.039 
something that is fixed or that you can
change<00:01:28.439> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:29.299> but<00:01:30.299> I'll<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.930> wait

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
change in the game but I'll have to wait

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.240 
change in the game but I'll have to wait
and<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:32.240> sound-wise<00:01:33.500> up<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.979> being<00:01:35.130> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
and see sound-wise up see it being a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.569 
and see sound-wise up see it being a
game<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.880> never<00:01:36.329> going<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:37.710> realistic

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
game is never going to be that realistic

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.910 
game is never going to be that realistic
obviously<00:01:39.450> has<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.960> made<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.619> digital

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
obviously has to be made in a digital

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.080 
obviously has to be made in a digital
form

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
form

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.430 
form
but<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.180> will<00:01:44.330> be<00:01:44.390> interesting<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:45.020> see<00:01:45.170> how

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
but it will be interesting to see how

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.460 
but it will be interesting to see how
the<00:01:45.500> full<00:01:46.490> stroke<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:49.240> DLC<00:01:50.240> bikes<00:01:50.720> sound<00:01:51.140> if

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
the full stroke and DLC bikes sound if

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.200 
the full stroke and DLC bikes sound if
they<00:01:51.530> sound<00:01:51.980> just<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.400> same<00:01:52.640> as<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:53.000> current

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
they sound just the same as the current

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.870 
they sound just the same as the current
bikes<00:01:54.040> definitely<00:01:55.040> looking<00:01:55.280> for<00:01:55.460> to<00:01:55.640> seeing

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
bikes definitely looking for to seeing

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.390
