00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
they're terrible but something that's

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
they're terrible but something that's
totally<00:01:05.580> immeasurable<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.200> making

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
totally immeasurable and I'm just making

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.440 
totally immeasurable and I'm just making
up<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.920> theory<00:01:08.310> right<00:01:08.490> now<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> think<00:01:08.970> fights

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
up this theory right now I think fights

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
up this theory right now I think fights
mean<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.619> team<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.280> Leafs<00:01:11.490> than

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
mean more to a team like the Leafs than

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.429 
mean more to a team like the Leafs than
it<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.150> team<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.510> with<00:01:13.110> all<00:01:13.290> due

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
it does to a team like that with all due

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.109 
it does to a team like that with all due
respect<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.920> Frazer<00:01:14.159> McLaren<00:01:14.280> because<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.909> have
