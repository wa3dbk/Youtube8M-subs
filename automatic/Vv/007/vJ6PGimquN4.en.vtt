00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.140
 because 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.940
 yea 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.089
 8 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.040
 Paulo 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.849
 right 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 it's part 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:16.189
 O 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.679
 tel 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:22.809
 I consider it to be a very large charge on our part only in the 

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:26.179
 Considering the worth the load on this land a tip 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.980
 but it is Christ himself speaks in the father's house there are many addresses that follow the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.580
 rounds 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.220
 and if we think it through 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.630
 a very Spiritist doctrine of Moscow and minds of many moments 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.809
 here we go only in our galaxy 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.549
 we discovered the 640 area banned so far these areas 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.520
 plus the new themes that make up your luck Mercury Venus Land and Mars 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 jupiter saturn uranus and neptune 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.550
 furthermore 640 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.830
 although they are gaseous giant planets ah can not have a life goes on 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.229
 follow the logic our science seeks 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.569
 a planet with similar conditions adopted so far for 35 years nothing 

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:16.329
 Prevents equipment even near cacanatan that is what we are going to 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:17.229
 meet 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.050
 with temperatures that already range from 500 to 1,500 grams in the profiles 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.560
 put an end to life 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.170
 beyond the product spirit nor does it teach us that there are no planets 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.090
 there is no end 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.470
 own land shelter jets 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.350
 inscribed certainly are the ones who stayed seventh for certain 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.600
 period of time 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.400
 resources we will eliminate in the suburb and after having clarified so far the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.190
 time they were 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.720
 little more than a magic or feel would have fought to follow 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 this kind of event, but keep quiet in the analysis of the subscribers so that our 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.450
 planet too 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.040
 but we are not aware of the dangers specific issues to the new year 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.490
 but you are the one who wants to ask questions in the book of spirits 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.490
 issues of 55 years and 58 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.740
 holy them 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.969
 72 to 68 each time the goal of speaking of other worlds as 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:22.249
 would be life in those other moments we have agilize we have a great 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.609
 the commander of gararu mount the islanders of the chapel we have the letters 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.309
 of a francis francisco's death charlie was where the boy's mother 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:36.900
 neighboring relatives ailments of the world on the side of our state to soar mm and 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.380
 evolution in two groups a chapter 13 is also mentioned c13 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.240
 it is also mentioned the life in other worlds 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.379
 we can not forget that we are eternal skin 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.699
 today we are on earth but where we have been anticipating direct 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.380
 When he arrives at San Miguel 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.720
 is not evolutionarily such that our civilization ps can no longer 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.299
 meet our deeds 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.129
 marked Christ even spoke two thousand years ago the father's house many coins 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.889
 in the book of the spirits in the hour explains 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:14.999
 also this is registered in one of these characters I have already mentioned some of the 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:18.239
 works is not and it is up to him to form one of the serious 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:23.960
 but were the most famous sea and in the best of its time 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.490
 also discuss this with the Corinthians 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.049
 and it was one of his possibilities 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.709
 without counting also they would inform account of this program has time that 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.170
 also noted 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.510
 we think in the vicinity of the earth's atmosphere 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.029
 not too difficult for us to go together but it will be very very arrogant 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.809
 Our part is yes 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:49.779
 thousands or millions and 1 billion other civilizations in the most varied 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:54.999
 some more backward than in others at a very similar level. 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:59.650
 ibolt taste the most advanced others many more advanced sea 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.400
 others where the body is no longer dense like ours, this occurs 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.349
 precisely by the day I was also a little less intense than our sun 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:08.859
 have referred to bankruptcy 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.630
 therefore there are many dwellings and many tenants 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.540
 for the three universities 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.699
 that is what I could answer to this question 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:17.789
 not 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.340
 delivery 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.930
 it's part
