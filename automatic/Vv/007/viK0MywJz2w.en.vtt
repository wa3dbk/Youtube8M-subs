pocket<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.800> we<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.400> so<00:02:07.940> what<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.180> see

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
pocket that we have here so what you see

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.960 
pocket that we have here so what you see
here<00:02:08.660> is<00:02:08.720> actually<00:02:09.320> the<00:02:09.890> gore-tex<00:02:10.520> membrane

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
here is actually the gore-tex membrane

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.740 
here is actually the gore-tex membrane
itself<00:02:11.660> which<00:02:11.990> is<00:02:12.020> part<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.070> outer<00:02:13.970> fabric

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
itself which is part of the outer fabric

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.980 
itself which is part of the outer fabric
so<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:16.070> comparison<00:02:16.460> with<00:02:16.970> every<00:02:17.450> other<00:02:17.600> type

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
so in comparison with every other type

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.660 
so in comparison with every other type
of<00:02:18.020> membrane<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:18.920> every<00:02:19.160> other<00:02:19.190> type<00:02:19.640> of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
of membrane and every other type of

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.450 
of membrane and every other type of
construction<00:02:20.350> this<00:02:21.350> construction<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.280> the

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
construction this construction is the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.550 
construction this construction is the
most<00:02:22.670> complicated<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:23.690> expensive<00:02:24.050> to

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
most complicated and expensive to

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.520 
most complicated and expensive to
manufacture<00:02:24.920> and<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:26.360> also<00:02:26.510> provides<00:02:27.200> the

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
manufacture and it also provides the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.380 
manufacture and it also provides the
best<00:02:27.740> waterproofing<00:02:28.640> with<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:28.970> least<00:02:29.180> amount

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
best waterproofing with the least amount

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.200 
best waterproofing with the least amount
of<00:02:29.690> soaking<00:02:30.580> anytime<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.730> have<00:02:31.820> a<00:02:31.880> removable

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
of soaking anytime you have a removable

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.570 
of soaking anytime you have a removable
membrane<00:02:33.020> or<00:02:33.230> a<00:02:33.260> free-floating<00:02:33.830> membrane<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
membrane or a free-floating membrane the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.060 
membrane or a free-floating membrane the
outer<00:02:34.760> fabric<00:02:35.390> can<00:02:36.050> soak<00:02:36.260> up<00:02:36.440> quite<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.770> bit<00:02:36.980> of

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
outer fabric can soak up quite a bit of

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.370 
outer fabric can soak up quite a bit of
water<00:02:37.370> but<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.150> doesn't<00:02:38.570> happen<00:02:38.750> with<00:02:39.170> the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
water but that doesn't happen with the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.700 
water but that doesn't happen with the
gore-tex<00:02:40.340> pro<00:02:40.880> shell<00:02:41.200> yeah<00:02:42.200> this<00:02:42.410> one<00:02:42.590> is

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
gore-tex pro shell yeah this one is

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.280 
gore-tex pro shell yeah this one is
actually<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:43.130> removable<00:02:43.730> collar<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.960> you<00:02:45.020> can

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
actually a removable collar so you can

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.680 
actually a removable collar so you can
see<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:48.170> like<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.860> removable<00:02:49.690> interlining

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
see so like the removable interlining

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.980 
see so like the removable interlining
you<00:02:51.320> have<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> removable<00:02:51.950> triplex<00:02:52.730> collar<00:02:53.120> so

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
you have a removable triplex collar so

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.470 
you have a removable triplex collar so
you<00:02:54.530> can<00:02:54.680> really<00:02:54.920> vary<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.550> warmth<00:02:55.880> that<00:02:56.090> you

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
you can really vary the warmth that you

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.140 
you can really vary the warmth that you
know<00:02:56.920> based<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.160> your<00:02:58.340> combination<00:02:59.030> of

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
know based on your combination of

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.310 
know based on your combination of
interline<00:02:59.540> is<00:02:59.810> an<00:02:59.960> ex<00:03:00.110> kinare<00:03:00.680> inner<00:03:01.010> lining

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
interline is an ex kinare inner lining

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.810 
interline is an ex kinare inner lining
it's<00:03:03.320> much<00:03:03.680> more<00:03:03.890> plush<00:03:04.250> than<00:03:04.550> the<00:03:04.700> inner

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
it's much more plush than the inner

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.610 
it's much more plush than the inner
lining<00:03:05.060> that<00:03:05.360> we've<00:03:05.600> used<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.110> other<00:03:06.260> rather

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
lining that we've used on other rather

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.080 
lining that we've used on other rather
products<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:08.450> can<00:03:08.600> see<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.350> bit<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:09.950> fleece<00:03:10.820> on

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
products you can see a bit of fleece on

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.880 
products you can see a bit of fleece on
the<00:03:11.270> interior<00:03:11.600> as<00:03:12.050> well<00:03:12.080> as<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> normal

quilting<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.239> we<00:03:14.870> basically<00:03:15.110> did<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.860> if

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
quilting and we basically did that if

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.070 
quilting and we basically did that if
somebody's<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.239> spend<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.600> money<00:03:17.780> for

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:11.340 

so<00:04:00.940> that's<00:04:01.180> closing<00:04:01.690> it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.530 

also<00:04:12.190> show<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.460> about<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.970> self<00:04:13.240> healing

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
also show you about the self healing

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.990 
also show you about the self healing
properties<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.530> zipper<00:04:14.890> if<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.730> close

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
properties of the zipper if you close

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.140 
properties of the zipper if you close
the<00:04:16.240> zipper<00:04:16.709> normally<00:04:17.709> if<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.280> break<00:04:19.120> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
the zipper normally if you break a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.260 
the zipper normally if you break a
zipper<00:04:19.690> open<00:04:20.110> you<00:04:20.800> can<00:04:21.280> it's<00:04:21.940> pretty

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
zipper open you can it's pretty

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.190 
zipper open you can it's pretty
much<00:04:22.450> done<00:04:22.810> right<00:04:23.610> so<00:04:24.610> not<00:04:25.330> that<00:04:25.510> it's<00:04:25.690> easy<00:04:25.870> to

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
much done right so not that it's easy to

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.380 
much done right so not that it's easy to
do<00:04:26.410> but<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.900> break<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.350> zipper<00:04:29.590> open<00:04:30.390> it's

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
do but if you break the zipper open it's

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.990 
do but if you break the zipper open it's
self<00:04:31.690> healing<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.950> simply<00:04:33.220> move<00:04:33.580> it<00:04:33.760> back

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
self healing so you simply move it back

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.330 
self healing so you simply move it back
to<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.390> bottom<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.470> then<00:04:35.710> up<00:04:35.830> to<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.070> top

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
to the bottom and then up to the top

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.120 
to the bottom and then up to the top
again<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:37.030> it's<00:04:37.960> completely<00:04:38.290> sealed<00:04:38.860> you
