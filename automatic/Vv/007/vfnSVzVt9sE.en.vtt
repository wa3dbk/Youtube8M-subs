every time i was putting it on it felt a
little<00:01:58.100> greasy<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:58.670> he<00:01:58.909> dried<00:01:59.390> in<00:02:00.350> a<00:02:00.500> matter

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
little greasy but he dried in a matter

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.889 
little greasy but he dried in a matter
of<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.830> second<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.460> i<00:02:01.520> just<00:02:01.700> love<00:02:01.819> that<00:02:02.090> me<00:02:02.300> and

of a second and i just love that me and
i<00:02:03.380> wanted<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.800> design<00:02:04.100> something<00:02:04.369> very

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
i wanted to design something very

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.149 
i wanted to design something very
similar<00:02:05.210> for<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.600> hair<00:02:05.810> that<00:02:06.500> wouldn't<00:02:07.009> wear

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
similar for the hair that wouldn't wear

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.650 
similar for the hair that wouldn't wear
the<00:02:07.250> hair<00:02:07.399> down<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.940> wouldn't<00:02:08.360> make<00:02:08.600> it

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
the hair down that wouldn't make it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.690 
the hair down that wouldn't make it
greasy<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:09.440> that<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.069> would<00:02:10.190> feel<00:02:10.369> like<00:02:10.519> you

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
greasy and that you would feel like you

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.750 
greasy and that you would feel like you
always<00:02:10.940> enhance<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.170> sheen<00:02:12.560> and<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.580> fact

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
always enhance the sheen and the fact

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880 
always enhance the sheen and the fact
that<00:02:13.790> it's<00:02:14.000> in<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.150> spray<00:02:14.600> you're<00:02:15.290> not<00:02:15.590> limited

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
that it's in a spray you're not limited

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.680 
that it's in a spray you're not limited
in<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.400> amount<00:02:16.489> that<00:02:16.880> you<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.330> put<00:02:17.540> you

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
in the amount that you have to put you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.350 
in the amount that you have to put you
if<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:17.930> put<00:02:18.080> a<00:02:18.110> couple<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.709> palms<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:20.239> know

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
if you put a couple of palms you know

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.890 
if you put a couple of palms you know
here<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.780> there<00:02:20.840> keeping<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.850> ends<00:02:23.030> a<00:02:23.480> little

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
here and there keeping the ends a little

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.630 
here and there keeping the ends a little
separated<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:24.709> to<00:02:24.860> give<00:02:25.040> it<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.160> kind<00:02:25.340> of

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
separated just to give it that kind of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.940 
separated just to give it that kind of
lightness<00:02:26.090> to<00:02:26.120> it<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.660> little<00:02:27.560> bit<00:02:27.769> on<00:02:27.860> the

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
lightness to it a little bit on the

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.289 
lightness to it a little bit on the
route<00:02:28.100> you<00:02:28.130> wouldn't<00:02:28.549> know<00:02:28.610> exactly<00:02:29.030> where<00:02:29.269> to

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:29.299 
route you wouldn't know exactly where to

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:30.520 
route you wouldn't know exactly where to
put<00:02:29.510> it<00:02:29.540> because<00:02:29.780> basically<00:02:29.959> most<00:02:30.350> of<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
put it because basically most of the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.289 
put it because basically most of the
time<00:02:30.739> where<00:02:30.980> do<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.519> to<00:02:31.610> shine<00:02:31.820> where<00:02:32.180> do

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
time where do you want to shine where do

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.030 
time where do you want to shine where do
you<00:02:32.359> want<00:02:32.690> that<00:02:32.840> kind<00:02:33.019> of<00:02:33.170> feel<00:02:33.350> it's<00:02:33.769> always

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040

you want that kind of feel it's always
on<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.250> surface<00:02:34.670> most<00:02:34.970> of<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.180> time<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.019> it's

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
on the surface most of the time so it's

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.630 
on the surface most of the time so it's
a<00:02:36.290> very<00:02:36.320> easy<00:02:36.620> product<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.190> use<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.549> i'm<00:02:37.609> very

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
a very easy product to use and i'm very

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.729 
a very easy product to use and i'm very
proud<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.269> actually<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:38.840> can<00:02:38.989> see<00:02:39.200> from

proud of it actually as you can see from

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.250 
proud of it actually as you can see from
the<00:02:39.890> volume<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.220> she<00:02:40.400> had<00:02:40.519> before<00:02:41.049> all<00:02:42.049> the

the volume that she had before all the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.120 
the volume that she had before all the
