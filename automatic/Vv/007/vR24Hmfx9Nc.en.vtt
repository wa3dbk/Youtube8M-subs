00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.250
 guys hello my name is romance 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.500
 Vladimir I want to show you today 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.559
 thing but maybe some of course 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.140
 Seen know about it this is called 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.440
 return and why you need it 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.530
 so that the man who got lost in the forest 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.460
 pull him back to the point where he is 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.620
 what is at stake 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.690
 let's see we test and and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.690
 directly on the spot namely in the forest 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.759
 and so here we turn on waiting for now 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 he has already found the satellite here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.149
 we press in the middle a button 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.130
 pushed the blue light comes on it 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.159
 means that we remember this place 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.450
 all now we turn it off our car 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:35.700
 it is worth the least beginning we go to the forest 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:39.240
 demonstrate how this works 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.950
 return in a like me that year 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 got lost 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.890
 a very unpleasant feeling of course i 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:50.850
 arrived at the old Vladimir tract 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.990
 the road the road went in the forest she walked between 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.509
 two villages the village were somewhere 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.009
 kilometers ten from each other and between 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.979
 they walked the road 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:07.649
 she walked through the forest like this 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:10.229
 same as now here so i want there 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.110
 should look he was collecting coins was 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.220
 one coin was going to darrow 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.290
 and the time is already mushroom was and something 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.010
 I will hide once the road saw a mushroom 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.049
 and went one stroke 2 3 4 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.670
 and I walked along the road so as not to 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:32.609
 get lost in the forest for the media absolutely 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:37.200
 stranger and so out of the way gathered 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:40.109
 package union with this package I understand that 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.250
 I do not accept where I am where my 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:44.670
 the road to the left to the right that's just been me 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.269
 this 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.230
 return or it is quite simple me 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.200
 took it 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 he brought the car yes he is not of course there 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.049
 some swamps there and so on there 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.879
 similar but the direction is quietly dirty tricks 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:04.910
 that's enough so we went to 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.270
 we are in the forest 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.090
 imitate 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.430
 after we seem to lose the device here 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.640
 he was off 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:17.820
 Now we will turn it on and so I 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 turned on and it will now be while the arrows 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.220
 Here I have for the arrows dude 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 go somewhere 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.600
 comes back we turn around 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.210
 go back so he arrows immediately 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.540
 switched forward to the direction of who 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.280
 direction we go so I will not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 I will disconnect to show real 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.230
 time arrows as they work and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.520
 on these arrows we will now 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.320
 I don't want to go out after groups 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.250
 go up since there is a path here yes I 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.400
 I'll just show you how it works. 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:54.680
 so here we have directly output here 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.680
 straight line we turn on go 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.500
 things really work I'm by no means 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:08.480
 don't advertise 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.609
 but everyone who collects mushrooms collects 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.920
 coins in the woods 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:16.229
 must have i also have the same 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.500
 there in the Arkhangelsk region there faces 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:22.610
 these are not the faces that are here 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.789
 us near Moscow there and some in the districts 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.880
 there if you get lost it will be assholes 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:33.180
 sorry for the expression so this thing 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:39.300
 everyone should be involved 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:41.910
 such things so here we have direct 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.099
 line let's just imitate i like 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.560
 I would not like to expand straight 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:48.660
 turn go the other way as 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.630
 it will work about dedicate switched 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.820
 like dude where are you back we are again 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.699
 back turn around go all again 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.699
 straight line goes straight 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:08.280
 so when there will be 50 meters from goal and 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:12.860
 goals we have won it light now! 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:16.560
 light blue should help 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.389
 at 50 meters it will flash apr 20 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:23.270
 meters she in my opinion if not mistaken 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.270
 will just burn and look like that 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:40.650
 and their hands are frozen 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:45.300
 but we will carry out the end experiments now 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.990
 car about not fired up a new box 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.550
 and here it is blinking 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.800
 she doesn't light up blue she just 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.840
 skip and blink when we go 20 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.789
 meters home life 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.789
 crap will burn. blue 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.800
 Well, here we are at the car, so it caught fire 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:08.129
 in blue we are all at the goal here it is 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.550
 thanks to all the car who watched 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:13.610
 be sure to subscribe the channel and me 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:17.159
 very young support 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:20.389
 young beginners like doing 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:25.370
 metal search sometimes for 4 year in my 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:25.370
