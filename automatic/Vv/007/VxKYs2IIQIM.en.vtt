00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
grip to track the layout the place is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160 
grip to track the layout the place is
very<00:00:17.250> nice<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.850> fans<00:00:18.119> there<00:00:18.390> are<00:00:18.420> very

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
very nice the fans there are very

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.060 
very nice the fans there are very
enthusiastic<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:21.350> little<00:00:22.350> bit<00:00:22.470> memories<00:00:22.949> from

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
enthusiastic a little bit memories from

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.580 
enthusiastic a little bit memories from
there<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:24.180> i<00:00:24.330> said<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.630> nice<00:00:24.869> nice

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
there and like i said this nice nice

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.390 
there and like i said this nice nice
country<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> go

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.940 

the<00:00:33.270> most<00:00:33.510> rigorous<00:00:33.750> palace<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> first<00:00:34.650> part

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the most rigorous palace the first part

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.380 
the most rigorous palace the first part
of<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.360> circuit<00:00:36.780> shows<00:00:36.990> very<00:00:37.590> faster

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
of the of the circuit shows very faster

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.650 
of the of the circuit shows very faster
Gordon<00:00:42.680> with<00:00:43.680> us<00:00:43.950> as<00:00:44.190> well<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.330> tricky

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
Gordon with us as well that's the tricky

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.770 
Gordon with us as well that's the tricky
one<00:00:45.810> when<00:00:45.990> you<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.980> few<00:00:47.790> corners<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.600> row

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
one when you have a few corners in a row

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.840 
one when you have a few corners in a row
especially<00:00:49.620> high<00:00:49.740> speed<00:00:50.070> corners<00:00:50.310> if<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
especially high speed corners if you

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.400 
especially high speed corners if you
miss<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> little<00:00:51.360> be<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> first<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.050> one

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
miss a little be the first one this one

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.140 
miss a little be the first one this one
would<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.620> bad<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.040> so<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.700> I<00:00:53.790> think<00:00:54.030> those

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
would be bad and so on and I think those

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.060 
would be bad and so on and I think those
fifths<00:00:54.630> of<00:00:54.720> fish<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.230> our<00:00:55.350> corners<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.980> a

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
fifths of fish and our corners in a

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.230 
fifths of fish and our corners in a
whirlwind<00:00:56.310> in<00:00:56.970> Sector<00:00:57.450> one<00:00:57.630> there<00:00:59.060> that's<00:01:00.060> why

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:00.240 
whirlwind in Sector one there that's why

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.670 
whirlwind in Sector one there that's why
we<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.540> doing<00:01:00.690> free<00:01:00.840> practice<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.560> then

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
we are doing free practice and then

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.380 
we are doing free practice and then
trying<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.130> qualifying<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.760> get<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
trying in a qualifying to get the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:16.760 
trying in a qualifying to get the
perfect<00:01:03.600> love

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.460 

usually<00:01:17.770> when<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:18.190> are<00:01:18.690> not<00:01:19.690> have<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.230> paddle

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
usually when you are not have to paddle

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.700 
usually when you are not have to paddle
a<00:01:20.710> lot<00:01:20.890> in<00:01:21.400> in<00:01:21.880> the<00:01:22.000> middle<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.630> field<00:01:23.350> and

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
a lot in in the middle of the field and

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.740 
a lot in in the middle of the field and
usually<00:01:24.490> on<00:01:24.640> a<00:01:24.760> better<00:01:24.970> position<00:01:25.150> in<00:01:25.660> the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
usually on a better position in the

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.290 
usually on a better position in the
front<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.310> that's<00:01:27.310> obviously<00:01:27.520> what<00:01:27.970> we<00:01:28.120> aim

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
front and that's obviously what we aim

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.170 
front and that's obviously what we aim
for

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.750 

those<00:01:33.990> cough<00:01:34.230> circuits<00:01:34.710> probably<00:01:35.160> so<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.640> a

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
those cough circuits probably so just a

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.200 
those cough circuits probably so just a
bit<00:01:35.910> better<00:01:36.090> than<00:01:36.530> tournaments<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.030> just<00:01:39.030> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
bit better than tournaments and just you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.870 
bit better than tournaments and just you
have<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.620> be<00:01:40.620> quite<00:01:40.890> aggressive<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.640> first

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
have to be quite aggressive in the first

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.810 
have to be quite aggressive in the first
part<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.540> suzuka<00:01:43.530> circuit<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
part of the suzuka circuit to to get the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.870 
part of the suzuka circuit to to get the
laptop<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.500> love<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.950> drive<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.220> Formula<00:01:47.580> One<00:01:47.760> car
