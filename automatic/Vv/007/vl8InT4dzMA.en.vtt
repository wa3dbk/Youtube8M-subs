00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.060 
appearance obviously wearing the costume
that<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.359> much<00:00:30.630> more<00:00:30.900> reminiscent<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> one

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.360

very<00:00:35.370> cool<00:00:35.520> figure<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> best<00:00:36.930> Anakin

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
very cool figure and not the best Anakin

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
very cool figure and not the best Anakin
that's<00:00:37.950> been<00:00:38.129> released<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.790> far<00:00:39.090> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
that's been released so far but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.440 
that's been released so far but
certainly<00:00:40.230> not<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.500> worst<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.730> no

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
certainly not the worst and I have no

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
certainly not the worst and I have no
doubt<00:00:42.719> at<00:00:42.899> all<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.440> Hasbro<00:00:43.980> will<00:00:44.129> probably

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
doubt at all that Hasbro will probably

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.369 
doubt at all that Hasbro will probably
milk<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.969> sculpt<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.899> worth<00:00:45.960> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
milk this sculpt for what it's worth and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.709 
milk this sculpt for what it's worth and
we'll<00:00:47.100> see<00:00:47.309> multiple<00:00:47.820> releases<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.390> this<00:00:48.539> one

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
we'll see multiple releases of this one

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.650 
we'll see multiple releases of this one
later<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.110> down<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> line<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:51.000> before<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.480> get

either<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:41.489> only<00:02:41.670> thing<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:41.880> don't<00:02:41.940> really

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
either and the only thing I don't really

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.670 
either and the only thing I don't really
like<00:02:42.390> about<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:43.019> is<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.440> lack<00:02:43.650> of

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
like about it is the lack of

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
like about it is the lack of
articulation<00:02:44.580> which<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.180> will<00:02:45.360> elaborate<00:02:45.720> on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
articulation which I will elaborate on

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.930 
articulation which I will elaborate on
in<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.080> moment<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.560> but<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.400> than<00:02:47.580> that<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
in a moment and but other than that the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.809 
in a moment and but other than that the
overall<00:02:48.150> sculpt<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.750> really<00:02:49.110> nice<00:02:49.290> and<00:02:49.819> the

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
overall sculpt is really nice and the

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.020 
overall sculpt is really nice and the
outfit<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.540> incredibly<00:02:52.049> accurate<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.970> I

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
outfit is incredibly accurate and as I

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.090 
outfit is incredibly accurate and as I
said<00:02:54.299> it's<00:02:54.840> very<00:02:54.930> reminiscent<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:55.950> one

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
said it's very reminiscent of the one

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.970 
said it's very reminiscent of the one
that<00:02:56.250> he<00:02:56.310> wears<00:02:56.519> in<00:02:57.420> Episode<00:02:58.170> three<00:02:58.200> Revenge

first<00:03:45.500> push<00:03:45.830> from<00:03:46.040> motion<00:03:47.800> well<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:48.890> can<00:03:49.070> see

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
first push from motion well you can see

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.790

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
ankles which is the biggest letdown

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.110 
ankles which is the biggest letdown
about<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.200> figure<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.530> my<00:04:27.620> opinion<00:04:27.950> and<00:04:28.130> but

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
about this figure in my opinion and but

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.520 
about this figure in my opinion and but
once<00:04:29.270> again<00:04:29.450> I've<00:04:29.720> said<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:29.990> before<00:04:30.169> many

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
once again I've said this before many

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.140 
once again I've said this before many
times<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:31.040> is<00:04:31.190> one<00:04:31.370> of<00:04:31.400> those<00:04:31.580> figures<00:04:31.940> that

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
times this is one of those figures that

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.300 
times this is one of those figures that
definitely<00:04:32.510> makes<00:04:32.720> up<00:04:33.020> for<00:04:33.290> the<00:04:33.410> lack<00:04:34.280> of

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
definitely makes up for the lack of

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.350 
definitely makes up for the lack of
articulation<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.690> overall<00:04:35.990> sculpt<00:04:37.360> now

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
articulation in the overall sculpt now

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.060 
articulation in the overall sculpt now
the<00:04:38.419> additional<00:04:39.200> accessory<00:04:39.830> that<00:04:39.860> comes

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
the additional accessory that comes

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.060 
the additional accessory that comes
included<00:04:40.310> is<00:04:40.840> a<00:04:41.840> swap<00:04:42.050> out<00:04:42.229> hand<00:04:42.500> for<00:04:42.740> Anakin

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
included is a swap out hand for Anakin

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.130 
included is a swap out hand for Anakin
and<00:04:43.310> we<00:04:44.000> haven't<00:04:44.240> actually<00:04:44.390> seen<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.870> in<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
and we haven't actually seen this in the

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.770 
and we haven't actually seen this in the
series<00:04:45.500> yet<00:04:45.770> but<00:04:46.040> I'm<00:04:46.880> assuming<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.390> this<00:04:47.630> is

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
series yet but I'm assuming that this is

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.210 
series yet but I'm assuming that this is
just<00:04:48.020> something<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.440> they've<00:04:48.680> done<00:04:48.890> for

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
just something that they've done for

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.920 
just something that they've done for
playability<00:04:49.880> features<00:04:50.419> but<00:04:50.600> as<00:04:50.690> you<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.870> see

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
playability features but as you can see

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.800 
playability features but as you can see
I'm<00:04:51.530> on<00:04:52.160> this<00:04:52.340> arm<00:04:52.610> Anakin<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.419> wearing<00:04:53.690> the

I'm on this arm Anakin is wearing the

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.780 
I'm on this arm Anakin is wearing the
glove<00:04:54.080> very<00:04:54.560> similar<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.130> the<00:04:55.280> one<00:04:55.430> he<00:04:55.550> wears
