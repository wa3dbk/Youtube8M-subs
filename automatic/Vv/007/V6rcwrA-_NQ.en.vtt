okay<00:03:32.760> all<00:03:33.120> right<00:03:33.180> I've<00:03:33.660> got<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.110> theory<00:03:34.970> now

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
okay all right I've got the theory now

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:42.970 
okay all right I've got the theory now
do<00:03:36.030> ya

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
very precise yes how long do they mature

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.509 
very precise yes how long do they mature
for<00:04:02.660> minimums<00:04:03.500> in<00:04:03.709> days<00:04:03.950> that<00:04:03.980> will<00:04:04.370> be

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
for minimums in days that will be

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.530 
for minimums in days that will be
maximum<00:04:05.390> three<00:04:06.319> weeks<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.980> when<00:04:07.550> we<00:04:08.209> get<00:04:08.360> them

maximum three weeks and when we get them
back<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:09.140> the<00:04:09.260> caves<00:04:09.470> yes<00:04:09.980> we<00:04:10.340> can<00:04:10.489> age<00:04:10.760> them

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
back to the caves yes we can age them

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.140 
back to the caves yes we can age them
until<00:04:11.690> four<00:04:12.470> weeks<00:04:12.550> okay<00:04:13.550> but<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:13.940> will<00:04:14.120> be

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
until four weeks okay but this will be

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.820 
until four weeks okay but this will be
in<00:04:14.330> the<00:04:14.390> maximum<00:04:14.870> we<00:04:15.080> were<00:04:15.200> able<00:04:15.530> to<00:04:15.560> do

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
in the maximum we were able to do

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.460

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.580 

what<00:04:41.310> that<00:04:41.430> is

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.659 

so<00:04:46.130> what<00:04:46.970> Francois<00:04:47.750> is<00:04:47.990> doing<00:04:48.290> right<00:04:48.560> now

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
so what Francois is doing right now

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:51.340 
so what Francois is doing right now
after<00:04:49.669> he<00:04:50.660> de<00:04:50.900> molde

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
after he de molde

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.990 
after he de molde
the<00:04:51.530> cheese's<00:04:52.010> he's<00:04:53.650> making<00:04:54.650> the<00:04:54.770> right

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
the cheese's he's making the right

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.200 
the cheese's he's making the right
regular<00:04:56.000> as<00:04:56.210> much<00:04:56.570> as<00:04:56.870> regular<00:04:57.350> as<00:04:57.470> possible

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
regular as much as regular as possible

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.850 
regular as much as regular as possible
exactly<00:04:59.240> but<00:04:59.540> you<00:04:59.690> see<00:04:59.900> modeled<00:05:00.530> on<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.680> earth

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
exactly but you see modeled on the earth

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.550 
exactly but you see modeled on the earth
exactly<00:05:01.639> so<00:05:01.970> that<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.270> can<00:05:02.450> evolve<00:05:02.720> regularly

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
exactly so that it can evolve regularly

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.790 
exactly so that it can evolve regularly
as<00:05:04.160> much<00:05:04.430> as<00:05:04.639> possible<00:05:04.820> so<00:05:05.230> he's<00:05:06.230> getting<00:05:06.410> the

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
as much as possible so he's getting the

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.830 
as much as possible so he's getting the
cheese's<00:05:07.280> so<00:05:07.790> he<00:05:07.940> can<00:05:08.090> obtain<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.630> right

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
cheese's so he can obtain the right

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.010 
cheese's so he can obtain the right
shape<00:05:09.370> that<00:05:10.370> we're<00:05:10.580> asking<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.300> him<00:05:11.450> if<00:05:11.840> you

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
shape that we're asking to him if you

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.960 
shape that we're asking to him if you
want<00:05:12.230> to<00:05:12.380> obtain<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:12.830> right<00:05:12.980> texture<00:05:13.520> the

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
want to obtain the right texture the

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.730 
want to obtain the right texture the
right<00:05:14.210> aromas<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.710> cheese<00:05:15.980> you<00:05:17.200> you<00:05:18.200> need<00:05:18.410> to

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
right aromas in a cheese you you need to

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.520 
right aromas in a cheese you you need to
work<00:05:19.250> with<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.610> raw<00:05:19.790> milk<00:05:19.970> yes<00:05:20.530> definitely

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
work with the raw milk yes definitely

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.469 
work with the raw milk yes definitely
better<00:05:21.710> it's<00:05:22.520> very<00:05:22.760> important<00:05:23.240> for<00:05:23.330> you<00:05:23.450> to

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
better it's very important for you to

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:26.290 
better it's very important for you to
work<00:05:23.750> with<00:05:23.780> small<00:05:24.320> producers<00:05:24.860> like<00:05:25.220> this<00:05:25.460> it

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
work with small producers like this it

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.790 
work with small producers like this it
is<00:05:26.360> primordial<00:05:27.250> yeah<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.910> is<00:05:29.060> just<00:05:29.419> basil<00:05:29.960> yeah

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
is primordial yeah it is just basil yeah

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.790 
is primordial yeah it is just basil yeah
because<00:05:31.479> we<00:05:32.479> know<00:05:32.630> exactly<00:05:32.930> how<00:05:33.380> they<00:05:33.560> work

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
because we know exactly how they work

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.350 
because we know exactly how they work
and<00:05:34.130> we<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.060> that<00:05:35.240> they<00:05:35.479> follow<00:05:36.100> our

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
and we know that they follow our
