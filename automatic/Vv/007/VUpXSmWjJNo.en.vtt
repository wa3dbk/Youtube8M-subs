everyone stays away from it as you guys
will<00:03:52.100> see<00:03:52.340> right<00:03:53.239> here<00:03:53.510> I<00:03:53.720> make<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.320> guy<00:03:54.470> stand

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
will see right here I make the guy stand

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.770 
will see right here I make the guy stand
back<00:03:55.190> so<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.579> doesn't<00:03:55.910> glitch<00:03:56.090> out<00:03:56.299> then<00:03:56.660> I

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
back so it doesn't glitch out then I

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.319

press<00:03:57.019> X<00:03:57.350> and<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:58.010> all<00:03:58.220> get<00:03:58.400> teleported<00:03:58.730> on<00:03:59.120> so

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
press X and we all get teleported on so

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.789
