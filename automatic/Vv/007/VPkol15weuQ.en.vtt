through<00:02:48.690> income<00:02:49.140> I'm<00:02:49.440> serious<00:02:49.950> about<00:02:50.190> its

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
through income I'm serious about its

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.940 
through income I'm serious about its
approach<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.360> running<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.959> kind<00:02:52.410> of<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.739> think

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
approach to running and kind of I think

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.289 
approach to running and kind of I think
that's<00:02:53.099> only<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> natural<00:02:53.760> thing<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.060> you<00:02:54.180> get

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
that's only a natural thing is you get

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.550 
that's only a natural thing is you get
into<00:02:54.450> something<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.870> start<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> enjoy<00:02:55.410> it

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
into something you start to enjoy it

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
into something you start to enjoy it
more<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:56.400> want<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.760> kind<00:02:56.910> of<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.299> know<00:02:57.329> go

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
more you want to kind of you know go

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.710 
more you want to kind of you know go
faster<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.829> further<00:02:59.099> be<00:02:59.849> better<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:02.720> started

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
faster go further be better I started

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.330 
faster go further be better I started
running<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:04.049> by<00:03:04.200> basically<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.040> think<00:03:05.160> that

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
running and by basically I think that

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.789 
running and by basically I think that
London<00:03:05.610> transformed<00:03:06.569> itself<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.230> Mike<00:03:07.500> into

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
London transformed itself and Mike into

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.440 
London transformed itself and Mike into
another<00:03:08.010> city<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.940> see<00:03:09.150> different

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
another city you see different

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.210 
another city you see different
characters<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.930> see<00:03:10.049> different<00:03:10.319> people<00:03:10.620> you

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
characters you see different people you

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.559 
characters you see different people you
notice<00:03:11.640> different<00:03:11.760> sights<00:03:12.150> you<00:03:12.390> hear

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
notice different sights you hear

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.759 
notice different sights you hear
different<00:03:12.690> sales<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.379> smell<00:03:13.680> different

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
different sales you smell different

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.640 
different sales you smell different
smells<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.090> therefore<00:03:15.410> nighttime<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
smells and so therefore nighttime is the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.559 
smells and so therefore nighttime is the
time<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.040> Qatar<00:03:17.280> but<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.790> love<00:03:18.000> funny<00:03:18.209> some<00:03:18.450> of

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
time in Qatar but I love funny some of

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.780 
time in Qatar but I love funny some of
the<00:03:18.690> most<00:03:21.170> idea<00:03:22.170> reflective<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:23.130> important<00:03:23.700> to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the most idea reflective is important to

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.640 
the most idea reflective is important to
me<00:03:23.940> because<00:03:24.269> you're<00:03:24.600> always<00:03:24.870> more<00:03:25.170> powerful

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
me because you're always more powerful

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.190 
me because you're always more powerful
in<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> group<00:03:26.489> then<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.389> as<00:03:27.600> individual

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
in the group then you are as individual

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.460 
in the group then you are as individual
I'd<00:03:29.040> say<00:03:29.280> with<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.579> running<00:03:29.880> it's<00:03:30.269> kind<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.660> in

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
I'd say with the running it's kind of in

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.259 
I'd say with the running it's kind of in
order<00:03:31.829> to<00:03:31.950> be<00:03:32.069> a<00:03:32.099> good<00:03:32.280> runner<00:03:32.489> but<00:03:32.910> don't<00:03:33.150> miss

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
order to be a good runner but don't miss

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.330 
order to be a good runner but don't miss
anything<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.810> is<00:03:34.290> something<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.799> can<00:03:34.829> do<00:03:35.099> as

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
anything that is something you can do as

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.190 
anything that is something you can do as
an<00:03:35.549> individual<00:03:36.090> I<00:03:36.299> think<00:03:36.540> you<00:03:36.870> have<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.170> have

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
an individual I think you have to have

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.050 
an individual I think you have to have
support

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
support

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.120 
support
you
