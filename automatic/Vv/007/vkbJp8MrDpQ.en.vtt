00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.400
 Hello company of by a nice question and the previous exchange meeting with press 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 I got it 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.569
 If there is a quick way word to say that 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:16.640
 Where speedup is easy to do is a speed man 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.739
 Where there are two easy balls 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:20.030
 But win 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.520
 Where it is easy for sp to live there where sudan is established 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.480
 It is a question that I ask you to expect it before 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.819
 Though 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.089
 So I thought this was a very easy question 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.680
 And various negative answers come out and it is extremely reference for me 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.999
 After all it takes money from a well-known person 

00:00:37.999 --> 00:00:39.160
 It is interesting 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.200
 Thank you very much for answering miles 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.150
 What is it even though it is red, the answer is 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.840
 I would like to go 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.710
 Well the answer is love 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 Oh, speed up, cheap place and 3 once 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.140
 It is easy to do 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.090
 So I answered that one month ago but it's three eyes 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.390
 You 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.809
 It is always a patch for those two people 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:04.760
 patch 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.920
 If you explain this work 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.010
 I'm sad but worried about good results when I think after cheap 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:11.630
 I am 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.360
 It is common to Komine 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.460
 I think this column is an expert for beginners 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.299
 Though 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.130
 Whether it's a child or what, it's raining and a line to the relationship officials 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.990
 It is feeling in common 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 In that way, I think of things that have such meaning and are presenting 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.040
 It is thing to think about town, too 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.520
 Well then I thought it was definitely not eating 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.009
 I think so 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.050
 Even if everyone wants to live 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.050
 Do you think so 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.960
 that is 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 It is 14 days 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.520
 It's about 20 for us 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.800
 I've been on the 26th 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.420
 So turn it down and you'll be more at ease 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 The chat is at the agency it did 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.380
 So there was a baby boom of a cat growing up looking at it gradually 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.750
 If it's easy to get a speed gun 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.800
 It is easy to speed down this mountain that is getting more and more aggressive 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.179
 It is a place 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:13.849
 And this is basic 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.599
 So this must be understood first and must be understood by the Muskey method 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.589
 I can not think 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.979
 I would like to explain about two high on the basis of that 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:29.069
 First of all, in the second half of 3 that Mr. 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.019
 It's about coming around a lot 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.180
 It will be difficult for the company so we will take a walk 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.389
 The defendant does not know, so please destroy and live 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.059
 If you come back at that time 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.779
 There are not three companies 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.399
 To be precise, there are no three companies. 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:46.639
 It is the point 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.339
 So before it gets hit before it comes 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:53.129
 The controls we know here 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:54.689
 I should be doing 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.369
 So I wonder if it's a little different now 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:02:59.849
 There is also a case that the edge obtained can be slightly off 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.279
 There is a case that stocking is a little too versatile 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.589
 It's a bit behavioral basically you have to unzip the answer 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:07.650
 Because I wanted 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.650
 Oh, it's a bit of a falling frequency 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.909
 It is important for us before 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.400
 Speed ​​control when you see everyone's comments 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.299
 As there were many talks that we could not do, we want to comment there 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.439
 I think 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.709
 Basically from our pet conclusions we 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.939
 I do not think about speeding down with 3-2 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.119
 That's because the speed is getting faster. 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.759
 So here I have to think about speeding down 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:37.759
 I'm thinking of balance and resistance 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.150
 If you can laugh in the south-west, you can come to Ms. 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.299
 When you can afford speed control 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.390
 Nagahama I have been making stable and continuous exchanges 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:53.899
 The station of the station so that 4 teams can surely do when they come to Mariko 

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:57.129
 Let's get ready to seethe 3-propane at the stage 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.639
 I will do everything with that idea 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:04.999
 It was before 

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:06.399
 For example, high 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:09.129
 Looking at the slip of together 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.230
 Breakthrough takes place and basically all 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.559
 I am in the air 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.009
 So there is no adoption of speed 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.790
 So when we run away we balance in the minute air 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:20.970
 With balance 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.259
 I just declare it there 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.550
 And I wanted to buy it when I got -32, but I got 53 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.960
 When speed control 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 Keep balance in another area 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.550
 Then control here 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.259
 It is this repetition 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.259
 It becomes such a way of thinking 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.620
 So far with eighty people 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.139
 It seems sad to reverse, but in fact 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.659
 There is also a way to change the speed by traveling by my brother. 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:52.949
 Though I can not get over it by the joint party in the horse body 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.210
 For example, a tie-up with this service 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.219
 Ecole 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:57.670
 There is a good way 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.030
 But those are a little more versatile 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.170
 So I would like to talk about it again this time 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:07.460
 If it is a rainy treasure like a hole 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.460
 We introduce the basic way of thinking 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.580
 Well, finally from here is the main issue and in light of the hole to the country 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.389
 I would like to represent Mahon, but the plan is again today 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.870
 People who would like to ask questions If you ask questions, everyone will be discussed again 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.139
 I think it was exciting so I want to ask a question 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:26.240
 I think 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.139
 8 Naturally Weighted 3rd Round 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.139
 I want to see a lot of things too 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.810
 Finally it's a relatively gentle slope so it's eco-friendly and slips 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.210
 I can do it and it looks very good looking at this alone 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.650
 But in fact there are challenges in genius 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.879
 It means that ict runaway on a steep slope 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:53.129
 I think that I'm troubled if there is a person at all, so through the town 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.909
 I took up the foot as an issue 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:58.979
 Then I run away on the steep slopes that year 

00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:04.250
 If you can do hard with Tofu and 103, you can overcome 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:05.300
 I thought 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.539
 That's the question this time 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.710
 How can we overcome the 103 problems 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.869
 This is a question 

00:06:12.869 --> 00:06:16.279
 It is a front speed controller that runs away 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:18.709
 It means that you can not do it 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:21.739
 What part of what you did not control 

00:06:21.739 --> 00:06:22.610
 Should i 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.860
 In Tokoen City that I would like you to answer that 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.779
 Let's think about it 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.639
 that try to go with this frequency 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:34.699
 The masters were so, but I want to go out one after another 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:37.889
 If you have the video that the civil engineering still made Sarai Ma 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.900
 I think that I understand the answer 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.139
 Write an answer towards Yamada's comment column 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.430
 Let me think together 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.430
 Thank you 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.539
 1. 

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.599
 is
