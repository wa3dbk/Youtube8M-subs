00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.809
 good morning my friends in Italy and 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.910
 welcome to a smart booking 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.160
 home cam of xiaomi and as you already know 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.619
 from a little let me ample from one's own 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.269
 market to gadgets and accessories of each 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.519
 type and in particular initiated a 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.730
 home automation project and that is 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.440
 making a smart home 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.390
 represented many accessories and for 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.640
 this project we saw the smart 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 socket smart the smart 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 power a smart light bulb we have 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.140
 even saw an air purifier 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.840
 and there is also a lesser known suite of 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 safety with sensors in particular 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.460
 this smartphone 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 obviously as the name implies and deals with 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 of the personal video surveillance of the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.100
 home in truth we will see that it also does 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.670
 many other things 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.260
 let's go well what in what it costs 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 content and packaging here it is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:24.060
 we find our range with one 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:25.490
 protection film here it is 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.579
 we're going to see a little more in detail 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:33.229
 subsequently inside we find the 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:38.060
 charger I have a standard charger 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 from an amp obviously including English 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:48.600
 usb pack inside we also find the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:54.210
 manual on series a for 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.939
 installing the qr code for per 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.290
 mating and of course everything 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.130
 strictly in Chinese and finally the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.130
 usb cable 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.450
 understood sbt occupies in life 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.300
 simply of the power of the 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.490
 smart program with one cable that like 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:23.370
 let's see it is very long indeed 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:26.100
 allow to position the cam in a way 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.750
 much easier however much more 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.610
 long of a standard cable as I was saying 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.940
 it simply deals 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:37.740
 of power on the smart range of 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.990
 facts and connects via wifi to 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.790
 our network is also the update e 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.930
 everything is done through 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.500
 which we do not find in the package 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.870
 nothing else we find later 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.260
 specifications confirm that he is able 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.830
 to record at 720p resolution 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:03.570
 then in hd and a sensor with 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:07.250
 an opening of 2 mm and the support for 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:10.040
 networks wi fi 802.11 abg and n 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.010
 or let's see this in detail 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.709
 this range and has its own stand of 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:22.050
 support that is adjustable in two 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.570
 directions or some photos looked like 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.400
 could be possible to lodge it up 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.810
 a wall but here I see that it is only of 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.880
 rubber is therefore only possible 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.430
 place it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.709
 It is also possible to remove the range from 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.330
 his stand 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:39.600
 here it is so we can show it 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.480
 more in detail then frontally 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.120
 we obviously find objective 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.150
 on the back we find the microphone e 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.590
 the speaker yes because it allows the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.480
 range also of two-way communication 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.420
 way and from the audio it is possible to me 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.590
 transmit audio to the webcam and 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.709
 maybe talk to your own 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.930
 we find the qr code for 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.459
 the coupling of the device 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:08.790
 with the application a reset button 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.590
 and here is the housing for the micro 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.680
 sd required and registration of 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.680
 video clips 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.910
 and now also a motion the text 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.490
 so if you can disable it 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.890
 obviously in the case of levy gods hares 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.250
 movements will go to record that 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:34.040
 portion of video you can review 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:35.900
 then we go immediately to 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:40.130
 discharge the delicate elite application 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.990
 we will do some tests a little more convincing 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.790
 see you very soon for one 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.040
 full review of the smart home 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.180
 room of xiaomi hello hello friends of 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.180
