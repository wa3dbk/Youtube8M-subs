00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello everyone invented a video video 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.380
 let him support me that he is served with 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 +1 x I bring a new video of call of 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.830
 duty black or two but good today we will 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.810
 talk about the gameplay or anything for the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.750
 style though if I have to tell you that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.759
 it's a very very very old game is the 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.079
 oldest game that had recorded 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.000
 but with them there is that I have 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.579
 many gameplays saved by 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 I want to comment them and others and well this 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.079
 it's one of the first games that I 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.550
 get good because it's the second day of 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.800
 have gone white 2 or as 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
 you will see this has almost a year 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.100
 departure so good I hope that you 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.980
 like it and nothing more and a little bit of illusion 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 your life because it was one of the first 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.600
 games like this and good as I say 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.150
 I was excited to upload it despite having 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.680
 others more good and even newer 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.840
 but good that I already say that I wanted 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.790
 upload it so no but today I come to 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.530
 talk about the crop case you know 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.850
 that is going to be the next call of duty that 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.049
 come out here I start to shoot at my 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.240
 fellow as always I very 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.070
 intelligent and good as I say them 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.409
 came to talk about heat ticos already 6 and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.000
 that there is much information that is not 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.250
 is giving as much hype as the others 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.710
 call of duty 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.670
 that as the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.470
 launch and others that remain 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.940
 practically a week to come out 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.470
 the heat and ticos is entering me 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.670
 also a little more of desire and good 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.190
 I'm going to leave a news that I 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.660
 I personally liked it and I come to you 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 give my opinion I am that it has been 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.290
 confirmed that there will be a way 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.660
 someone like balÃ­n you'll say it's a 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.550
 mobile and obviously it will be something a 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.610
 alternative mode to zombie mode let's say 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.140
 trying to avoid it obviously because 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 well you know that zombie mode is 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.550
 exclusive for the game that accepts and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.200
 for days and said the call of 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.000
 duty does every year a company is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.130
 say a year trias short year the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.750
 infinity ward infinity ward thats what 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.390
 what modern warfare do and in this 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.920
 case the broth crops and days just that 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.649
 does for example the call of duty world 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.149
 at war the call of duty black ops' one 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.340
 with the multiple costs that are those that 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.600
 have the zombies worth I know that with 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.640
 modern warfare to take a mode 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.500
 survival that really was not even the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.720
 half is not a quarter of the fun 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.489
 that can become the zombies and 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.020
 they know that zombies is something that 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.790
 many people like it and therefore 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.739
 they are trying to get through all 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.570
 media mode of play the most similar 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.519
 possible to the zombies but obviously 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.930
 that is not zombies because fuck or be 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.150
 it would be a bit plagiarizing 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.760
 of ars and besides that it would be every year 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.250
 the same thing and in the end they would end up being 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.549
 same because if you take out every year what 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.380
 same 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.060
 imagine that zombies always come out 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.160
 every year, obviously, the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.269
 zombies would stop liking so much because 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.420
 really the good thing that the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.670
 zombies is that like every two years then 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.950
 as it catches you more desire so good 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.079
 you already know the link mode has been confirmed 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.720
 but there is one thing that I personally 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:49.160
 I think I hate to see to play 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.959
 we are going to have to go through someone 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.090
 first the history mode of the call of 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.340
 Live duty and this makes me that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.250
 think that the way someone is not going to 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.769
 be maybe that way zombies or me 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.750
 I explain the zombie mode we can play it 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.690
 pull and it's like an alternative mode 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.420
 the multiplayer story and zombies is 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.010
 say that is the difference notoriously 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.200
 because they are like three game modes 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.120
 great but having to spend the 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.850
 Story mode to unlock mode 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.830
 and it makes me think that maybe the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.900
 that yes maybe the way to and do not be 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.060
 as big as the mode can be 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.459
 zombie not but be a small 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.440
 added that yes it may be fine but 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.380
 I really have serious doubts that 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.570
 can come to compete say between 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.070
 quotes with the zombie mode that the 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.590
 call of duty black or cough or call of 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.480
 duty black ops' 1 and that's why not 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.010
 Well obviously they do it so that the 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.989
 people play the campaign and pass it on 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.390
 It is obviously the only objective that 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.120
 has that but I do not know if it was something so 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.489
 spectacular maybe they would put it say 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.370
 as from the beginning and their parties is 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:55.010
 say multiplayer campaign and morona link 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.410
 which is called I think infected does not infect or 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.330
 something something something similar not in the 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.390
 description of the video you will have the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.370
 images that have come out on this one 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.440
 about this mode someone that there are already people 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.090
 who has played it and others and what good 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.390
 have uploaded images of how it's going to be and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.490
 such 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.840
 to me personally at the moment 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.700
 illusion does not make me although I do have 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
 want to try it and see how it is and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.209
 it is said that as soon as the heat comes out 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.519
 furtive you will not have it in the channel 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.530
 so much for light is that I'm pleased that 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.419
 I will buy it and soon I hope 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.280
 buy less as soon as it comes out play 4 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.860
 to play 4 so that is to say what are you going 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.380
 to have gameplay of play 4 of bone of the 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.540
 call of duty with him and 4 of call of duty 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.250
 2 of play 3 will obviously have 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.590
 more games in the channel so nothing 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.060
 I hope you enjoy it and leave it to me 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.890
 comment what do you think about this topic 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.600
 on the subject of the way to link is called 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.520
 the tension if you want it to be good 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.200
 that not that such also personally 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.510
 well here you see me what I do I think 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.610
 going 26 be over 26 in one go with the 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.830
 lightning attack that's the mega vale is 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.840
 really what saves me the gameplay 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.250
 so nothing kids I hope that I have 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.450

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.000

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.470

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.350
 good call of duty and keep us in the 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.120
 chat for a long time because I already 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.700
 It is said that as soon as I leave I will play 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.310
 I take it out as usual and nothing will go up all 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.870

 team screamed if you liked it and now 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.930
 as you will see the score as of 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.970
 observe directly all are bad if you go 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.830
 it's not that I say it was one day 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.720
 after leaving the game so nobody 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.100
