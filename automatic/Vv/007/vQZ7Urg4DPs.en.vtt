00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.850
 unboxing and in the review I will explain

 well how is that but stay tuned 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.680
 go find out about the product but 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.020
 For now, I'm going to open the box 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.040
 to see and well nothing I left 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.040
 also to buy me 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.250
 and he played general told us that I am 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.200
 this 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.160
 I bought two I did not know they were selling in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.290
 big and bought cookies and good two 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.600
 monsters 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.310
 unfortunately there was not the green like that 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.000
 that they are only prisoners good we are going to 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.000
 open this box 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.890
 why 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.090
 I am going to show you what you have sent me 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:13.150
 see me he does not want to explain much about 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.770
 the product because as you know I will 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.520
 do an unboxing of a review where I'm going 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.520
 to explain well 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.489
 but 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.910
 because they are not seeing anything but I 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.560
 listen while I open this 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.090
 What he has sent me are some cards 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.000
 they are called live game hd 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.580
 these cards are incredible because 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.370
 oil when you're recording 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.660
 before when you recorded or transmitted 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.390
 live 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.570
 the signal of the game was responsible for 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.110
 process the computer with the entity 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.630
 is with this card is the card that 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.260
 in being charged to do it so 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.330
 so it frees us a lot of space in the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
 computer has no idea 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.330
 incredible for any youtuber gamer 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.150
 that you want to dedicate to this here is 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.560
 I really really recommend those 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 cards look at this 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.079
 here is one now let's show them well 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.079
 quickly 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.810
 chan chan that was central network is the 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:22.299
 program that uses the card to record 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.260
 forget france de qantas already and of 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:28.230
 so much filthy this is 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.210
 here it comes with three months free of 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.430
 split compatible with windows 8 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:40.090
 they were already good in the super box 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:42.160
 this epic and nothing is there else 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.959
 as I say one is for the videos 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.430
 to do the unboxing and the review and the 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.560
 another one we're going to draw in the channel like this 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.019
 that are attentive all this is thanks to 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.130
 AVerMedia people are 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.030
 behaving very well 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.520
 damn street noise good guys 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.200
 thank you very much for watching the video 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.660
 remember that they do not want to give much in 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.610
 detail in this but what these do 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.500
 cards is that while you're 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.360
 Missing recording the card is the one 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.490
 is responsible for capturing the signal of 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.260
 video before your video card 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.240
 for and the monitor goes through this card 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.620
 just like your console you can connect 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.390
 your console first to the card and to 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.610
 monitor and the card takes care of 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:24.170
 record of transmitting of doing everything 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:26.180
 you and believe me the first to 720 in hd va 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.700
 until the end and very graphic games and 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.900
 I do not play them at 60 fps or it's like, 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.400
 you were not with anything on the computer 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.380
 as if you were not transmitting this 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.080
 is responsible for releasing everything because it 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.310
 in charge of the processes do not have much 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.600
 in details because I'm going to do it 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.710
 for the video 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.590
