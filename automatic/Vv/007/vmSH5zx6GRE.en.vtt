artists<00:02:14.260> that<00:02:14.440> working<00:02:15.310> our<00:02:16.350> premix<00:02:17.350> the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
artists that working our premix the

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.110 
artists that working our premix the
color<00:02:18.480> palettes<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.890> what<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.280> did<00:02:21.640> for<00:02:22.060> my

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
color palettes and but what I did for my

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.260 
color palettes and but what I did for my
painting<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.840> most<00:02:23.320> of<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.800> color<00:02:24.040> were<00:02:24.820> mixed

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
painting is most of the color were mixed

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.390 
painting is most of the color were mixed
the<00:02:25.540> right<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.230> canvas<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.740> while<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.130> was

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the right on the canvas a while I was

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.350 
the right on the canvas a while I was
working<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.540> canvas<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:30.340> Kuchar<00:02:31.330> has<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
working on the canvas so Kuchar has the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.290 
working on the canvas so Kuchar has the
advantage<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.570> the<00:02:34.780> each<00:02:34.930> color<00:02:36.120> each<00:02:37.120> of

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
advantage of the each color each of

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.320 
advantage of the each color each of
brass<00:02:37.450> jokes<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:38.140> carried<00:02:38.880> really<00:02:39.880> multiple

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
brass jokes that carried really multiple

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.449 
brass jokes that carried really multiple
colors<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.050> I<00:02:41.080> see<00:02:41.530> that<00:02:41.739> your<00:02:41.860> pain<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.250> very

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
colors so I see that your pain is very

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.490 
colors so I see that your pain is very
thick<00:02:43.000> how<00:02:43.330> long<00:02:43.540> does<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.750> take<00:02:44.050> for<00:02:44.230> these<00:02:44.320> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
thick how long does it take for these to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.860 
thick how long does it take for these to
dry<00:02:44.739> it<00:02:45.400> takes<00:02:45.640> about<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:46.150> half<00:02:46.239> a<00:02:46.510> year<00:02:46.660> to

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
dry it takes about a half a year to

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.010 
dry it takes about a half a year to
completely<00:02:47.260> dry<00:02:47.470> half<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.190> year<00:02:48.580> right<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
completely dry half a year right but the

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.750 
completely dry half a year right but the
surface<00:02:50.410> right<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:50.950> couple<00:02:51.370> weeks

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
surface right in a couple weeks

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.479 
surface right in a couple weeks
and<00:02:52.239> there's<00:02:52.690> no<00:02:52.900> air<00:02:53.050> coming<00:02:53.860> into<00:02:54.220> it

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
and there's no air coming into it

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.729 
and there's no air coming into it
because<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:55.060> back<00:02:55.239> of<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.780> canvas<00:02:56.050> is<00:02:56.380> still

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
because the back of the canvas is still

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.940 
because the back of the canvas is still
and<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.660> pain<00:02:58.900> that<00:02:59.080> actually<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.470> not<00:02:59.620> dry

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
and so the pain that actually is not dry

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.729 
and so the pain that actually is not dry
they<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.370> said<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.090> must<00:03:01.930> go<00:03:02.050> through<00:03:02.200> so
