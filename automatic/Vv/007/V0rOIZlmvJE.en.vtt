00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.329> I've<00:00:00.450> just<00:00:00.480> have<00:00:00.840> done<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.170> stars

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:01.230 
I think I've just have done to the stars

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.800 
I think I've just have done to the stars
and<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.700> sky<00:00:02.850> was<00:00:03.090> looking<00:00:03.300> little<00:00:03.389> rough<00:00:03.659> I

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
and the sky was looking little rough I

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.300 
and the sky was looking little rough I
heard<00:00:04.049> some<00:00:04.200> thunder<00:00:04.529> and<00:00:04.560> looked<00:00:04.920> like<00:00:05.040> maybe

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
heard some thunder and looked like maybe

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.369 
heard some thunder and looked like maybe
she<00:00:05.490> might<00:00:05.609> rain<00:00:05.850> so<00:00:06.240> Mike<00:00:06.720> had<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> idea<00:00:07.290> of

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
she might rain so Mike had the idea of

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.049 
she might rain so Mike had the idea of
maybe<00:00:07.500> put<00:00:07.799> some<00:00:08.189> kind<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.550> tarp

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
maybe put some kind of a tarp

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.180 
maybe put some kind of a tarp
he<00:00:09.510> had<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> small<00:00:09.840> tarpon<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.500> why<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> thought

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
he had a small tarpon is why I thought

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.129 
he had a small tarpon is why I thought
was<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.429> small<00:00:11.639> term<00:00:11.849> in<00:00:12.150> his<00:00:12.269> bag<00:00:12.480> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.900> was

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
was a small term in his bag but I was

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.419 
was a small term in his bag but I was
thinking<00:00:13.440> well<00:00:13.530> as<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.769> unfold<00:00:13.920> them<00:00:14.280> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
thinking well as you unfold them to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.210 
thinking well as you unfold them to
realize<00:00:14.839> how<00:00:15.839> huge<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.590> like<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:16.890> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
realize how huge something like that and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.429 
realize how huge something like that and
it's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.550> little<00:00:18.270> heavier<00:00:18.690> than<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.960> normal<00:00:19.260> turf

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
it's a little heavier than a normal turf

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.210 
it's a little heavier than a normal turf
of<00:00:19.590> course<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:19.920> there<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
of course it's because there was a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.349 
of course it's because there was a
frypan<00:00:20.460> stuck<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:22.670> there<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.699> then<00:00:24.029> Mike<00:00:24.210> just

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
frypan stuck in there and then Mike just

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.120 
frypan stuck in there and then Mike just
tied<00:00:24.570> up<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:24.990> corner<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.500> tree<00:00:28.130> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
tied up the one corner to a tree so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.980 
tied up the one corner to a tree so
later<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.519> day<00:00:29.849> we<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.269> Mike<00:00:30.449> up<00:00:30.630> higher<00:00:30.840> in

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
later that day we got Mike up higher in

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.600 
later that day we got Mike up higher in
