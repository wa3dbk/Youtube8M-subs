00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.940
DALEK RICKY: You know The Doctor, you understand -

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.480
DALEK CHRIS EVANS: TARDIS detected! In flight!

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.980
FUN FACT #1: This video originally started by parodying the end of the previous episode as well, with the Doctor's "here's what I'm gonna do" speech, but I had to cut it for copyright reasons. That's why this Dalek says "well, that was quick" because this was going to happen immediately after... THE MORE YOU KNOOOOOW

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.280
DALEK RICKY: Well, that was quick!

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.800
*pew*

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.580
*pew*

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.040
TARDIS (in its lamp): HERE I COME BITCHES MAKE WAY RING RING MOTHERHUGGERS ITS FOR YOU

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.700
CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW.... HARKNESS: We got incoming!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.640
MISSILES: WHAT A LOVELY DAY.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.480
TARDIS (in its lamp): Huh, I really hope they got that extrapolator thing to work because otherwise I'm pretty mu-

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.660
DALEK RICKY: The Doctor has finally been exterminated! Now we can - why do I hear the TARDIS?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.880
TARDIS (in its lamp): BOO!

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.780
DALEK RICKY: Wow! It really is bigger on the inside!

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.620
Hello, Docto-

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.100
DALEKS: Exterminate etc. you know the drill...

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.660
THE DOCTOR: Is that it?

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.000
DALEK EMPEROR: Doc-toooor!

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.540
CHOIR: AHHHHHHHRHRHRGHG GGAHGFHGSDHGFHAGDHFGSHDGFHGSHDGFHSGDHGFHGDSFGHSHDGF

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:31.760
DALEK EMPEROR: It is I, the Emperor Dalek. The supreme. The big cheese. The cat's -

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.680
THE DOCTOR: I get it.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.020
DALEK CHRIS EVANS: Do not interrupt!

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.180
DALEK BARRY SCOTT: Do not interrupt!

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.200
DALEK LYNDA WITH A Y: What he said.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.060
THE DOCTOR: I think you're forgetting something. I'm The Doctor, and if there's one thing I can do, it's talk.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.180
I've got five billion languages, and you haven't got one way of stopping me. So if anybody's gonna shut up, it's you!

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.800
DALEK THE IMMORTAL IRON PLUNGER PROTECTOR OF KUN LUN SWORN ENEMY OF THE HAND: Bugger!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.420
THE DOCTOR: Okey doke, so where were we?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.540
DALEK EMPEROR: We waited here in the dark space, damaged but rebuilding.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.040
FUN FACT #2: This is my favourite piece of dialogue in the whole show. I mean, the actual version, in the actual episode... not this version. Oh, never mind.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.620
Centuries passed, and we quietly infiltrated the systems of Earth.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:13.940
Harvesting the waste of humanity. The prisoners, the refugees, the dispossessed. They all came to us.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:28.360
The bodies were filleted, pulped, sifted, sautÃ©ed, blended, grated, grilled, fried, simmered on a medium heat for forty minutes until golden brown.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.840
THE DOCTOR: So you created an army of Daleks out of the dead.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.060
ROSE (IS BAE): That makes 'em... half human.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.780
DALEK EMPEROR: If you want to be black and white about it, yes.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.040
DALEK MY BALLS: Hurray for dead humans! Hurray!

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.200
Hurray!

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:43.380
HURRAY!

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.220
THE DOCTOR: They're insane!

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.680
Hiding in silence for hundreds of years. That's enough to drive anyone mad.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.760
But it's worse than that.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Driven mad by your own flesh.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.000
The Stink of Humanity. *roll credits*

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.820
You hate your own existence...

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.800
...and that makes them more deadly than ever.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.620
FUN FACT #3: God damn, I miss Eccleston. ...I know that wasn't really a fact.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.640
We're going.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.880
DALEK EMPEROR: Thank you for stopping by. See you again soon!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.840
DALEKS: GOODBYE! GOODBYE! GOODBYE!

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.680
DALEK NONE PIZZA LEFT BEEF: Nice to see you, Doctor!

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.840
DALEKS: GOODBYE! GOODBYE! GOODBYE!

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.240
DALEK DANCES WITH BAD WOLVES: You too, Rose.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.280
DALEK I ACTUALLY DON'T MIND LOVE AND MONSTERS: Thank you for coming, sorry we were not more hospitable.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.120
DALEK HENRY: See you later, alligator.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.640
DALEKS: GOODBYE! GOODBYE! GOODBYE!

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.760
DALEK THANKS FOR WATCHING: Au revoir!
