00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.360
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.879
 first consequence 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 Today we make nussse ourselves 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:21.750
 spread here in the pot are 130 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:26.630
 marine and rip-offs when we are now 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.630
 together with two eggs 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:55.859
 in a pot for the 82 grams of sugar 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:59.750
 mix and that will then be the mass 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.750
 the noses have to come on top 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:02:04.620
 vanilla sugar forget about two 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:02:13.970
 I have Turkish flag here 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:13.970
 I now have two teaspoons brother 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.500
 and we give that too slowly underneath 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.750
 the butter 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:03:12.909
 we know then spread that 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:18.480
 It should be sticky on this as well 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.480
 That's so important 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:58.310
 and 22 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:22.830
 butter sugar and write the beautiful 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:25.560
 Be careful here 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.900
 because otherwise you turn out to ground 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.360
 and then we do not have any more 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.850
 but several mud sluts you see 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:38.250
 also some bamberger tastes 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:44.750
 at least during this time one should 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:44.750
 have fueled hundreds of 180 degrees 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:06.410
 like me now for 30 minutes 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:06.410
 middle rail in the oven 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.600
 Ok, that's what the cake looks like when it does 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.560
 is done 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.560
 I have such a clausur here now 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:37.900
 maybe then it will be good if only at the 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:40.000
 water will have melted then do 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:43.330
 you very carefully he cuts from 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.770
 schnitzel from namely still small 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:49.090
 is because someday you will come 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:55.150
 the whole then you just pull like that 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:07:11.710
 fine train back and forth all the time good 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:13.479
 is come the other direction is like that 

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.740
 then it cools then I cut 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:22.090
 now the first one appears here 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:27.810
 row to land and then out of it then so 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.810
 nice beautiful performance 

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:41.520
 halved these four 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.520
 that the beautiful route 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:52.020
 such a nice result 

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.509
 that could make someone important 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.410
 impress 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:08:01.449
