00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.630
 the pop 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello hello welcome to paper top in 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.280
 this video I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.259
 super nice box and well original good 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.759
 in the form of a truck you can only 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.559
 adapt if you want a truck 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.690
 ice cream or you want a truck from dorna 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.850
 I do not know what you like more and the best of 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.530
 everything is that it is very easy to do 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.450
 it's just a matter of drawing and 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.460
 mark with pencil these technical things 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.020
 and therefore we occupy very well poquitos 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.270
 materials so I hope you like it 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.860
 very much and we are going to see things to do 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.870
 our little box in the shape of a truck 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.579
 ice creams we're going to need cardboard I 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.950
 I recommend one that is thicker than 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.200
 we will also use pencil rule 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.120
 cutter and everything to mark and cut and 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.950
 paints and brushes decorated paper and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.930
 everything you need to decorate your 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.579
 truck let's start occupying the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.620
 corner of our cardboard sheet 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.260
 so that everything goes straight and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.570
 We started marking the 26.5 centimeters 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.250
 from the corner and then we mark 18 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.860
 centimeters towards the corner of the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.870
 cardboard then on this side we mark 10 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.390
 centimeters and the same in this brand 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.970
 to join the lines in this way 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.580
 then in that line we also mark 18 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.790
 cm and join with the mark below that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.860
 there must be something like that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.170
 then on this line we make two 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.180
 marks one to five centimeters and another to 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.130
 six centimeters putting the rule from 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.230
 the edge of the cardboard and we make two 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.390
 lines so you do not need to take them 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.340
 until the other side then on the line 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.290
 that is left above we make a mark to the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 three centimeters and we put it together with this 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.120
 point on the line below since you have 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.070
 this you can erase those lines now 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.200
 on this line we are going to mark six 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.180
 centimeters and we put that mark together with 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.580
 our diagonal hairline and in this way 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.020
 we already have one side of the truck now 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.180
 to do the top part and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.650
 opposite we take this line towards 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 up and on it we mark eight 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.850
 centimeters the same on the shore of 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.190
 the cardboard to draw a straight line 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.080
 and on that new line we mark 12 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.380
 centimeters and we put it together with the brand 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.270
 from below then we mark 5 centimeters 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.180
 and we draw a line in this way 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.479
 then we mark 3.3 centimeters and what 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.149
 same and then we mark 4.8 centimeters and 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.860
 the same thing later to do the other side 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.540
 of the truck we are going to do the same as in 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.489
 the first part only that now in mode 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.350
 mirror so we give it wide 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.060
 same ten centimeters we mark the same 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.489
 18 centimeters later 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.170
 same marks of 5 and 6 centimeters and 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.090
 making the same diagonal line and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.370
 joining the to this line and so we have the 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.500
 another side of the truck now for the part 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.690
 from below our box we mark 8 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 centimeters and we draw a line and then 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.800
 we draw another line to a centimeter of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.630
 distance this part will be one of 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.790
 our tabs to be able to assemble everything 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.739
 then in the first part we draw 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.959
 let's add a rectangle that will be 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.660
 the door of the box the rectangle must 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.190
 measure 8 x 10 centimeters then we are going to 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.930
 erase some lines so you go 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.000
 seeing more or less the shape of the box and 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.980
 We only add some eyelashes 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.739
 these sides that I recommend you to be 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.049
 Knitted 7 to 1 centimeter wide and not 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.850
 you forget the bottom part mark 18 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.040
 centimeters together with this side of the 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.450
 Truck and mark the eyelashes erase 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.370
 some lines so you do not do 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.200
 balls and also marks the eyelashes of the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.210
 door for them to help us 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.290
 close the house 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.910
 [Music] 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.710
 now for you to see everything easier you 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.870
 I'm going to draw with a black down all the 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.640
 contour that you must trim and erase 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.770
 the lines that we do not occupy and good 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.730
 then remember with a cutter or scissors and 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.730
 you will have something like that 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.650
 [Music] 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.090
 and behind the cutter marks the folds and 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.640
 bending so everything is grabbing 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.769
 shape and then with a good glue I 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.959
 I recommend you cold silicone see pasting 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.310
 lashes and putting everything together and what 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.620
 here we are going to make the tires 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.500
 drawing four circles helping you 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:56.040
 a compass open at 2.5 centimeters and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:57.750
 then cut out the circles then paste 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.730
 your circles to the truck trying to make 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.250
 are well aligned and that when you stop 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:07.049
 little house does not tremble like jelly now 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.639
 let's draw him all the parts of 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.919
 a truck to our house like the 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.349
 windshield windows doors doors 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:14.270
 lighthouses the defense and all that until having 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:19.009
 something like that 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.009
 [Music] 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.490
 and now comes the fun part that is 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.960
 paint each of these parts I used 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.430
 pastel colors because they are made to me 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.319
 pretty colors for a truck 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.999
 ice cream but you can use the colors 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.069
 that you like and also for the paper 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:36.199
 decorated in some parts or coloring 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.150
 with markers when you finish you will have left 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.610
 something like that and good me at the door of the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.139
 box I drew a chalkboard type that would come 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.330
 being the blackboard where they show what 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.370
 ice cream flavors there and literally I painted it 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.169
 with chalkboard paint and I draw you a 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:57.020
 pretty frame so you could write 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:59.150
 some message also draw you in this 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.800
 part an ice cream and wrote him script 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.750
 Well to confirm that from 2 mi 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.759
 truck true but you can draw read 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.169
 and lobitos birthday or whatever 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.419
 relate to what you are going to put 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.699
 inside your house and to draw what 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.129
 same on the other side only sumps with 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:16.599
 a sheet of paper and a pencil and 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:16.599
 the same is left on both sides 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.029
 [Music] 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.100
 last I brought with a black down 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.290
 the part of the doors and in general the 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.440
 outline of each part to have something 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.740
 more cartoonish but this is optional 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.740
 [Music] 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.420
 and let's not forget the message in the 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:49.150
 chalkboard you can also write there the 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.220
 typical for so -and-so or so 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.960
 that you like although you can also omit 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.450
 what you can design your truck as 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.000
 more you like it and ready like that of sencillito 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.680
 We have a super cute gift box 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.110
 or to keep your personal things 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.000
 apart from truth it is incredible to 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.530
 decorate your space so do many 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.590
 small boxes 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.590
 [Music]
