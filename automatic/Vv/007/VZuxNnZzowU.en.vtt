00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.220 

I<00:01:15.890> feel<00:01:17.690> it's<00:01:19.100> an<00:01:20.100> heirloom<00:01:20.490> variety<00:01:20.700> as<00:01:21.120> well

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
I feel it's an heirloom variety as well

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.230

because<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.930> cob<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.799> size

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
because the cob of it is about the size

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.840 
because the cob of it is about the size
of<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.340> pencil<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> kernels<00:01:28.320> are<00:01:28.850> very

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of a pencil and the kernels are very

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
of a pencil and the kernels are very
very<00:01:30.090> long<00:01:30.330> it's<00:01:30.930> come<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.260> of<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.560> so<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.010> get

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
corner lay on the ground goons will get

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.210 
corner lay on the ground goons will get
in<00:02:42.670> it<00:02:42.850> and<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.480> won't<00:02:43.630> be<00:02:43.750> any<00:02:43.870> good<00:02:44.010> so<00:02:45.010> the

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
in it and it won't be any good so the

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.610 
in it and it won't be any good so the
shorter<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.790> stalk<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:46.630> grows<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.320> better

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
shorter the stalk that grows the better

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.370 
shorter the stalk that grows the better
off<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:47.980> are<00:02:48.040> Louisiana<00:02:49.200> so<00:02:50.200> we're<00:02:50.290> gonna

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
off you are Louisiana so we're gonna

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.790 
off you are Louisiana so we're gonna
plan<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:50.740> see<00:02:51.070> it's<00:02:51.250> about<00:02:52.350> two<00:02:53.350> three<00:02:53.590> inches

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
plan I see it's about two three inches

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.210 
plan I see it's about two three inches
apart<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:56.200> we're<00:02:56.380> gonna<00:02:56.500> thin<00:02:56.800> out<00:02:56.830> to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
apart and then we're gonna thin out to

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
apart and then we're gonna thin out to
the<00:02:57.370> prettiest<00:02:58.090> tallest<00:02:58.540> stalk<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:59.350> micro

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.490 

expose<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.440> corn<00:03:08.770> so<00:03:09.010> now<00:03:09.160> we're<00:03:09.340> going<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:10.500> do

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
expose of corn so now we're going to do

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.650 
expose of corn so now we're going to do
another<00:03:11.740> the<00:03:12.040> cuca<00:03:12.340> bytes<00:03:12.550> which<00:03:13.360> would<00:03:13.540> be

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
another the cuca bytes which would be

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.920 
another the cuca bytes which would be
our<00:03:13.690> zucchini<00:03:14.050> and<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.430> squashes<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.000> stuff<00:03:16.390> we

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
our zucchini and I squashes and stuff we

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.740 
our zucchini and I squashes and stuff we
want<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.200> plant<00:03:17.440> these<00:03:17.680> at<00:03:17.980> least<00:03:18.370> a<00:03:18.910> couple

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
feet apart I'm gonna put it like four

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.570 
feet apart I'm gonna put it like four
seeds<00:03:22.239> in<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> pot<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:24.220> way<00:03:24.370> because

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
seeds in a pot and that way because

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.280 
seeds in a pot and that way because
these<00:03:24.700> these<00:03:25.060> bushes<00:03:25.510> will<00:03:25.660> get<00:03:25.810> about<00:03:25.989> three

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
these these bushes will get about three

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.870 
these these bushes will get about three
feet<00:03:26.470> across<00:03:26.709> they'll<00:03:27.130> get<00:03:27.280> pretty

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
feet across they'll get pretty

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.880 
feet across they'll get pretty
good-sized<00:03:30.239> they<00:03:31.239> come<00:03:31.480> up<00:03:31.660> fast

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.000 

Keeney<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.840> only<00:03:37.840> had<00:03:38.050> a<00:03:38.080> few<00:03:38.170> heals<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:38.830> that's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
Keeney I only had a few heals so that's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.220 
Keeney I only had a few heals so that's
all<00:03:39.160> we<00:03:39.310> need<00:03:39.549> but<00:03:40.269> I<00:03:40.299> might<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.690> 10-foot

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
all we need but I might have a 10-foot

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.460 
all we need but I might have a 10-foot
divider<00:03:41.890> in<00:03:42.160> between<00:03:42.810> and<00:03:43.810> I'm<00:03:44.049> gonna<00:03:44.170> start

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
divider in between and I'm gonna start

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.699 
divider in between and I'm gonna start
with<00:03:44.560> our<00:03:44.940> little<00:03:45.940> white<00:03:46.090> squash<00:03:46.510> these<00:03:47.500> are

with our little white squash these are
blue<00:03:47.860> squashes<00:03:48.519> they<00:03:48.670> won't<00:03:48.850> find<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.390> over

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
blue squashes they won't find all over

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.630 
blue squashes they won't find all over
the<00:03:49.690> place<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.769> don't<00:03:50.980> want<00:03:51.160> them<00:03:51.250> so<00:03:51.400> close

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
the place but I don't want them so close

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.350 
the place but I don't want them so close
to<00:03:51.790> where<00:03:51.910> they're<00:03:52.000> going<00:03:52.120> to<00:03:52.180> cross

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
to where they're going to cross

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.240 
to where they're going to cross
pollinate<00:03:52.930> with<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.110> other

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
pollinate with the other

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.490 
pollinate with the other
so<00:03:55.380> start<00:03:56.380> off<00:03:56.470> with<00:03:56.590> a<00:03:56.650> little<00:03:56.800> white<00:03:56.950> spot

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
so start off with a little white spot

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.740 
so start off with a little white spot
they<00:03:59.500> call<00:03:59.740> them<00:03:59.890> scallops<00:04:00.520> because<00:04:01.450> they

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
they call them scallops because they

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.310 
they call them scallops because they
look<00:04:01.870> like<00:04:01.900> little<00:04:02.050> flying<00:04:02.410> saucers<00:04:04.320> and

easier<00:06:13.020> to<00:06:13.140> harvest<00:06:13.260> that<00:06:13.680> way<00:06:16.100> just<00:06:17.100> make

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
easier to harvest that way just make

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.910 
easier to harvest that way just make
them<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.490> team<00:06:17.550> and<00:06:18.200> these<00:06:19.200> are<00:06:19.350> kind<00:06:19.560> of<00:06:19.620> close

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:19.920 
them a team and these are kind of close

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.670 
them a team and these are kind of close
maybe<00:06:20.250> couple<00:06:20.640> inches

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.520 

and<00:06:24.680> they'll<00:06:24.890> eat

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
and they'll eat

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.270

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
so we're far enough away from our other

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:45.400 
so we're far enough away from our other
squashes<00:06:34.900> we<00:06:35.900> can<00:06:39.910> smell<00:06:40.910> variety<00:06:44.320> it'll<00:06:45.320> do

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.410 
squashes we can smell variety it'll do

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.540 
squashes we can smell variety it'll do

usually about 6 feet apart is the

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.610 
usually about 6 feet apart is the
decorum<00:07:10.600> and<00:07:11.600> we're<00:07:11.690> going<00:07:11.840> to<00:07:11.900> plant<00:07:12.140> them<00:07:12.380> in

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:12.620 
decorum and we're going to plant them in

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.840 
decorum and we're going to plant them in
a<00:07:13.780> pile<00:07:14.780> here<00:07:15.260> and<00:07:15.980> we're<00:07:16.130> going<00:07:16.340> to<00:07:16.430> judge

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
a pile here and we're going to judge

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.430 
a pile here and we're going to judge
about<00:07:17.120> another<00:07:17.300> 3<00:07:17.630> feet<00:07:17.660> and<00:07:18.110> then<00:07:18.230> another

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
about another 3 feet and then another

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.650 
about another 3 feet and then another
pile<00:07:18.770> of<00:07:19.040> them<00:07:19.250> so<00:07:20.000> that<00:07:20.090> we<00:07:20.150> can<00:07:20.270> keep<00:07:20.540> the

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
pile of them so that we can keep the

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.300 
pile of them so that we can keep the
grass<00:07:20.840> out<00:07:21.110> in<00:07:21.260> between<00:07:21.350> while<00:07:21.710> they<00:07:21.890> come<00:07:22.130> up

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:22.310 
grass out in between while they come up

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.420 
grass out in between while they come up
so<00:07:22.520> it's<00:07:22.880> gonna<00:07:23.000> be<00:07:23.150> little<00:07:23.330> heels

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 
so it's gonna be little heels

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:52.060 
so it's gonna be little heels
about<00:07:25.710> four<00:07:26.710> or<00:07:26.860> five<00:07:27.070> seeds<00:07:27.490> in<00:07:27.910> a<00:07:28.180> pile
