00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:53.319 
rota or the foolish burial my choice I
can<00:03:52.069> ditch<00:03:52.219> any<00:03:52.430> card<00:03:52.669> to<00:03:52.819> make<00:03:52.909> it<00:03:53.060> either<00:03:53.180> of

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
can ditch any card to make it either of

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.129 
can ditch any card to make it either of
those<00:03:54.879> it's<00:03:55.879> a<00:03:56.000> once<00:03:56.209> per<00:03:56.389> turn<00:03:56.419> thing<00:03:56.840> so<00:03:57.079> it

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:57.139 
those it's a once per turn thing so it

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:58.449 
those it's a once per turn thing so it
becomes<00:03:57.349> pretty<00:03:57.469> devastating<00:03:58.010> after<00:03:58.189> couple

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
becomes pretty devastating after couple

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.379 
becomes pretty devastating after couple
turns<00:03:59.950> MS<00:04:00.950> T's<00:04:01.219> because<00:04:01.969> I<00:04:02.090> don't<00:04:02.239> like

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
turns MS T's because I don't like

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:14.439 
turns MS T's because I don't like
continuous<00:04:02.989> cards<00:04:03.349> like<00:04:13.150> linear<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.239> turns

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:14.449 
continuous cards like linear it turns

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.749 
continuous cards like linear it turns
into<00:04:14.599> a<00:04:14.689> +3<00:04:14.959> so<00:04:15.919> it's<00:04:16.099> pretty<00:04:16.280> good<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.519> a<00:04:16.579> Satan

00:04:16.749 --> 00:04:16.759 
into a +3 so it's pretty good of a Satan

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:21.380 
into a +3 so it's pretty good of a Satan
card
