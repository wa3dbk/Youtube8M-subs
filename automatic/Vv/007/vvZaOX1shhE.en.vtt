00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
can just shoot it and you'll be able to

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
can just shoot it and you'll be able to
see<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.210> there<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.659> another<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.409> well

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
see it there is another one here as well

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.020 
see it there is another one here as well
but<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.860> can't<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> for<00:01:35.520> me<00:01:35.670> which<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
but you can't get it for me which is

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.370 
but you can't get it for me which is
there<00:01:36.270> unfortunately

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
there unfortunately

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
there unfortunately
so<00:01:38.280> we<00:01:38.369> have<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.549> go<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.850> zip<00:01:38.880> line<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.420> get

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
so we have to go on the zip line to get

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.990 
so we have to go on the zip line to get
to<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.860> next<00:01:41.100> one<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.369> think

it's kind of like in the sea somewhere
here<00:01:50.780> yeah<00:01:51.780> but<00:01:52.020> that's<00:01:52.079> where<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.380> need<00:01:52.470> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.480 
here yeah but that's where you need to
go<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.930> film<00:01:55.500> jump<00:01:55.979> cross<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
go so this is a film jump cross the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.990 
go so this is a film jump cross the
zipline<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:58.100> look<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.430> left

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
zipline and look to your left

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.859 
zipline and look to your left
and<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.570> should<00:02:00.750> be<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> sea<00:02:01.320> and

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.180 

so<00:02:06.869> shoot<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> couple<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.650> times<00:02:07.860> with

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so shoot it a couple of times with

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:20.690 
so shoot it a couple of times with
whatever<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.550> want<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.810> go<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> so<00:02:20.520> the

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
sixth one is actually coming away from

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.729 
sixth one is actually coming away from
that<00:02:22.980> area<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.489> moving<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:25.050> second

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
that area and moving it on to the second

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.220 
that area and moving it on to the second
area<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:27.330> need<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.600> jump<00:02:27.810> around<00:02:27.959> these

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
area and you need to jump around these

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.850 
area and you need to jump around these
Hill<00:02:28.700> boys<00:02:29.700> either<00:02:29.940> both<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:31.350> moving<00:02:31.739> this

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
Hill boys either both like moving this

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.920 
Hill boys either both like moving this
or<00:02:32.069> something<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.610> yeah<00:02:33.030> just<00:02:33.270> jump<00:02:33.450> across<00:02:33.569> a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
as well it's on the second salt beach

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.690 
as well it's on the second salt beach
and<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:52.080> three<00:02:52.440> actually<00:02:52.830> around<00:02:53.070> it<00:02:53.250> so

find round here and that is warm on
about<00:03:02.970> round<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:05.370> area<00:03:05.819> of<00:03:05.970> operations

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
about round here the area of operations

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.670 
about round here the area of operations
the<00:03:08.010> I<00:03:08.670> was<00:03:09.420> gonna<00:03:09.570> say<00:03:09.720> second<00:03:10.079> one<00:03:10.200> but<00:03:10.500> yeah

the I was gonna say second one but yeah
second<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.160> for<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.370> area<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.880> just<00:03:11.910> down

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
second one for this area is just down

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.539 
second one for this area is just down
here<00:03:12.420> next<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.380> this<00:03:13.500> tower<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.280> should<00:03:14.459> be

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
here next to this tower and it should be

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.710 
here next to this tower and it should be
next<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.000> boat

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
next to a boat

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.850 
next to a boat
awesome<00:03:16.590> salt<00:03:16.829> wheels<00:03:17.959> hmm<00:03:19.049> yeah<00:03:19.620> brick

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
awesome salt wheels hmm yeah brick

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.539 
awesome salt wheels hmm yeah brick
or<00:03:20.130> something

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
or something

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.500 
or something
well<00:03:21.030> that's<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.269> ain't<00:03:21.420> on<00:03:22.760> our<00:03:23.760> second<00:03:24.299> in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
well that's you ain't on our second in

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:32.130 
well that's you ain't on our second in
that<00:03:24.780> area<00:03:25.310> either<00:03:26.310> way

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.910 

so<00:03:32.830> the<00:03:33.040> nine<00:03:33.340> point<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:34.200> behind<00:03:35.200> some<00:03:35.560> locks

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
so the nine point is behind some locks

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.960 
so the nine point is behind some locks
so<00:03:36.310> is<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:37.270> bit<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.740> know<00:03:38.860> easy<00:03:39.160> to<00:03:39.310> miss<00:03:39.490> and

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
so is is bit you know easy to miss and

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:47.420 
so is is bit you know easy to miss and
it's<00:03:40.180> like<00:03:40.330> they're<00:03:40.510> in<00:03:40.720> this<00:03:40.810> sea<00:03:41.140> again<00:03:44.370> and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.050 

that's<00:03:48.430> what<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.820> on<00:03:48.940> map<00:03:50.580> so<00:03:51.580> it's<00:03:51.730> sort<00:03:52.000> of

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
that's what is on map so it's sort of

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.360 
that's what is on map so it's sort of
like<00:03:52.210> Roundy<00:03:52.980> near<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> rocks<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:56.010> the<00:03:57.010> last

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
like Roundy near the rocks and the last

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.910 
like Roundy near the rocks and the last
one<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.290> beach

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
here this will pathway and round the B's

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.360 
here this will pathway and round the B's
wrecks<00:04:07.870> or<00:04:08.320> whatever<00:04:08.770> the<00:04:08.890> hell<00:04:09.040> they<00:04:09.220> are
