but<00:00:08.880> now<00:00:09.120> these<00:00:09.780> cards<00:00:10.170> only<00:00:10.380> two<00:00:10.650> hundred<00:00:10.980> and

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
but now these cards only two hundred and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.759 
but now these cards only two hundred and
fifty<00:00:11.250> euros<00:00:11.670> which<00:00:12.059> is<00:00:12.090> no<00:00:13.080> money<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.469> guess

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
fifty euros which is no money I guess

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.250 
fifty euros which is no money I guess
for<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> card<00:00:14.250> in<00:00:14.309> this<00:00:14.370> phone<00:00:14.839> so<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.109> really

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
for a card in this phone so it's really

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
for a card in this phone so it's really
competing<00:00:16.740> against<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> gtx<00:00:17.609> 970

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
competing against the gtx 970

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.529 
competing against the gtx 970
performance<00:00:19.050> wise<00:00:19.230> but<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> uses<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:19.920> power

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
performance wise but it uses more power

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.790 
performance wise but it uses more power
but<00:00:21.539> then<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> also<00:00:22.109> louder<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:22.680> is

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
but then it's also louder here is

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.890 
but then it's also louder here is
cheaper<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.369> by<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.609> time<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:24.390> power<00:00:24.660> thing

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
cheaper so by the time the power thing

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.890 
cheaper so by the time the power thing
you<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.439> mix<00:00:25.830> up<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.189> itself<00:00:26.599> it<00:00:27.599> will<00:00:27.720> have

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
you know mix up for itself it will have

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.900

side<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:42.110> goofed<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.320> ok<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.370> I<00:02:44.400> thought<00:02:44.640> they

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
side I goofed up ok so I thought they

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.580 
side I goofed up ok so I thought they
were<00:02:44.940> on<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> ends<00:02:45.450> but<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.410> piece

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
were on the ends but that's just a piece

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.620 
were on the ends but that's just a piece
of<00:02:46.770> metal<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.430> then<00:02:48.060> we<00:02:48.239> have<00:02:48.420> another

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
of metal there and then we have another

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.080 
of metal there and then we have another
tree<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.800> they're<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> same<00:02:50.340> he<00:02:50.550> punch<00:02:50.820> really

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
tree so they're the same he punch really

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.750 
tree so they're the same he punch really
they<00:02:51.209> just<00:02:51.239> curl<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.220> c-shape

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they just curl you know in the c-shape

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.790 
they just curl you know in the c-shape
through<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> cart<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.020> an<00:02:55.110> ice<00:02:55.260> cooler<00:02:55.500> it's

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
through the cart it's an ice cooler it's

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.509 
through the cart it's an ice cooler it's
all<00:02:55.980> metal<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.489> like<00:02:56.670> that<00:02:57.769> he<00:02:58.769> partook<00:02:59.160> copper

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
all metal I like that he partook copper

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.180 
all metal I like that he partook copper
which<00:02:59.670> is<00:02:59.820> a<00:02:59.850> typical<00:03:00.350> tul<00:03:01.350> card<00:03:01.709> design<00:03:02.040> so

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
which is a typical tul card design so

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.759 
which is a typical tul card design so
this<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:03.750> same<00:03:04.019> as<00:03:04.230> what<00:03:04.410> are<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> other

this is the same as what are the other

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.190 
this is the same as what are the other

have an 8 pin and a 6-pin and looking to
through<00:03:36.269> the<00:03:36.420> back<00:03:36.600> plate<00:03:36.840> and<00:03:37.019> I<00:03:37.230> don't<00:03:37.440> know

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
through the back plate and I don't know

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.949 
through the back plate and I don't know
if<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.739> guys<00:03:37.890> can<00:03:37.950> see<00:03:38.160> it<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:39.510> there's<00:03:39.540> no

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
if you guys can see it but there's no

if you guys can see it but there's no
contact<00:03:40.440> between<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.860> back<00:03:41.130> plate<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.579> any

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
contact between the back plate and any

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.670 
contact between the back plate and any
of<00:03:42.480> the<00:03:42.600> chip<00:03:42.810> so<00:03:42.959> this<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.230> just<00:03:43.410> as

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
of the chip so this is just as

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.560 
of the chip so this is just as
protection<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.489> guess<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.910> not<00:03:45.060> actively

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
protection I guess it's not actively

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.840 
protection I guess it's not actively
cooling<00:03:46.110> anything<00:03:46.470> all<00:03:47.010> right<00:03:47.220> then<00:03:47.370> guys<00:03:47.549> so

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
cooling anything all right then guys so

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.440 
cooling anything all right then guys so

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
is the same as the version by power

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.000 
is the same as the version by power
color<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.420> you<00:03:57.959> know<00:03:58.079> all<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.410> top<00:03:58.620> cards

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
are the same so I'm going to start off

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:01.940 
are the same so I'm going to start off
with<00:04:01.170> battlefield<00:04:01.470> 4

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
with battlefield 4

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.670 
with battlefield 4
all<00:04:02.280> these<00:04:02.580> are<00:04:02.910> Teddy<00:04:03.270> P<00:04:03.629> numbers<00:04:04.050> olmec

all these are Teddy P numbers olmec
stats<00:04:04.980> as<00:04:05.250> high<00:04:05.430> as<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.670> game<00:04:05.819> will<00:04:06.030> go<00:04:06.230> that's

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
stats as high as the game will go that's

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.110 
stats as high as the game will go that's
the<00:04:07.440> number<00:04:07.709> we're<00:04:07.920> running<00:04:08.190> so<00:04:08.510> we<00:04:09.510> go<00:04:11.120> 17.4

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
the number we're running so we go 17.4

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.449 
the number we're running so we go 17.4
FPS<00:04:12.540> average<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:13.140> battlefield<00:04:13.920> 4<00:04:14.010> you<00:04:14.340> know

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
FPS average in battlefield 4 you know

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.360 
FPS average in battlefield 4 you know
the<00:04:14.640> first<00:04:15.060> mission<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.079> one<00:04:16.320> that's<00:04:16.889> pretty

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
the first mission that one that's pretty

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.159 
the first mission that one that's pretty
all<00:04:17.609> right<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:18.060> should<00:04:18.269> you<00:04:18.510> know<00:04:18.630> according

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
all right it should you know according

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.890 
all right it should you know according
to<00:04:19.320> what<00:04:19.440> I<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:19.680> from<00:04:19.859> the<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.549> other<00:04:21.510> cards

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
to what I have from the the other cards

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.409 
to what I have from the the other cards
I<00:04:21.989> test<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.919> actually<00:04:23.100> very<00:04:23.310> good<00:04:23.729> yeah

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
I test it it's actually very good yeah

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.810 
I test it it's actually very good yeah
so<00:04:25.550> moving<00:04:26.550> on<00:04:26.750> battlefield<00:04:27.750> 3<00:04:28.080> now<00:04:28.260> this<00:04:28.470> is

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
so moving on battlefield 3 now this is

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.390 
so moving on battlefield 3 now this is
more<00:04:29.930> about<00:04:30.930> an<00:04:31.380> older<00:04:31.650> game<00:04:31.860> really<00:04:32.160> but<00:04:32.310> we

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
more about an older game really but we

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.420 
more about an older game really but we
were<00:04:32.520> getting<00:04:32.760> 120<00:04:33.300> FPS<00:04:34.020> which<00:04:34.919> is<00:04:35.040> really

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
were getting 120 FPS which is really

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.159 
were getting 120 FPS which is really
good<00:04:35.639> right<00:04:35.940> but<00:04:36.419> then<00:04:36.570> when<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.840> overclock

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
good right but then when we overclock

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.830 
good right but then when we overclock
that<00:04:37.440> we<00:04:37.560> were<00:04:37.680> able<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.040> get<00:04:38.160> 135<00:04:38.880> FPS<00:04:39.630> which

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
that we were able to get 135 FPS which

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.510 
that we were able to get 135 FPS which
is<00:04:40.020> even<00:04:40.530> better<00:04:40.560> so<00:04:41.510> yay<00:04:42.510> for<00:04:42.630> FPS<00:04:43.370> and<00:04:44.370> then

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
is even better so yay for FPS and then

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.460 
is even better so yay for FPS and then
again<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.180> have<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.450> keep<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.810> pricing<00:04:46.260> lines

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
again you have to keep the pricing lines

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.379 
again you have to keep the pricing lines
in<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.740> car<00:04:46.919> because<00:04:47.070> this<00:04:47.340> card<00:04:47.610> is<00:04:47.729> quite

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
in this car because this card is quite

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.060 
in this car because this card is quite
cheap<00:04:48.630> actually<00:04:49.430> moving<00:04:50.430> on<00:04:50.700> to<00:04:50.850> tomb<00:04:51.090> raider

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
cheap actually moving on to tomb raider

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.010 
cheap actually moving on to tomb raider
you<00:04:53.070> know<00:04:53.160> we're<00:04:53.340> dipping<00:04:53.700> below<00:04:53.790> 60<00:04:54.360> FPS<00:04:54.750> but

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
you know we're dipping below 60 FPS but

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.420 
you know we're dipping below 60 FPS but
it's<00:04:55.260> still<00:04:55.440> twice<00:04:55.680> as<00:04:55.860> much<00:04:56.010> as<00:04:56.070> what<00:04:56.220> it

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
it's still twice as much as what it

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.800 
it's still twice as much as what it
calls<00:04:56.610> sold<00:04:56.820> us<00:04:56.970> so<00:04:57.900> that<00:04:58.110> was<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:59.300> 57.9<00:05:00.300> FPS

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
calls sold us so that was a 57.9 FPS

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.980 
calls sold us so that was a 57.9 FPS
into<00:05:01.139> greater<00:05:01.460> still<00:05:02.460> 1080p<00:05:03.360> everything<00:05:03.810> like

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
into greater still 1080p everything like

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.800 
into greater still 1080p everything like
that<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.440> then<00:05:04.650> Assassin's<00:05:05.550> Creed<00:05:05.850> I<00:05:06.090> managed

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
that and then Assassin's Creed I managed

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.120 
that and then Assassin's Creed I managed
to<00:05:06.840> make<00:05:07.169> it<00:05:07.320> work<00:05:07.760> great<00:05:08.760> we<00:05:09.479> were<00:05:09.600> getting<00:05:10.130> 56

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
to make it work great we were getting 56

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.779 
to make it work great we were getting 56
FPS<00:05:11.729> there<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.650> for<00:05:13.650> me<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.950> most<00:05:14.100> fun<00:05:14.550> thing

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
FPS there so for me the most fun thing

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.090 
FPS there so for me the most fun thing
to<00:05:14.820> see<00:05:15.090> is<00:05:15.240> how<00:05:15.570> what<00:05:16.289> driver<00:05:16.620> there<00:05:16.950> are

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
to see is how what driver there are

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.490 
to see is how what driver there are
1990s<00:05:17.820> has<00:05:17.970> a<00:05:18.030> volt<00:05:18.300> because<00:05:18.450> I<00:05:18.780> just<00:05:19.080> did<00:05:19.380> the

1990s has a volt because I just did the

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.110 
1990s has a volt because I just did the
gigabyte<00:05:19.889> card<00:05:20.160> and<00:05:20.370> I'll<00:05:20.460> link<00:05:20.639> that<00:05:20.729> here

quite a while ago and you know

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.440 
quite a while ago and you know
performances<00:05:26.220> that's<00:05:26.580> really<00:05:26.789> picked<00:05:27.060> up<00:05:27.210> so

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
performances that's really picked up so

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.560

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
I'll now put ya there I keep getting the

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.650 
I'll now put ya there I keep getting the
world<00:05:34.650> corner<00:05:34.979> so<00:05:35.430> I'll<00:05:35.580> put<00:05:35.820> a<00:05:36.000> gold<00:05:36.510> award

cheaper<00:05:39.150> than<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.360> GTX<00:05:40.250> 970<00:05:41.250> but<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:41.880> pretty

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
cheaper than the GTX 970 but it pretty

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.240 
cheaper than the GTX 970 but it pretty
much<00:05:42.330> performs<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.050> exact<00:05:43.410> same<00:05:43.650> way<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:44.039> just

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
much performs the exact same way it just

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.190 
much performs the exact same way it just
uses<00:05:44.430> a<00:05:44.610> bit<00:05:44.820> more<00:05:44.970> power<00:05:45.150> but<00:05:45.720> this<00:05:45.960> car

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
uses a bit more power but this car

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.409 
uses a bit more power but this car
doesn't<00:05:46.530> run<00:05:46.650> out<00:05:46.950> I<00:05:47.160> never<00:05:47.370> saw<00:05:47.760> it<00:05:47.910> go<00:05:48.090> above
