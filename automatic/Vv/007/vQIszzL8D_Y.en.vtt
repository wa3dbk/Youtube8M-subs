the discovery vision concept we set out

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.250 
the discovery vision concept we set out
to<00:00:09.710> develop<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.950> vision<00:00:11.309> for<00:00:11.670> just<00:00:11.880> how

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
to develop a vision for just how

rolling<00:01:49.920> out<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.310> red

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
rolling out the red

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.230 
rolling out the red
we<00:01:51.290> have<00:01:51.710> designed<00:01:52.340> back<00:01:52.580> end<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> car

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
we have designed back end of the car

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.350 
we have designed back end of the car
with<00:01:53.510> one-piece<00:01:54.200> tailgate<00:01:54.800> we<00:01:55.580> think<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.150> it

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
with one-piece tailgate we think that it

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.720 
with one-piece tailgate we think that it
will<00:01:56.540> offer<00:01:57.160> everything<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.430> split

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
will offer everything that the split

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.750 
will offer everything that the split
tailgate<00:01:59.330> offers<00:02:00.229> today<00:02:00.560> but<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.610> lot<00:02:01.729> more

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
tailgate offers today but in a lot more

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.760 
tailgate offers today but in a lot more
convenient<00:02:02.540> way<00:02:02.720> and<00:02:02.960> these<00:02:03.080> is<00:02:03.290> only<00:02:03.410> thanks

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.340 
convenient way and these is only thanks
to<00:02:03.920> a<00:02:04.280> very<00:02:04.820> clever<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.540> fresh<00:02:05.840> approach<00:02:06.320> to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
to a very clever and fresh approach to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.919 
to a very clever and fresh approach to
engineering<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:07.220> can<00:02:07.430> stand<00:02:07.820> on<00:02:08.179> the<00:02:08.720> load

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
engineering you can stand on the load

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.790 
engineering you can stand on the load
floor<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:09.590> actually<00:02:10.280> view<00:02:10.850> over<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> car<00:02:11.800> so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
floor and actually view over the car so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010 
floor and actually view over the car so
if<00:02:12.890> you're<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> racing<00:02:13.610> event<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:14.090> example<00:02:14.150> you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
if you're a racing event for example you

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.080 
if you're a racing event for example you
can<00:02:15.200> be<00:02:15.320> stood<00:02:15.590> on<00:02:15.740> that<00:02:15.770> platform<00:02:16.310> with<00:02:16.970> your

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
can be stood on that platform with your

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.060 
can be stood on that platform with your
binoculars<00:02:17.209> watching<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.080> race<00:02:18.290> I<00:02:18.560> think<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
binoculars watching the race I think the

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.300 
binoculars watching the race I think the
entire<00:02:19.340> design<00:02:20.000> team<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.510> very<00:02:21.350> proud<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.950> what

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
entire design team is very proud of what

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.580 
entire design team is very proud of what
we've<00:02:22.520> achieved<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.209> it's<00:02:24.020> really<00:02:24.230> just<00:02:24.290> a

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
we've achieved and it's really just a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.890 
we've achieved and it's really just a
taster<00:02:25.070> of<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:25.940> we'll<00:02:26.120> achieve<00:02:26.480> with

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
taster of what we'll achieve with

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:38.630 
taster of what we'll achieve with
Discovery<00:02:27.380> in<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:27.590> future

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
