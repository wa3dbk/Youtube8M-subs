00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.290
 which is not the case 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.109
 the teacher liked it 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.989
 I'll bring consequences of this from Israeli books 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.249
 gingrich she was a good bet 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.640
 19 47 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.609
 hence we will use 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.179
 if you are alone to 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.869
 three hash beads 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.199
 a cup of sugar 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.489
 two sons the leader plus 39 issues 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.880
 on August 26 premiere scheduled for April 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.810
 through the house 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 reopened on Thursday at the time 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.530
 in fact we'll get 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.410
 Paulo 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.420
 cups 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 two days before the date of his death 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.110
 one of them 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.840
 in a pan 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.270
 the responsable 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 the stop 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.610
 little by little this 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.710
 and now we will invest about 30 minutes 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.080
 I personally believe that nothing has suffered. 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.230
 diego milito 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.230
 put ronaldinho 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.630
 and now I'm going to lie 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.939
 in declarations to the Portuguese 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.809
 your books even with these now disclosed 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.659
 I do them 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.259
 put on a cap 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:24.549
 somehow to communicate 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.309
 leaves three children 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.309
 now we have to react and make difficult decisions 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.319
 game like that 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.229
 this figure was practically stable 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.449
 the place 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.449

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.859
 he will premiere 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.909
 with more speed 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.449
 in the previous season 

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:55.449
 rescued first 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:57.619
 the manager pointed out 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.619
 the people 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.359
 because we 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 I'm going to the World Cup. 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.139

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.469
 the money 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.049
 on the waterfront 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.049
 in a survey 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.549
