00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.029
 rayet others and coffee and worth with 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.649
 the series of serious until we leave 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.849
 apart from before 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.380
 since then as you will know a week 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.820
 of another week's college all 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.410
 criticism up and this time we're going to talk 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.410
 crypt video game cursed 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.540
 we remember that they are crepe and pasta are not 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.880
 things confirmed are not that worth about 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.260
 urban legend let's start with the 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.270
 political that we mentioned in video 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.890
 previous but we're going to review the cop 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.620
 he supposedly saw in an arcade worth a 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.620
 recreational machine that supposedly 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.440
 created the government of the us with 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.730
 subliminal messages and with lights 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.530
 strobes to see how 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.540
 young people reacted to 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.220
 mental manipulation with the intention was 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.780
 in the middle of the cold war, it's worth against Russia 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.210
 then the plan to be able to use it on 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.620
 tomorrow in some kind of attack the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.150
 game was coming program to provoke 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 insomnia to provoke a series of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.250
 characteristics to cause vomiting 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.600
 nightmares you know with hospitalization so much 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.790
 with intention to have tomorrow to 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.190
 use it against the enemy army in 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.580
 end is those little things I did in that 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.650
 I think so 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.240
 with a very old game that is taboo 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
 the tau was that it was like 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.299
 tarot cards is from the games of 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.280
 letters that you asked a question 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.200
 and the machine by means of letters of 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.420
 Tarot told you the future and let's go 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.220
 I said I answered that question 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.470
 because we sent it because it was a game 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.320
 very weird apart that it has so many 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:44.090
 colors very very very different because 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.380
 the first creepy mario came out 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.390
 our same old ones that are the ones that 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.670
 the scared ones for the face 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.590
 suddenly your dreams and the first ones that 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.390
 they left arantxa muscular espanta we have 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.979
 seen very well the same is from the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.539
 first games that had nudes the 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.740
 letters came out then did not women 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:59.689
 naked 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.789
 and above all it was that they were a game 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:06.229
 they are very bad roll and it is said that 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.850
 they really were all fulfilled it's said to 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.459
 the cops several images in which yes 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.500
 I know if contrasts are played I know 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.480
 example that in the background black in 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.670
 reality and be dark with face 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.980
 sinister the end there is a lot of legend 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.560
 urban behind that game for the super 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.000
 nintendo that that which is of the game nothing 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.920
 strange and that has never been seen again 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 such a game gives very bad roll 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.440
 I'm going to tell a story 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.850
 it happened about 15 years ago it's worth in the USA 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.040
 there is something very typical that are the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.930
 castles rakes 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.140
 Every so often people carry 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.310
 accumulating two then take it all out at 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.799
 garden they have and they sell it here 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.989
 then a boy was looking in 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.359
 a kiss raked and found a 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.920
 cartridge there is a 164 and the game and 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.620
 you had a marker plus hours 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.480
 then says oysters you just get this 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.579
 game to do and half a year ago against 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.340
 of this now here is a reef then 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.560
 when he got home he tried it and saw that 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.239
 had a file already saved to the is of 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.519
 another previous game that was called ve 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.340
 and it turns out that the game was like 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.519
 corrupt as I could to whom it appeared that 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.290
 dying constantly drowned 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.299
 the protagonist then turning 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.430
 normally and the music of the 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.200
 sites was upside down people they 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.669
 he said strange things meaningless things 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.739
 when he talked about the characters 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:28.489
 many letters appear and every certain 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.829
 time a delinquent doll appeared 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.810
 we put the image here that is 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:34.700
 I called come and they said you should not 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.189
 to have done that and the character was going back to 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.470
 die legend has it that this was a 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.750
 primeval cartridge of a beta of 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.720
 game and it came into the hands of a child who 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.090
 it was called 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.570
 and that child died some time ga 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.040
 way it was reflected in that game what 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.180
 go with the face that we have seen before in 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.800
 a face that appears in the game that 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.920
 technically in the face of jaume and azadí 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.540
 terminal but it gives very bad roll this was 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.730
 of the very first games that came out 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.380
 way is super old and sure of the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.390
 you know because he is one of the greatest 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.090
 failures video game readers was 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.250
 a tremendously bad game that happens 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.630
 that the company was wrong and predicted 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.890
 that it was going to be a clear sales success 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.300
 because the movie was so but 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.940
 exactly this being a little more 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.549
 take out billions of tea sets 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.019
 that even exceeded the games to the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.280
 sale to consoles be the creation 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.510
 of consoles worth 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 it happened that this was an authentic 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.640
 failure and it is said that in the company 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.390
 He buried all the games in the desert 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.040
 again mexico 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.150
 there are photos but that necessary to a 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.370
 assembly of what people see 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.980
 unearthing a roll state games 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.870
 of litate lists and really find 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.360
 one of these do not laugh reid since it is 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.910
 another type room costs a lot of money now 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.350
 let's talk about another urban legend 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.090
 related to the game sonic ere vale 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.470
 to a car racing game worth 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.400
 with the protagonists of the saga of 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.229
 go out 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.810
 there is supposedly a character 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:55.139
 unlockable that is the doll of time 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.509
 let's start from the basis of the fear that it gives is 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.030
 an inert doll lifeless eyes 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:02.669
 totally black from black accounts and 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.889
 the ruby is here a rival of a 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.560
 ruby red is said that every so often 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:10.440
 every time he plays a lot a lot in 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.169
 the character the ruby ​​he has goes from 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.000
 green to red is worth then means 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.789
 mind that is red when you play 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.430
 You can kill the other characters 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:24.330
 it's like they become super powerful 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.880
 super I have super that they say that 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.389
 character to unlock it in that mode 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.889
 for your life at risk in general dolz 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.870
 a character that was very bad roll yes yes 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:35.850
 and how he has seen the image is a bug 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.350
 that you do not have to find those all 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.419
 these acts then there is a lot having 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.970
 the parameter and finally they're going to name 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.979
 a song from suicide quotes 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.520
 pokémon is worth it because ancient way in the 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:49.650
 chorus the band sounds a tune 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.760
 pretty freaky vale was a very song 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.160
 rare that then also 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.620
 was distorted and you get a roll what happens 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.240
 with this the legend has it that children 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.540
 who played these in Japan the children of 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.920
 between 7 and 12 years had committed suicide 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.420
 many children with an index of about 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.860
 hundred and some cases of children who 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.930
 commit suicide between these age ranges 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.970
 it's worth and supposedly rational why 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.700
 why this song had some 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:14.370
 waves that only that age range could 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.110
 listen to it and that incited suicide 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.730
 done if there was a frequency that if the 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.680
 put it upside down or getting mixed 

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.550
 the toys and assisted you commit suicide 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.920
 suicide 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.510
 first they gave vomiting after discomfort 

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.010
 then profitability until pressure to the 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.290
 children and take her but the girls and commit suicide 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.510
 here after logically it will be a lie 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.670
 because if it had not been but as 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.950
 detail in all subsequent games 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.590
 as for example in the red yellow in 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.090
 the fire red all remakes all 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.530
 the songs are exactly the same 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.840
 except for the town the band that was 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.370
 changed the modified you say because if 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.590
 there's nothing behind because they changed it 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.930
 why they spent money on hired an 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.370
 Uncle sweetness cases these people were not 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:52.200
 and there has to be something we do not know 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.120
 neither that incites suicide but yes 

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.720
 maybe that by the type of melody by the 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.340
 kind of those that generate discomfort 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.080
 we are going to put a bit of song 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.460
 we see it we remember that it has no 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.460
 has only one song 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.900
 well here is our list of 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.920
 lippi pasta since this week goes from the 

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.120
 next week we will return with 

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.870
 curiosity and within a couple of weeks 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.870
 We will return with 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.040
 background all the time
