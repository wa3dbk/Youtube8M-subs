00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.150 

since<00:00:07.890> my<00:00:08.069> surgery<00:00:08.900> I<00:00:09.900> thought<00:00:10.800> I'd<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.130> a

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
my experience a little bit okay so

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.859

relaxed and like xanax a day or two

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.870

before so you're not like freaking out

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.100 
before so you're not like freaking out

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
you're honestly not gonna remember much

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.870 
you're honestly not gonna remember much
about<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.559> days<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.070> hospital<00:00:35.370> it's

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
about the days that your hospital it's

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.930 
about the days that your hospital it's
just<00:00:36.350> not<00:00:37.350> even<00:00:37.770> existed<00:00:38.309> anymore<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.790> my

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
just not even existed anymore in my

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.670 
just not even existed anymore in my
memory<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:40.860> worst<00:00:41.100> part<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.579> definitely

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
memory but the worst part is definitely

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.590 
memory but the worst part is definitely
not<00:00:43.680> being<00:00:43.950> able<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.219> move<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.550> tongue<00:00:44.820> when

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
not being able to move your tongue when

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.150 
not being able to move your tongue when
you're<00:00:46.190> when<00:00:47.190> you're<00:00:47.219> wired<00:00:47.489> shut

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
you're when you're wired shut

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
you're when you're wired shut
and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.850> gonna<00:00:50.940> cuts<00:00:51.570> on<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.230> my

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
and I was gonna cuts on the back of my

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.260 
and I was gonna cuts on the back of my
tongue<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.949> splint<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.120> just

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
tongue from the splint and that was just

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.420 
tongue from the splint and that was just
really<00:00:54.420> unpleasant<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> medication<00:00:55.980> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
really unpleasant and the medication is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.160 
really unpleasant and the medication is
really<00:00:56.460> nasty<00:00:57.329> tasting<00:00:59.840> so<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
really nasty tasting so you have to be

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.240 
really nasty tasting so you have to be
creative<00:01:01.649> with<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:01.920> food<00:01:02.219> choices

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
creative with your food choices
