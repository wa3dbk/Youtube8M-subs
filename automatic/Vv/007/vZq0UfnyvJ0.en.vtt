right here they're all laying flat so
we're<00:00:24.860> going<00:00:24.950> to<00:00:25.040> test<00:00:25.279> this<00:00:25.400> out<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:25.640> have

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
we're going to test this out I have

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.359 
we're going to test this out I have
behind<00:00:26.480> me<00:00:26.599> another<00:00:26.900> bed<00:00:27.470> with<00:00:27.800> the<00:00:28.040> coins<00:00:28.250> are

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
behind me another bed with the coins are

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.600 
behind me another bed with the coins are
all<00:00:28.460> upright<00:00:28.820> and<00:00:29.029> we<00:00:29.599> will<00:00:30.279> do<00:00:31.279> that<00:00:31.460> on

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
all upright and we will do that on

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.330 
all upright and we will do that on
another<00:00:31.700> video<00:00:32.119> so<00:00:32.560> again<00:00:33.560> most<00:00:34.010> of<00:00:34.130> the<00:00:34.190> holes

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
another video so again most of the holes

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.020 
another video so again most of the holes
are<00:00:34.520> 6<00:00:34.730> inches<00:00:34.910> I<00:00:35.239> think<00:00:35.270> I<00:00:35.540> have<00:00:36.640> two<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.910> are

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
are 6 inches I think I have two that are

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.830 
are 6 inches I think I have two that are
18<00:00:38.300> 8<00:00:38.540> inches<00:00:39.050> I'm<00:00:39.649> using<00:00:39.890> an<00:00:40.100> ace<00:00:40.250> 250<00:00:40.840> with

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
18 8 inches I'm using an ace 250 with

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.700 
18 8 inches I'm using an ace 250 with
the<00:00:41.960> ultimate<00:00:42.380> 13<00:00:42.800> inch<00:00:43.010> double<00:00:43.309> D<00:00:43.460> coil<00:00:43.730> and

we'll<00:00:45.710> show<00:00:45.890> you<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> result<00:00:46.340> these<00:00:46.520> two

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
we'll show you the result these two

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.290 
we'll show you the result these two
holes

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
holes

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.740 
holes
we<00:00:47.539> got<00:00:47.719> quarters<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.030> first<00:00:50.449> one<00:00:50.719> here

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
we got quarters and this first one here

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.200 
we got quarters and this first one here
is<00:00:51.370> a<00:00:52.370> 65<00:00:53.149> I<00:00:53.510> know<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:53.989> 1980<00:00:54.769> quarter<00:00:55.250> at<00:00:55.429> 6

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
is a 65 I know it's 1980 quarter at 6

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.180 
is a 65 I know it's 1980 quarter at 6
inches<00:00:56.530> that's<00:00:57.530> a<00:00:57.800> 65<00:00:58.370> quarter<00:00:58.820> at<00:00:59.030> 8<00:00:59.480> inches

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
inches that's a 65 quarter at 8 inches

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.900 
inches that's a 65 quarter at 8 inches
so<00:01:01.190> we'll<00:01:01.339> do<00:01:01.460> this<00:01:03.190> 1980<00:01:04.190> quarter<00:01:04.580> at<00:01:04.699> 6

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
so we'll do this 1980 quarter at 6

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.850 
so we'll do this 1980 quarter at 6
inches<00:01:05.089> first<00:01:08.530> discriminate<00:01:09.530> or<00:01:09.830> a

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
inches first discriminate or a

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.850 
inches first discriminate or a
sensitivities<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.880> below<00:01:11.270> smacks<00:01:14.230> from<00:01:17.860> no

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
sensitivities to below smacks from no

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.789 
sensitivities to below smacks from no
problem<00:01:19.399> at<00:01:19.520> 6<00:01:19.820> inches<00:01:20.240> let's<00:01:20.899> go<00:01:21.140> over<00:01:21.530> to<00:01:21.560> the

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
problem at 6 inches let's go over to the

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:32.499 
problem at 6 inches let's go over to the
8<00:01:21.950> inch<00:01:22.159> one<00:01:25.540> can't<00:01:26.540> get<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:31.450> struggling<00:01:32.450> a

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
8 inch one can't get it struggling a

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.870 
8 inch one can't get it struggling a
little<00:01:32.630> bit<00:01:33.670> let's<00:01:34.670> catch<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.090> now<00:01:35.240> to<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:37.700> up

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
little bit let's catch it now to go up

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.190 
little bit let's catch it now to go up
one<00:01:38.090> notch<00:01:38.329> on<00:01:38.570> sensitivity<00:01:42.100> no<00:01:43.100> probably

let's<00:01:48.200> go<00:01:48.350> back<00:01:48.619> one<00:01:48.829> notch<00:01:49.130> on<00:01:49.310> sensitive

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
let's go back one notch on sensitive

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:57.840 
let's go back one notch on sensitive
let's<00:01:50.210> change<00:01:50.450> directions<00:01:50.899> turn<00:01:51.469> around<00:01:51.770> 180

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.160 
catching it 6 inch one no problem
we<00:02:10.190> actually<00:02:10.370> could<00:02:10.640> go<00:02:10.790> down<00:02:11.060> on<00:02:11.090> two<00:02:11.900> notches

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
we actually could go down on two notches

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.580 
we actually could go down on two notches
on<00:02:12.500> sensitivity<00:02:13.270> and<00:02:14.270> still<00:02:14.540> catch<00:02:17.380> okay

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
on sensitivity and still catch okay

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.320

let's go two notches below fool got it

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.600 
let's go two notches below fool got it
on<00:02:59.210> all<00:02:59.360> metal<00:02:59.720> mode<00:02:59.750> so<00:03:00.080> we<00:03:00.170> can<00:03:00.320> hear<00:03:06.610> just

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
on all metal mode so we can hear just

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.020 
on all metal mode so we can hear just
picking<00:03:08.240> it<00:03:08.300> up<00:03:08.420> I'm<00:03:08.960> not<00:03:09.140> showing<00:03:09.380> just<00:03:09.710> don't

this whole the time at a 65 dime at 8

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:44.190 
this whole the time at a 65 dime at 8
inches<00:03:31.150> nothing<00:03:36.340> let's<00:03:37.340> go<00:03:37.490> full<00:03:37.730> sensitivity

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:57.850

struggling most picking up interferes

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:15.569 
struggling most picking up interferes
now<00:04:06.550> let's<00:04:07.550> go<00:04:07.670> down<00:04:07.820> one<00:04:08.030> notch

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.050 

it's<00:04:16.579> tough<00:04:16.850> that's<00:04:17.060> not<00:04:17.299> catching<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:18.850> okay

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
it's tough that's not catching it okay

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.090 
it's tough that's not catching it okay
hey<00:04:20.720> that<00:04:20.989> hole<00:04:21.139> over<00:04:21.169> there<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.769> nickel
