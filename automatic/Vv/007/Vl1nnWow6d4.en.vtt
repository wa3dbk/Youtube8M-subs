00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
of the most common mistakes players do

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.920 
of the most common mistakes players do
when<00:00:37.800> preparing<00:00:38.130> their<00:00:38.640> strokes<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.210> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
when preparing their strokes is that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.840 
when preparing their strokes is that
they<00:00:40.079> use<00:00:40.260> their<00:00:40.500> arms<00:00:40.800> too<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
they use their arms too much that

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.180 
they use their arms too much that
creates<00:00:42.390> unnecessary<00:00:42.710> tension<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.950> arms

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
creates unnecessary tension in the arms

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.280 
creates unnecessary tension in the arms
which<00:00:44.490> causes<00:00:44.940> very<00:00:45.180> inconsistent<00:00:45.720> strokes

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
which causes very inconsistent strokes

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.920 
which causes very inconsistent strokes
they<00:00:47.280> use<00:00:47.430> their<00:00:47.670> arms<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.300> they<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.720> see

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
they use their arms because they can see

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.510 
they use their arms because they can see
that<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.290> arms<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> racket<00:00:50.250> move

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
that the arms and the racket move

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
that the arms and the racket move
through<00:00:50.850> space<00:00:51.180> as<00:00:51.450> the<00:00:52.110> player<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.380> preparing

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
through space as the player is preparing

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
through space as the player is preparing
their<00:00:53.130> stroke<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:54.240> they<00:00:54.420> fail<00:00:54.720> to<00:00:54.930> see<00:00:55.140> that

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
their stroke but they fail to see that

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.350 
their stroke but they fail to see that
all<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.680> movement<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.430> simply<00:00:56.850> caused<00:00:57.120> by

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
all this movement was simply caused by

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.440 
all this movement was simply caused by
body<00:00:57.630> rotation<00:00:58.130> if<00:00:59.130> all<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.640> focus<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.300> on

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
body rotation if all your focus is on

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.090 
body rotation if all your focus is on
the<00:01:00.600> racket<00:01:00.989> movement<00:01:01.200> which<00:01:01.650> we're<00:01:01.829> trying

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the racket movement which we're trying

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.549 
the racket movement which we're trying
to<00:01:02.280> imitate<00:01:02.720> since<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.079> that's<00:01:04.350> how

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
to imitate since you think that's how

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.830 
to imitate since you think that's how
you<00:01:04.619> learn<00:01:04.920> correct<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.579> technique<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you learn correct so technique then you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.960 
you learn correct so technique then you
will<00:01:07.079> most<00:01:07.290> likely<00:01:07.560> use<00:01:07.979> your<00:01:08.189> arms<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.790> move

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
will most likely use your arms to move

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
will most likely use your arms to move
the<00:01:09.149> racket<00:01:09.509> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.689> path<00:01:10.079> that<00:01:10.110> you're

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the racket in the path that you're

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.240 
the racket in the path that you're
trying<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> copy<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:12.299> really<00:01:12.689> your<00:01:12.810> body

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
trying to copy and not really your body

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.680 
trying to copy and not really your body
that's<00:01:14.250> why<00:01:14.430> I've<00:01:14.640> removed<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.180> racket<00:01:15.540> from

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
that's why I've removed the racket from

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.930 
that's why I've removed the racket from
the<00:01:15.870> clip<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.620> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.159> focus<00:01:17.400> only<00:01:17.760> on

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
the clip so that you can focus only on

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.360 
the clip so that you can focus only on
the<00:01:18.150> body<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.659> notice<00:01:19.620> that<00:01:19.800> the<00:01:19.950> preparation

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
the body and notice that the preparation

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.390 
the body and notice that the preparation
is<00:01:20.790> really<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.510> turn<00:01:21.780> meaning<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> rotation

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
is really just a turn meaning a rotation

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.030 
is really just a turn meaning a rotation
of<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.640> body<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:24.060> its<00:01:24.420> axis<00:01:24.799> that's<00:01:25.799> why

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
of the body around its axis that's why

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.860 
of the body around its axis that's why
we<00:01:26.190> call<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.640> unit<00:01:27.030> turn<00:01:27.299> meaning<00:01:27.690> that

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:27.870 
we call it the unit turn meaning that

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.260 
we call it the unit turn meaning that
the<00:01:28.020> body<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> arms<00:01:28.890> move<00:01:29.640> together<00:01:29.850> is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the body and the arms move together is

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
the body and the arms move together is
one<00:01:30.540> unit<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.350> initial<00:01:31.890> stage<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
one unit in this initial stage of the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
one unit in this initial stage of the
preparation<00:01:33.299> I've<00:01:33.530> played<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.710> unit<00:01:35.010> turned

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
preparation I've played the unit turned

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
preparation I've played the unit turned
backwards<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.909> few<00:01:35.940> times<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> becomes<00:01:37.110> very

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
backwards a few times as it becomes very

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.380 
backwards a few times as it becomes very
clear<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.890> Fernando<00:01:38.310> simply<00:01:38.909> turns<00:01:39.180> his

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
clear that Fernando simply turns his

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.690 
clear that Fernando simply turns his
body<00:01:39.570> sideways<00:01:40.229> without<00:01:41.010> doing<00:01:41.310> anything

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
body sideways without doing anything

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.570 
body sideways without doing anything
with<00:01:41.909> his<00:01:42.090> arms<00:01:42.710> this<00:01:43.710> will<00:01:43.920> become<00:01:44.250> even<00:01:44.549> more

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
with his arms this will become even more

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.270 
with his arms this will become even more
clear<00:01:44.970> if<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.299> look<00:01:45.390> at<00:01:45.690> this<00:01:45.810> side-by-side

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
clear if you look at this side-by-side

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
clear if you look at this side-by-side
comparison<00:01:47.280> where<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:47.970> stopped<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.479> first

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
comparison where I stopped the first

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.020 
comparison where I stopped the first
clip<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.290> Fernando<00:01:49.530> turned<00:01:50.130> roughly<00:01:50.640> 90

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
clip when Fernando turned roughly 90

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.630 
clip when Fernando turned roughly 90
degrees<00:01:51.390> from<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.689> ready<00:01:51.990> position<00:01:52.369> if<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
degrees from the ready position if you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640 
degrees from the ready position if you
look<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.970> his<00:01:54.150> body<00:01:54.360> an<00:01:54.630> arms<00:01:54.900> position<00:01:55.409> now

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
look at his body an arms position now

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.350 
look at his body an arms position now
you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:56.880> almost<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
you can see that they are almost the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.620 
you can see that they are almost the
same<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:57.960> were<00:01:57.990> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.439> ready<00:01:58.650> position

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
same as they were in the ready position

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.880 
same as they were in the ready position
perhaps<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.900> now<00:02:01.110> becomes<00:02:01.560> even<00:02:01.860> more

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
perhaps that now becomes even more

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.890 
perhaps that now becomes even more
obvious<00:02:02.180> when<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.390> are<00:02:03.479> no<00:02:03.659> more

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
obvious when there are no more

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.020

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
his body and arms position so to

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.089 
his body and arms position so to
conclude<00:02:09.259> whenever<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.470> hear<00:02:10.649> about<00:02:10.890> the

unit turn in Chinese that means that the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
unit turn in Chinese that means that the
body<00:02:13.680> simply<00:02:14.159> turns<00:02:14.459> sideways<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.269> that<00:02:15.629> the

these<00:02:22.680> sideways<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.300> often

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
these sideways but we can often

these sideways but we can often

and<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.209> racket<00:02:27.600> move<00:02:27.870> through<00:02:28.110> space<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.680> we

and the racket move through space and we

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.220 
and the racket move through space and we
think<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.940> player<00:02:30.180> use<00:02:30.390> their<00:02:30.660> arms<00:02:31.020> to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
quite a long journey from the start to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.010 
quite a long journey from the start to
finish<00:03:08.460> but<00:03:09.460> once<00:03:09.760> we<00:03:09.940> remove<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.420> racket<00:03:10.780> and

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
finish but once we remove the racket and

finish but once we remove the racket and
pay<00:03:11.500> attention<00:03:12.010> only<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.520> hands<00:03:12.940> we<00:03:13.450> can

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
pay attention only to the hands we can

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.510 
pay attention only to the hands we can
see<00:03:13.810> how<00:03:13.959> simple<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.560> compact<00:03:14.980> his<00:03:15.250> swings

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
see how simple and compact his swings

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.490 
see how simple and compact his swings
are<00:03:15.750> what's<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:17.020> interesting<00:03:17.200> about

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
are what's really interesting about

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.949 
are what's really interesting about
Fernando's<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.400> hand<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.790> back<00:03:18.820> in<00:03:19.209> is<00:03:19.360> that

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
Fernando's to hand it back in is that

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.750 
Fernando's to hand it back in is that
his<00:03:20.140> forward<00:03:20.620> swing<00:03:20.890> goes<00:03:21.100> almost<00:03:21.370> through

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
his forward swing goes almost through

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.060 
his forward swing goes almost through
the<00:03:21.910> identical<00:03:22.390> path<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:23.110> his<00:03:23.320> back<00:03:23.560> swing<00:03:23.830> I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
the identical path as his back swing I

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.280 
the identical path as his back swing I
believe<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.030> that's<00:03:25.180> how<00:03:25.420> Fernando<00:03:26.050> gives

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
believe that that's how Fernando gives

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.050 
believe that that's how Fernando gives
himself<00:03:26.770> the<00:03:26.890> right<00:03:27.040> feel<00:03:27.430> for<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.820> swing

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
himself the right feel for the swing

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.870 
himself the right feel for the swing
path<00:03:28.300> when<00:03:29.170> he<00:03:29.320> does<00:03:29.530> his<00:03:29.770> back<00:03:30.010> swing<00:03:30.280> he

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
path when he does his back swing he

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.540 
path when he does his back swing he
feels<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.330> exact<00:03:31.690> path<00:03:32.020> of<00:03:32.260> the<00:03:32.410> racket

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
feels the exact path of the racket

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.640 
feels the exact path of the racket
meaning<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.700> curve<00:03:33.970> of<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.330> swing<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:35.470> that

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
meaning the curve of the swing so that

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.650 
meaning the curve of the swing so that
when<00:03:35.830> he<00:03:36.010> swings<00:03:36.280> forward<00:03:36.820> he<00:03:37.060> has<00:03:37.090> a<00:03:37.239> really

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
when he swings forward he has a really

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.840 
when he swings forward he has a really
fresh<00:03:37.930> memory<00:03:38.350> of<00:03:38.530> how<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.800> swing<00:03:39.220> towards<00:03:39.640> the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
fresh memory of how to swing towards the

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.510 
fresh memory of how to swing towards the
ball<00:03:40.350> another<00:03:41.350> thing<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:42.130> see<00:03:42.310> here

ball another thing that you can see here

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.370 
ball another thing that you can see here
is<00:03:42.640> how<00:03:42.790> short<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.360> compact<00:03:43.630> his<00:03:44.080> swing<00:03:44.350> is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
is how short and compact his swing is

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.560 
is how short and compact his swing is
when<00:03:45.130> there's<00:03:45.340> no<00:03:45.520> racket<00:03:45.940> in<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.120> picture

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.050 
when there's no racket in the picture

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060
