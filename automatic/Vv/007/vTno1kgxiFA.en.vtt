00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
I'll be doing quite a few more of these

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.629 
I'll be doing quite a few more of these
as<00:00:13.139> well<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.830> really<00:00:14.190> think<00:00:14.340> you'll

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
as well because I really think you'll

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.450 
as well because I really think you'll
benefit<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.630> these<00:00:16.260> videos<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:16.770> anyway

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
benefit from these videos so anyway

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.650 
benefit from these videos so anyway
let's<00:00:18.270> start<00:00:18.570> off<00:00:19.369> this<00:00:20.369> collateral<00:00:20.670> will<00:00:21.240> be

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
let's start off this collateral will be

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.590 
let's start off this collateral will be
a<00:00:21.869> rainbow<00:00:22.500> fake<00:00:22.949> skill<00:00:23.189> tutorial<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.880> if<00:00:24.480> you

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
a rainbow fake skill tutorial and if you

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.589 
a rainbow fake skill tutorial and if you
do<00:00:24.720> know<00:00:24.900> how<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.560> it<00:00:25.740> in<00:00:25.949> FIFA<00:00:26.369> 14<00:00:26.609> or<00:00:27.029> FIFA

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
do know how to do it in FIFA 14 or FIFA

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.380 
do know how to do it in FIFA 14 or FIFA
13<00:00:27.840> I<00:00:28.410> guess<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:29.460> it's<00:00:29.699> basically<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> same

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
13 I guess then it's basically the same

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.240 
13 I guess then it's basically the same
but<00:00:30.689> if<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.960> don't<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.349> how<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> do<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
but if you don't know how to do it and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970 
but if you don't know how to do it and
you<00:00:32.399> want<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> learn<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.350> I'll<00:00:34.350> show<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.710> how

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
you want to learn and I'll show you how

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.639 
you want to learn and I'll show you how
it<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.670> done<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.239> basically<00:00:36.899> what<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.230> does<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it is done and basically what it does is

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.690 
it is done and basically what it does is
you<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:38.510> flick<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.960> ball<00:00:40.140> behind<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
you like flick the ball behind you and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.810 
you like flick the ball behind you and
over<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.450> head<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:42.840> then<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:44.760> a

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
over your head and then you can get a

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
over your head and then you can get a
volley<00:00:45.090> or<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.570> something<00:00:45.930> whatever<00:00:46.140> but

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
volley or in or something whatever but

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.630 
volley or in or something whatever but
anyway<00:00:47.129> let's<00:00:47.610> start<00:00:48.090> off<00:00:48.329> I'll<00:00:48.600> play<00:00:48.899> my

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
anyway let's start off I'll play my

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
anyway let's start off I'll play my
animations<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.820> stuff<00:00:51.000> now<00:00:51.230> one<00:00:52.230> two<00:00:52.379> three

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
animations and stuff now one two three

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.680 
animations and stuff now one two three
and<00:00:52.980> there<00:00:53.399> we<00:00:53.489> go<00:00:53.640> regular<00:00:54.120> rainbow<00:00:54.449> flicker

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
and there we go regular rainbow flicker

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.510 
and there we go regular rainbow flicker
is<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> first<00:00:55.289> thing<00:00:55.469> you'll<00:00:55.920> flick<00:00:56.190> your<00:00:56.309> dip

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is the first thing you'll flick your dip

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
is the first thing you'll flick your dip
stick<00:00:56.550> downwards<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.570> then<00:00:57.719> twice<00:00:57.989> upwards

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
stick downwards and then twice upwards

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
stick downwards and then twice upwards
quite<00:00:58.800> quickly<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> need<00:00:59.730> four<00:00:59.969> start

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
quite quickly and you need four start

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
quite quickly and you need four start
skills<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.629> course<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:02.010> can

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
skills of course to do this and you can

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.680 
skills of course to do this and you can
do<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> five<00:01:02.820> star<00:01:03.030> scaler<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> course

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
do it with a five star scaler of course

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.870 
do it with a five star scaler of course
as<00:01:03.809> well<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.010> how<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.400> done<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
as well and this is how it's done in the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.600 
as well and this is how it's done in the
arena<00:01:06.119> -<00:01:06.780> one<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.560> down<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.130> two<00:01:08.369> time

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
arena - one time down and two time

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.899 
arena - one time down and two time
upwards<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:10.369> examples<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.729> done

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
upwards and this examples here are done

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:12.740 
upwards and this examples here are done
by<00:01:12.090> Slaton

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
by Slaton

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.719 
by Slaton
but<00:01:13.790> yeah<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> basically<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.490> flick

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but yeah so you basically have to flick

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.910 
but yeah so you basically have to flick
the<00:01:17.970> stick<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.630> opposite<00:01:19.200> direction<00:01:19.350> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
the stick in the opposite direction of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
the stick in the opposite direction of
where<00:01:20.159> you're<00:01:20.340> running<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.909> then<00:01:21.119> twice

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
where you're running and then twice

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.749 
where you're running and then twice
quickly<00:01:22.200> in<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.740> direction<00:01:22.770> where<00:01:23.520> you're

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
quickly in the direction where you're

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.990 
quickly in the direction where you're
running<00:01:23.939> -<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:26.189> gives<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> an<00:01:26.670> idea<00:01:26.759> of

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
running - so that gives you an idea of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.210 
running - so that gives you an idea of
how<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> will<00:01:27.630> be<00:01:27.930> done<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.560> game<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:28.950> well

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
how it will be done in the game as well

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.980 
how it will be done in the game as well
and<00:01:29.430> let's<00:01:30.060> move<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> advanced

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and let's move on to the advanced

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.690 
and let's move on to the advanced
rainbow<00:01:31.290> flick<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.130> basically<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
rainbow flick so it is basically the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
rainbow flick so it is basically the
same<00:01:32.909> except<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.540> hold<00:01:33.950> upwards<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.159> first

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
same except you hold upwards the first

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.109 
same except you hold upwards the first
time<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.820> bit<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.290> split<00:01:37.560> second<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
time a bit for a split second or so and

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.719 
time a bit for a split second or so and
then<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.740> flick<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.770> quickly<00:01:41.280> another

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
then you just flick it quickly another

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.420 
then you just flick it quickly another
time<00:01:42.090> upwards<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.290> it<00:01:43.500> will<00:01:44.040> look<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.399> bit

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
time upwards so it will look a bit

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.819 
time upwards so it will look a bit
different<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.689> nicer<00:01:46.079> as<00:01:46.380> well<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
different and a bit nicer as well and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.980 
different and a bit nicer as well and
the<00:01:47.100> distance<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.729> will<00:01:47.909> cover<00:01:48.180> while

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the distance you will cover while

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.170 
the distance you will cover while
holding<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.590> ball<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.340> air<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
holding the ball in the air will be a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.730 
holding the ball in the air will be a
bit<00:01:51.390> longer<00:01:51.630> as<00:01:51.869> well<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.649> to

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
bit longer as well so if you want to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.740 
bit longer as well so if you want to
take<00:01:52.950> take<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> over<00:01:54.090> an<00:01:54.210> opponent<00:01:54.329> or

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
take take it over an opponent or

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260 
take take it over an opponent or
something<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.590> advanced<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.969> bit

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
something then the advanced one is a bit

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.910 
something then the advanced one is a bit
better<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.930> course<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.259> only<00:01:58.469> need<00:01:58.710> leads

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
better and of course you only need leads

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
better and of course you only need leads
for<00:01:59.189> star<00:01:59.430> skills<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> do<00:01:59.909> that<00:01:59.939> worst<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.450> as

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
for star skills to do that worst one as

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.590 
for star skills to do that worst one as
well<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.530> quite<00:02:01.799> nice<00:02:02.009> anyway<00:02:02.610> let's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
well so that is quite nice anyway let's

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.069 
well so that is quite nice anyway let's
move<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.259> regular<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.130> game<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:06.210> this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
move on to regular in game so this

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.020 
move on to regular in game so this
example<00:02:07.590> here<00:02:07.829> on<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> screen<00:02:08.310> shows<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.849> how

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
example here on the screen shows you how

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
example here on the screen shows you how
to<00:02:09.090> do<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.599> in

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
to do it in

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.619 
to do it in
the<00:02:10.819> direction<00:02:11.819> to<00:02:11.939> the<00:02:12.060> left<00:02:12.239> if<00:02:12.510> you're

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
the direction to the left if you're

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.110 
the direction to the left if you're
running<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:12.989> left<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:13.739> once<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.909> right

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
running to the left so once to the right

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.479 
running to the left so once to the right
end<00:02:15.299> twice<00:02:15.659> to<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.900> left<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.680> one<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.159> to<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
end twice to the left this one is to the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.520 
end twice to the left this one is to the
right<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:18.150> once<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.659> the<00:02:18.780> left<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> twice

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
right so once to the left and twice

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.850 
right so once to the left and twice
quickly<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.400> right<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.329> basically<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
quickly to the right so basically the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.470 
quickly to the right so basically the
opposite<00:02:23.250> direction<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.819> your<00:02:23.970> running<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
opposite direction of your running and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.600 
opposite direction of your running and
twice<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.260> direction<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.159> are<00:02:26.280> running<00:02:26.489> to

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
twice the direction you are running to

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.059 
twice the direction you are running to
or<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.810> everything<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.319> done<00:02:28.500> by<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
or and everything is done by with the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.069 
or and everything is done by with the
right<00:02:29.250> stick<00:02:29.519> of<00:02:29.730> course<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.239> here<00:02:30.720> are<00:02:30.900> some

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
right stick of course and here are some

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.679 
right stick of course and here are some
examples<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.069> see<00:02:32.250> with<00:02:32.819> sterling<00:02:33.359> here

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
examples as you see with sterling here

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:37.179 
examples as you see with sterling here
but<00:02:34.470> yeah<00:02:34.739> that<00:02:35.400> was<00:02:35.609> that<00:02:35.849> let's<00:02:36.239> move<00:02:36.420> on<00:02:36.540> to

advanced in game so what you want to do

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.140 
advanced in game so what you want to do
is<00:02:40.769> of<00:02:40.950> course<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.340> same<00:02:41.519> as<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.939> arena

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
is of course the same as in the arena

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.770 
is of course the same as in the arena
once<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.200> left<00:02:43.950> twice<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> right<00:02:45.540> but

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
once to the left twice to the right but

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.479 
once to the left twice to the right but
the<00:02:45.959> first<00:02:46.200> time<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:46.799> do<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.159> the<00:02:47.280> right

the first time you do it to the right

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.789 
the first time you do it to the right
you<00:02:47.670> hold<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:48.090> bit<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.540> same<00:02:49.170> goes<00:02:49.440> for<00:02:49.470> the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.190 
so yeah that is basically how it's done
in<00:03:03.599> game<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.620> tend<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.430> do<00:03:05.609> these<00:03:06.200> skill

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
in game I tend to do these skill

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.349 
in game I tend to do these skill
tutorials<00:03:07.650> from<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.129> in-game<00:03:08.639> perspective<00:03:09.239> as
