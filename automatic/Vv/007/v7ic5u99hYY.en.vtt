00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:06.049
 ae 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:18.690
 for millennia 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.750
 we believe that what sets us apart from 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.220
 other animals is to be aware 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.609
 awareness that the styles of 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.130
 there's the next we're alive 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.260
 this supposedly unique ability which 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 empathy for the next or 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 even by other animals is also what 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.879
 gives us the ability to learn 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.640
 noting that someone else does something to 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 transmit in our knowledge more 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.079
 in the last two decades scientists 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.789
 they began to doubt this concept 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.640
 everything indicates that other animals also 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.670
 are mainly mammals 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.320
 and birds but the group includes even octopuses 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.739
 last month a group of renowned 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.780
 scientists signed the manifesto 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.870
 attesting this conclusion to the community 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.320
 began to have this doubt and 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 nineteen ninety 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.460
 a group of researchers studied the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 brain waves of a monkey while 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 peanut looked for reasons 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 unknown a man entered the middle of the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.000
 experience took some peanuts from a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 bowl 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.350
 the machine then registered in the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.360
 monkey man celebrations 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.850
 the surprise was to discover that the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.830
 behavior of the human brain to think 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 something like I'm hungry that was to know 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.619
 from im 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.170
 How will I open it and can I eat it? 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.729
 very similar to the monkey run 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 same activity 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.729
 this has led scientists to 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 they will have to ask 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.229
 awareness of your actions 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.720
 a series of research was done after the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.460
 discovery in one of them painted 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
 belly of a dolphin 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.110
 in the sequence golf not only realized that 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.079
 had painted her belly as if 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.320
 directed the psi spirit was not 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.320
 turned and observed the mark in his act 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.460
 brain than the brain wave pattern 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.100
 similar to a woman looking at herself 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.250
 makeup mirror or a cover 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.460
 research will continue to find that 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.310
 both humans with macaÃ© wires 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.050
 the elephants they have something that was before 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.750
 associated with men only 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.700
 the mirror neuron when we look at another 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.550
 person suffering our brain felt the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.800
 pain of the other literally neurons 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 mirror replicate this pain that is why 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.370
 we feel pity 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.709
 The incredible thing is that the brain of a monkey 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.170
 works similarly would look 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.569
 another to mark with the human suffering 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.700
 he will understand and share this 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.489
 This ability is one of the 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.170
 bases for what we call empathy 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.440
 the discovery of which animals have 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.510
 empathy has changed science with 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.610
 this premise found that the people 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.489
 can use this same ability to 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.590
 solve complex problems such as 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.080
 open a bottle to get a meal 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.209
 How can these people only do this? 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.330
 for being aware of the brain itself 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.950
 the body itself and how you use them to 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.680
 troubleshoot 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.170
 has come yet another conclusion that 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.660
 animals as well as humans have 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.830
 consciousness until other living things 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.049
 exist 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.810
 this is what drives elephants to protect 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:16.940
 your puppies and loved ones to monkeys 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.260
 helping others not to drown during the 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.660
 crossing a river 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.959
 a dog feels affection for his hard 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.480
 to the point of sharing this suffering 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.310
 in one of the experiments done 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.320
 that a dog limited the way 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.410
 his owner when he was with the 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.350
 injured leg and seat there were no 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:41.170
 dog physical problem he just wanted to be 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.170
 solidarity with your human companion
