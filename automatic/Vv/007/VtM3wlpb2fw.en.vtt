00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
system I have so far here I'm going to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:44.670 
system I have so far here I'm going to
go<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.440> my<00:02:31.880> first<00:02:33.320> PSP

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.600 

here's<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.720> psp1000<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.770> can<00:02:48.860> see<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.340> size

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
here's the psp1000 you can see in size

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.010 
here's the psp1000 you can see in size
comparison<00:02:50.090> it's<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:51.820> lot<00:02:52.820> different

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:03.820 

basically<00:02:57.020> fits<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.680> it<00:03:01.000> yeah<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:03.020> if<00:03:03.650> you<00:03:03.740> have

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
basically fits in it yeah so if you have

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.990 
basically fits in it yeah so if you have
a<00:03:03.920> PST<00:03:04.370> 1000<00:03:05.060> 2000<00:03:05.510> or<00:03:05.630> 3000<00:03:06.380> and<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:07.670> want<00:03:07.940> to

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
a PST 1000 2000 or 3000 and you want to

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.810 
a PST 1000 2000 or 3000 and you want to
get<00:03:08.120> it<00:03:08.240> go<00:03:08.390> well<00:03:09.140> if<00:03:09.860> you<00:03:10.010> want<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.280> see<00:03:10.460> how

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
get it go well if you want to see how

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.370 
get it go well if you want to see how
much<00:03:11.000> size<00:03:11.300> comparison<00:03:11.930> is<00:03:12.910> about<00:03:13.910> the<00:03:14.900> minima

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
much size comparison is about the minima

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.710 
much size comparison is about the minima
the<00:03:15.860> -<00:03:16.610> volume<00:03:17.570> sign<00:03:17.990> is<00:03:18.610> probably<00:03:19.610> where<00:03:20.600> it

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
the - volume sign is probably where it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.630 
the - volume sign is probably where it
is

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
is

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
is
that's<00:03:22.640> probably<00:03:22.880> size<00:03:23.210> so<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:26.300> now<00:03:26.480> I'll

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
that's probably size so and now I'll

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.960 
that's probably size so and now I'll
show<00:03:26.720> you<00:03:26.930> against<00:03:27.410> the<00:03:27.590> iPod<00:03:27.980> Touch<00:03:28.280> right

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970
