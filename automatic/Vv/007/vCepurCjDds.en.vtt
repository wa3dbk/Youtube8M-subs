can be complicated it takes a little bit
of<00:00:18.060> time<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.510> if<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.930> wet<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.410> got<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.770> deal

with it's a pain in the butt something
like<00:00:21.449> this<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.750> much<00:00:22.050> easier<00:00:22.529> because<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.890> has

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
like this is much easier because it has

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.800 
like this is much easier because it has
a<00:00:23.010> metal<00:00:23.220> framework<00:00:23.609> underneath<00:00:24.029> that<00:00:24.480> simply

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
accordions out of the way so let me

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.390 
accordions out of the way so let me
demonstrate<00:00:26.730> that<00:00:27.859> doesn't<00:00:28.859> get<00:00:28.980> much<00:00:29.130> easier

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400

spring<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:27.000> bigger<00:01:27.210> model<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:27.960> going

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
spring for the bigger model it's going

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.390 
spring for the bigger model it's going
to<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.290> wider<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.100> room<00:01:29.340> for

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
to be wider it's going to have room for

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.980 
to be wider it's going to have room for
saddlebags<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.270> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.479> even<00:01:30.659> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
saddlebags so if you even if you have a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.480 
saddlebags so if you even if you have a
smaller<00:01:31.290> bike<00:01:31.500> that's<00:01:31.680> heavily<00:01:31.950> loaded<00:01:32.220> with

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
smaller bike that's heavily loaded with

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.039 
smaller bike that's heavily loaded with
luggage<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.329> might<00:01:33.479> consider<00:01:33.689> just

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
luggage you might consider just

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.140 
luggage you might consider just
springing<00:01:34.439> for<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.650> bigger<00:01:34.860> one<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.310> the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
springing for the bigger one so the

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
springing for the bigger one so the
framework<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.689> easy<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.530> it's<00:01:38.070> easy

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
framework is very easy to use it's easy

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.319 
framework is very easy to use it's easy
to<00:01:38.490> put<00:01:38.640> together<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.090> uses

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
to put together it uses

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
to put together it uses
color-coordinated<00:01:40.229> pieces<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.799> snaps

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
color-coordinated pieces so you snaps

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.130 
color-coordinated pieces so you snaps
right<00:01:41.430> together<00:01:41.610> spring-loaded<00:01:42.509> push<00:01:42.810> pins

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
right together spring-loaded push pins

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.899 
right together spring-loaded push pins
and<00:01:43.380> some<00:01:43.740> wing<00:01:44.009> nuts<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.369> only<00:01:44.490> takes<00:01:44.700> one

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
and some wing nuts it only takes one

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.520 
and some wing nuts it only takes one
person<00:01:44.939> about<00:01:45.329> thirty<00:01:45.750> minutes<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> bolt<00:01:46.380> this

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
person about thirty minutes to bolt this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
person about thirty minutes to bolt this
thing<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.950> also<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.180> lightweight<00:01:48.450> type<00:01:49.140> of

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
thing up also it's a lightweight type of

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.719 
thing up also it's a lightweight type of
a<00:01:49.380> metal<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:49.920> very<00:01:50.040> easy<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.579> utilize

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
a metal so it's very easy to utilize

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.120 
a metal so it's very easy to utilize
however<00:01:51.360> overall<00:01:51.810> weights<00:01:52.140> only<00:01:52.350> about<00:01:52.560> 55

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
however overall weights only about 55

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.490 
however overall weights only about 55
pounds<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.909> smaller<00:01:54.210> size<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:55.320> that's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
pounds for this smaller size what that's

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
pounds for this smaller size what that's
going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> give<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.299> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
going to give you is going to give you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
going to give you is going to give you
actually<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:58.020> chance<00:01:58.590> for<00:01:58.770> this<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> blow<00:01:59.310> away

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually a chance for this to blow away

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
actually a chance for this to blow away
in<00:01:59.909> heavy<00:02:00.329> duty<00:02:00.540> storms<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.619> going<00:02:01.740> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in heavy duty storms so you're going to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.139 
in heavy duty storms so you're going to
want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:01.979> make<00:02:02.130> sure<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.579> tie<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.880> down

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
want to make sure that you tie it down

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.510 
want to make sure that you tie it down
but<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.570> made<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> do<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.070> framework

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
but it's made to do that the framework

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.310 
but it's made to do that the framework
on<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.700> inside<00:02:06.119> actually<00:02:06.360> has<00:02:06.600> places<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> be

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
on the inside actually has places to be

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.100 
on the inside actually has places to be
staked<00:02:07.740> down<00:02:07.890> also<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.209> these<00:02:09.450> tethers<00:02:09.959> as

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
staked down also it has these tethers as

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110 
staked down also it has these tethers as
well<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.709> run<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:11.069> tie<00:02:11.370> down<00:02:11.849> to<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
well so you can run a tie down to a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.170 
well so you can run a tie down to a
stake<00:02:12.450> somewhere<00:02:12.780> else

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
stake somewhere else

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.390 
stake somewhere else
it<00:02:13.299> also<00:02:13.420> has<00:02:13.599> grommets<00:02:14.079> at<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> base<00:02:14.560> another

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
it also has grommets at the base another

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.130 
it also has grommets at the base another
nice<00:02:15.610> feature<00:02:15.849> about<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> has<00:02:16.959> a

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
nice feature about this is that it has a

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.559 
nice feature about this is that it has a
built-in<00:02:17.650> locking<00:02:18.159> hardware<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:19.000> latches

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
built-in locking hardware that latches

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.210 
built-in locking hardware that latches
down<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.049> once<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.319> fold<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.709> closed

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
down so once you fold this closed

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.800 
down so once you fold this closed
you<00:02:21.430> throw<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.760> lock<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.180> there<00:02:22.329> and<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:22.629> it's

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you throw a lock in there and now it's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.149 
you throw a lock in there and now it's
not<00:02:22.959> going<00:02:23.110> to<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.260> messed<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:23.560> by<00:02:23.680> anybody

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
not going to be messed with by anybody

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.190 
not going to be messed with by anybody
who's<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.459> supposed<00:02:24.819> to<00:02:24.879> have<00:02:25.000> access<00:02:25.480> some

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
who's not supposed to have access some

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.780 
who's not supposed to have access some
other<00:02:26.379> cool<00:02:26.530> features<00:02:26.890> on<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.430> roll-up

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
other cool features on this the roll-up

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:28.890 
other cool features on this the roll-up
storm<00:02:28.120> windows<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.599> want<00:02:28.720> to<00:02:28.780> get<00:02:28.870> a

storm windows if you want to get a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.569 
storm windows if you want to get a
little<00:02:29.019> bit<00:02:29.170> more<00:02:29.349> light<00:02:29.590> inside<00:02:30.040> or<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.549> a

little bit more light inside or just a
little<00:02:30.730> bit<00:02:30.819> of<00:02:30.879> airflow<00:02:31.329> you<00:02:31.569> roll<00:02:31.989> these<00:02:32.140> up

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
little bit of airflow you roll these up

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.589 
little bit of airflow you roll these up
it<00:02:32.680> all<00:02:32.829> uses<00:02:33.220> velcro<00:02:33.700> everything<00:02:34.420> that's

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
it all uses velcro everything that's

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.750 
it all uses velcro everything that's
attached<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.109> this<00:02:35.230> uses<00:02:35.500> very<00:02:35.950> heavy<00:02:36.310> duty

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
attached on this uses very heavy duty

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.220 
attached on this uses very heavy duty
velcro<00:02:36.909> that's<00:02:37.329> the<00:02:37.480> way<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.840> material

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
velcro that's the way that the material

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.960 
velcro that's the way that the material
actually<00:02:38.409> attaches<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.069> the<00:02:39.280> framework<00:02:39.579> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
actually attaches to the framework and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.179 
actually attaches to the framework and
that<00:02:40.510> stuff<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.959> really<00:02:41.409> burly<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.980> it's<00:02:42.099> not

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
that stuff is really burly so it's not

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.649 
that stuff is really burly so it's not
going<00:02:42.489> anywhere<00:02:42.730> anytime<00:02:43.090> soon

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
going anywhere anytime soon

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:46.470 
going anywhere anytime soon
another<00:02:44.650> real<00:02:44.950> cool<00:02:45.220> feature<00:02:45.459> about<00:02:45.760> this<00:02:45.970> you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
another real cool feature about this you

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.970 
another real cool feature about this you
can<00:02:46.629> see<00:02:46.810> how<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.049> framework<00:02:47.409> has<00:02:47.769> these

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
can see how the framework has these

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.280 
can see how the framework has these
extensions<00:02:48.609> or<00:02:48.819> rather<00:02:49.299> the<00:02:49.510> fabric<00:02:49.900> extends

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
extensions or rather the fabric extends

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.199 
extensions or rather the fabric extends
down<00:02:50.530> over<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.069> framework<00:02:51.459> that's<00:02:51.940> going<00:02:52.150> to

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
down over the framework that's going to

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.460 
down over the framework that's going to
help<00:02:52.389> keep<00:02:52.569> things<00:02:52.780> from<00:02:52.930> getting<00:02:53.049> up<00:02:53.349> inside

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
help keep things from getting up inside

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.740 
help keep things from getting up inside
also<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.549> forgot<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.970> mention<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.450> thing<00:02:55.599> on

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
also I forgot to mention one thing on

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.750 
also I forgot to mention one thing on
the<00:02:55.840> interior<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.530> comes<00:02:56.799> with<00:02:56.980> its<00:02:57.129> own<00:02:57.220> LED

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the interior it comes with its own LED

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.399 
the interior it comes with its own LED
light<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.239> this<00:02:58.359> hangs<00:02:58.659> from<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.959> framework

00:02:59.399 --> 00:02:59.409 
light so this hangs from the framework

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.140 
light so this hangs from the framework
and<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.859> gives<00:03:00.069> you<00:03:00.159> that<00:03:00.280> extra<00:03:00.430> illumination

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
and it gives you that extra illumination

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.819 
and it gives you that extra illumination

when you're manipulating this in the
