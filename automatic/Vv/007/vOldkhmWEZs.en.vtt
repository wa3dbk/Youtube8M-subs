okay<00:00:07.540> so<00:00:07.600> we've<00:00:07.990> gone<00:00:08.440> through<00:00:08.500> finding<00:00:09.190> roots

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
okay so we've gone through finding roots

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.699 
okay so we've gone through finding roots
and<00:00:09.610> fifths<00:00:09.820> we've<00:00:10.240> used<00:00:10.540> the<00:00:10.930> octave<00:00:11.410> a<00:00:11.530> bit

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:11.709 
and fifths we've used the octave a bit

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:13.949 
and fifths we've used the octave a bit
and<00:00:11.950> we've<00:00:12.549> primarily<00:00:13.209> gone<00:00:13.570> through<00:00:13.809> our

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:13.959 
and we've primarily gone through our

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.980 
and we've primarily gone through our
tune<00:00:14.170> using<00:00:14.830> half<00:00:15.400> notes<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.029> incidentally

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
tune using half notes and incidentally

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.530 
tune using half notes and incidentally
when<00:00:17.259> when<00:00:18.250> you're<00:00:18.369> playing<00:00:18.550> jazz<00:00:18.880> is<00:00:19.180> a<00:00:19.210> great

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:19.540 
when when you're playing jazz is a great

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.780 
when when you're playing jazz is a great
little<00:00:19.720> lesson<00:00:20.140> to<00:00:20.290> know<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:21.160> first<00:00:21.490> time

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
little lesson to know the first time

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.060 
little lesson to know the first time
through<00:00:22.119> a<00:00:22.150> tune<00:00:22.450> when<00:00:22.840> the<00:00:23.079> horn<00:00:23.649> player<00:00:23.919> is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
through a tune when the horn player is

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.889 
through a tune when the horn player is
playing<00:00:24.250> the<00:00:24.489> melody<00:00:24.730> and<00:00:25.180> we<00:00:25.390> call<00:00:25.570> that<00:00:25.599> the

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
playing the melody and we call that the

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.460 
playing the melody and we call that the
head<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.349> jazz<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:28.119> really<00:00:28.660> appropriate<00:00:28.960> on

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
head in jazz it's really appropriate on

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.880 
head in jazz it's really appropriate on
bass<00:00:29.890> to<00:00:30.369> play<00:00:30.730> half<00:00:31.599> notes<00:00:31.989> while<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.739> head

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
bass to play half notes while the head

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.220 
bass to play half notes while the head
is<00:00:33.010> being<00:00:33.219> played<00:00:33.550> but<00:00:34.510> then<00:00:34.660> when<00:00:34.840> guys<00:00:34.989> start

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230 
is being played but then when guys start

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.920 
is being played but then when guys start
improvising<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:36.430> you're<00:00:36.730> you're<00:00:37.329> playing

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
improvising and you're you're playing

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.500 
improvising and you're you're playing
behind<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.620> improvisation<00:00:39.460> usually<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.420> a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
behind the improvisation usually in a

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.090 
behind the improvisation usually in a
swing<00:00:40.719> tune<00:00:40.960> you<00:00:41.170> want<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.410> get<00:00:41.530> to<00:00:41.710> more<00:00:41.890> of<00:00:41.949> a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
swing tune you want to get to more of a

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.189 
swing tune you want to get to more of a
quarter<00:00:42.339> note<00:00:42.550> pattern<00:00:42.969> so<00:00:43.660> let's<00:00:43.839> just<00:00:44.019> take

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
quarter note pattern so let's just take

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.279 
quarter note pattern so let's just take
a<00:00:44.230> minute<00:00:44.440> to<00:00:44.800> do<00:00:44.949> roots<00:00:45.579> and<00:00:45.879> fifths<00:00:46.149> with<00:00:47.079> the

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
a minute to do roots and fifths with the

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:50.459 
a minute to do roots and fifths with the
octaves<00:00:47.769> using<00:00:48.730> quarter<00:00:49.329> notes<00:00:49.359> for<00:00:50.320> each

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
octaves using quarter notes for each

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.529 
octaves using quarter notes for each
measure<00:00:50.859> instead<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.640> half<00:00:51.879> notes<00:00:52.149> for<00:00:52.449> each

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
measure instead of half notes for each

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:54.989 
measure instead of half notes for each
measure<00:00:52.960> it's<00:00:53.920> basically<00:00:54.550> the<00:00:54.760> same<00:00:54.940> thing

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
measure it's basically the same thing

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.090 
measure it's basically the same thing
but<00:00:55.480> we're<00:00:55.780> essentially<00:00:56.320> playing<00:00:56.620> twice<00:00:56.920> as

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
but we're essentially playing twice as

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.360 
but we're essentially playing twice as
fast<00:00:57.339> as<00:00:57.579> we<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:57.940> did<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:59.440> for<00:00:59.859> each<00:01:00.039> measure

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
fast as we just did so for each measure

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.320 
fast as we just did so for each measure
you'll<00:01:00.699> have<00:01:00.940> one<00:01:01.600> two<00:01:02.170> three<00:01:02.859> four<00:01:03.429> one<00:01:03.999> two

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
you'll have one two three four one two

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.640 
you'll have one two three four one two
three<00:01:04.960> four<00:01:06.060> before<00:01:07.060> we<00:01:07.240> were<00:01:07.360> going<00:01:07.390> one<00:01:08.140> two

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
three four before we were going one two

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.870 
three four before we were going one two
three<00:01:09.370> four<00:01:09.940> one<00:01:10.510> two<00:01:11.050> three<00:01:11.380> four<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.730> it's

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
three four one two three four so it's

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.580 
three four one two three four so it's
just<00:01:12.940> essentially<00:01:13.450> double<00:01:13.780> time<00:01:13.930> playing

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
just essentially double time playing

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.230 
just essentially double time playing
quarter<00:01:14.950> notes<00:01:14.980> and<00:01:15.280> this<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.820> kind<00:01:16.060> of<00:01:16.090> the

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
quarter notes and this is kind of the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.420 
quarter notes and this is kind of the
beginning<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:17.020> feeling<00:01:17.530> like<00:01:17.710> we're<00:01:18.010> playing

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
beginning of feeling like we're playing

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.940 
beginning of feeling like we're playing
