00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.660
 we present you a new madness of 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.209
 telepizza because you have to be crazy to 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.099
 offer you a medium pizza for only 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.529
 4.95 take advantage of the crazy Tuesdays of 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.770
 pizza the secret is in the dough just 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.899
 there is very little and good we have already passed 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.079
 I think the hardest thing physically already 

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:30.130
 we all started to find more and more 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:31.719
 rhythm and good I think that it is already less 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.480
 so that we are all at one hundred 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:37.090
 per hundred and be able to reach one hundred percent 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.820
 at the first game so when 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.410
 we started we had the goal of 15 to 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.800
 final good now the mister also us 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.050
 gave 44 free days that also have 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.700
 come well to all to recover a 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.380
 little of also in the hard preseason 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 who is and demanding what he is doing and 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.640
 good 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.410
 we have still believe that the three 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.890
 matches ahead to follow 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.480
 preparing and good if you longer 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.670
 of what we thought but also 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.470
 we have to think that we do not have 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.020
 more time to prepare ourselves better 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.690
 not yet cost them more the preseason 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.590
 to others less I think that in the end each one 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.930
 it's different has your body different 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.140
 the truth that I like also the 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.290
 work and the preseason and well I think 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.440
 which is a fundamental basis this year 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.750
 now that is being the hardest of 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.330
 all I've done and I think we 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.460
 can come very well many times a year 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.170
 past the same we played well the first 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.080
 part we had occasions and the second 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.840
 they beat us down and I think it's something 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.119
 that the team also needed to improve 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.369
 and I think it's good that with this work 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.369
 Well, it can help us a lot, I think that 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.619
 until now especially we had in mind 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.820
 improve the physical theme many matches 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.950
 we train in the morning and then 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.430
 in the afternoon and well we have already enough 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.070
 tired I think it's good that we have to 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.920
 improve on the goal that's clear 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 that we have scored few goals and create more 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.450
 and good times that's something that 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.390
 we all know I think that being all 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.970
 the entire template and since 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:17.360
 since Saturday's game start now 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.310
 look more adjustments as to the equipment 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.070
 and well I think that as I said 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.470
 before now we are already 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.930
 approaching the best level physically that 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.720
 it's very important and now I think about 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.000
 compete well without playing against athletic 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.489
 because it is always an attractive party and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.430
 good does not stop being preseason 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.400
 we have to always in preseason I think 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.580
 that you have to know that the most important 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.220
 is to take out as the sensations see that the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.709
 team is improving that is taking steps 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.050
 forward that we carry then in this 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.660
 so look like creating more chances 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.300
 or being very well placed that we do not 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.680
 make chances I think in the end more 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.380
 beyond results the important the 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 preseason 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.700
 I told you the important thing is to get to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.770
 one hundred for five in the sports and take out 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.940
 the three points in that match well very 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.070
 well the truth that we really wanted 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:12.160
 that they all arrived and could be 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.810
 together being able to play some 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.440
 party and the entire staff of the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.420
 complete and good as I said before and 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.960
 there is little we have to go 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:26.710
 adjusting everything until now because we have 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:29.770
 thought more about the physical and good 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.360
 I think we have improved a lot that the 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.910
 team is working very hard already 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.330
 from now on we must also go 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.720
 adjusting things to improve also in 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:44.020
 the theme of equipment and of and of topics 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.910
 individualities and good I have happy with 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.830
 the work of the team that is doing 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.350
 during all the preseason that I think 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.560
 it's being very good right now 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.340
 we are calm in that aspect as 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.780
 I have said many times before playing in 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.120
 preseason the load is noticeable and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.910
 well I think that we have also complicated 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.230
 played so many games without hardly having 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.450
 trained in the game or things and that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.190
 also because you notice it is not listening 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.480
 we know we have to score goals that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.650
 at the end is when the matches are won 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.210
 and we are now already working hard 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.940
 in it and surely we are going to improve 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:23.970
 we have I think a lot of quality up and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.980
 at the end they have to end up entering 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.360
 the key is that from the party the 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.460
 sports is when they have to enter 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.180
 the goals and when we have to start 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.250
 take out the points 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.750
 yes it is true that I already said the year 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.940
 past that many times he had played in 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.639
 band last year so what young 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.550
 I did not find everything comfortable 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:47.000
 that I would like and good so in the end 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.979
 we are players and good we have to 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.340
 adapt to the positions you need 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:53.539
 the team that has the coach and the 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.120
 true that other times it is played in 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.940
 equal bands for the style of play by 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.680
 for whatever it is then in other seasons 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.470
 I had found myself very comfortable there 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.599
 and years passed then not so much and there will be 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.849
 improve so I play play there then 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:11.780
 do your best and help the 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.820
 team if it is logical in the end is a 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.300
 team that we all want to be up and 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:19.940
 we know how good the more players 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.940
 well better players come then 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.940
 competition can also improve 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.040
 all though good I think the year 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.210
 passed and individually I do not think that 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.700
 we had a lot of problem I think 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.700
 we had good equipment and I think it was more 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.770
 same collective problem and that is what 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.180
 we have to improve not I believe that in 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.970
 We've done good matches for years 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.430
 past it cost us a lot and good 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.740
 we all want this year to be up on 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.960
 last year we also wanted it could not be 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.770
 but but let's try to fight for 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.889
 be up 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.599
 I think it's a wide player but 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.479
 that can also be shaped to play by 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:01.050
 inside it has a lot of quality is very 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:04.710
 vertical good ball hit good is 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.409
 a very young player that still that 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.289
 Of course it will improve a lot and good 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.669
 I'm sure this year if not this 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.909
 year is the next one that will triumph 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.370
 here because good quality has is very 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.949
 good hardworking people and things very 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:22.830
 clear very focused and good the truth 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.580
 which is a sure for real from here to 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.580
 future too
