00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:17.760
 Who have we a very old one? 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:19.859
 the ant man stops where he left off from 1989 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 a vending machine by capcom vending machines 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 or a mega drive game already 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.349
 pretty old gets but that has too 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 a sense for this player strider 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.579
 say very it's a remake is 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.320
 a reboot so a hair is ripe it is 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.120
 a new strider it is not like 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
 the old game waiting for the old game 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.020
 straight shooter straight of the automaton 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.059
 hard game 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:55.920
 this is he such an action adventure 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.090
 with open leveldesign where you like one 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.520
 This is one of their own 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.100
 freedom of movement you can on walls 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.989
 climb along and master so are you 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.540
 thou on the ceiling along hand over hand up 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.180
 I also like the beautiful mobiles a lot 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.619
 Well, I think it is different 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.000
 pretty cool of that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.490
 trade representative fig kami or too 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.500
 The ninjas' mouvement is very, very much 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.090
 dynamic you can jump in the middle 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.060
 can you change direction again? 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.070
 and can the complete jump again 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.659
 Undo is actually very much 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 good other, I think it's very good 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.530
 playable 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.570
 So far, I've been fighting that way 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 mediocre excited because you stop 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.740
 actually only a light blow as 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.909
 heavy blow hate and actually the 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.350
 all the time just wild on the keys 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 hammering it is not really tactical 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.250
 but it is very fast for me I think 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 the challenge, therefore, is that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.700
 to the character just really the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.380
 whole time in motion so has 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.740
 standstill goes to this game ghana 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.180
 you feel like a flash and yourself 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.680
 I think I can not attack 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.880
 block big now or something like that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.469
 is actually quite pretty 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.329
 defenseless and must therefore also the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.770
 all the time dodge exactly one 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.079
 I do not have any blog yet 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 found but for a possibility to 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.590
 reflect shots 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.479
 that is an extra then later 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.150
 still coming 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.980
 one collects extras like in a match 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.510
 less so you get upgrades 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.000
 Double jump and something like her own 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.970
 you increase its its life points 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.890
 bar and so what was me totally 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.019
 appeals because I'm a big fan of 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.840
 I'm playing such and that too 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.730
 me one of the most attractive aspects of 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.930
 the game and what I like very well 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.769
 like that presentation 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.410
 yes I really think it's totally this one 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.209
 open levels team and of course that's the way it is 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.150
 classic 2d gameplay but I think 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.549
 you get very nice spatial 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.260
 impression of the effect of the levels 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.810
 really big through this beautiful 3d 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.370
 environment and are always over again 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.530
 nice reflections to see 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.040
 So I think it's a stylistic 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.590
 very very nice game and also effect 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 overflow partly straight into the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.959
 boss fight usually quite the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 easy but they are cool 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.640
 So did the bike 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.900
 so a retro charm wild cut it 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.889
 Dodge attacks 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:15.109
 Put me really tactical but it 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:17.690
 It's fun and fun 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.269
 Now again for the gambler of the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.700
 originals there are many 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.299
 sound effects and innuendo unlustig 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.069
 quite falling so that is served 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.530
 Also a bit the retro fans here 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.510
 everything really comes to life 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.510
 successful remake or ilike
