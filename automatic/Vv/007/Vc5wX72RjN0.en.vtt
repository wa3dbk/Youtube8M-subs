00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
you would go perfectly with a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:28.809 
you would go perfectly with a
tuberculosis<00:02:13.430> that's<00:02:14.430> will<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.700> used<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.120> that

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:45.650 

when<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.970> first<00:02:31.549> like<00:02:44.330> they're<00:02:45.330> not<00:02:45.450> gonna

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
when you first like they're not gonna

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.320 
when you first like they're not gonna
make<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:45.989> connection<00:02:46.440> yes<00:02:47.030> right<00:02:48.030> away

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
make the connection yes right away

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.850 
make the connection yes right away
certainly<00:02:48.900> something<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.410> need<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.620> consider

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
certainly something you need to consider

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.420 
certainly something you need to consider
later<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.900> yeah<00:02:51.900> right<00:02:52.470> away<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.069> think<00:02:53.099> it's

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
later on yeah right away you think it's

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.390 
later on yeah right away you think it's
too<00:02:53.700> short<00:02:54.350> little<00:02:55.350> things<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.130> a<00:02:56.190> really

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
too short little things I think a really

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.130 
too short little things I think a really
important<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:56.940> they<00:02:57.090> say<00:02:57.299> when<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:58.019> puppy

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
important that they say when your puppy

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.199 
important that they say when your puppy
is<00:02:58.440> doing<00:02:58.829> like<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.160> do<00:02:59.370> it<00:02:59.519> was<00:02:59.820> chewing<00:03:00.090> on

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
is doing like you do it was chewing on

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.509 
is doing like you do it was chewing on
your<00:03:00.239> feet<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:01.530> need<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.739> be<00:03:01.829> quite<00:03:02.040> fun<00:03:02.310> with

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
your feet you need to be quite fun with

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.250 
your feet you need to be quite fun with
it<00:03:02.640> when<00:03:02.760> I<00:03:02.790> probably<00:03:03.000> choose<00:03:03.269> don't<00:03:03.450> me<00:03:03.660> go<00:03:03.780> to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it when I probably choose don't me go to

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.870 
it when I probably choose don't me go to
the<00:03:04.320> scruff<00:03:04.590> let<00:03:04.739> me<00:03:04.799> pull<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.040> away<00:03:05.220> if<00:03:05.760> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
the scruff let me pull it away if it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.789 
the scruff let me pull it away if it
continues<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.570> try<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.930> bite<00:03:07.079> then<00:03:07.620> I'll

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
continues to try and bite then I'll

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.920 
continues to try and bite then I'll
eventually<00:03:08.609> we're<00:03:08.940> here<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.540> tweaked<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
eventually we're here it's tweaked a

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.509 
eventually we're here it's tweaked a
little<00:03:09.959> bit<00:03:10.230> when<00:03:10.500> they<00:03:10.620> do<00:03:10.829> it<00:03:10.980> the<00:03:11.160> physics

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
little bit when they do it the physics

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.620 
little bit when they do it the physics
like<00:03:11.700> okay<00:03:12.180> bunny<00:03:12.359> does<00:03:12.660> not<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> film<00:03:13.260> yeah<00:03:13.980> and

like okay bunny does not a film yeah and
those<00:03:15.630> kind<00:03:16.079> of<00:03:16.109> things<00:03:16.200> are<00:03:16.530> really

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
those kind of things are really

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.210 
those kind of things are really
important<00:03:17.400> right<00:03:17.549> now

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
important right now

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.680 
important right now
sure<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:19.080> making<00:03:20.080> sure<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:20.380> you<00:03:20.560> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
sure that you making sure that you and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.560 
sure that you making sure that you and
you<00:03:22.690> hear<00:03:22.870> if<00:03:22.960> some<00:03:23.140> people<00:03:23.290> say
