yeast that is still in solution is going

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.520 
yeast that is still in solution is going
to<00:00:35.760> eat<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.000> all<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.600> priming<00:00:37.079> sugar<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.500> we

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
to eat up all that priming sugar that we

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
to eat up all that priming sugar that we
just<00:00:37.829> put<00:00:38.010> into<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:39.059> that's<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
just put into it and that's going to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.209 
just put into it and that's going to
release<00:00:39.840> carbon<00:00:40.200> dioxide<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.070> pressurize

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
release carbon dioxide and pressurize

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.150 
release carbon dioxide and pressurize
the<00:00:41.730> bottle<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> give<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.629> carbonation<00:00:43.469> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the bottle and give you carbonation so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.119 
the bottle and give you carbonation so
in<00:00:44.460> two<00:00:45.300> weeks<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:46.230> can<00:00:46.350> try<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> have<00:00:46.890> one

in two weeks you can try to have one

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.010 
in two weeks you can try to have one
bottle<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> see<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.809> enough

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
bottle and see if it's got enough

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.860 
bottle and see if it's got enough
carbonation<00:00:49.379> you're<00:00:49.829> good<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.129> go<00:00:50.239> in<00:00:51.239> three

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
carbonation you're good to go in three

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.779 
carbonation you're good to go in three
weeks<00:00:52.190> probably<00:00:53.190> you're<00:00:53.430> going<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> get<00:00:53.730> a
