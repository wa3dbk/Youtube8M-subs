game as a college athlete how difficult

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.480 
game as a college athlete how difficult
was<00:05:09.699> that<00:05:09.759> when<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.270> seconds<00:05:10.720> wind<00:05:10.930> down<00:05:11.490> to

second<00:05:55.120> half<00:05:55.240> because<00:05:55.450> second<00:05:56.020> half<00:05:56.140> the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
second half because second half the

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.020 
second half because second half the
offense<00:05:56.440> really<00:05:57.130> seemed<00:05:57.400> to<00:05:57.490> first<00:05:57.760> start

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
offense really seemed to first start

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.600 
offense really seemed to first start
firing<00:05:58.330> on<00:05:58.600> all<00:05:58.630> cylinders<00:05:58.920> I'd<00:05:59.920> take<00:06:00.220> upon

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
firing on all cylinders I'd take upon

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.340 
firing on all cylinders I'd take upon
myself<00:06:00.640> and<00:06:01.180> the<00:06:01.300> first<00:06:01.510> half<00:06:01.720> they<00:06:02.080> can't

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
myself and the first half they can't

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:03.630 
myself and the first half they can't
turn<00:06:02.500> the<00:06:02.560> ball<00:06:02.770> over<00:06:02.830> to<00:06:03.190> a<00:06:03.220> team<00:06:03.430> like<00:06:03.580> that

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640 
turn the ball over to a team like that

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.010 
turn the ball over to a team like that
and<00:06:05.070> that<00:06:06.070> was<00:06:06.190> that<00:06:06.580> was<00:06:06.670> the<00:06:06.730> story<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.720> mean

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
and that was that was the story I mean

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.780 
and that was that was the story I mean
we<00:06:08.110> had<00:06:08.140> to<00:06:08.410> turn<00:06:08.590> over<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:09.070> kill<00:06:09.280> drives<00:06:09.610> in

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
we had to turn over to kill drives in

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.850 
we had to turn over to kill drives in
the<00:06:09.820> first<00:06:10.000> half<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.270> led<00:06:10.480> to<00:06:10.600> sit<00:06:10.900> seven<00:06:11.650> or

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
the first half and led to sit seven or

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.160 
the first half and led to sit seven or
14<00:06:12.460> points<00:06:12.760> for<00:06:12.790> them<00:06:13.000> so<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.300> was<00:06:13.690> the

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:14.170 
14 points for them so that was the

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:16.560 
14 points for them so that was the
difference<00:06:14.260> as<00:06:14.680> turnover<00:06:15.120> talk<00:06:16.120> about<00:06:16.390> the
