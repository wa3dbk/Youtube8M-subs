00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
compass so let's get right into the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.139 
compass so let's get right into the
video<00:00:32.820> guys<00:00:38.090> um<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.750> gonna<00:00:39.930> take<00:00:40.290> about

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
video guys um this is gonna take about

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.770 
video guys um this is gonna take about
until<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.180> find<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.809> good<00:00:43.170> base<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.739> attack<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
until I find a good base to attack and

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.080 
until I find a good base to attack and
what<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.020> strategy<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.000> have

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
what the strategy is is first you have

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.709 
what the strategy is is first you have
to<00:00:48.120> deploy<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.809> pekka's<00:00:49.770> front<00:00:50.430> line<00:00:50.789> then

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
to deploy your pekka's front line then

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
to deploy your pekka's front line then
the<00:00:51.870> wizards<00:00:52.230> are<00:00:52.469> here<00:00:52.770> because<00:00:53.100> they're

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the wizards are here because they're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.729 
the wizards are here because they're
gonna<00:00:53.460> back<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> pekka's<00:00:54.530> cause<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
gonna back up the pekka's cause the

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.819 
gonna back up the pekka's cause the
pekka's<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.789> big<00:00:57.270> meat<00:00:57.629> shields<00:00:58.109> that's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
pekka's are the big meat shields that's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.100 
pekka's are the big meat shields that's
what<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> job<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> for<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.170> and<00:01:01.170> um<00:01:01.770> yeah<00:01:02.340> just

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
what the job is for it and um yeah just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.690 
what the job is for it and um yeah just
find<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.229> good<00:01:04.379> base<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:07.369> this<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
find the good base and this will be a

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:24.620 
find the good base and this will be a
good<00:01:08.970> rate<00:01:10.430> yep<00:01:14.240> no<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:22.939> can<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.090> better<00:01:24.330> loop

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
good rate yep no I can find better loop

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.789 
good rate yep no I can find better loop
since<00:01:25.200> peckers<00:01:25.740> do<00:01:26.159> cost<00:01:26.509> 30,000<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.720> legs<00:01:28.590> are

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
since peckers do cost 30,000 a legs are

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.179 
since peckers do cost 30,000 a legs are
for<00:01:29.310> level<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.729> pekka's<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.750> correct<00:01:31.189> and

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
for level one pekka's if I'm correct and

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.370 
for level one pekka's if I'm correct and
that<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.729> lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> legacy<00:01:33.720> since<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.259> have

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that is a lot of the legacy since I have

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920 
that is a lot of the legacy since I have
three<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> ninety<00:01:35.759> thousand<00:01:36.509> Alexa

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
three which is ninety thousand Alexa

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.020 
three which is ninety thousand Alexa
plus<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> wizards<00:01:38.360> and<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.350> Wizards<00:01:40.710> cost

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
plus the wizards and the Wizards cost

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.359 
plus the wizards and the Wizards cost
2500<00:01:42.030> each<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.720> oh<00:01:45.829> he<00:01:46.829> does<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.189> two

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
2500 each I think oh he does have two

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.899 
2500 each I think oh he does have two
Inferno<00:01:47.700> towers<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.270> Inferno<00:01:48.630> towers<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.909> lot

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
Inferno towers and Inferno towers a lot

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
Inferno towers and Inferno towers a lot
of<00:01:51.090> damage<00:01:52.520> like<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> lot<00:01:54.680> especially<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of damage like a lot especially to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.709 
of damage like a lot especially to
pekka's<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.820> Dragons<00:01:59.240> so<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.390> just<00:02:00.570> gonna

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
pekka's and Dragons so I'm just gonna

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.429 
pekka's and Dragons so I'm just gonna
keep<00:02:01.020> searching<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.649> about<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.130> base<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.820> mean

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
keep searching for about a base I mean

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.449 
keep searching for about a base I mean
and<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> find<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> base<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.640> perfect<00:02:06.350> um

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:07.459 
and so I find the base that's perfect um

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:13.520 
and so I find the base that's perfect um
I<00:02:08.509> could<00:02:09.509> find<00:02:09.690> better<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:12.750> army

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
I could find better and this army

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.640 
I could find better and this army
composition<00:02:13.950> cost<00:02:14.370> about<00:02:15.140> 200<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.410> CERN

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
composition cost about 200 I like CERN

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.270 
composition cost about 200 I like CERN
upper<00:02:16.950> which<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.790> lot<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.860> have<00:02:19.860> 1<00:02:20.100> million

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
upper which is a lot I have 1 million

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.680 
upper which is a lot I have 1 million
something<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.850> lecture<00:02:21.120> now<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> only<00:02:21.600> have

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
something the lecture now I only have

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:29.740 
something the lecture now I only have
800<00:02:22.560> thousand<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.959> pretty<00:02:25.440> good<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.580 

the<00:02:30.750> space<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.390> only<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.480> 5%<00:02:33.810> battery<00:02:34.230> left

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the space is I only have 5% battery left

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.770 
the space is I only have 5% battery left
so<00:02:34.830> after<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> speed<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.580> Stingo<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:41.780> don't

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
so after the speed of Stingo I don't

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:56.090 
so after the speed of Stingo I don't
want<00:02:42.930> that<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.290> happen<00:02:46.910> no<00:02:51.890> no<00:02:53.330> and<00:02:54.650> I'm<00:02:55.650> sorry
