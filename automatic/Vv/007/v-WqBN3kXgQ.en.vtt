00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.680
 Especially a company 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 Do you think carefully 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.650
 As a result, the intention of the leader negotiation 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.640

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 Pieces of one stroke and sram memory to fall apart 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.740

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.049
 Because I have friends 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.899
 Need time to think before the tomb 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.959
 Don't think 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 Where I really should change 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.609
