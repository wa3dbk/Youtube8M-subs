00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
quickly as well it's definitely on par

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:40.330 
quickly as well it's definitely on par
with<00:01:23.290> other<00:01:23.590> os's<00:01:24.070> like<00:01:24.430> Android<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.090> iOS

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

okay<00:01:41.340> now<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.550> is<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.700> downside<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
okay now there is one downside to

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.360 
okay now there is one downside to
Windows<00:01:42.600> Phone<00:01:42.720> 7<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.920> that's<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> fact<00:01:44.280> that

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
Windows Phone 7 and that's the fact that

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.100 
Windows Phone 7 and that's the fact that
there's<00:01:44.580> no<00:01:44.640> multitasking<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.900> can't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there's no multitasking so you can't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.900 
there's no multitasking so you can't
open<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.350> nap<00:01:46.530> then<00:01:46.800> another<00:01:47.010> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.400> jump

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
open a nap then another and then jump

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.850 
open a nap then another and then jump
back<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.240> original<00:01:48.540> one<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.650> be

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
back to the original one and have it be

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
back to the original one and have it be
where<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.160> left<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.300> literally<00:01:51.570> reopens

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
where you left it it literally reopens

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.240 
where you left it it literally reopens
of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.290> app<00:01:52.410> and<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.800> to<00:01:52.920> start<00:01:53.130> over

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
of the app and you have to start over

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.940 
of the app and you have to start over
which<00:01:53.910> is<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.270> annoying<00:01:54.900> when<00:01:55.350> playing<00:01:55.830> a
