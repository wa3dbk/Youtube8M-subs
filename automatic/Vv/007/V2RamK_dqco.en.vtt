00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
the precision tool to help you make

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.640 
the precision tool to help you make
really<00:00:18.029> cool<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.570> awesome<00:00:18.660> bases<00:00:19.230> we're

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
really cool and awesome bases we're

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.900 
really cool and awesome bases we're
gonna<00:00:19.770> be<00:00:19.890> looking<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.369> first<00:00:20.580> three

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
gonna be looking at the first three

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.679 
gonna be looking at the first three
apply<00:00:21.330> rotate<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> move<00:00:23.300> the<00:00:24.300> first<00:00:24.510> tool

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
apply rotate and move the first tool

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
apply rotate and move the first tool
we're<00:00:24.810> gonna<00:00:24.900> look<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.590> apply<00:00:25.949> tool

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
we're gonna look at is the apply tool

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.490 
we're gonna look at is the apply tool
what<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> lets<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.449> push<00:00:27.720> pull<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
what it lets you do is push pull and

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.370 
what it lets you do is push pull and
align<00:00:28.859> targets<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.640> world<00:00:30.140> basically<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
align targets to the world basically the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.530 
align targets to the world basically the
way<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.679> do<00:00:31.830> this<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> if<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.820> want<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> align

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
way we do this is if you want to align

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790 
way we do this is if you want to align
it<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.930> world<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.260> need<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.649> this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it to the world you need to have this

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.709 
it to the world you need to have this
box<00:00:35.070> checked<00:00:35.219> what<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.090> auto<00:00:36.239> align<00:00:36.510> tool

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
box checked what the auto align tool

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.450 
box checked what the auto align tool
does<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> same<00:00:37.440> thing<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.860> shifty<00:00:38.280> does

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
does is the same thing that shifty does

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
does is the same thing that shifty does
when<00:00:38.670> you're<00:00:38.790> rotating<00:00:39.210> something<00:00:39.570> with<00:00:39.690> your

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
when you're rotating something with your

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.610 
when you're rotating something with your
fist<00:00:40.200> gun<00:00:40.940> now<00:00:41.940> as<00:00:42.210> we're<00:00:42.840> still<00:00:43.020> under<00:00:43.260> apply

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
fist gun now as we're still under apply

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.830 
fist gun now as we're still under apply
we're<00:00:43.800> gonna<00:00:43.920> check<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.910> push-pull<00:00:45.539> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
we're gonna check out the push-pull and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.389 
we're gonna check out the push-pull and
what<00:00:46.020> push-pull<00:00:46.500> lets<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.370> lets

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
what push-pull lets you do is it lets

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.240 
what push-pull lets you do is it lets
you<00:00:47.610> select<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.300> push-pull<00:00:49.230> amount<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.950> then

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you select a push-pull amount and then

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
you select a push-pull amount and then
with<00:00:50.460> secondary<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.030> reload<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.690> push

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
with secondary and reload you can push

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.319 
with secondary and reload you can push
and<00:00:52.590> pull<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.489> target<00:00:53.879> extra<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.239> gonna

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
and pull the target extra we're gonna

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.029 
and pull the target extra we're gonna
look<00:00:54.480> at<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> rotate<00:00:55.350> tool<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.890> does

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
look at is the rotate tool and that does

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
look at is the rotate tool and that does
exactly<00:00:56.309> what<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.820> says<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.360> rotates<00:00:58.109> an

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
exactly what that says it rotates an

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.619 
exactly what that says it rotates an
object<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.800> an<00:00:59.190> axis<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.120> only<00:01:00.329> thing<00:01:00.510> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
object on an axis the only thing you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.150 
object on an axis the only thing you
need<00:01:00.750> checked<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.530> one<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.859> free

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
need checked for this one is free

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
need checked for this one is free
started<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.030> what<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.239> rotate<00:01:03.539> tool<00:01:03.570> allows

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
started so what the rotate tool allows

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
started so what the rotate tool allows
us<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.199> do<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.470> pick<00:01:04.739> an<00:01:04.860> access<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.519> prop<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
us to do is pick an access on a prop and

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
us to do is pick an access on a prop and
then<00:01:06.270> move<00:01:06.420> our<00:01:06.570> mouse<00:01:06.720> left<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.229> right<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
then move our mouse left to right to

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340 
then move our mouse left to right to
rotate<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.150> shoot<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.450> once<00:01:09.630> we<00:01:10.049> start

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
rotate it so we shoot it once we start

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.010 
rotate it so we shoot it once we start
rotating<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.130> then<00:01:11.430> we<00:01:11.520> shoot<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.820> again<00:01:12.020> to

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
rotating and then we shoot it again to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.450 
rotating and then we shoot it again to
stop<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.409> rotation<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.979> last<00:01:14.189> tool<00:01:14.430> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
stop the rotation the last tool that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
stop the rotation the last tool that
we're<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.210> today<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.810> move

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
we're gonna look at today is the move

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.469 
we're gonna look at today is the move
tool<00:01:16.770> this<00:01:17.460> one<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.850> get<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.240> confusing

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
tool this one can get a little confusing

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
tool this one can get a little confusing
if<00:01:18.900> your<00:01:19.049> settings<00:01:19.439> aren't<00:01:19.710> set<00:01:19.890> right<00:01:20.130> really

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
if your settings aren't set right really

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.010 
if your settings aren't set right really
all<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.330> this<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.750> freeze

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
all you need for this one is freeze

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.140 
all you need for this one is freeze
target<00:01:22.560> checked<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.250> your<00:01:23.400> snap<00:01:23.640> distance

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
target checked and your snap distance

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.120 
target checked and your snap distance
set<00:01:24.720> at<00:01:24.900> zero<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> everything<00:01:26.009> else

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
set at zero and everything else

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
set at zero and everything else
unchecked<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.509> move<00:01:27.689> tool<00:01:27.930> does<00:01:28.140> exactly

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
unchecked the move tool does exactly

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.640 
unchecked the move tool does exactly
what<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> says<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.100> allows<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.759> move<00:01:30.119> props

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
what it says it allows you to move props

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.800 
what it says it allows you to move props
so<00:01:31.650> basically<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.579> works<00:01:32.610> is<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.270> shoot<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
so basically how it works is you shoot a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.450 
so basically how it works is you shoot a
point<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.799> prop<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.280> we're<00:01:35.369> gonna

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
point on your first prop so we're gonna

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.580 
point on your first prop so we're gonna
pick<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> bottom<00:01:36.450> middle<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.409> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pick the bottom middle right there and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.740 
pick the bottom middle right there and
then<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.220> shoot<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> point<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> next<00:01:39.479> prop

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
then you shoot a point on the next prop

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
then you shoot a point on the next prop
so<00:01:40.020> we're<00:01:40.200> gonna<00:01:40.290> pick<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.250> top<00:01:41.549> middle<00:01:42.000> and
