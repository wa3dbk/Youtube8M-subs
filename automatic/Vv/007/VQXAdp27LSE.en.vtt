00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 hi friends today i want to say that 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.240
 I have one very attentive 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.450
 the viewer and I like his approach to business 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.089
 in this video I will tell you about the stop 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.300
 who made artem for these here 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.640
 sand vise secured to 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.519
 turntable and turntable 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.140
 very little space so he had to 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.260
 a little imagination 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.470
 from his words I understood that he is 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.710
 novice millers and before that he 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.100
 worked on coordinate boring 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.280
 equipment but he has a good grip 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.300
 and as I understood, he himself is also not a man 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.480
 bastard 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.030
 and pretty clever right 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 the side of the grip he secured ordinary 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.789
 clamp well and on the second 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.120
 he set the clamp with an extended bolt 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.250
 on this bolt he fixed 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 pinch with a sharp nose and took advantage 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.720
 im both focusing and here are these two checker checks 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.250
 lie apart from the grip like we 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 see one classic 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.880
 and the other is a check clip with a lobe and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.920
 Now a little more detail for 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.490
 clamping vice on the left side 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.119
 longer bolt is used it is like 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.729
 usually pressed with a nut and on top of it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:29.460
 another nut is screwed on this nut 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.430
 will serve as a support for the second clamp 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 regiment need to pick up such length to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.700
 above it was possible to impose a puck and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.979
 screw the whole thing as a nut you in 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.590
 this video I can add that you can 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.229
 use more tricky dog stops and 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.210
 designs as you see here are two 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.869
 clamps that i use as 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.470
 stop one of them is straight and the other with 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.869
 curved nose but emphasis with curved 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.420
 spout is not always possible to apply and 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.210
 probably artem situation 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.399
 he would not fit but as an option you 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.129
 can remember such an application and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.440
 maybe he 'll come in handy sometime 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.780
 Well, this is probably all thanks for 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.380
 attention thanks Artem 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.380
 goodbye
