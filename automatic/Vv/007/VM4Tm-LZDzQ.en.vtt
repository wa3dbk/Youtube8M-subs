the street had but these are your guys

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.789 
the street had but these are your guys
you've<00:00:03.389> built<00:00:03.629> this<00:00:03.720> base<00:00:04.049> there<00:00:04.319> your<00:00:04.500> troops

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
you've built this base there your troops

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.800 
you've built this base there your troops
you<00:00:04.980> get<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.250> see<00:00:05.400> them<00:00:05.549> working<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.660> that's

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
you get to see them working and that's

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.259 
you get to see them working and that's
really<00:00:07.140> really<00:00:07.350> cool<00:00:07.970> let's<00:00:08.970> go<00:00:09.090> ahead<00:00:09.179> and

look at our soldiers will go into the
barracks<00:00:11.269> this<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.450> where<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.750> set<00:00:13.049> up<00:00:13.200> your

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
barracks this is where you set up your

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.990 
barracks this is where you set up your
soldiers<00:00:14.070> if<00:00:14.250> they've<00:00:14.400> received<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.849> promotion

their names and we recommend that you
name<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.699> after<00:00:26.849> friends<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.390> family

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
name them after friends and family

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.029 
name them after friends and family
members<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> when<00:00:28.349> they<00:00:28.439> die<00:00:28.590> horribly

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
members so that when they die horribly

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.320 
members so that when they die horribly
during<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.369> alien<00:00:29.699> invasion<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.150> will<00:00:30.240> be

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
during the alien invasion it will be

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.700 
during the alien invasion it will be
that<00:00:30.449> much<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.660> poignant<00:00:31.050> for<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> was

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
that much more poignant for you that was

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.450 
that much more poignant for you that was
another<00:00:31.830> classic<00:00:32.309> ex-con<00:00:32.640> moment<00:00:34.280> but<00:00:35.280> we

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
another classic ex-con moment but we

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.250 
another classic ex-con moment but we
have<00:00:35.640> been<00:00:35.790> page<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.210> science<00:00:36.540> labs<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.110> we

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
have been page to the science labs so we

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.560 
have been page to the science labs so we
should<00:00:37.410> probably<00:00:37.620> go<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:37.980> next<00:00:38.210> my<00:00:39.210> name<00:00:39.420> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
should probably go there next my name is

building weapons to fight the aliens

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.750 
building weapons to fight the aliens
themselves<00:00:59.440> so<00:00:59.800> you<00:00:59.890> turning<00:01:00.280> the<00:01:00.370> aliens

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
themselves so you turning the aliens

themselves so you turning the aliens
strengths<00:01:01.149> against<00:01:01.480> them<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:02.170> as<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.350> recover

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
strengths against them so as you recover

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.869 
strengths against them so as you recover
things<00:01:03.040> in<00:01:03.219> the<00:01:03.280> field<00:01:03.489> you're<00:01:03.699> going<00:01:03.820> to

bring it back to your science labs for

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.649 
bring it back to your science labs for
your<00:01:05.710> researchers<00:01:06.250> to<00:01:06.430> research<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.479> once

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
your researchers to research and once

your researchers to research and once
they've<00:01:07.810> unlocked<00:01:08.110> new<00:01:08.409> technologies<00:01:09.040> you'll

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
they've unlocked new technologies you'll

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.940 
they've unlocked new technologies you'll
go<00:01:09.700> to<00:01:09.759> engineering<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:11.350> your<00:01:11.470> engineers

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
go to engineering and your engineers

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.740 
go to engineering and your engineers
will<00:01:12.159> be<00:01:12.280> able<00:01:12.369> to<00:01:12.490> build<00:01:12.670> new<00:01:12.820> armor<00:01:13.479> and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
will be able to build new armor and

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.990 
will be able to build new armor and
weapons<00:01:14.140> and<00:01:14.440> items<00:01:14.560> for<00:01:15.040> you<00:01:15.159> and<00:01:15.369> you<00:01:15.850> have

weapons and items for you and you have

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.639 
weapons and items for you and you have
tough<00:01:16.390> choices<00:01:16.600> to<00:01:16.869> make<00:01:16.899> here<00:01:17.229> so<00:01:17.440> do<00:01:17.590> you

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
tough choices to make here so do you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.680 
tough choices to make here so do you
build<00:01:17.770> new<00:01:17.950> armor<00:01:18.369> to<00:01:18.549> cut<00:01:18.700> down<00:01:18.880> on<00:01:19.119> the

build new armor to cut down on the
casualty<00:01:20.200> rate<00:01:20.440> or<00:01:20.950> do<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.399> build<00:01:21.580> a<00:01:21.700> new

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
casualty rate or do you build a new

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.210 
casualty rate or do you build a new
module<00:01:22.030> for<00:01:22.509> your<00:01:22.600> base<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:23.110> expand<00:01:23.799> ex-cons

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220
