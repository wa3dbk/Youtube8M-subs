durability brisa light changes that
finally<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:56.819> have<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> soft<00:01:57.360> gel<00:01:57.629> that<00:01:57.989> comes

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
finally we have a soft gel that comes

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.319 
finally we have a soft gel that comes
off<00:01:58.409> easy<00:01:58.709> but<00:01:59.159> has<00:01:59.310> great<00:01:59.640> durability<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
off easy but has great durability and

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.240 
off easy but has great durability and
great<00:02:00.569> toughness<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.890> this<00:02:01.979> gel

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
great toughness so I think that this gel

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.279 
great toughness so I think that this gel
is<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.579> change<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.939> industry<00:02:03.289> all

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
is going to change the industry all

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.569 
is going to change the industry all
