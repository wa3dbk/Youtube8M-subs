hey<00:00:02.100> I<00:00:02.129> just<00:00:02.220> wanted<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.820> show<00:00:03.270> my<00:00:03.659> champion

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
hey I just wanted to show my champion

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.270 
hey I just wanted to show my champion
600<00:00:05.450> tube<00:00:06.450> amplifier<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.560> I<00:00:07.620> did<00:00:07.919> a<00:00:07.950> couple

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
600 tube amplifier that I did a couple

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.070 
600 tube amplifier that I did a couple
of<00:00:08.340> quick<00:00:08.519> modifications<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.690> were<00:00:09.780> very

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
of quick modifications to that were very

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.390 
of quick modifications to that were very
easy<00:00:10.320> very<00:00:10.679> cheap<00:00:12.559> first<00:00:13.559> thing<00:00:13.799> was<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
easy very cheap first thing was to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.689 
easy very cheap first thing was to
remove<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.240> factory<00:00:15.719> grille<00:00:16.080> cloth<00:00:16.699> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
remove the factory grille cloth the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.960 
remove the factory grille cloth the
cloth<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.930> comes<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.560> thing<00:00:19.880> is<00:00:20.880> a

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
cloth that comes on this thing is a

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.210 
cloth that comes on this thing is a
heavy<00:00:22.039> felty<00:00:23.449> material<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:25.410> I'm<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.980> even

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
heavy felty material that I'm not even

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.310 
heavy felty material that I'm not even
sure<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:27.300> breathe<00:00:27.570> through<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.050> if<00:00:28.199> you

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
sure you could breathe through it if you

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.839 
sure you could breathe through it if you
put<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> over<00:00:28.680> your<00:00:28.859> mouth<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.070> nose<00:00:29.310> it

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
put it over your mouth and nose it

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
put it over your mouth and nose it
really<00:00:30.390> does<00:00:30.539> not<00:00:30.660> let<00:00:30.929> much<00:00:31.109> air<00:00:31.320> through<00:00:31.560> it

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
really does not let much air through it

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.510 
really does not let much air through it
all<00:00:32.660> kind<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.750> muffles<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> sound<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:35.340> some

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
all kind of muffles the sound to some

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.540 
all kind of muffles the sound to some
degree<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.110> had<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:38.239> funky-looking

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
degree so I had this funky-looking

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.430 
degree so I had this funky-looking
speaker<00:00:41.550> cloth<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.660> took<00:00:42.809> off<00:00:43.140> of<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
speaker cloth that I took off of a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
speaker cloth that I took off of a
vintage<00:00:43.800> organ<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.489> my<00:00:44.640> church<00:00:44.940> was<00:00:45.180> getting

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
vintage organ that my church was getting

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.220 
vintage organ that my church was getting
rid<00:00:45.719> of<00:00:45.750> I<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.340> looks<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.610> little<00:00:48.230> looks

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
rid of I know that looks a little looks

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.160 
rid of I know that looks a little looks
a<00:00:49.350> little<00:00:49.410> crazy<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> liked<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
a little crazy but I kind of liked it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.110 
a little crazy but I kind of liked it
and<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.289> also<00:00:52.440> after<00:00:52.949> reading<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.850> these

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and then also after reading up on these

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.959 
and then also after reading up on these
amplifiers<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:55.050> decided<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.860> remove<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.910> r7

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
amplifiers I decided to remove the r7

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.610 
amplifiers I decided to remove the r7
negative<00:00:59.969> feedback<00:01:00.359> loop<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
negative feedback loop out of the

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.310 
negative feedback loop out of the
circuit<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.460> also<00:01:03.059> modify<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.570> tone<00:01:03.960> stack<00:01:04.290> a

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
circuit and also modify the tone stack a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.850 
circuit and also modify the tone stack a
bit<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.020> sling<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.140> here

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.969 

here's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> picture<00:01:11.250> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> circuit<00:01:12.030> board

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
here's a picture of the circuit board

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.850 
here's a picture of the circuit board
and<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.100> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.860> somebody's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
and you can see on this one somebody's

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.999 
and you can see on this one somebody's
already<00:01:17.040> removed<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> r7<00:01:18.680> that's<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
already removed the r7 that's just a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.719 
already removed the r7 that's just a
matter<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.369> clipping<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.090> at<00:01:21.270> both<00:01:21.450> ends<00:01:21.750> and

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
matter of clipping it at both ends and

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.749 
matter of clipping it at both ends and
then<00:01:23.729> here's<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> tone<00:01:24.420> stack<00:01:24.810> right<00:01:25.290> here

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
then here's the tone stack right here

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.560 
then here's the tone stack right here
and<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.970> r19<00:01:27.720> i<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:29.460> applied<00:01:29.850> heat<00:01:30.240> right

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
and this r19 i just applied heat right

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.789 
and this r19 i just applied heat right
here<00:01:30.890> pulled<00:01:31.890> up<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.250> end<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.540> resistor

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
here pulled up this end of the resistor

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.789 
here pulled up this end of the resistor
and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.040> wired<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.700> toggle<00:01:35.970> switch<00:01:36.799> you

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and then I wired in a toggle switch you

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.460 
and then I wired in a toggle switch you
know<00:01:37.920> one<00:01:38.189> one<00:01:38.700> side<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.210> toggle<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.749 

mounting<00:01:43.470> point<00:01:43.740> on<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> board<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
mounting point on the board and the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
mounting point on the board and the
other<00:01:44.790> side<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> toggle<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> actual

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
other side of the toggle to the actual

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
other side of the toggle to the actual
leg<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.210> resistor<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:54.450> back<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
leg of the resistor so the back of the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.420 
leg of the resistor so the back of the
amplifier

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.040 

now<00:01:58.430> have<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:58.820> toggle<00:01:59.060> switch<00:01:59.240> here<00:01:59.720> when

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
now have this toggle switch here when

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.450 
now have this toggle switch here when
it's<00:02:00.170> up<00:02:00.320> like<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.850> factory<00:02:03.100> tone<00:02:04.100> stack

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it's up like this the factory tone stack

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.240 
it's up like this the factory tone stack
is<00:02:04.790> still<00:02:05.330> in<00:02:05.450> place<00:02:05.720> and<00:02:06.710> when<00:02:06.830> you<00:02:06.920> click<00:02:07.130> it

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
is still in place and when you click it

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.290 
is still in place and when you click it
down<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:08.119> takes<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.690> hour<00:02:09.050> 19<00:02:10.030> out<00:02:11.030> of<00:02:11.210> the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
down that takes that hour 19 out of the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.330 
down that takes that hour 19 out of the
loop<00:02:11.450> there<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.020> effectively<00:02:12.800> kills<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
loop there and effectively kills that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.480 
loop there and effectively kills that
area<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.710> thought<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.370> would<00:02:16.550> show<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.820> what

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
area so I thought I would show you what

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.270 
area so I thought I would show you what
the<00:02:19.490> sound<00:02:19.730> difference<00:02:19.940> is<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:21.680> going<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:21.950> use

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the sound difference is I'm going to use

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.220 
the sound difference is I'm going to use
this<00:02:23.060> classic<00:02:24.020> vibe<00:02:24.700> Stratocaster<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:27.020> does

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
this classic vibe Stratocaster it does

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.010 
this classic vibe Stratocaster it does
have<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.500> Robert<00:02:27.950> Cray<00:02:28.450> loaded<00:02:29.450> pick<00:02:29.630> guard<00:02:29.840> in

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
have a Robert Cray loaded pick guard in

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.830 
have a Robert Cray loaded pick guard in
it<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.550> video<00:02:31.880> is<00:02:32.090> basically<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.570> to

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
it but this video is basically just to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.890 
it but this video is basically just to
show<00:02:33.020> you<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.350> sounds<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.310> to

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
show you the the sounds not to

alright<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:48.400> right<00:02:49.400> now<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.090> amplifier<00:02:50.870> is

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
alright so right now the amplifier is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.300 
alright so right now the amplifier is
set<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.340> 7<00:02:52.880> and<00:02:53.270> the<00:02:54.140> toggle<00:02:54.500> switches<00:02:54.680> up<00:02:55.040> in

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
set at 7 and the toggle switches up in

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.050 
set at 7 and the toggle switches up in
stock<00:02:55.610> mode<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:57.080> guitar<00:02:57.580> is<00:02:58.580> on<00:02:58.730> the<00:02:58.850> neck

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060

out of both volume and tone and so

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.100 
out of both volume and tone and so
here's<00:03:04.489> just<00:03:04.580> just<00:03:05.120> a<00:03:05.209> few<00:03:05.390> chords<00:03:05.750> just<00:03:05.959> so

you can hear what it sounds like in

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:30.230 
you can hear what it sounds like in
stock<00:03:07.970> format<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.540> volume<00:03:08.840> level

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.060 

the<00:03:31.240> stock<00:03:31.510> speaker<00:03:31.960> in<00:03:32.200> there<00:03:32.560> you<00:03:32.770> know<00:03:32.890> what

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
the stock speaker in there you know what

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:54.420

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.880 

all<00:03:55.430> right<00:03:55.580> now<00:03:55.940> changing<00:03:56.570> nothing<00:03:56.930> else<00:03:57.110> I'm

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
all right now changing nothing else I'm

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.970 
all right now changing nothing else I'm
just<00:03:57.950> going<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.340> flick<00:03:58.520> the<00:03:58.640> toggle<00:03:59.000> switch

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.590 

play<00:04:03.980> something<00:04:04.400> very<00:04:05.030> similar<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.540> same

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
play something very similar the same

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.260 
play something very similar the same
kind<00:04:05.960> of<00:04:05.990> thing<00:04:09.550> your<00:04:10.550> definite<00:04:11.120> volume

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:11.270 
kind of thing your definite volume

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.240 
kind of thing your definite volume
increase<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.170> significant

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:57.689 

the<00:04:17.000> mids<00:04:17.269> are<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.480> little<00:04:17.600> fuller

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:57.699 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.559 

and<00:04:58.699> now<00:05:00.759> I'm<00:05:01.759> going<00:05:01.909> to<00:05:01.999> turn<00:05:02.239> up<00:05:02.299> the

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:02.569 
and now I'm going to turn up the

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.759 
and now I'm going to turn up the
amplifier<00:05:03.019> all<00:05:03.529> the<00:05:03.739> way<00:05:05.799> to<00:05:06.799> 12<00:05:08.229> and<00:05:09.229> then<00:05:09.649> it

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:09.769 
amplifier all the way to 12 and then it

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:20.049 
amplifier all the way to 12 and then it
gets<00:05:10.659> real<00:05:11.659> loud<00:05:18.639> there's<00:05:19.639> a<00:05:19.729> lot<00:05:19.909> of

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:20.059 
gets real loud there's a lot of

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:33.110 
gets real loud there's a lot of
distortion

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:55.810 

Oh

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.800 

so<00:05:56.820> quite<00:05:57.210> a<00:05:57.240> big<00:05:57.420> difference<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.500> obviously

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810 
so quite a big difference and obviously

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.420 
so quite a big difference and obviously
you<00:06:00.810> can<00:06:00.990> roll<00:06:01.140> off<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.590> the<00:06:01.980> volume<00:06:02.280> on<00:06:02.400> the

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
you can roll off the the volume on the

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.940 
you can roll off the the volume on the
guitar<00:06:03.920> pick<00:06:04.920> a<00:06:04.950> little<00:06:05.100> bit<00:06:05.310> lighter<00:06:06.950> still

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
guitar pick a little bit lighter still

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.970 
guitar pick a little bit lighter still
get<00:06:08.160> some<00:06:08.510> clean<00:06:09.510> but<00:06:10.050> then<00:06:10.230> strike<00:06:10.500> it<00:06:10.650> harder

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:10.980 
get some clean but then strike it harder

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:17.060 
get some clean but then strike it harder
you<00:06:14.840> know<00:06:15.840> I'm<00:06:15.960> going<00:06:16.140> to<00:06:16.170> get<00:06:16.290> the<00:06:16.410> tone<00:06:16.950> to

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070 
you know I'm going to get the tone to

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:21.230 
you know I'm going to get the tone to
change<00:06:17.340> so<00:06:17.990> for<00:06:19.220> the<00:06:20.220> very<00:06:20.490> short<00:06:20.580> money<00:06:21.000> that

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
change so for the very short money that

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.780 
change so for the very short money that
this<00:06:21.390> cost<00:06:21.660> to<00:06:21.810> do<00:06:21.990> I<00:06:22.590> definitely<00:06:23.520> think<00:06:23.610> it

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:23.790 
this cost to do I definitely think it

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.970 
this cost to do I definitely think it
was<00:06:23.820> worth<00:06:24.060> it

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:24.980 
was worth it

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.030 
was worth it
if<00:06:25.980> for<00:06:26.280> nothing<00:06:26.400> else<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.830> give<00:06:29.010> a

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
if for nothing else just to give a

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.970 
if for nothing else just to give a
little<00:06:29.220> bit<00:06:29.400> more<00:06:29.540> tonal<00:06:30.540> variation<00:06:31.440> to<00:06:31.860> the

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
little bit more tonal variation to the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.650 
little bit more tonal variation to the
amp<00:06:32.480> so<00:06:35.240> there<00:06:36.240> you<00:06:36.330> go

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
amp so there you go

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.440 
amp so there you go
that's<00:06:36.840> what<00:06:36.960> I<00:06:36.990> did<00:06:37.170> with<00:06:37.290> mine
