00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:05.399 
okay so what I did I just walked around

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.480 
okay so what I did I just walked around
and<00:00:05.940> through<00:00:06.900> the<00:00:07.020> plants<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.620> I<00:00:07.680> just<00:00:07.980> took

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
and through the plants and I just took

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.150 
and through the plants and I just took
I<00:00:08.520> just<00:00:08.850> cut<00:00:09.030> tips<00:00:09.240> off<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.630> things<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.650> we

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
I just cut tips off of things so we we

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.730 
I just cut tips off of things so we we
could<00:00:11.309> propagate<00:00:11.550> some<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.179> these<00:00:12.300> and<00:00:12.740> here's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
could propagate some of these and here's

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.530 
could propagate some of these and here's
again<00:00:14.010> this<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> nice<00:00:14.639> minka<00:00:15.090> before<00:00:15.450> we

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
again this is a nice minka before we

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.630 
again this is a nice minka before we
looked<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.960> yucky<00:00:16.170> venca<00:00:16.650> but<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
looked at that yucky venca but this is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.040 
looked at that yucky venca but this is
nice<00:00:17.849> and<00:00:18.060> green<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.540> would<00:00:18.660> make<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.840> nice

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
nice and green and would make a nice

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.420 
nice and green and would make a nice
cutting<00:00:19.290> and<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.619> should<00:00:19.800> route<00:00:20.009> really<00:00:20.160> well

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
cutting and it should route really well

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.780 
cutting and it should route really well
it's<00:00:20.849> a<00:00:20.939> lot<00:00:21.090> thicker<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> lot<00:00:22.079> greener<00:00:22.790> we

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:23.790 
it's a lot thicker it's a lot greener we

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.600 
it's a lot thicker it's a lot greener we
did<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> coleus<00:00:24.989> before<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.860> this<00:00:26.009> is<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.220> good

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
did the coleus before and this is a good

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.609 
did the coleus before and this is a good
size<00:00:26.849> for<00:00:27.270> cutting<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:28.020> might<00:00:28.169> take<00:00:28.320> some<00:00:28.470> of

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
size for cutting it might take some of

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.909 
size for cutting it might take some of
these<00:00:28.680> bigger<00:00:28.980> leaves<00:00:29.250> off<00:00:30.529> so<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.710> about

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:31.919 
these bigger leaves off so it's about

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.610 
these bigger leaves off so it's about
got<00:00:32.460> four<00:00:32.700> sets<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.210> nice<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.500> know<00:00:34.590> I

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
got four sets of nice little you know I

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
got four sets of nice little you know I
mean<00:00:34.859> two<00:00:35.039> sets<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.489> know<00:00:35.609> Belize<00:00:36.539> this<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.350> an

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
mean two sets you know Belize this is an

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.819 
mean two sets you know Belize this is an
English<00:00:37.769> ivy<00:00:38.989> you<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.109> tell<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.440> was<00:00:40.530> cut

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
English ivy you can tell what it was cut

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
English ivy you can tell what it was cut
before<00:00:41.010> right<00:00:41.730> there<00:00:41.940> there's<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> cut<00:00:42.600> point

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
before right there there's a cut point

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.169 
before right there there's a cut point
so<00:00:43.170> maybe<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.500> might<00:00:43.679> just<00:00:43.859> cut<00:00:44.039> it<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.399> little

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
so maybe I might just cut it a little

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.630 
so maybe I might just cut it a little
above<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.989> take<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> leaf<00:00:46.649> off<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.429> good

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
above that take a leaf off that's a good

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.579 
above that take a leaf off that's a good
size<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.809> know<00:00:48.929> they<00:00:49.079> just<00:00:49.109> need<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:49.589 
size you know they just need to be a

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.169 
size you know they just need to be a
couple<00:00:49.920> inches<00:00:50.100> some<00:00:50.399> people<00:00:50.640> ask<00:00:50.850> me<00:00:50.940> how

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:51.179 
couple inches some people ask me how

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:52.759 
couple inches some people ask me how
many<00:00:51.359> notes<00:00:51.600> how<00:00:51.899> many<00:00:52.079> nodes<00:00:52.260> need<00:00:52.499> to<00:00:52.620> be<00:00:52.739> a

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
many notes how many nodes need to be a

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.160 
many notes how many nodes need to be a
but<00:00:53.370> below<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.120> ground<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.899> doesn't

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
but below the ground and it doesn't

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.419 
but below the ground and it doesn't
really<00:00:55.260> matter<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.769> like<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> couple<00:00:56.249> inches

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
really matter just like a couple inches

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:59.349 
really matter just like a couple inches
you<00:00:56.850> know<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.179> just<00:00:57.620> here's<00:00:58.620> another<00:00:58.859> one

you know you just here's another one

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:05.090 
you know you just here's another one
Lantana<00:01:02.749> you<00:01:03.749> know<00:01:03.870> if<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.650> were<00:01:04.739> worried

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
Lantana you know if you were worried

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
Lantana you know if you were worried
about<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.430> these<00:01:05.820> leaves<00:01:06.180> were<00:01:06.390> too<00:01:06.600> big<00:01:06.840> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
about that these leaves were too big you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.980 
about that these leaves were too big you
could<00:01:07.909> because<00:01:08.909> some<00:01:09.090> leaves<00:01:09.299> are<00:01:09.600> big<00:01:09.840> you

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
could because some leaves are big you

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.020 
could because some leaves are big you
can<00:01:10.170> cut<00:01:10.380> some<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.829> off<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.430> don't<00:01:11.579> have<00:01:11.729> to

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
can cut some of it off you don't have to

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.580 
can cut some of it off you don't have to
but<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.990> gonna<00:01:13.110> wilt<00:01:13.380> too

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
but if you think it's gonna wilt too

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.219 
but if you think it's gonna wilt too
much<00:01:13.909> they'll<00:01:14.909> be<00:01:15.060> fine<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.630> see<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.020> one's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
much they'll be fine and see this one's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.830 
much they'll be fine and see this one's
starting<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.740> into<00:01:16.890> flower<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.659> we<00:01:18.659> could

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
starting to go into flower and we could

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.270 
starting to go into flower and we could
pluck<00:01:19.049> these<00:01:19.259> flowers<00:01:19.619> off<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.590> that's<00:01:22.920> one

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
pluck these flowers off so that's one

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.639 
pluck these flowers off so that's one
type<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.549> Lantana<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.049> another<00:01:25.380> one

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
type of Lantana then I have another one

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:27.649 
type of Lantana then I have another one
which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.240> color<00:01:27.420> this

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
which is this is a different color this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.490 
which is this is a different color this
is<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> yellow<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:29.090> it's<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.270> flowering<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.229> oh

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
is a yellow and it's not flowering so oh

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.140 
is a yellow and it's not flowering so oh
it<00:01:31.860> does<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.219> button<00:01:32.630> take<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.810> out

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
it does have a button take that out

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.820 
it does have a button take that out
have<00:01:36.940> plectranthus<00:01:38.050> same<00:01:39.050> thing<00:01:39.230> like<00:01:39.350> coleus

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
have plectranthus same thing like coleus

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.280 
have plectranthus same thing like coleus
I'll<00:01:40.010> probably<00:01:40.220> take<00:01:40.430> some<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.790> these<00:01:40.850> off<00:01:41.290> you

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
I'll probably take some of these off you

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.590 
I'll probably take some of these off you
know<00:01:42.380> take<00:01:42.650> these<00:01:42.860> off

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.870 

and<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.290> surprised<00:01:47.710> you<00:01:47.890> like<00:01:48.100> so<00:01:48.610> we're<00:01:48.760> gonna

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
and it surprised you like so we're gonna

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.000 
and it surprised you like so we're gonna
stick<00:01:49.150> this<00:01:49.270> in<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.570> soil<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.500> could<00:01:50.800> root

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
stick this in the soil and it could root

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.710 
stick this in the soil and it could root
from<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.310> base<00:01:51.580> of<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.880> plant<00:01:52.180> or<00:01:52.420> it<00:01:52.540> could

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
from the base of the plant or it could

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.160 
from the base of the plant or it could
root<00:01:52.930> from<00:01:53.170> beliefs<00:01:53.650> so<00:01:54.570> having<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.600> certain

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
root from beliefs so having a certain

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.450 
root from beliefs so having a certain
number<00:01:56.260> of<00:01:56.410> nodes<00:01:56.500> under<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.130> ground<00:01:57.280> you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.460 
number of nodes under the ground you

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.850 
number of nodes under the ground you
really<00:01:57.850> had<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.479> know<00:01:58.540> exactly<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.290> plant<00:01:59.680> of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
really had to know exactly the plant of

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.700 
really had to know exactly the plant of
where<00:02:00.040> it's<00:02:00.190> gonna<00:02:00.310> root<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.790> I<00:02:01.590> really<00:02:02.590> don't

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
where it's gonna root and I really don't

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.499 
where it's gonna root and I really don't
think<00:02:02.830> it<00:02:03.070> matters<00:02:04.140> here's<00:02:05.140> some<00:02:05.350> bridalveil

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
think it matters here's some bridalveil

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.300 
think it matters here's some bridalveil
that<00:02:07.509> we<00:02:07.600> cut<00:02:07.810> before<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.860> one's<00:02:09.130> a<00:02:09.190> little

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
that we cut before this one's a little

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.600 
that we cut before this one's a little
too<00:02:09.610> long<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.869> it's<00:02:10.990> kind<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.260> wispy<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.010> when

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
too long and it's kind of wispy so when

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.040 
too long and it's kind of wispy so when
I<00:02:12.640> stick<00:02:12.940> these<00:02:13.060> I<00:02:13.240> might<00:02:13.360> stick<00:02:13.660> more<00:02:13.870> than

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
I stick these I might stick more than

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.230 
I stick these I might stick more than
one<00:02:14.200> together<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:15.520> get<00:02:15.640> them<00:02:15.790> in<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:15.940> root<00:02:16.090> but

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
one together to get them in the root but

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.410 
one together to get them in the root but
this<00:02:16.360> roots<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.840> easy<00:02:17.080> so<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:19.060> one's<00:02:19.300> in

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
this roots pretty easy so this one's in

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.190 
this roots pretty easy so this one's in
flower<00:02:19.690> so<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:21.070> know<00:02:21.190> this<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:23.020> this

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
flower so you know this I know this

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.290 
flower so you know this I know this
plant<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.770> know<00:02:23.830> it<00:02:24.010> roots<00:02:24.220> fairly<00:02:24.550> easy<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.090> if

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
plant I know it roots fairly easy but if

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.000 
plant I know it roots fairly easy but if
I<00:02:25.480> saw<00:02:25.660> all<00:02:25.870> these<00:02:25.989> flowers<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> plant<00:02:26.890> I

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
I saw all these flowers on a plant I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.290 
I saw all these flowers on a plant I
didn't<00:02:27.250> know<00:02:27.340> I'd<00:02:27.489> probably<00:02:27.640> avoid<00:02:28.090> this

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
didn't know I'd probably avoid this

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.210 
didn't know I'd probably avoid this
shoot<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:29.020> I'd<00:02:29.140> go<00:02:29.320> for<00:02:29.500> something<00:02:29.860> else<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
shoot and I'd go for something else so

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.790 
shoot and I'd go for something else so
this<00:02:30.370> I<00:02:30.550> might<00:02:30.700> just<00:02:30.910> throw<00:02:31.060> away<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.530> pick<00:02:32.680> up

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
this I might just throw away and pick up

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.660 
this I might just throw away and pick up
another<00:02:33.040> one

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
another one

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.830 
another one
