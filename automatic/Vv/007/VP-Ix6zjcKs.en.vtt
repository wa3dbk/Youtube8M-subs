00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 Kana also good 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.700
 It is quite early 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.480
 Even if you rub it 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.030
 Can not take 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:13.110
 Yes, I was really surprised to try this by hand 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 Take fruit 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.720
 Feeling setter 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.689
 I 'm changing 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.689

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160
 More 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 Pre 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.510
 Such military 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 Tsukana above and open your eyes before you dry 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.110
 Because I saw this 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.120
 When it rubs 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.490
 Can not take 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.780
 half 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.770
 So this is soap and so on 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.470
 It seems that it can be taken, but it is strong against water, tears and sweat 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.000
 Guy was taken in the design that is attached to the really hand is taken in the design 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.770
 Because 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.190
 About really come this after one day 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:27.980
 It is anxious about whether you hold a single ticket how much 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:27.980
 But even with a really ordinary eyeliner I can get it from here 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.770
 Take key 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.910
 In after here is the more common of eyeliner black 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:43.120
 It was brown to say that avocado of a color like the air 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.010
 Next house behind 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.450
 This is good 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.170
 Though it is what I one often referred to as a driver g 2 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.170
 I can not see it 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.270
 In love and 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.440
 With a really transparent tip 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.440
 By the way, I wonder if I went 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:13.690
 I try Now I think I can be seen here 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:17.610
 I suppose that I made a mistake here 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.610
 For example, if you make a mistake 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.650
 Not really 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.470
 Yes 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.780
 It came 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:34.470
 It seems to be black here, but this seems to be clean with a tissue off 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.470
 Let's try it for a moment 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.980
 It was food 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:53.560
 After really a cat you are writing it capped This moisture moisturizing ingredients to this 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:58.520
 It will not be dry at all 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:03.409
 Well you can make immediately after erasing This feeling has been moisturizing Hasa 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:07.639
 Just like the sand dune, the brush tip dirt is just wiped with a tissue ok 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:11.839
 That's why it 's best written to fix these eyelines , though 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:18.499
 I love Ailine I was waiting for this kind of thing 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:23.210
 I had a pencil type guy in the old days but it was too fat to start with something else 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:27.310
 Erasable c really on the other pin point even this is I was 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:30.960
 It is this house sucking power 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:32.969

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.189

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:37.189
 It 's fun to cut it like this 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.830
 So this time 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:49.740
 This Japan I found in the moonlight 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:50.820

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.080

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:56.500
 And this eyeliner 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:04.129
 I can not take it 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:11.449
 I thought it was because I was not a specialist in cosmetics because it was an industry. 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:15.129
 It has been unexpectedly surprised and quite surprised I'll try to put on a little in a row from now on
