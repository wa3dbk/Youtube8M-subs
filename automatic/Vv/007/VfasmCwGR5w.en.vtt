if<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.549> can<00:00:14.730> get<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> defender<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.570> step<00:00:15.990> out<00:00:16.080> on

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
if I can get a defender to step out on

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.210 
if I can get a defender to step out on
the<00:00:16.199> field<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.590> act<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:16.859> we're<00:00:17.010> going

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the field we can act like we're going

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099 
the field we can act like we're going
this<00:00:17.340> way<00:00:17.400> okay<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.449> get<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> defender<00:00:19.080> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
this way okay so I get a defender to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.210 
this way okay so I get a defender to
step<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.560> field<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.100> you<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
step on the field and what I want you to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.620 
step on the field and what I want you to
do<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.400> try<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.760> represent<00:00:21.029> stand<00:00:21.480> on<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
do is try to represent stand on the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.540 
do is try to represent stand on the
field<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:21.900> would<00:00:22.050> represent<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.890> low<00:00:23.100> line<00:00:23.400> of

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
field that would represent a low line of

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
field that would represent a low line of
defense<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.269> then<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:24.750> we<00:00:24.900> need<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
defense and then what we need is a

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
defense and then what we need is a
forward<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:25.980> on<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> field<00:00:26.369> we're

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
forward to go out on the field we're

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.970 
forward to go out on the field we're
attacking<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.630> way<00:00:27.779> again<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.500> if<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.830> could

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
attacking that way again so if you could

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.130 
attacking that way again so if you could
go<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.400> represent<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.390> high<00:00:30.689> line<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
go out and represent a high line of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.760 
go out and represent a high line of
confrontation<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.980> where<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> would<00:00:32.610> be<00:00:32.730> so

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
confrontation and where that would be so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.490 
confrontation and where that would be so
all<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:34.940> so<00:00:35.940> if<00:00:36.059> Abby's<00:00:36.390> up<00:00:36.510> top<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.989> she<00:00:37.320> is

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
all right so if Abby's up top and she is

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.260 
all right so if Abby's up top and she is
representing<00:00:38.250> as<00:00:38.520> soon<00:00:38.760> as<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.000> lose<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
representing as soon as we lose that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.639 
representing as soon as we lose that
we're<00:00:39.480> gonna<00:00:39.600> confront<00:00:39.870> we're<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.350> try<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
we're gonna confront we're gonna try to

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.260 
we're gonna confront we're gonna try to
win<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> ball<00:00:41.010> back<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.520> soon<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
this would be a really really safe group

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
this would be a really really safe group
of<00:00:44.640> defense<00:00:44.910> obviously<00:00:45.120> nobody<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.020> hangs

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
of defense obviously nobody really hangs

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.869 
of defense obviously nobody really hangs
out<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.770> far<00:00:47.010> back<00:00:47.190> anymore<00:00:47.489> but<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.640> for

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
but when we're defending it's really

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.289 
but when we're defending it's really
really<00:01:22.409> hard<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.799> if<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.610> try<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> find<00:01:24.119> ways

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
really hard so if we try to find ways

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.999 
really hard so if we try to find ways
first<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.689> all<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:25.200> said<00:01:25.409> already<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.799> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
first of all we said already that we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.140 
first of all we said already that we
would<00:01:26.159> bring<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> line<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.880> we're<00:01:27.030> gonna

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
would bring this line up we're gonna

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
would bring this line up we're gonna
bring<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.450> especially<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:28.200> we're<00:01:28.650> confronting

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
bring it especially if we're confronting

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.530 
bring it especially if we're confronting
someone<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.579> high<00:01:29.729> up<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> field<00:01:30.240> our<00:01:30.360> line

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
someone that high up the field our line

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.910 
someone that high up the field our line
of<00:01:30.689> defense<00:01:30.990> would<00:01:31.110> be<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.799> can

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
of defense would be up here and we can

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.980 
of defense would be up here and we can
scoot<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.430> little<00:01:32.579> bit<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.299> so<00:01:33.810> we're

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
scoot you up a little bit but so we're

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.030 
scoot you up a little bit but so we're
already<00:01:34.170> starting<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.500> make<00:01:34.619> things<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.920> little

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
already starting to make things a little

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.530 
already starting to make things a little
bit<00:01:35.189> more<00:01:35.250> compact<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.180> bit<00:01:36.270> tighter

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
bit more compact a little bit tighter

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.980 
bit more compact a little bit tighter
and<00:01:37.320> if<00:01:37.710> we<00:01:37.829> decided<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.420> we<00:01:39.420> were<00:01:39.540> gonna<00:01:39.689> be

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and if we decided that we were gonna be

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.390 
and if we decided that we were gonna be
a<00:01:40.020> little<00:01:40.200> bit<00:01:40.380> safer<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:40.920> confront

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a little bit safer and not confront

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.920 
a little bit safer and not confront
teams<00:01:41.610> until<00:01:41.790> they<00:01:41.970> came<00:01:42.090> closer<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.509> our<00:01:42.720> half

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
teams until they came closer to our half

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.300 
teams until they came closer to our half
then<00:01:43.439> we<00:01:43.470> would<00:01:43.710> bring<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.979> line<00:01:44.189> of

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
then we would bring that line of

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
then we would bring that line of
confrontation<00:01:44.909> back<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.210> we<00:01:45.270> would<00:01:45.360> let<00:01:45.509> them

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
confrontation back and we would let them

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
confrontation back and we would let them
switch<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> ball<00:01:46.259> across<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.740> back<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
switch the ball across the back of the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
switch the ball across the back of the
field<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.759> switch<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.659> if<00:01:48.750> they'd<00:01:48.899> like

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
field and and switch it if they'd like

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.120 
field and and switch it if they'd like
but<00:01:49.290> we're<00:01:49.409> gonna<00:01:49.500> keep<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.040> bit

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
but we're gonna keep a little bit

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.800 
but we're gonna keep a little bit
tighter<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:50.850> now<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.060> we've<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.540> line

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
tighter so now that we've got our line

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.999 
tighter so now that we've got our line
of<00:01:51.960> defense<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.290> little<00:01:52.439> higher<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.770> field

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
of defense a little higher up the field

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.319 
of defense a little higher up the field
in<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.130> line<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.369> confrontation<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.119> little

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
in our line of confrontation a little

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.819 
in our line of confrontation a little
further<00:01:54.509> back<00:01:54.810> let's<00:01:55.049> get<00:01:55.170> we'll<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.740> go

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
further back let's get we'll just go

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
further back let's get we'll just go
ahead<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.130> for<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> purpose<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
ahead and do for the purpose of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
ahead and do for the purpose of
demonstration<00:01:57.659> of<00:01:57.869> four<00:01:58.049> four<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.130> we

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
demonstration of four four two so if we

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.800 
demonstration of four four two so if we
can<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.399> three<00:01:59.640> more<00:01:59.790> defenders<00:02:00.329> three<00:02:00.630> more

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
can get three more defenders three more

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.030 
can get three more defenders three more
midfielders<00:02:01.229> one<00:02:01.380> more<00:02:01.530> forward<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:01.950> our

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
midfielders one more forward and get our

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
midfielders one more forward and get our
goalkeeper<00:02:02.250> out<00:02:02.640> there<00:02:02.880> start<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.570> work<00:02:03.780> a

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
goalkeeper out there start to work a

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.630 
goalkeeper out there start to work a
little<00:02:04.020> bit<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.290> our<00:02:04.409> shape<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.640> you've<00:02:06.479> got

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
little bit on our shape so you've got

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
little bit on our shape so you've got
let<00:02:08.640> me<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.879> hop<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.379> obviously

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
let me go hop in there so now obviously

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.470 
let me go hop in there so now obviously
and<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.550> little<00:02:12.030> bit<00:02:12.150> deceiving

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and this is a little bit deceiving

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.940 
and this is a little bit deceiving
because<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.989> such<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> small<00:02:13.410> field

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
because it's such a small field

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.890 
because it's such a small field
but<00:02:14.220> keeping<00:02:14.910> ourselves<00:02:15.390> closer<00:02:15.599> together

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
but keeping ourselves closer together

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.710 
but keeping ourselves closer together
within<00:02:16.680> 25<00:02:17.400> 30<00:02:17.760> yards<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:18.150> each<00:02:18.239> other<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.629> be

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
within 25 30 yards of each other can be

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.270 
within 25 30 yards of each other can be
really<00:02:19.019> really<00:02:19.290> tight<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.650> really<00:02:19.709> compact

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
really really tight and really compact

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.619 
really really tight and really compact
and<00:02:20.430> make<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.670> difficult<00:02:20.849> for<00:02:21.120> teens<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.510> we

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
and make it difficult for teens but we

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.119 
and make it difficult for teens but we
have<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.840> start<00:02:22.050> kind<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.680> being<00:02:22.890> aware<00:02:23.069> of

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
have to start kind of being aware of

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.320 
have to start kind of being aware of
some<00:02:23.340> things<00:02:23.519> so<00:02:23.610> what<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.760> want<00:02:23.879> to<00:02:23.970> do<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.150> take

ball<00:02:38.069> right<00:02:38.220> now<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:38.580> shifted<00:02:38.970> across<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
ball right now and we shifted across the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.670 
ball right now and we shifted across the
other<00:02:39.599> concept<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.110> we're<00:02:40.290> really<00:02:40.440> trying

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
other concept that we're really trying

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.080 
other concept that we're really trying
to<00:02:40.769> develop<00:02:41.160> and<00:02:41.280> Alyssa's<00:02:41.610> trying<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.910> sneak

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
to develop and Alyssa's trying to sneak

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.720 
to develop and Alyssa's trying to sneak
over<00:02:42.209> there<00:02:42.360> already<00:02:42.690> is<00:02:43.200> that<00:02:43.549> vertical<00:02:44.549> line

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
over there already is that vertical line

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.130 
over there already is that vertical line
that<00:02:45.060> goes<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.299> down<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.629> center<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.049> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
that goes right down the center of the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.720 
that goes right down the center of the
field<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> we<00:02:46.980> said<00:02:47.190> if<00:02:47.310> we're<00:02:47.430> always<00:02:47.519> going

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
field and we said if we're always going

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.430 
field and we said if we're always going
to<00:02:47.819> be<00:02:47.940> 10<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.299> 12<00:02:48.330> yards<00:02:48.810> apart<00:02:49.140> from<00:02:49.290> each

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
to be 10 to 12 yards apart from each

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.380 
to be 10 to 12 yards apart from each
other<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:49.950> they're<00:02:50.370> on<00:02:50.459> that<00:02:50.640> side<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.330> we

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
other if they're on that side and we

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.030 
other if they're on that side and we
work<00:02:51.599> our<00:02:51.780> way<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.170> that<00:02:52.380> puts<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.709> list<00:02:52.920> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
work our way in that puts a list of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.009 
work our way in that puts a list of
about<00:02:53.160> 36<00:02:53.730> yards<00:02:54.000> away<00:02:54.120> at<00:02:54.299> most<00:02:54.569> which<00:02:54.780> puts

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
about 36 yards away at most which puts

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.330 
about 36 yards away at most which puts
her<00:02:55.079> right<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.380> center<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.739> field<00:02:55.950> so

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
her right in the center of the field so

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.589 
her right in the center of the field so
we're<00:02:56.430> gonna<00:02:56.519> take<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.760> vertical<00:02:57.360> Center

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
we're gonna take that vertical Center

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.670 
we're gonna take that vertical Center
down<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.780> field<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.110> start<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.470> shift

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
down the field and start the shift

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.110 
down the field and start the shift
people<00:02:58.980> across<00:02:59.160> there<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.640> we're<00:03:00.000> gonna

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
people across there and we're gonna

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.720 
people across there and we're gonna
really<00:03:00.450> work<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> lock<00:03:01.140> them<00:03:01.349> in<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.980> now<00:03:02.670> you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
really work to lock them in and now you

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.100 
really work to lock them in and now you
can<00:03:02.970> start<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.299> see<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.690> becoming<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
can start to see this is becoming a

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.449 
can start to see this is becoming a
little<00:03:04.230> more<00:03:04.380> difficult<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.099> another<00:03:05.280> team

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
little more difficult for another team

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.770 
little more difficult for another team
especially<00:03:05.640> because<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.060> other<00:03:06.450> team<00:03:06.599> only

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
especially because the other team only

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.170 
especially because the other team only
has<00:03:06.870> one<00:03:06.989> person<00:03:07.349> of<00:03:07.440> thumb<00:03:07.640> but<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.000> lot

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
has one person of thumb but it's a lot

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.240 
has one person of thumb but it's a lot
easier<00:03:09.360> now<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.840> kind<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.349> lock<00:03:10.500> things<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.890> so

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
easier now to kind of lock things in so

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.979 
easier now to kind of lock things in so
what<00:03:11.400> I<00:03:11.459> want<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> start<00:03:11.880> to<00:03:12.000> do<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.810> may

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
what I want to start to do is we may

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.380 
what I want to start to do is we may
defend<00:03:13.680> depending<00:03:14.190> on<00:03:14.280> how<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.489> goes<00:03:14.579> it

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
defend depending on how this goes it

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.479 
defend depending on how this goes it
might<00:03:15.720> be<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.440> Emily's<00:03:17.160> putting<00:03:17.400> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
might be that Emily's putting the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.949 
might be that Emily's putting the
pressure<00:03:17.670> on<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.940> ball<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:18.329> quickly<00:03:18.780> and

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
pressure on the ball really quickly and

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.509 
pressure on the ball really quickly and
if<00:03:19.319> she<00:03:19.470> has<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> abandon<00:03:19.980> that<00:03:20.220> point<00:03:20.459> of

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
if she has to abandon that point of

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:21.740 
if she has to abandon that point of
attack<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.970> turn<00:03:21.090> back<00:03:21.269> we<00:03:21.420> want<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:21.630> make

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
attack and turn back we want to make

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.240 
attack and turn back we want to make
sure<00:03:21.780> they<00:03:22.019> don't<00:03:22.109> switch<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.470> so<00:03:23.069> you're

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
sure they don't switch it so you're

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.910 
sure they don't switch it so you're
coming<00:03:23.489> in<00:03:23.579> here<00:03:23.609> first
