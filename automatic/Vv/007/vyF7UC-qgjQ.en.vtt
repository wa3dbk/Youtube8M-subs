PowerPoint presentation wirelessly using
a<00:00:44.280> Wi-Fi<00:00:44.700> network<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.410> way<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> works

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:47.629 
a Wi-Fi network now the way it works

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:50.029 
a Wi-Fi network now the way it works
varies<00:00:48.629> weather<00:00:48.960> depending<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.770> whether<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
varies weather depending on whether you

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.770 
varies weather depending on whether you
run<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.550> iPad<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:51.180> I'm<00:00:51.360> doing<00:00:51.629> right

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
run it on an iPad like I'm doing right

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
run it on an iPad like I'm doing right
here<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.710> run<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.980> on<00:00:53.100> an<00:00:53.219> iPhone<00:00:53.640> but

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
here or you run it on an iPhone but

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.119 
here or you run it on an iPhone but
essentially<00:00:54.449> we've<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.110> seen<00:00:55.350> presentations

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
essentially we've all seen presentations

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
essentially we've all seen presentations
where<00:00:56.340> people<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> clicker<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.570> can

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
where people have a clicker so they can

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
where people have a clicker so they can
stand<00:00:57.930> away<00:00:58.230> from<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> computer<00:00:59.100> and

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
stand away from the computer and

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.340 
stand away from the computer and
interact<00:01:00.300> better<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> audience<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
interact better with the audience and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.779 
interact better with the audience and
maybe<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> laser<00:01:02.129> pointer<00:01:02.460> or

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maybe they have a laser pointer or

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:03.229 
maybe they have a laser pointer or
something

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
something

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.750 
something
well<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.899> tries<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> same<00:01:05.280> thing<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
well this tries to do the same thing and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.490 
well this tries to do the same thing and
then<00:01:05.909> more<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.540> let<00:01:06.720> me<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:06.990> show<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.380> that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
then more and let me just show you that

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
then more and let me just show you that
right<00:01:07.740> now<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.040> I've<00:01:08.189> done<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.610> creates<00:01:09.000> a

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
right now what I've done it creates a

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.840 
right now what I've done it creates a
unique<00:01:09.659> connection<00:01:10.049> via<00:01:10.590> Wi-Fi<00:01:10.860> with<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
unique connection via Wi-Fi with a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.100 
unique connection via Wi-Fi with a
computer<00:01:12.360> running<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.630> PowerPoint

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
computer running a PowerPoint

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.840 
computer running a PowerPoint
presentation<00:01:13.170> there's<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> security<00:01:14.369> code<00:01:14.549> so

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
presentation there's a security code so

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
presentation there's a security code so
somebody<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.390> audience<00:01:15.540> can't<00:01:16.110> kind<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
somebody in the audience can't kind it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.380 
somebody in the audience can't kind it
can't<00:01:17.340> monkey<00:01:17.729> around<00:01:18.119> with<00:01:18.240> your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
can't monkey around with your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.929 
can't monkey around with your
presentation<00:01:18.840> but<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> interface

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
presentation but on the on the interface

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.120 
presentation but on the on the interface
there<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> control<00:01:22.080> panel<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.680> this<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there is a control panel like this and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.710 
there is a control panel like this and
you<00:01:23.189> see<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.880> example<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.570> it's

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you see for example and because it's

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
you see for example and because it's
Wi-Fi<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> like<00:01:25.860> with<00:01:26.009> infrared

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
Wi-Fi it's not like with infrared

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.039 
Wi-Fi it's not like with infrared
controls<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> be<00:01:27.390> close<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.900> can

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
controls that I have to be close I can

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.359 
controls that I have to be close I can
actually<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.409> quite<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.710> distance<00:01:29.040> away<00:01:29.220> from

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
actually be quite a distance away from

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.319 
actually be quite a distance away from
the<00:01:29.640> computer

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the computer

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.569 
the computer
but<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.840> has<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> complete<00:01:31.409> control<00:01:31.829> panel<00:01:32.250> here

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
but it has a complete control panel here

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700 
but it has a complete control panel here
to<00:01:33.090> control<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> slide<00:01:33.869> presentation<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to control the slide presentation so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
to control the slide presentation so
remotely<00:01:35.070> I'll<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.549> start<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> slide

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
remotely I'll just start the slide

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.870
