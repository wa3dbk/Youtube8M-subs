 this is not enamel far from each other 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.580
 because what's so good is another game 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.500

 well-known that they are role-playing games 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.719
 let's say multiplayer those who climb 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.210
 level and good to get a system of 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
 range abilities and everything like 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.940
 You will have seen when I am 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.370
 facing these people 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.590
 my character is an archer here -between 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.360
 there are quite a few classes like this kind of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 the kittens let's say in which there 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.120
 this one that is like a leopard the snow the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.100
 let's say there's a panda and a red panda there 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.460
 a dog a cat come on there's a lot of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.550
 things 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.190
 there is another class that are girls in clothes 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.440
 inside there is another class that are a 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.960
 sort of arcs of the folk of the night 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.060
 sorry and good many kinds there are many 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.400
 races and many classes like this that are 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.630
 archers there the typical swordsman let's go 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.759
 the typical ones sure you all have 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.390
 ever played a half rpg or a 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.399
 a normal rpg so everyone will know 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.470
 how do you see I'm at level 24 lunar not 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.060
 I already have all my skills good 6 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.640
 skills that are what can be 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.610
 carry and I have more and here the level 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.050
 maximum 60 so I'm about 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.460
 half way but obviously every time 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.920
 it gets complicated so it's getting more and more 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.310
 difficult I already have my horse that you are going to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.350
 see now and if pulse c3 is activated and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.410
 I'm here killing a little bit this game 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.479
 the truth is that I tried it a little bit and 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.479
 I have it parked because I went back to play 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.170
 small but I love I love it more than 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.240
 nothing for this because of your graphics I look at you 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.100
 guys that he has stung if you compare me 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.710
 this with any capture of the world of 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.470
 warcraft has no color none this 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.000
 game has tremendous graphics and 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.710
 that on the contrary day 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.480
 look at the view because it is 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.240
 impressive what it has to offer 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.580
 this game in sight but good for 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.560
 another side obviously the wall of warcraft 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.290
 has more what you have more 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.030
 skills has more let 's say is a 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 more complete game since it takes more 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.350
 time this game 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.910
 this good word is free to play that does not 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.010
 He had said that it is nothing but 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.720
 well much better that is, is that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.060
 what else the sport go to this game 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.860
 graphic 2 hanging over free to break 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.220
 What else can you ask for? 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.320
 free to play and has left free to play 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.590
 a couple of months ago, so it's very 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.300
 new and missing things that has world 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.239
 of warcraft but good has other things 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.370
 much better in my opinion what do 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.010
 make it a great game worth playing and 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.560
 play and play and reach level 60 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.300
 as a flawed and play it every day 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.800
 of my mother's life because it's a raisin 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.400
 Be careful how they make me a slaughter 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.400
 good here 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.310
 v 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.560
 as you see in the environments are 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.020
 incredible the design of the characters 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.810
 it's amazing my weapon has also 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.340
 recently purchased is very incredible everything 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.140
 in this game it 's amazing everything is at 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.910
 great is a game created by a 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.560
 Korean company 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.600
 what good core is now very fashionable 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.370
 for the North Korea for the war if 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.190
 that and South Korea because they have apps 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.890
 ie site that is very fashionable 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.350
 you do, so this is a Korean game that 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.940
 is going to make more fashionable and now I'm going to 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.310
 teach one thing that sure you like 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.680
 You will be seeing it here in the background but 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.280
 look guys what is that the little one 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.480
 giant that is expected to arrive 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:48.070
 because from here it is not well appreciated your 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.650
 size but good here is look at me 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.450
 put forward 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.459

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.150
 also of variety of enemies guys 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.460
 there are a lot a lot of enemies 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.620
 different this is one of the areas that 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.510
 is unlocked at level 20 or some 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.390
 unlock we go more to level 20 or so 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.520
 but there are a lot of areas a lot of 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.380
 characters is a pass to me the truth 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.640
 is that I have loved the field too 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.310
 it's true that I do not have much experience 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.050
 in the rpg single player world of 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.100
 warcraft and little bit but this game has 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.350
