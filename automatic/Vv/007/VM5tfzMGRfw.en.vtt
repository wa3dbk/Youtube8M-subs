certain amount of nudges that you could

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.520 
certain amount of nudges that you could
just<00:02:36.590> why

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
just why

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.230 
just why

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
gravity of which way it goes and you

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.580 
gravity of which way it goes and you
could<00:02:51.270> push<00:02:51.510> buttons<00:02:51.930> like<00:02:52.700> trampolines<00:02:53.700> or

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
you could tilt for him to go faster slow

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.860 
you could tilt for him to go faster slow
down

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
down

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.860 
down
basically<00:03:22.650> like<00:03:22.950> gravity<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:24.150> right<00:03:24.630> there

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
basically like gravity then right there

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.470 
basically like gravity then right there
five<00:03:25.380> that's<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.310> that's<00:03:27.060> how<00:03:27.150> much<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.360> know

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
place it gives you like five seconds to

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.850 
place it gives you like five seconds to
move<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:50.120> yeah<00:03:51.120> that's<00:03:51.329> basically<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.709> game

move and yeah that's basically the game

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.280 
move and yeah that's basically the game
played<00:03:53.160> there's<00:03:53.660> different<00:03:54.660> types<00:03:54.959> like<00:03:55.170> I

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
played there's different types like I

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.430 
played there's different types like I
said<00:03:55.530> you<00:03:55.650> could<00:03:55.799> push<00:03:56.070> him<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.970> nagas

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
said you could push him the nagas

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.470 
said you could push him the nagas
gravity<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.040> pushing<00:03:59.519> the<00:04:00.060> pushing

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
gravity and then the pushing the pushing

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.509 
gravity and then the pushing the pushing
of<00:04:00.570> buttons<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.670> lot<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:03.019> pushing<00:04:04.019> comes<00:04:04.950> out<00:04:05.250> to

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
of buttons a lot of pushing comes out to

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.520 
of buttons a lot of pushing comes out to
pinball<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.540> get<00:04:06.720> to<00:04:06.930> push<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> little

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
pinball you get to push the little

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.849 
pinball you get to push the little
buttons<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.310> he<00:04:09.120> launches<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.930> he<00:04:10.380> gets<00:04:10.590> hurt

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
buttons and he launches and he gets hurt

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.150 
buttons and he launches and he gets hurt
basically<00:04:11.720> all<00:04:12.720> right<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.470> see<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.829> those

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
basically all right you see that those

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.909 
basically all right you see that those
little<00:04:14.340> arrow<00:04:14.760> things<00:04:15.260> press<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:16.410> button<00:04:16.709> and

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
little arrow things press the button and

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:22.130 
little arrow things press the button and
it<00:04:17.250> launches<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.450> just<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.930> hurt

it launches and you just have to hurt

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.680 
it launches and you just have to hurt
him<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.410> much<00:04:22.590> as<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:26.760> I<00:04:27.000> guess<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.479> suck

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
him as much as you can up I guess I suck

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.930 
him as much as you can up I guess I suck
all<00:04:28.320> right<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:28.710> yeah<00:04:29.130> you<00:04:29.190> could<00:04:29.430> push<00:04:29.580> buttons

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
all right so yeah you could push buttons

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.880 
all right so yeah you could push buttons
nudge<00:04:30.450> use<00:04:31.110> gravity<00:04:31.590> tilt<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.250> iPhone<00:04:32.640> and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
nudge use gravity tilt the iPhone and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.140 
nudge use gravity tilt the iPhone and
that's<00:04:34.890> pretty<00:04:35.160> much<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.640> could<00:04:36.030> also

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
that's pretty much it you could also

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.300 
that's pretty much it you could also
view<00:04:36.450> replay<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:39.260> you<00:04:40.260> could<00:04:40.440> see<00:04:40.650> replay<00:04:41.130> but

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
view replay and you could see replay but
