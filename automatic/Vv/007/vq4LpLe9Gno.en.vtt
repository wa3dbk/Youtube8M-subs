00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 hello to all and all its worst 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.889
 waves of your favorite red hen 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.040
 is today so we find ourselves for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.310
 a video with tiebreak those who 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.510
 would have this hello little video a 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180
 video tents have to say a small 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.460
 trick that we discovered on the internet at 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.019
 about mobs a little history so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.640
 history ex in fact it's the egg of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.810
 Easter 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 usually it's used in 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.410
 computer to define a hidden object 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.050
 a finally something fun 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 normally so for that you will not 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 an anvil 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.700
 you will take a mtag you go 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 take the nem tags and you go 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.210
 call the nem good airs tag 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.070
 so it's mandatory if you want 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.140
 do the trick that we do everything 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.270
 just because it's coded for that 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.090
 we imagine have for example that I call 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.180
 ouzou blida narbonne beats the zombie 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.300
 does turns around totally and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.980
 completely bugged the call it's the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.810
 things would be well the only thing to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.100
 backwards so that's actually you can 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.960
 do that any bat to keep 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 of the hen 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.619
 the horse also it works also the 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.830
 creeper which is very entertaining if at 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.299
 backwards so these are the animals actually 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.460
 turn around completely it's really 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.200
 very funny 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.590
 can have fun doing anything 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.799
 what 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.100
 kind of magma cubes for example slim here 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.170
 the evil michael that upside down even guy 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.710
 belanger did not change by law he goes on 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.509
 see that he has upside down like that with 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 it does not work with squid 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:49.430
 octopuses yeah that's a pity 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:54.000
 for the france cow before the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.340
 veiling and going towards sees her 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.920
 chances that's it's still fun it's not 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.500
 it's useless but it can be funny 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.119
 to control your friends so amused 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.440
 Libyan and then so soon 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.360
 maybe for other simple tips 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.950
 of this style if it shows who is 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.910
 completely buggy flying over 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:16.050
 ground yeah that's class so he wanted 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.260
 put a mob back to the place 1 you have 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.010
 to put the onem tag back in you 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.570
 delete the contents if he wants them 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:30.900
 give 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:36.450
 javier does not want him he does not want nothing 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:39.020
 put me commented max stone here is you 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.020
 just before I walk 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.020
 here 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:56.540
 its market share have it works with the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:02.410
 they win I did not see him upside down 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.410
 month the horse covering the west 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.800
 okay so we leave you to be 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.800
 other projects 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.080
 it is to him that is here more 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.080
 long
