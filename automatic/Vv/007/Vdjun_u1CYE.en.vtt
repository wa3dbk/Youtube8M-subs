of thing and to talk about usually as I

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.039 
of thing and to talk about usually as I
said<00:01:32.909> usually<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.210> make<00:01:33.329> notes<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.750> usually

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
said usually I make notes are usually

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810

brainstorm<00:01:34.890> for<00:01:34.950> topics<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.549> stuff<00:01:35.729> like

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
brainstorm for topics and stuff like

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.399 
brainstorm for topics and stuff like
that<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.509> write<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:36.900> notes<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
that then write little notes on the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.050 
that then write little notes on the
topics<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.040> script<00:01:38.460> my<00:01:38.610> videos<00:01:38.939> because

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
topics I don't script my videos because

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.090 
topics I don't script my videos because
I<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.229> scrape<00:01:40.530> them<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:40.920> not

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
I think if you scrape them then it's not

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.760 
I think if you scrape them then it's not
really<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.840> it<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.170> talking<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
really but it is you talking but it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.920 
really but it is you talking but it's
not<00:01:43.920> really<00:01:44.299> stopping<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.420> from<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.659> heart

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
not really stopping you from the heart

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
not really stopping you from the heart
so<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.799> write<00:01:47.009> down<00:01:47.040> notes<00:01:47.340> second<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
so when I just write down notes second I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.510 
so when I just write down notes second I
blight<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.840> have<00:01:49.350> little<00:01:49.590> tangents<00:01:50.250> all<00:01:50.369> the

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
going to bother getting cod4 because

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.630 
going to bother getting cod4 because
there's<00:04:53.710> less<00:04:53.830> and<00:04:53.980> less<00:04:54.040> people<00:04:54.130> playing

there's less and less people playing
cod4<00:04:54.850> now<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.419> I<00:04:56.140> think<00:04:56.380> it's<00:04:56.860> not<00:04:57.100> gonna

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
cod4 now and I think it's not gonna

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.890 
cod4 now and I think it's not gonna
because<00:04:57.370> I<00:04:57.490> think<00:04:58.180> there's<00:04:58.300> only<00:04:58.390> like<00:04:58.510> five

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
because I think there's only like five

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.600 
because I think there's only like five
hundred<00:04:58.930> or<00:04:59.530> something<00:04:59.800> people<00:05:00.010> online<00:05:00.310> at

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
hundred or something people online at

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
any time on cod4 now so it's not really

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.040 
any time on cod4 now so it's not really
worth<00:05:03.070> my<00:05:03.280> time<00:05:03.570> but<00:05:04.570> they're<00:05:04.720> getting<00:05:04.960> cod4
