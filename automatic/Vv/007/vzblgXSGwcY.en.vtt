00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello hello here is made more bio 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.259
 cook we make a raw food recipe and 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.179
 Although a cholera like pasta with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.759
 tomato sauce with little paperwork 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.759
 inside and a paradise parmesan 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.619
 what do you need for garage of course 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:31.289
 paprika tomato basil natural 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.940
 bit of herbal salt is and cottbus as 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 There is also in the channel as you yourself 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.400
 makes left running down there now works 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.030
 click on pepper of course garlic 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.320
 certainly the paralysis slowly train ne 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.390
 lemon olive oil 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.170
 I have said about we need 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 in addition, the fact we start 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.320
 easy 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.899
 I still thought with the kohlrabi kokott 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120
 Recipes are usually always 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.489
 vegan yes it does not always exist of course 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 anyway capital a5 and alike 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 Of course most of them are now 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.990
 has its megane pure vegetable only 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.990
 vegetables first appeared kurabi 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.060
 then there are two options either 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.450
 You can cut very thinly 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 he in dublin 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:40.650
 much easier now 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.400
 more efficient faster than natural 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:51.050
 Noble one plumber years one has 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:56.100
 The kohlrabi ends up with the same result 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.590
 At the back what are the louis one would never do 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:06.660
 first say maybe a bit short 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 has kurabi so come on something 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:21.650
 sea salt slightly better swallow 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.650
 cold pressed natural and lemon 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.260
 the rent then cover foil and 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.880
 for two hours in the fridge then 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:45.640
 kiefers at that time it means for the 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.320
 Most will then already prepared 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.760
 tomorrow 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:54.580
 yes it is the more that is already supposed to 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:04.510
 cora the pasta then it goes on with 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:07.380
 our so paprika just a bit 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.380
 Small could use that instead of mixa 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:21.010
 or a plug or maxime what you are 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:25.350
 we only have to ask the question 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.350
 cut off the rear wheel 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.120
 private 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.120
 a set out 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.950
 on the 8th 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:16.700
 spices this is my hangover of provence 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:24.260
 as I said best always black 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:24.260
 something basil comes to it 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.160
 girlfriend swallow nicely 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.719
 to screw and off in the leaves 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.729
 the flag that makes us for you 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.860
 leave it as possible no pieces 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.900
 look forward to who likes it because I like it 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.430
 yes, completely through as you can see 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.940
 What he does not have to do so anyway 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:10.660
 private really has enough liquid 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:10.660
 so that a nice jacket 

00:05:13.689 --> 00:05:20.590
 ok, I think that suits ours 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.580
 have to get along for a few months 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.550
 simple paranuts a bit small 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.789
 Cut here for others with 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.789
 despite 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:34.340
 Of course that goes over, for example 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:47.949
 a kitchen machine about still roughly 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:51.430
 grate or something out of here 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.430
 ok then judge 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:02.060
 pasta plate 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.169
 There is also such a nice spiral 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:17.220
 Schneider I have the small version 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.870
 which I also show times since 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.229
 However, you can not just as good 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:26.460
 make clean but the carrots for the 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:28.849
 root vegetables can not happen that way 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.849
 trim 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:37.050
 today we do it that way you can do it 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:38.580
 even without appliances can pasta 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.740
 sauce for the image now times a 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.409
 they just do not like small clubs 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:50.300
 pretty 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:50.300
 parmesan with it 

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:59.769
 basil rather just made super 

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.149
 clear the marinated time of 2 hours 

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.609
 that should be that you do 

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:05.049
 just fits better 

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:09.789
 but you can do that well you can 

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:12.149
 yes also just bobby fireworks the ford 

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:15.869
 is optimal start for raw food everyday 

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:18.369
 for example clearly now it gets slowly 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:20.439
 does not give it anymore but that seems so 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:22.419
 other smoothies for skating or cool 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.339
