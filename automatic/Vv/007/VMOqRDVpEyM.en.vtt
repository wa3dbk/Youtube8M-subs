and then he stops he stops over here by

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
the steps and that's a where a lot of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.730 
the steps and that's a where a lot of
people<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> hide<00:01:12.380> when<00:01:13.380> they're<00:01:13.590> up

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
people like to hide when they're up

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.890 
people like to hide when they're up
there<00:01:13.979> basically<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.540> run<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
there basically so when you run up the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.440 
there basically so when you run up the
stairs<00:01:16.170> they<00:01:16.560> can<00:01:16.710> shoot<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.220> back

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
stairs they can shoot you in the back

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.670 
stairs they can shoot you in the back
but<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.659> really<00:01:18.900> don't<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> problem<00:01:19.380> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
but I really don't see the problem in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.289 
but I really don't see the problem in
that<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> stairs<00:01:21.150> I

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
that because I if I go up the stairs I

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.969 
that because I if I go up the stairs I
usually<00:01:21.600> run<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.960> stairs<00:01:22.140> backwards<00:01:22.500> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
usually run up the stairs backwards I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.830 
usually run up the stairs backwards I
throw<00:01:23.610> some<00:01:23.790> stuns<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.479> both<00:01:24.659> directions

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
throw some stuns in both directions

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.660 
throw some stuns in both directions
bounce<00:01:25.439> them<00:01:25.680> off<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> wall<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.369> then<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.520> run

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
bounce them off the wall and then I run

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.870 
bounce them off the wall and then I run
up<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> stairs<00:01:27.030> backwards<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> pre-fire

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
up the stairs backwards and I pre-fire

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
up the stairs backwards and I pre-fire
and<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.000> usually<00:01:30.299> allows<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> get<00:01:31.530> up

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and that usually allows you to get up

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.880 
and that usually allows you to get up
there<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.040> take<00:01:32.310> care<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.579> business<00:01:32.759> but<00:01:33.890> it
