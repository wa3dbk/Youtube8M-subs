00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.700
 he certainly knows that when I'm in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.890
 have something cheaper mobile phone and always 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.490
 easy because it is for example samsung 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.320
 galaxy y samsung galaxy ace and also at 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.599
 sony not cold in the higher 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 Price class at the xperia mini or 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.250
 micro because the xperia live-walk that sony 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.750
 live-walk main as by joussen 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.460
 it seems to me to be so 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.900
 can it ever happen that the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.920
 memory is very limited 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.500
 So 4 120 mb free is very sad when 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.750
 sony xperia really do that very much 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 stupid because it is a game handy 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.420
 then on jonathan pictures so much games 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.010
 fred is a relative shame for that 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 it's a very simple trick 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.879
 marcel grote be like you do that 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.129
 instructions in the video of me and then 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.730
 I show the app so completely normal 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.500
 in place you then he gives it completely normal 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.980
 so usd will take 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.259
 it is this app then installs 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.469
 shut up opens that takes a while 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:09.469
 little 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 that are there so are always all apps 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:30.320
 Listed and now says the app is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 not much but gesture was linking 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:40.770
 then he asks for utrecht allowed him 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:43.700
 the root right supports this because that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:47.130
 about android 4.0 I should say 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.010
 must be minister so you have to maximally 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.260
 in German point zero if you have 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.570
 Unfortunately, that does not work because 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.370
 the greta is relatively good from memory 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140
 are 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.420
 that would have to be synonymous with Android 4.1 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.979
 But not all of them go only certain 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.130
 Now we have to see what then 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.530
 the topic is also good, for example 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:14.900
 Now what do we need here? 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 would keyboard where it is now 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.870
 I had to go 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.560
 yes, for example, to do standards 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.810
 it now says I want them to 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.410
 install freeze there or 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 The menu was able to manage the content 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.760
 was you can look for alba on it 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:50.390
 generally with any app delete nobody 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.860
 it should not just have that on it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.260
 should not just do it as or not 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.820
 solve everything you do not know because of it 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.300
 may happen that the device itself 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.280
 it breaks for you, for example 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.650
 really do not need it here 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.390
 This talkback in Kriegs- tor new 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:14.980
 Software install csu hear the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:18.760
 updates but you can see the action 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.760
 really delete it completely 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.330
 that was about a video if still ask 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.330
 just have in the comments
