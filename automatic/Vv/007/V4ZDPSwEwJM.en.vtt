 Android rooted using an application 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.230
 which is called triangle and wii but before 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.140
 that nothing first of course has to 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.509
 develop your device using the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.580
 super user using another application 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.920
 it's just going to be adjustments if you have 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.770
 the super user and you go to the end of the list 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.590
 where it says from full routing this 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.540

 available in the app once it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.310
 we have already in our device we are going 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.560
 to go to the folder where we have it 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.119

 any application once what 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.530
