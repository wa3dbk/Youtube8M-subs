00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello guys sorry for the trouble in the meantime 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.290
 I get messages and emails 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.820
 this is a service communication 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.330
 very fast because I need yours 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.610
 Help 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.290
 as we have mentioned on facebook and 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.839
 twitter if you do n't follow us as usual 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.920
 there are the links below do it because 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.420
 just go green first 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.070
 communication 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.800
 we are thinking of launching a new one 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.180
 interactive address book on youtube and on 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.439
 our video space on the phone 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.939
 italia.com in which practically 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 we will discuss with you what you want 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.020
 you now well explain the section yes 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.880
 will call iPhone Italia Kiwi in Sundays 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.250
 will be published as the name of 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 Sunday is practically you will do the 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.719
 questions and I envy you I will answer 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.579
 precisely after a few days each 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.410
 week we will collect all the questions 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.010
 most interesting curious and funny 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 so let's say it will not be a service of 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.360
 assistance will not be rewarded 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.469
 more assistance questions 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.910
 details because we say we have others 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.730
 channels for assistance 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 and they are also more direct and faster then 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.799
 if you need an answer 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.869
 immediate advice on a question 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.540

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.770
