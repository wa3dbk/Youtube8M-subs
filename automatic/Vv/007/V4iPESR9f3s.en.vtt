look at how these stats are translated
in<00:03:12.390> game<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:12.989> actual<00:03:13.290> damage<00:03:13.829> that<00:03:14.069> is

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.370 
Delta mobs as you can see there are four
steps<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.849> influence<00:03:18.299> actual<00:03:18.750> damage<00:03:19.109> being

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
steps that influence actual damage being

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.099 
steps that influence actual damage being
Delta<00:03:19.799> mobs<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:21.299> first<00:03:21.599> step<00:03:21.810> in<00:03:21.989> this

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109
