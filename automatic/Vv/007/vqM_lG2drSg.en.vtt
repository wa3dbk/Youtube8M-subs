00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.640 
much but we will say that the quest is
interesting<00:01:39.780> because<00:01:39.960> there's<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> couple<00:01:40.560> of

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
interesting because there's a couple of

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.020 
interesting because there's a couple of

depending on what clues you decide to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810 
depending on what clues you decide to
follow<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.860> doesn't<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:44.700> add

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
follow it doesn't really add

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.090 
follow it doesn't really add
replayability<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.439> nice<00:01:46.619> touch<00:01:46.890> when

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
replayability but it's a nice touch when

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.319 
replayability but it's a nice touch when
it<00:01:47.220> comes<00:01:47.369> together<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:47.970> end<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.240> your
