00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
just because for my mouse in particular

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.620 
just because for my mouse in particular
it<00:00:33.780> is<00:00:33.809> not<00:00:34.140> working<00:00:34.590> properly<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:35.450> was<00:00:36.450> using

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it is not working properly I was using

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.680 
it is not working properly I was using
it<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.960> while<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.380> was<00:00:37.649> gaming<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.309> and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
it for a while I was gaming with it and

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.910 
it for a while I was gaming with it and
every<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.870> often<00:00:40.079> while<00:00:40.410> I<00:00:40.469> was<00:00:40.559> playing<00:00:40.680> some

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
every so often while I was playing some

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.069 
every so often while I was playing some
Team<00:00:41.160> Fortress<00:00:41.399> 2<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.879> do<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> 360

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
Team Fortress 2 I just do like a 360

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.560 
Team Fortress 2 I just do like a 360
spin<00:00:43.489> and<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.579> don't<00:00:44.700> know<00:00:44.879> why<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.210> know

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
spin and I don't know why you know

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.720 
spin and I don't know why you know
something<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.860> feel<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.520> think

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
something with the feel of this I think

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.279 
something with the feel of this I think
because<00:00:48.000> it's<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.360> lot<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:48.750> than<00:00:49.020> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
because it's a lot different than the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.979 
because it's a lot different than the
Razer<00:00:49.440> Kabuto<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> mouse<00:00:51.570> man

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Razer Kabuto which is this mouse man

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.979 
Razer Kabuto which is this mouse man
here<00:00:52.620> mouse<00:00:52.949> pad<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:54.180> use<00:00:54.809> this

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
here mouse pad right here I use this

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.170 
here mouse pad right here I use this
right<00:00:55.230> now<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.590> was<00:00:55.980> using<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> before<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:57.030> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
right now I was using it before and I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.689 
right now I was using it before and I
was<00:00:57.300> gonna<00:00:57.420> upgrade<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.050> but<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.680> had<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
was gonna upgrade to this but I had to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.549 
was gonna upgrade to this but I had to
go<00:00:59.820> back<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.270> because<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> cloth

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
go back to this because this is a cloth

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.250 
go back to this because this is a cloth
feel<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:02.730> smooth<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> sort<00:01:04.140> of

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
feel very smooth but this is sort of

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.550 
feel very smooth but this is sort of
bumpy<00:01:04.710> okay<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:06.270> know<00:01:06.450> right<00:01:07.140> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> box

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
bumpy okay and I know right on the box

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.580 
bumpy okay and I know right on the box
it<00:01:07.979> says<00:01:08.780> high-performance<00:01:09.780> for<00:01:09.990> optical<00:01:10.470> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
it says high-performance for optical and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.840 
it says high-performance for optical and
laser<00:01:10.770> mice<00:01:11.070> well<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.510> rat<00:01:12.689> seven<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
laser mice well I have to rat seven and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.249 
laser mice well I have to rat seven and
it<00:01:14.850> didn't<00:01:15.119> properly<00:01:15.360> work<00:01:15.720> for<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.049> Mouse

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
it didn't properly work for that Mouse

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
it didn't properly work for that Mouse
so<00:01:16.530> maybe<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.009> just<00:01:17.220> mine<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.759> don't<00:01:17.909> know<00:01:18.030> why

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
so maybe it's just mine I don't know why

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.840 
so maybe it's just mine I don't know why
but<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.950> know<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.310> don't<00:01:20.490> know<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
but you know I don't know it is just

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.200 
but you know I don't know it is just
mine<00:01:21.299> my<00:01:21.720> mouse<00:01:21.900> from<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.290> mouse<00:01:23.250> pad<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.700> my

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
mine my mouse from that mouse pad or my

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.190 
mine my mouse from that mouse pad or my
razor<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:25.320> when<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.710> was<00:01:26.240> playing<00:01:27.240> when<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.080> was

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
razor but when I was playing when I was

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.200 
razor but when I was playing when I was
actually<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.280> my<00:01:29.400> computer<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> was

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
actually just on my computer I was

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.210 
actually just on my computer I was
moving<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.930> mouse<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.040> very

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
moving the mouse just you know very

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.030 
moving the mouse just you know very
slowly<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.840> wouldn't<00:01:34.079> move<00:01:34.200> clearly<00:01:34.799> or

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
slowly and it wouldn't move clearly or

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.230 
slowly and it wouldn't move clearly or
smoothly

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
smoothly

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
smoothly
I<00:01:36.450> guess<00:01:37.079> across<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.680> screen<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.460> you

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I guess across the screen it was you

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
I guess across the screen it was you
know<00:01:39.030> sort<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.390> bumping<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.229> down<00:01:40.400> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
know sort of bumping up and down and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.429 
know sort of bumping up and down and
just<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:42.630> weird<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.759> decided<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.439> most

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
just really weird so I decided that most

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.109 
just really weird so I decided that most
likely<00:01:46.590> it's<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.220> mouse<00:01:47.399> mat<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.850> matte

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
likely it's this mouse mat a matte

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.480 
likely it's this mouse mat a matte

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
the feel of it I don't like because it's

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.270 
the feel of it I don't like because it's
bumpy<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.850> it<00:03:44.000> didn't<00:03:44.239> work<00:03:44.269> from<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.660> mouse

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
bumpy and it didn't work from the mouse

horrible mouse pad for all my sign

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.420 
horrible mouse pad for all my sign
guessing<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:56.269> but<00:03:56.989> for<00:03:57.230> Mom<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.709> wasn't<00:03:58.340> that

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430
