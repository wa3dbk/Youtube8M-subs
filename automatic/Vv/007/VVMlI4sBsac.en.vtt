00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 Oh 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.220
 and before 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.470
 the facilities these gorgeous here that 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.960
 does how installed in his fans a 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.000
 we do not think we're back when he's 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.610
 returned to the stable ca ground that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.920
 had bought where I did build 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.350
 so everything was thought, that is to say for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.700
 the comfort of horses the well being of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.290
 horses for the practical side of 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.860
 employees it's really a stable that has 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.630
 been up of nothing really for that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.300
 everything happens to be able to work in 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.280
 the good situations 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.210
 I am lucky to have 45 days 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.210
 slap in the deer 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.840
 yeah 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.610
 I hope to bring today we are going 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:33.850
 make turf Tuesdays and love of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.850
 judgment 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.590
 she evolved well that still and they 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.070
 want all the dogs before already been 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.229
 beefy a docu the jackdaw actually done 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 more jumencourt it was a little more 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.640
 rustic 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.409
 we can say in his momentum his model I 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.420
 found that between 2 and 3 years old and still 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:57.080
 a nice evolution amassed a lot more 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.909
 to draw is really more beautiful and I 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.229
 think that same quality then still 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.229
 progressed between two and three years 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.979
 so it's a mare that makes more 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.650
 of a year that a few courses what is it 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.280
 rare to see the two years in the very beginning 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:22.569
 of year and keep this level there he even 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:28.709
 evolved over courses go go 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.709
 vote ps alex emond who is typing 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.439
 so notice to the guys 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.190
 the mines spain yes to screw the chic 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.560
 the sales of milagro the breeding of 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.019
 milagro is the biggest breeding 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.170
 from Spain where he had organized a sale 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.120
 in madrid where its owners so we 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.160
 made the move and had bought 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.819
 several horses the shower abadon which 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.319
 was part of the lot 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.709
 after that it's a wink of 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.510
 owners of a partner who associates 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.459
 on the mare that I've known for more 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.720
 of 20 years who said he led who 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.730
 would not put her to training and that he 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.680
 would call him that when he had me 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.140
 proposed that name there I was a little bit 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.730
 skeptics and the results that makes it a 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.730
 beautiful story especially that go good 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.750
 in her first race she had already 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.520
 this mind she already had this quality 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.310
 quality has nevertheless progressed she has 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.820
 matured but sediments or 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.780
 input he had me had enthusiasm 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.430
 and his ability to run this so 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.710
 she always remained equal to her 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.010
 same and emmerdent progression cons 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.520
 we're coming on this comeback race to 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:52.980
 cagnes-sur-mer 18 february sindup who 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.530
 whatever happens will remain etched in 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.720
 your memory because 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 you put an end to your calm all 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.310
 it's going to be serious and I had it 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.560
 said that gave the first winner that 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.690
 I will do as a jockey I will stop 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.800
 on it and I was lucky enough to fall 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.840
 on her 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.030
 on this show north noc it was really 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.840
 a pleasure I have a doubt we will say 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.820
 two seconds 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.680
 and when I ask my mare to 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.000
 lie 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.639
 girls who are boring while eating 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.079
 and its acceleration from 100 watts to 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:22.250
 ventoso and I have a portrait before 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.669
 term at home with the race was at my 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.740
 scope 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.280
 saw the view at the speed that I could 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.280
 come survival 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.780
 if bush who always answered me 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.190
 present at each of her outings she has 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.570
 had a bad race we will say 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.110
 it was the test at the criterium of the 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.440
 spoiler 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.180
 but we could reconcile and so the 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.830
 mare I felt a little less 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.030
 well but being a favorite of the race 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.980
 is always difficult to do there 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.140
 so I still took 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.550
 the court option is at the races where 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.240
 the mare was revealed to be less 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.750
 alright so well I was associated with m so 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.880
 I really do not have to go hard I will say and 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.340
 so to aim after the end of the season 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.320
 where she answered present we are in 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.270
 winning the race at 100 Serbian being 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.960
 Seconds of the house price 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.300
 laffitte 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.280
 it's really a mare that responds to 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.600
 my expectations when we do a real 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.880
 program and spacing them well 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.770
 races this year we are really in 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.550
 the typical profile 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.440
 after this is a mare that is 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.850
 very calm who has a big mind and a 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.010
 poker what that's all it did 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.660
 really with his heart yes the morning 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.210
 it's not demonstrative 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:43.930
 it's the afternoon it's for me it's 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:45.550
 a warrior she pushes herself to 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.380
 transform when we go to 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.570
 boxes in boxes where the climb 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.100
 like that it really is calm 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.920
 and soothed and when asked 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.850
 it is she completely transforms am 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.160
 says the race is over 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.300
 the pressure falls she will be she 

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.310
 come back every time I come back to trot 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.870
 to let you breathe well 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.490
 recover judgment signs that 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.360
 never panic what then is it 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.460
 really his strength 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.570
 I think it's mental alain's 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:12.400
 warrior alain heart as big as she 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:13.360
 that's when you have the mind and the 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.920
 heart 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.800
 the physical also hated really has everything 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.660
 to make a really nice mare 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.270
 what me it is a freelance of two hearts 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.200
 that manages that I have in me what this 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.210
 will burn all 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.610
 all my life I think 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.199
 I hope there will still be 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.460
 other things to heart 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.460
 between her and me what 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.749
 be added for her it's not very 

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:26.599
 complicated I think she has a lot 

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:27.499
 who would like to be associated with l for 

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:29.990
 the moment we have a little bit of 

00:07:27.499 --> 00:07:31.999
 talks with ioritz mendizabal who has 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.499
 shocked for me that he is very fine here 

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:35.050
 it's a mare that you have to be very 

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.430
 end with us to succeed to have 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.229
 a lot of cold blood to wait for them 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.330
 Last 200 meters and trust 

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:43.520
 the police 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:44.779
 so ioritz for me is a foot game 

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.069
 who could be associated with him who 

00:07:44.779 --> 00:07:48.289
 would be very good and we could keep 

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.569
 for the rest of Joe Borg's career 

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.909
 if the mare is doing the value I hope 

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:56.439
 in caution 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:07:56.439
 it flows from source is the hen
