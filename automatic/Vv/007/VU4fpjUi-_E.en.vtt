00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.380
 are set 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 from the street because so in 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.180
 first is ford focus 3 up to 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.310
 types of mounts that exist 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.770
 so well, in general, three types of mounts that's what 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.570
 wireframe 1 like this he 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.590
 looks to and tobi-shaped mount 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.140
 In fact, the fabric is set it 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.440
 general window sill gum window 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.440
 the frame that is in this place 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:47.000
 in this place like this there is no gum usually 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:52.130
 have Lada volkswagen and skoda 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.800
 Well, other cars too gum here 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 This gum bends metal frame 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.240
 on the legs pounded the metal frame in 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.670
 do not leave an energetic scent 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:08.290
 fortifications like this is inserted 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:13.600
 and you are absolutely perfect anyway 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:16.520
 bends like this and if you choose 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.500
 frame curtain with magnets 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.530
 it just superimposes it 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.790
 mount magnet and keeps well yes 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.790
 here's a magnet 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.830
 volkswagen jetta 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 like 1 2 5 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:48.720
 here is the mount here and here 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:55.620
 all pretty good 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:58.290
 how many here look one-two-three magnet but 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.600
 it is generally quite racial necessary very 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.750
 they often ask not to fly out just 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.250
 with the window open if 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.940
 I do not give legs to knock it does not 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.099
 will fly out 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.540
 in general actually keeps very 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:18.010
 well except that keeps well on 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.090
 besides when the window is open 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.910
 the twist is small due to the fact that here 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.819
 mesh and cabin noise is smaller and smaller 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:40.069
 due to this probably not quite a bit 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:43.480
 zero zero integer as the second kind of mount 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:46.910
 if you chose the curtains with magnets 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.329
 this is a double-sided tape mount 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.880
 that is, in this case there is no car 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:55.420
 possibilities under the gum window frame 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.860
 install mount past 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.380
 it is installed like this just 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.310
 stuck here 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.970
 degrease the places 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:08.209
 mounts and inserted curtain us there 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.700
 the same magnet this regard 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.739
 curtains with magnets also exist 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.789
 curtain which is installed without 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:24.550
 magnets on the latch up in this case 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:27.289
 me here is one universal mount 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.560
 bendable mount for each machine 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.340
 you have to change your way 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.430
 simply 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.760
 metal mount metal gum 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.620
 Yakovchenko 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:43.090
 all the same let's say you 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:47.490
 tag or you some or volkswagen 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.380
 some kind of passat or jed anneals on 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.280
 installed in the same way 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:57.040
 bend mounting 1 2 the letter r is made 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.260
 the same is done in kobe inserted 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.580
 a curtain is inserted here 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.950
 and zadayatsya latch that is, too 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.470
 as I have already shown 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.570
 just on the other side does the same thing 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.640
 See Dima when ordering people 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:16.270
 should immediately tell what kind 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:18.070
 fixing whether you yourself need say in 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.430
 dependence on what kind of car 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:26.020
 Depending on completes the curtains with their own 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:28.540

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.130
 window frame and 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.590
 the shutter snaps these on magnets 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:47.110
