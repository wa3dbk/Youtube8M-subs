00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.450
 we found here in the pedestrian mx 5 of 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.900
 may good the most beautiful of all the street 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.949
 is the contact with reality the power 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.199
 listen to the people of Cordoba who 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.970
 happens and be in each one of those of 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:21.829
 homes that does not seem to me to be the most 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.349
 cute to be on the street is a descent 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.599
 of reality in telling you stuff 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.419
 that happen past the mobile or my career 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.579
 journalistic with the good lizard not 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.960
 ago not so much last year I have 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.930
 the possibility is the first channel of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.040
 broadcast live from the patrol wake 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.660
 aerial from the police helicopter 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.920
 from CÃ³rdoba province good was a 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 experience first the first time 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.220
 I saw the helicopter go up and second the 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.420
 first live broadcast this of 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.280
 Helicopter sweep in the province 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.080
 agreed so that was really very 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.180
 Then they go through a lot of things 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.230
 everyday the important thing to know that one 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.230
 he does what he can for the people 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.390
 thanks guys, if we keep playing 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.790
 least worse of these seven participants 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.369
 and anecdotes on the mobile a lot because 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.130
 a lot of people go by every day to me 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.110
 a lot of characters have fun 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.810
 we take them out to the air and can 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.840
 share the audience the guys who are going 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.000
 the mobile always surprise and one of the 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.070
 anecdotes that I had left over from this 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.140
 time in beni tomorrow that was 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.520
 little is that every day we take 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.680
 many people asked him some 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.070
 daily slogan that we have in the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.450
 program and one day it happened to me that we ended up 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.130
 just beni tomorrow and I was 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.780
 taking out the return leaving the microphone 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.320
 and video like six policemen looking for me 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.729
 but what happened that I was discovered was not 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.039
 that one of the notes I had made in 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.990
 the morning was a person who was 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.970
 searched for by 'homicide then what 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990
 they saw on the TV that was there by the 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.280
 center then well the police 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 ask me what time had the 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 note that said and others and plane 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.869
 We the best thing that can happen to us 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.210
 like movileros is having that contact with 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.000
 the people and one of the great 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.450
 experiences that we have is that people 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.750
 he approaches and asks us to help him 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.060
 and as a medium I think it's one of the 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.459
 greater satisfactions we have 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 some good anecdote in the summer if you 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.989
 you see and I can tell you why it makes a pec 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.000
 a month ago that started this this 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.489
 program and good for fools that 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.470
 we made the mobiles from carlos paz no 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.690
 can you imagine the heat that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.200
 we passed with the artist presented to the 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.840
 side and we tell you we are going and 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.630
 that is good or that the link was cut 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.500
 or what good always live things 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.500
 It has some brands
