00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:13.969
 the DUH perfect even in the dead of winter, this house goes through 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.300
 each outside 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.200
 Lack of perspective from doing nothing can get you underwater at Pergola Chrome 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.539
 but only in the summer 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.179
 in the cold season guests and other privileges will be guests in the house 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.050
 The place by the fireplace is of course very popular 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.770
 so find yourself really well 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.530
 and the coffee tastes Fr 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.530
 obviously not easy but stressed 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.590
 Nevertheless, there are not excuses in this house but also children 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.590
 but can not use here 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.330
 we wanted him a performance profile so I think it's in Iran 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.170
 Greenpeace is simply that women had to be cared for before 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.670
 Already 60 years of much needed credit for us it was important and 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 Meanwhile, we are looking forward to having a helper for the 98 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.630
 Gislason continues 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.420
 the house is locked in six weeks 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.420
 Everything was fine and I do not want it 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.250
 in addition to the large living area 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.410
 There are many more themes including ancillary rooms than the one with the CD 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.380
 whole family including guests who feel comfortable here 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.140
 So version Dolphin promoted 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.450
 in 3d in cinemas 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.280
 in the middle of the house in the depth 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.180
 in the transitional period about that is such a thing to take 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.950
 the GDR not stuck 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.389
 "It's really a bit surreal
