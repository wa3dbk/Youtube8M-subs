00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
like exposed it's really annoying so I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
like exposed it's really annoying so I
might<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.600> get<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.899> different<00:01:55.259> band<00:01:55.590> oh

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
might have to get a different band oh

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.410 
might have to get a different band oh
because<00:01:55.979> this<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.490> does<00:01:56.670> not<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.090> lot<00:01:57.360> of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
because this one does not have a lot of

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
because this one does not have a lot of
support<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:59.100> doesn't<00:01:59.460> sound<00:01:59.759> very<00:01:59.939> well

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
support and it doesn't sound very well

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.580 
support and it doesn't sound very well
but<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.479> does<00:02:00.630> have<00:02:00.869> some<00:02:01.049> ruching<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
but it does have some ruching in the

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
but it does have some ruching in the
middle<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:02.969> ties<00:02:03.479> in<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.869> back

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
middle and it just ties in the back

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.899 
middle and it just ties in the back
which<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.530> also<00:02:04.680> don't<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.700> find

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
obnoxious next banks that I have is a

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.080 
obnoxious next banks that I have is a
set<00:02:08.560> which<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.890> also<00:02:09.070> from<00:02:09.340> jcpenney<00:02:09.850> JC

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
set which is also from jcpenney JC

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.820 
set which is also from jcpenney JC
penney<00:02:10.330> has<00:02:10.390> some<00:02:10.600> really<00:02:10.780> cute<00:02:11.050> bikinis<00:02:11.530> for

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
penney has some really cute bikinis for

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.430 
penney has some really cute bikinis for
pretty<00:02:12.130> cheap<00:02:12.570> around<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:13.720> time<00:02:13.930> of<00:02:13.990> year<00:02:14.140> so

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
pretty cheap around this time of year so

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.560 
pretty cheap around this time of year so
i<00:02:14.470> would<00:02:14.620> definitely<00:02:14.830> checking<00:02:15.340> them<00:02:15.640> out<00:02:15.850> but

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
i would definitely checking them out but

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.500 
i would definitely checking them out but
i<00:02:16.630> guess<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.710> is<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.430> this<00:02:18.700> set<00:02:19.120> and<00:02:19.150> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
i guess so it is just this set and this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.480 
i guess so it is just this set and this
is<00:02:19.660> just<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> bottoms<00:02:20.290> for<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.860> top<00:02:21.310> is

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
is just the bottoms for the top is

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.640 
is just the bottoms for the top is
somewhere<00:02:21.790> in<00:02:21.940> there<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:22.720> it<00:02:22.990> is<00:02:23.140> just<00:02:23.440> this

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
somewhere in there but it is just this

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.550 
somewhere in there but it is just this
on<00:02:24.100> bottom<00:02:25.000> which<00:02:25.209> for<00:02:25.810> some<00:02:25.930> reason<00:02:25.990> whenever

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
on bottom which for some reason whenever

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.290 
on bottom which for some reason whenever
I<00:02:26.860> looked<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.490> I<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:27.940> think<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.240> is

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
I looked at this I just think this is

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.930 
I looked at this I just think this is
the<00:02:28.510> pool<00:02:28.780> in<00:02:29.050> Arizona<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:29.770> I'm<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.640> think

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
the pool in Arizona and I'm I I think

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.550 
the pool in Arizona and I'm I I think
actually<00:02:31.090> it<00:02:31.450> is<00:02:31.630> because<00:02:31.990> it<00:02:32.110> has<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.380> palm

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
actually it is because it has the palm

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.199 
actually it is because it has the palm
trees<00:02:32.860> and<00:02:32.890> it<00:02:33.100> has<00:02:33.220> like<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.490> Grand<00:02:33.760> Canyon

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
trees and it has like the Grand Canyon

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.580 
trees and it has like the Grand Canyon
or<00:02:34.300> some<00:02:34.510> kind<00:02:34.660> of<00:02:34.690> Canyon<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> back<00:02:35.320> and

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
or some kind of Canyon in the back and

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.590 
or some kind of Canyon in the back and
this<00:02:36.100> is<00:02:36.250> by<00:02:36.400> the<00:02:36.459> brand<00:02:36.790> Arizona<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.390> don't
