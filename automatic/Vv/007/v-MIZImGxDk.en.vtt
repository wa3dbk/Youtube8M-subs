a tutorial is gonna be separate I'm
going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:17.940> move<00:00:18.029> the<00:00:18.150> steering<00:00:18.330> wheel<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.810> is

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990

a multi-function I believe it's the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.120 
a multi-function I believe it's the
h-type<00:00:21.990> steering<00:00:22.410> well<00:00:22.590> I'm<00:00:22.650> not<00:00:22.740> sure<00:00:22.800> what

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
to get a bigger socket and then just use

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.289 
to get a bigger socket and then just use
a<00:01:06.689> impact<00:01:07.350> driver<00:01:07.680> or<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> they<00:01:08.369> go<00:01:08.850> fit<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
a impact driver or if they go fit at you

a impact driver or if they go fit at you
same<00:01:09.479> tank<00:01:09.720> driver<00:01:09.900> otherwise<00:01:10.200> use<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> socket

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
same tank driver otherwise use a socket

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.469 
same tank driver otherwise use a socket
wrench<00:01:10.890> person<00:01:11.760> um<00:01:11.880> by<00:01:12.000> take<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.299> these<00:01:12.420> two

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
wrench person um by take out these two

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.840 
wrench person um by take out these two
screws<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.860> disconnect<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.430> battery

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
screws so first disconnect the battery

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.070 
screws so first disconnect the battery
you<00:01:15.060> can<00:01:15.150> just<00:01:15.299> disguise<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> negative

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
you can just disguise the negative

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080 
you can just disguise the negative
terminal<00:01:16.409> that's<00:01:16.590> fine<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.580> reason<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.939> do

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
terminal that's fine the reason you do

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.640 
terminal that's fine the reason you do
that<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.930> trigger<00:01:19.229> an<00:01:19.380> airbag

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
that is that we do not trigger an airbag

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.320 
that is that we do not trigger an airbag
light<00:01:19.920> because<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> are<00:01:20.970> gonna<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
light because you are gonna have to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.210 
light because you are gonna have to
remove<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> airbag<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.439> order<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.860> remove<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
remove the airbag in order to remove the

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.830 
remove the airbag in order to remove the
steering<00:01:23.520> wheel<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:23.970> ended<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.360> using<00:01:24.570> this

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
steering wheel so I ended up using this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.870 
steering wheel so I ended up using this
to<00:01:25.049> get<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.380> leverage<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:26.580> one<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.790> those

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to get more leverage it's one of those

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
to get more leverage it's one of those
little<00:01:27.030> key<00:01:27.270> things<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.689> Harbor<00:01:28.380> Freight<00:01:28.409> or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
little key things a Harbor Freight or

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.310 
little key things a Harbor Freight or
autozone<00:01:29.220> or<00:01:29.310> whatever<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:30.540> use<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.110> to

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
autozone or whatever I use this to

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
autozone or whatever I use this to
loosen<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.369> use<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> screwdriver

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
loosen it and then I use a screwdriver

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.499 
loosen it and then I use a screwdriver
the<00:01:33.090> rest<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.479> way

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.850 

all<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.289> once<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.680> screws

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
out or loosened you just pull the air

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.380 
out or loosened you just pull the air
bag<00:01:43.289> straight<00:01:43.649> out<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.090> then<00:01:45.090> you're<00:01:45.299> going

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
bag straight out and then you're going

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.389 
bag straight out and then you're going

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
to see that there's wires attached to it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
to see that there's wires attached to it
you<00:01:47.939> got<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.179> be<00:01:48.210> careful<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:48.960> too<00:01:49.079> much

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
you got to be careful don't put too much

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.260 
you got to be careful don't put too much
tension<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.759> two<00:01:50.909> wires<00:01:51.090> right

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
tension on it there's a two wires right

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.580 
tension on it there's a two wires right

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
there that you have to unhook both of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.279 
there that you have to unhook both of
those<00:01:54.829> this<00:01:55.829> one<00:01:56.009> just<00:01:56.130> pulls<00:01:56.399> out<00:01:57.170> just<00:01:58.170> like

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
those this one just pulls out just like

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.480 
those this one just pulls out just like
that<00:01:58.470> there<00:01:59.039> you<00:01:59.069> go<00:01:59.220> there's<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> air<00:01:59.729> bag

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
that there you go there's the air bag

that there you go there's the air bag
here's<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.700> connector<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.179> was

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
here's a two connector that I was

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.520 
here's a two connector that I was
talking<00:02:03.420> about<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.350> push

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
talking about this one you have to push

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.249 
talking about this one you have to push
this<00:02:04.679> down<00:02:04.909> and<00:02:05.909> pull<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> out<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:07.049> way<00:02:07.200> you

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
this down and pull it out this way you

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.499 
this down and pull it out this way you
just<00:02:07.380> pull<00:02:07.560> straight<00:02:07.679> out<00:02:07.829> now<00:02:08.700> now<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> try

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
just pull straight out now now I try

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.609 
just pull straight out now now I try
that<00:02:09.539> removed<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.140> you're<00:02:10.349> gonna<00:02:10.440> have<00:02:10.500> left

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
that removed all you're gonna have left

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.880 
that removed all you're gonna have left
is<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.599> bolt<00:02:12.599> right<00:02:12.720> here<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:13.410> holds<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
is this bolt right here that holds the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.490 
is this bolt right here that holds the
whole<00:02:14.010> steering<00:02:14.280> wheel<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.610> column<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
whole steering wheel to the column you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.839 
whole steering wheel to the column you
might<00:02:16.500> need<00:02:16.650> an<00:02:16.799> impact<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.370> take<00:02:17.549> this<00:02:17.670> off

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
might need an impact to take this off

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.580 
might need an impact to take this off
the<00:02:18.000> impact<00:02:18.329> wrench<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:19.049> should<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.380> able<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
the impact wrench you should be able to

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.259 
the impact wrench you should be able to
do<00:02:19.769> with<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.400> socket<00:02:20.640> but<00:02:21.000> might<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.180> a

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
do with just a socket but might be a

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.759 
do with just a socket but might be a
little<00:02:21.420> bit<00:02:21.510> tougher<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.959> was<00:02:22.470> gonna<00:02:22.560> use<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
little bit tougher I was gonna use the

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:35.210 
little bit tougher I was gonna use the
impact<00:02:32.750> all<00:02:33.750> right<00:02:33.870> once<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:34.890> have<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
impact all right once you have that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.190 
impact all right once you have that
bolts<00:02:35.670> loosen<00:02:36.090> don't<00:02:36.480> take<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:36.930> all<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
bolts loosen don't take it out all the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900 
bolts loosen don't take it out all the
way<00:02:37.230> keep<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:38.069> couple<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.400> threads<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.790> there

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
way keep a couple of threads on there

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.339 
way keep a couple of threads on there
because<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:39.150> gonna<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.480> push<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.260> out

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
because you're gonna have to push it out

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.530 
because you're gonna have to push it out
a<00:02:40.410> little<00:02:40.590> bit<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:40.799> that<00:02:41.010> way<00:02:41.220> comes<00:02:41.489> up<00:02:41.640> or

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
a little bit so that way comes up or

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.120 
a little bit so that way comes up or
maybe<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.140> all<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.829> once<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.069> have

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
maybe not all right so once you have

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.910 
maybe not all right so once you have
that<00:02:44.280> out<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.030> bolt<00:02:45.709> taking<00:02:46.709> out<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
that out there's the bolt taking out the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.020 
that out there's the bolt taking out the
rest<00:02:47.040> of<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.250> way<00:02:47.340> I'm<00:02:47.459> gonna<00:02:47.579> put<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> bolt

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
rest of the way I'm gonna put the bolt

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
rest of the way I'm gonna put the bolt
right<00:02:48.150> back<00:02:48.359> in<00:02:48.620> after<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:50.010> for<00:02:50.220> the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
right back in after that's it for the

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.949 
right back in after that's it for the
steering<00:02:50.579> wheel<00:02:50.819> there's<00:02:51.420> no<00:02:51.569> student<00:02:51.870> wheel

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
steering wheel there's no student wheel

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.770 
steering wheel there's no student wheel
here<00:02:52.139> that's<00:02:52.769> it<00:02:52.980> for<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.420> removal<00:02:54.420> of<00:02:54.630> the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
here that's it for the removal of the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.720 
here that's it for the removal of the
steering<00:02:55.079> wheel<00:02:55.230> I'm<00:02:55.829> have<00:02:56.040> another<00:02:56.310> video<00:02:56.670> on

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
steering wheel I'm have another video on

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.370 
steering wheel I'm have another video on
removing<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.269> m3<00:02:57.690> steering<00:02:57.989> wheel<00:02:58.109> because

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
removing the m3 steering wheel because

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.559 
removing the m3 steering wheel because
it<00:02:58.470> has<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.620> different<00:02:59.040> style<00:02:59.250> airbag<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.000> then

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
it has a different style airbag and then

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.690 
it has a different style airbag and then
I'll<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> video<00:03:01.350> on<00:03:01.380> installing<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.280> m3

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
I'll have a video on installing the m3

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.340 
I'll have a video on installing the m3
wheel<00:03:02.880> because<00:03:03.569> most<00:03:03.780> of<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:03.989> guys<00:03:04.109> are

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
wheel because most of you guys are

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.650 
wheel because most of you guys are
probably<00:03:04.380> removing<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.489> install<00:03:06.000> m3<00:03:06.450> wheel

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
probably removing it to install m3 wheel

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.240 
probably removing it to install m3 wheel
