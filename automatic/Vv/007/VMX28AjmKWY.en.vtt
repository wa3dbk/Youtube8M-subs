00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.920
 description skins in real life that do not 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.170
 exists or consists of taking a script or 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.300

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.829
 fifa and we do it in real life 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.570
 before spikenard to tell them that it is not 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.940
 no series or anything like that simply 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.710
 it's a different video that was not fixed 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.870

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.150

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.400
 things from time to time and good guys if 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.590
 We have more than 100 lies in this video to 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.590
 the second part so manfredi 2 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.259
 good guys will not start with the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.909
 big city roulette 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.070
 one of the simplest dribbles and 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.270
 effective in the world of football so much that 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 if you do it right you stay like a 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.220
 authentic player but both in the fifa 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.180
 like in real life 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.180
 that is the name 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 simple not good now let's see a 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 juggling guy I have no fucking 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.619
 idea how is it called the only thing I know is 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.759
 that you have to give it with one foot and then 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.229
 with the other foot you have to give a 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.229
 entire return to the ball 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.650
 and as a lack of that famous elastic of 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.910
 great ronaldinho that consists of carrying 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.770
 the ball from right to left or 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.040
 left to right according to the foot that 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.040
 let's use 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.530
 now let's put a dribble in new 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.360
 committed on this fifa 15 good a guy 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.680
 of elastic that is like different 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.000
 passing it under the feet a 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.010
 very original dribble that I liked 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.310
 much to do in real life and in the 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.310
 fixed 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.430
 now we have nine favorite merchants 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
 of this type 15 that's very difficult to 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.630
 do because you have to do it stopped or 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.590
 almost stopped and as you get it right you stay 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.590
 like a real shearing 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.800
 arrÃ©glate spent the abracadabra that 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.959
 they are just players with a lot of technique 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.400
 Christian type difficult to do in a 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.300
 match but how come you get it right 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.300
 suck all 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.730
 I know that I have even the cock of 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.770
 change the song but good now 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.300
 we have a very simple dribble 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.130
 simple that if you do it at the time 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.460
 Exactly you can leave your rival for the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.460
 floors 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.220
 of the famous elastic one came out 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.080
 variation the inverse elastic the same 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.730
 but the other way around dribble with the one that can 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.730
 get out of trouble in many matches 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.180
 we go to the last skill and we have a 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.220
 combo added in this new fifa 15 that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.960
 is to make a reverse bicycle 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.040
 throw it forward and with the same foot 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.040
 throw it to the other side 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.800
