00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
online game if you think it's a little

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.130 
online game if you think it's a little
slow<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.720> can<00:01:51.869> go<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.200> 46<00:01:52.740> maybe<00:01:53.340> 48

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
slow you can go up to 46 maybe 48

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.200 
slow you can go up to 46 maybe 48
haven't<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.350> discover<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:56.190> just<00:01:57.030> been

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
haven't really discover I just been

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
haven't really discover I just been
messing<00:01:57.390> around<00:01:57.600> i'm<00:01:57.900> not<00:01:58.110> i<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.650> know<00:01:59.070> just

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
messing around i'm not i just know just

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.930 
messing around i'm not i just know just
the<00:01:59.580> even<00:01:59.909> numbers<00:02:00.210> haven't<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.720> tested

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
the even numbers haven't really tested

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.800 
the even numbers haven't really tested
46.2<00:02:02.940> or<00:02:03.330> 46.4<00:02:04.430> those<00:02:05.430> other<00:02:06.299> ones<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:08.810> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
46.2 or 46.4 those other ones but it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.180 
46.2 or 46.4 those other ones but it
works<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.200> right<00:02:10.470> now<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.400 

yeah<00:02:18.910> sometimes<00:02:19.480> yeah<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:20.110> said<00:02:20.320> it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
yeah sometimes yeah it's like I said it

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.010 
yeah sometimes yeah it's like I said it
slows<00:02:20.680> down<00:02:21.030> for<00:02:22.030> the<00:02:22.120> most<00:02:22.270> part<00:02:22.450> works<00:02:22.750> well

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
slows down for the most part works well

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.670 
slows down for the most part works well
for<00:02:23.230> me<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:24.000> might<00:02:25.000> change<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.480> 46<00:02:26.080> later<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:26.530> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
for me I might change the 46 later on to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.890 
for me I might change the 46 later on to
see<00:02:26.710> how<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.190> works<00:02:27.400> but<00:02:27.850> other<00:02:28.480> than<00:02:28.840> that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
see how that works but other than that

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.900 
see how that works but other than that
probably<00:02:29.700> 46<00:02:31.680> 4246<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.890> probably<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.670> best

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
probably 46 4246 is probably the best

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.630 
probably 46 4246 is probably the best
they're<00:02:34.390> all<00:02:34.570> about<00:02:34.810> the<00:02:34.870> same<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.340> just

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
they're all about the same it's just

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.460 
they're all about the same it's just
sometimes<00:02:36.880> they<00:02:37.480> go<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.050> just<00:02:38.080> shoot<00:02:38.440> a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
sometimes they go you just shoot a

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:52.100 
sometimes they go you just shoot a
little<00:02:38.620> bit<00:02:38.860> slow

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.740 

that's<00:02:52.770> about<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.580> then<00:02:53.730> for<00:02:54.210> anyone<00:02:54.690> who
