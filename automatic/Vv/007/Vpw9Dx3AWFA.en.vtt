00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.409
 still a shortened week like all 

00:00:02.239 --> 00:00:04.849
 the months of may but fortunately he 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.380
 seems that the good weather is also 

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:07.550
 of the party this week hello to 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.590
 all welcome to the new studios 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.390
 of video tickets we are Monday 5 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:21.890
 May 2014 and this is the news flash of the day 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:23.630
 that's the 600 that in a month 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.340
 will run the wwdc the conference 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.990
 annual developers of apple is the 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.880
 favorite sport of the aficionados of the 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.500
 mark at the apple is obviously of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.359
 predict what the tim cook firm is going to 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.829
 to be able to announce the two main 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:35.569
 rumors concern the annunciation of the hague 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.489
 iphone 6 watch but it looks good 

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:39.589
 that none of this should be there 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.850
 presented according to various sources it does not 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:42.469
 no mention will be made of 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.729
 new hardware in June because as 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.010
 last year the event will focus 

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:47.629
 only on the new bones of the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.339
 indeed mark ayo and suites and the 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.109
 latest version of mac os will be 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.370
 widely discussed despite some other 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:54.379
 rumors also appeared a few years ago 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.639
 days it will not be in June either 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.739
 that we should have news of 

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:58.969
 the apple tv be it the small module 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.530
 of media reading that is today 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.719
 in its third version that the famous 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.190
 tele2 apple that is becoming more and more 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.630
 unlikely over the months for everyone 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.820
 those who are impatiently waiting for the iphone 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.320
 6 who should finally pass a screen of 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.910
 much larger size so it will take 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.830
 wait for the month of September 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.340
 next in the category of 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.900
 smartphones 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.520
 amazing but who are going to have a hard time 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.350
 get into your jeans pocket here 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 the crazy peppers this is a 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.860
 innovation created by the human laboratory 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.600
 media lab of the Canadian University of 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.760
 queen's the piper fold is a smartphone 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.710
 equipped with three screens just that which 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.060
 assemble modulable way a little 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.620
 like a puzzle and that can be 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.090
 fold in several positions next 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.680
 used to the goal we can for example 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.000
 use one of the screens as a keyboard 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.410
 touch then we have the impression of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.820
 work on a laptop 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.500
 it is also possible to imagine 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120
 several other uses like display 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.250
 a conversation on a microphone and a 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.050
 web page on another the crazy piper is 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.280
 equipped with horse screens that limit 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.720
 so the quality of the data displayed 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.200
 but that also allows a long 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 autonomy 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.050
 if he is today a prototype he 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.220
 could, however, be of interest 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.020
 brands one can for example think of 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.670
 motorola in the smartphone project 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.740
 scalable stud is ultimately not so 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.750
 far from this one we talk about it again 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.220
 maybe in a few years the 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.990
 developers fans of comics it's nothing 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.310
 exceptional but from there to propose 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.930
 complete tools to developers for 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.980
 do very advanced research in 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.270
 a huge database and cancer 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.040
 the only one sticking to it is rather 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.170
 unusual and that's what 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.300
 so propose marvel the publisher of comics 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.520
 spider man x men captain america or 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 still iron man with the country marvel 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.190
 comics the publisher provides indeed 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.200
 software tools allowing 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.820
 developers to query the database of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.560
 marvel comics data to draw some 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.360
 metadata of all types for example one 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.530
 can query the base of marvel on 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.330
 the characters the parallel universes 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.460
 organizations the species 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.440
 aliens the animals the epics 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.520
 that change the universe the crossover 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.320
 between several heroes etc 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.850
 and if you wonder what 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.170
 can serve its api know that they 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.910
 will allow developers to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.470
 create web or mobile applications 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.070
 around the universe of our heroes 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.380
 favorite 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.820
 to follow the question of the day does not come from 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.630
 maxim that can not recover 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.790
 his messages 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.080
 othman from his iphone who persist 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.940
 to him indicated that his password is 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.710
 erroneous maxime nice try that does not 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.920
 not walk and so ask us our 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.660
 help 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.310
 hello maxime I reassure you are far 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.170
 to be the only one to have met this 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.150
 problem recently it does not come from 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.010
 the iphone but the two-way check 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.960
 cutting steps in com that replaced 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.490
 high mail windows live at the highest 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.050
 point as requires since a certain 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.490
 time this double security for himself 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.050
 connect to his account with sending a 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.730
 four-digit code on an address 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.320
 alternative or via SMS 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.430
 but the problem is that some 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.480
 platforms are not yet 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.010
 compatible with this step 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.630
 intermediate and this is the case of ayo is 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.310
 this to succeed anyway to 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.959
 to connect it must be indicated a word of 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.310
 pass app which is different from 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.450
 your email password for 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.890
 find the one you have to go to them 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.840
 40 live.com points 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.250
 then in the game and security and words 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.750
 password looking at the word part of 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.280
 pass application then you have to click 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.140
 about creating an application password 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.120
 you will find a rather slow password 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.800
 that you will have to enter instead of tom 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.270
 or usual password on your iphone and 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.800
 attention for each device 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.300
 different that is not compatible with 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.160
 this two-step verification 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.620
 you will have to create a new word of 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.730
 pass application to September even 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.050
 attention we talked about ex men and what 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.940
