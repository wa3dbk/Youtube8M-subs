bring a lot of new changing of course
the<00:00:35.700> metal<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> glass<00:00:36.420> body<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:36.930> is

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
the metal and the glass body which is

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.780 
the metal and the glass body which is
pretty<00:00:37.290> obvious<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.579> based

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
pretty obvious that is going to be based

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.319 
pretty obvious that is going to be based
on<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> galaxy<00:00:39.570> s6<00:00:40.489> but<00:00:41.489> yeah<00:00:41.969> but<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> other

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
on the galaxy s6 but yeah but the other

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.440 
on the galaxy s6 but yeah but the other
things<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:43.829> says<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.059> basically

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
things which says and this is basically

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.410 
things which says and this is basically
a<00:00:45.600> concept<00:00:46.190> okay<00:00:47.190> there's<00:00:47.430> no<00:00:47.610> leaks<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.210> are

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
a concept okay there's no leaks that are

were going to see it but not yet so this
is<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.449> concept<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.110> shows<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> Galaxy

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
is a concept that shows that the Galaxy

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.599 
is a concept that shows that the Galaxy
Note<00:00:56.820> 5<00:00:57.059> will<00:00:57.390> feature<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.960> 4k<00:00:58.710> display<00:00:59.100> which

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
Note 5 will feature a 4k display which

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.099 
Note 5 will feature a 4k display which
is<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.879> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.660> an<00:01:00.809> upgrade

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
Display might be ready to ship its 4k or

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.039 
Display might be ready to ship its 4k or
LED<00:01:37.259> panels<00:01:37.799> before<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> end<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.270> year<00:01:39.600> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
LED panels before the end of the year so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.800 
LED panels before the end of the year so
probably<00:01:40.770> we're<00:01:41.369> gonna<00:01:41.520> see<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:41.790> galaxy<00:01:42.180> note<00:01:42.570> 5

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
probably we're gonna see a galaxy note 5

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.850 
probably we're gonna see a galaxy note 5
with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> 4k<00:01:44.040> screen<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:46.320> know<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.439> cannot

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
with the 4k screen and you know I cannot

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.880 
with the 4k screen and you know I cannot
bet<00:01:47.640> my<00:01:47.820> money<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.390> but<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:49.380> seems<00:01:49.680> like

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
bet my money on that but it seems like

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
bet my money on that but it seems like
it<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.490> possibility<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.450> also<00:01:52.259> there's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
it is a possibility and also there's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.490 
it is a possibility and also there's
also<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:53.040> rumor<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.780> might<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.470> a

also a rumor that that we might see a
deal<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.070> screen<00:01:56.490> version<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> Galaxy

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
deal as screen version of the Galaxy

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.870 
deal as screen version of the Galaxy
Note<00:01:57.600> 5<00:01:58.159> they're<00:01:59.159> running<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.579> Ultra<00:01:59.850> HD

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
Note 5 they're running an Ultra HD

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.149 
Note 5 they're running an Ultra HD
resolution<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
resolution just like we have on the

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.749 
resolution just like we have on the
galaxy<00:02:02.820> s6<00:02:03.119> edge<00:02:03.979> probably<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.490> this

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
galaxy s6 edge probably this is it this
