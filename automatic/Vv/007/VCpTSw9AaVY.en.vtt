00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
in mind of course this could be false

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
in mind of course this could be false
information<00:01:27.479> since<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.350> anonymous

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
completely soon so I'm going to organize

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.120 
completely soon so I'm going to organize
the<00:01:39.390> store<00:01:39.600> into<00:01:39.780> two<00:01:39.960> parts<00:01:40.320> first<00:01:40.560> we're

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the store into two parts first we're

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.679 
the store into two parts first we're
going<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.280> analyze<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.000> makes<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.360> post

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
going to analyze what makes this post

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.929 
going to analyze what makes this post
seem<00:01:42.930> true<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.860> makes<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> seem<00:01:44.520> false

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
seem true and what makes it seem false

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
seem true and what makes it seem false
and<00:01:45.270> then<00:01:45.840> run<00:01:46.170> down<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.619> main<00:01:46.829> bits<00:01:47.100> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and then run down the main bits of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
and then run down the main bits of
information<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.119> important<00:01:48.509> leaks<00:01:48.689> in

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
not to believe these so going right into

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.609 
not to believe these so going right into
it<00:01:53.700> some<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.359> the<00:01:54.420> info<00:01:54.719> that<00:01:54.750> makes<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> post

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
because the information outlines a very

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.270
