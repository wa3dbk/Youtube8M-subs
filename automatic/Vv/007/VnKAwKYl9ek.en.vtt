00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 hello very good dear subscribers 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.890
 here we are with this new video for 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.690
 the channel and this is a video of things that 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.639
 you asked me a lot first 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 place let's see how to go and how 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.719
 secure these bikes that we have here 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.280
 the blazer is worth the bases of clubs 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 is that you can bring both denied and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.430
 so cool in the normal way and on the other 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.930
 side at the end of the video you will have a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.750
 bonus clip with the winners of the draw 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.250
 of the stop and chromed two things that I 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.359
 you have asked for a lot so nothing 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.910
 let's start with the first and the most 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.920
 important what is going to happen to us 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.599
 a motorcycle and how are we going to 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 secure them well so that a friend 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.480
 pass us the motorcycle the first thing that has 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.170
 what to do logically is to have the motorcycle 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.930
 OK 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.940
 logically so nothing here baxter me 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.579
 is going to wear the blazer tuned blazer 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.440
 very nothing very cool the way it has been 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.730
 passed the normal way and as you can see what 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.020
 What you have to do is get into your 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.789
 Garage with the motorcycle if you already have it 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.559
 then you walk in and you have 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.000
 that the bike is worth but when it comes out 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.800
 the kinematics that you are taking the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.570
 you will have to close the session 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 our character will come out and 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 we will have to be 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.770
 waiting here with the bazooka just like 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.230
 you are watching it to put a 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.820
 cucumber and bust his character 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.460
 It's worth busting the bike and bursting its 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.780
 The motorbike character will appear 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 duplicate fair 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
 in front so you're not going to have any 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.210
 lost and you'll just have to catch the I'm going 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.710
 to put the brass camera theres this 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.909
 you notice that when it comes out and it's going to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.290
 leaving the kinematics is seen then the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.590
 black screen he is already prepared 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 to close your session and when it's out 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 the kinematics that is coming out 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 here you have it how it goes out as he closes 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.700
 the session is valid and the bombing arrives 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.280
 the ball is already there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.899
 break that sorry the motorbike well 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.190
 Well now let's go back to my camera 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.750
 again and let's see what we have to 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.399
 do here we see it as he leaves the already 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.600
 closed session and we have 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.220
 burst but his bike has doubled 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.929
 right here in front here you can see it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.640
 how it has doubled without any kind of 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.190
 problem here we have it duplicated and 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.020
 we can take them without problem 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.850
 some he is no longer in our game 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.560
 ok because he has closed session so 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.840
 nothing simply we take it and we put it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.250
 in our garage this bike is already 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.770
 ours and when we put it into our 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.119
 Garage is going to have a locator, but 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.800
 what it is not going to have is not going to 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.530
 have insurance now comes the second 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.300
 part of the video that is how we're going to 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.619
 secure here as you see we have mine 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.360
 the one that I had before that is 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.890
 completely insured and here we have 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.019
 the broken caster just doubled me 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.020
 that is without insurance any vale 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.390
 there is nothing sure so nothing 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.890
 as we assure it then simple the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.390
 we take the bike we go back to 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.920
 invite brighter of course or 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.110
 We turn to invite our friend and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.400
 that we will need it again 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.050
 that nothing we take the motorcycle that is without 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.240
 make sure we get it out of our garage 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.340
 we go to the custom saints of 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.140
 jerk is worth once we are in the saints 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.000
 just what we're going to do is get ourselves 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.620
 on the internet and we're going to buy the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.790
 rebel carling that I remind you that is 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.440
 on the internet here on the last page 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.760
 here we have these cars 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.650
 They tend to be the coolest cars 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.510
 trillos then nothing we buy the face 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.160
 and yellow level because not because the 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.450
 we buy and he tells me that as everything 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.130
 I have to replace the full garage 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.350
 by replacing it with some vehicle 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.750
 anyone who is indifferent gives 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.220
 it's worth it we replace it once 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.630
 we have done this the only thing that we have 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 what to do we have already bought our 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.960
 face and reveal then we are going to put 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.850
 Against this appears our friend is going 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.130
 to embed it will leave us caught between 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.540
 the wall and your car is worth there is no 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.620
 problem is worth you see here let me 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.330
 caught and you're 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.760
 when we are careful, we will take demos 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.580
 we will give to be sorry and we will go to 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.440
 playstation store and our friend we 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.030
 will have to invite again to the game 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.350
 here you see it we are in playstation 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.930
 store and I get the invitation from brass 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.069
 ter then accepted this what will happen 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.689
 is that not 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.730
 it was sorry to put the pink cloud we 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.319
 will download again in the same game 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.450
 where we were in which 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.069
 we were before then well here we accept 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.659
 the invitation of brass ter and how I have 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.099
 said the 9 ross is thus will lower us 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.170
 you are sure if you want to join 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.879
 I'm sure and the cloud of ross just like 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.739
 I said we get off once the cloud of 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.659
 roster take us down we will realize that 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.040
 we will have doubled the motorcycle there as 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:42.659
 You're going to see us appears below 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.400
 the minimum for the location of 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:45.540
 our motorcycle because it is marked 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.579
 like it's our personal vehicle 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.290
 but this bike we are going to leave 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.150
 and we're not going to touch it 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.129
 we're just going to go for the bike 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.659
 you broke previously we were 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.819
 pillaging against the wall that has now 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.219
 So it was as if it were on the street 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.599
 so to speak, it is very possible that 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.680
 the bike will turn around it as 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.959
 you have seen we have had a few 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.790
 problems but well then if you give the 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:07.049
 turn then that the one in the car 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.939
 then he tapped it so that 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:10.469
 can you again take it, it's worth it because 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.599
 I do not know why but it stays like 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.010
 overturned well once we take it 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.480
 we move away you see how I am 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.699
 moving away from the saints custom and 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.440
 mostly away from my other car the 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.729
 motorcycle that appeared to us like it was 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.560
 our personal vehicle because if not 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.120
 will not let us call the mechanic and 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.440
 is what we have to do now we 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.670
 we move away a little when we are far 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.470
 we call the mechanic 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.730
 with the bike that does not have a locator 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.110
 remember with the bike that was 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.970
 recessed against the wall 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.800
 we call the mechanic and we're going to ask 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.780
 our karim reveals garin revel that 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.490
 we have bought previously when 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.170
 we were in the holy just because here 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.030
 we have it we call the mechanic we ask 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.220
 face and revel and we wait for the 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.050
 mechanic bring us face and reveal this 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.400
 it is very simple it is very easy 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.320
 simple and easy what is going to happen 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.240
 now basically we're going to 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.620
 exchange this motorcycle secured by the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.980
 face between candle green travel you go to 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.750
 lose but it costs nothing are 3,000 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.100
 here as you see the mechanics does not bring 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.990
 it is very important to wait until the 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.400
 mechanic get off the car is worth it then 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.350
 is the mechanic got out of the car 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.970
 has left us there the face and revel then 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.740
 it is simply us without 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.570
 get off the motorcycle even now 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.980
 we go to our garage and we put it 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.890
 inside the garage and how are you going 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.090
 check will already be completely 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.740
 assured the only thing you have to do 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.020
 is to follow the steps as I have done in the 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.850
 Video is very easy is easy worth 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.680
 has gone to the first all without any 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.930
 kind of problem so it's very easy 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.330
 as I say and very simple here you see that 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.490
 already the bike is secured so nothing 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.780
 basically this has been the video I hope 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.090
