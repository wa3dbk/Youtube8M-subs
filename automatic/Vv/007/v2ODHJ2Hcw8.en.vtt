00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
this boat really has the best of both

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.290 
this boat really has the best of both

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
worlds as it also has a rudder on the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.080 
worlds as it also has a rudder on the

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.330 
counter winds it is a fast walk tracking
system<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.610> only<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.810> top<00:02:11.080> portion<00:02:11.410> maneuvers

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340

system so only the top portion maneuvers
the<00:02:12.580> rudder<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.989> still<00:02:14.320> maintain<00:02:14.560> braced

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
the rudder and you still maintain braced

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.850

solid bracing ability over the boat when
it's<00:02:18.489> deployed<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.870> actually<00:02:20.560> Larry<00:02:20.799> you<00:02:20.980> can

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
it's deployed so actually Larry you can

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.789 
it's deployed so actually Larry you can
have<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.640> cake<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:21.970> eat<00:02:22.269> it<00:02:22.330> too<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.680> we

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.870 
know we like that the cockpit itself
it's<00:02:27.730> quite

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's quite

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.930 
it's quite

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
angle paddle stroke if you choose to do

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.740

that<00:03:12.410> and<00:03:13.070> for<00:03:13.100> smaller<00:03:13.880> powers<00:03:14.390> they're<00:03:14.600> not

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
that and for smaller powers they're not

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.390 
that and for smaller powers they're not
going<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:14.960> be<00:03:15.050> bumping<00:03:15.470> hands<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.250> things

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
going to be bumping hands and things

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.690 
going to be bumping hands and things
like<00:03:16.610> that<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.180> same<00:03:17.390> degree<00:03:18.700> the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
like that to the same degree the

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.150 
like that to the same degree the
capacity<00:03:20.330> of<00:03:20.360> this<00:03:20.720> boat<00:03:21.020> is<00:03:21.260> actually<00:03:21.590> rated

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
capacity of this boat is actually rated

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.900 
capacity of this boat is actually rated
quite<00:03:22.760> high<00:03:23.530> which<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.560> good<00:03:25.070> but<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
quite high which is good but one of the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.450 
quite high which is good but one of the
downsides<00:03:26.150> of<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.020> is<00:03:27.350> that<00:03:27.770> it<00:03:27.890> does<00:03:28.100> have<00:03:28.400> a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
downsides of that is that it does have a

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:32.800 
downsides of that is that it does have a
higher<00:03:29.120> back<00:03:29.690> deck<00:03:30.080> which<00:03:30.770> impedes<00:03:31.460> in<00:03:31.820> in<00:03:32.390> lay

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
higher back deck which impedes in in lay

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.220 
higher back deck which impedes in in lay
back<00:03:33.080> rolls<00:03:33.530> so<00:03:34.220> really<00:03:35.180> with<00:03:35.450> this<00:03:35.660> boat<00:03:36.020> as

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
back rolls so really with this boat as

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.800 
back rolls so really with this boat as
sea<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.680> sea<00:03:36.890> world<00:03:37.250> is<00:03:37.580> probably<00:03:38.030> your<00:03:38.600> best

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
sea to sea world is probably your best

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.160 
sea to sea world is probably your best
bet<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.650> forgot<00:03:40.550> to<00:03:40.730> mention<00:03:40.880> Larry<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:41.750> it<00:03:41.900> the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
bet I forgot to mention Larry but it the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.620 
bet I forgot to mention Larry but it the
boat<00:03:42.380> does<00:03:42.680> have<00:03:43.010> slight<00:03:43.520> rocker<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.330> it<00:03:44.360> or

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
boat does have slight rocker to it or

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.620 
boat does have slight rocker to it or
what<00:03:44.840> we<00:03:44.930> call<00:03:45.170> modern<00:03:45.440> rocker<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.790> that's<00:03:47.420> the

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
what we call modern rocker so that's the

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.960 
what we call modern rocker so that's the
curvature<00:03:48.170> of<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.320> boat<00:03:48.620> bow<00:03:48.860> to<00:03:48.920> stern<00:03:49.070> which

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
curvature of the boat bow to stern which

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.800 
curvature of the boat bow to stern which
when<00:03:50.420> you<00:03:50.600> edge<00:03:50.810> this<00:03:51.170> boat<00:03:51.560> aids<00:03:52.490> it<00:03:52.880> to<00:03:53.120> turn

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
when you edge this boat aids it to turn

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:54.980 
when you edge this boat aids it to turn
beautiful

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
beautiful

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.420
