going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:39.960> use<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> blender<00:00:40.559> logo<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.100> now

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
going to use the blender logo for now

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.350 
going to use the blender logo for now
rotate<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> x-axis<00:00:43.800> 90<00:00:44.190> degrees<00:00:44.520> and

rotate it on the x-axis 90 degrees and

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.930 
rotate it on the x-axis 90 degrees and
we're<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.260> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> position<00:00:46.680> things<00:00:47.280> so

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
we're just going to position things so

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.240 
we're just going to position things so
everything<00:00:48.360> looks<00:00:48.570> nice

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
we're going to change this to a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.510 
we're going to change this to a
dopesheet<00:01:27.680> window<00:01:30.009> now<00:01:31.009> we're<00:01:31.159> going<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.369> go

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
dopesheet window now we're going to go

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.990 
dopesheet window now we're going to go
up<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.820> few<00:01:32.060> frames<00:01:32.450> say<00:01:33.409> about<00:01:33.619> here<00:01:34.009> add<00:01:34.520> in<00:01:34.909> a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
up a few frames say about here add in a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.840 
up a few frames say about here add in a
location<00:01:35.420> keyframe<00:01:36.110> move<00:01:37.040> our<00:01:37.220> object<00:01:37.670> back

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
location keyframe move our object back

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.180 
location keyframe move our object back
behind<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.479> camera<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.020> then<00:01:39.500> go<00:01:39.680> back<00:01:39.890> 10

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
behind the camera and then go back 10

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.340 
behind the camera and then go back 10
frames<00:01:40.520> on<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.790> timeline<00:01:41.330> and<00:01:41.570> then<00:01:42.050> add<00:01:42.200> in

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
frames on the timeline and then add in

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.830 
frames on the timeline and then add in
another<00:01:42.590> location<00:01:43.070> keyframe<00:01:43.729> when<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.570> view

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
another location keyframe when we view

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.230 
another location keyframe when we view
that<00:01:45.020> we<00:01:45.500> see<00:01:45.740> a<00:01:45.770> nice<00:01:46.220> transition<00:01:46.759> where<00:01:47.090> our

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
that we see a nice transition where our

00:01:47.240 --> 00:02:02.230 
that we see a nice transition where our
object<00:01:47.810> falls<00:01:48.500> right<00:01:48.740> onto<00:01:49.100> our<00:01:49.130> white<00:01:49.460> canvas

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.460 

now<00:02:03.240> we'll<00:02:03.390> try<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.660> get<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.050> one<00:02:04.290> more

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
now we'll try to get in one more

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.010 
now we'll try to get in one more
transition<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:05.390> we'll<00:02:06.390> move<00:02:06.600> up<00:02:06.810> on<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
transition here we'll move up on the

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
transition here we'll move up on the
timeline<00:02:07.890> say<00:02:08.640> about<00:02:08.850> here

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
timeline say about here

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.110 
timeline say about here
add<00:02:09.930> in<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.290> location<00:02:10.619> keyframe<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.580> we're

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
add in a location keyframe and we're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.480 
add in a location keyframe and we're
going<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.480> move<00:02:12.720> this<00:02:12.960> off<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.920> screen<00:02:16.190> add<00:02:17.190> in

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
going to move this off the screen add in

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.540 
going to move this off the screen add in
another<00:02:17.790> location<00:02:18.180> keyframe<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.100> let's<00:02:20.400> see

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
another location keyframe and let's see

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.030 
another location keyframe and let's see
how<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:20.700> looks<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> it<00:02:22.380> follows<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
how that looks so it follows on the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.550 
how that looks so it follows on the
canvas<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:23.670> just<00:02:24.110> flies<00:02:25.110> off<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
canvas and then just flies off the

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.110 
canvas and then just flies off the
screen

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
screen

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.970 
screen
and<00:02:27.209> that<00:02:27.840> concludes<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> second<00:02:28.769> part<00:02:28.950> of

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and that concludes the second part of

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.070 
and that concludes the second part of
