00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
in because we don't know which one's

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.970

better we stick both the men

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.050 
better we stick both the men
and<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.910> evolutions<00:02:05.570> for<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:05.990> are<00:02:06.820> bold<00:02:07.820> all

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
and the evolutions for that are bold all

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.330 
and the evolutions for that are bold all
forgot<00:02:08.480> two<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.810> those<00:02:08.960> okay<00:02:09.830> ever<00:02:10.010> I'll<00:02:10.160> have

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
three that would be a bit better and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.030 
three that would be a bit better and
rock<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.180> rollers<00:02:14.660> got<00:02:15.290> two<00:02:15.530> different<00:02:15.740> types

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
rock and rollers got two different types

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
has more health so for that one in for

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.870 
has more health so for that one in for
two<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.890> these<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.220> one<00:02:22.280> even<00:02:22.490> does<00:02:22.700> damage

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
two of these this one even does damage

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.070 
two of these this one even does damage

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
even have any energies that will work

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.670 
even have any energies that will work
that<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:46.310> matchups<00:02:46.910> we<00:02:47.540> don't<00:02:47.750> have<00:02:48.080> much<00:02:48.380> ham

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
that so matchups we don't have much ham

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
was in base set and that was when I

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.380 
was in base set and that was when I
started<00:03:36.320> collecting<00:03:36.830> them<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.489> chairman<00:03:38.300> is

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
started collecting them and chairman is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.960 
started collecting them and chairman is
just<00:03:38.570> better<00:03:38.780> than<00:03:38.900> bill<00:03:39.760> ok<00:03:40.760> that's<00:03:40.940> just

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
a good card energy surge yep that's your

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.760 
a good card energy surge yep that's your
cue<00:03:55.130> cyl<00:03:55.550> if<00:03:55.790> we<00:03:56.390> are<00:03:56.600> energy<00:03:57.230> drained<00:03:57.530> we

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
cue cyl if we are energy drained we

cue cyl if we are energy drained we
don't<00:03:57.980> have<00:03:58.070> anything<00:03:58.250> this<00:03:59.060> guy<00:03:59.239> energy<00:03:59.480> from

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
don't have anything this guy energy from

Poquelin<00:04:52.550> communication<00:04:53.500> theatre<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.919> know

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
Poquelin communication theatre you know

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.760 
Poquelin communication theatre you know
i<00:04:55.669> switch<00:04:56.449> switch<00:04:56.960> is<00:04:57.139> useful<00:04:57.530> that'd<00:04:57.650> be

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
i switch switch is useful that'd be

i switch switch is useful that'd be
really<00:04:57.949> good<00:04:58.130> actually<00:04:58.310> for<00:04:58.639> me<00:04:58.760> if<00:04:59.479> they<00:04:59.840> were

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
really good actually for me if they were

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.930 
really good actually for me if they were
in<00:05:00.169> they<00:05:00.470> were<00:05:00.560> actually<00:05:00.740> in<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.520> first<00:05:01.789> or

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
in they were actually in the first or

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.850 
in they were actually in the first or
second<00:05:02.240> set<00:05:02.449> I<00:05:02.660> think<00:05:02.990> I've<00:05:03.169> been<00:05:03.320> in<00:05:03.440> jungle

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
second set I think I've been in jungle

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.710 
second set I think I've been in jungle
but<00:05:04.639> they<00:05:04.760> were<00:05:04.820> they<00:05:05.330> were<00:05:05.389> actually<00:05:05.539> really

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
but they were they were actually really

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.390 
but they were they were actually really
useful<00:05:05.990> but<00:05:06.470> not<00:05:06.620> as<00:05:06.710> much<00:05:06.889> as<00:05:06.949> well<00:05:07.280> well<00:05:07.960> okay

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
useful but not as much as well well okay

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.050 
useful but not as much as well well okay
I<00:05:10.780> think<00:05:11.780> that<00:05:12.440> might<00:05:13.039> be<00:05:13.100> enough<00:05:13.580> for<00:05:13.940> the

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
I think that might be enough for the

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.810 
I think that might be enough for the
trainers<00:05:14.449> and<00:05:14.710> rest<00:05:15.710> energy<00:05:15.949> so<00:05:16.460> we<00:05:16.490> just<00:05:16.729> need

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
trainers and rest energy so we just need

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.170 
trainers and rest energy so we just need
fighting<00:05:17.740> the<00:05:18.740> infinite<00:05:19.520> fighting<00:05:19.970> type

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
fighting the infinite fighting type

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.279 
fighting the infinite fighting type
energies<00:05:20.960> let's<00:05:21.289> just<00:05:21.380> put<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:21.770> load<00:05:22.039> these<00:05:22.250> in

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
energies let's just put a load these in

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.370 
energies let's just put a load these in
because<00:05:24.289> they<00:05:24.560> are<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:26.030> only<00:05:26.180> my<00:05:26.990> energies

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
because they are the only my energies

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:33.250 
because they are the only my energies
i'm<00:05:27.500> gonna<00:05:27.710> be<00:05:27.770> using<00:05:30.160> okay<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:32.810> cannot<00:05:33.020> play
