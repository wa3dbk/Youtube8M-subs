00:06:01.459 --> 00:06:01.469 
basically you can make it any size but

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:03.829 
basically you can make it any size but
the<00:06:01.589> bigger<00:06:01.830> it<00:06:02.039> gets<00:06:02.099> the<00:06:02.610> better<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.360> I

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:03.839 
the bigger it gets the better and I
