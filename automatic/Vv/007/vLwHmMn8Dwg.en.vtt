do in this video is work on first

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.750 
do in this video is work on first
creating<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.359> materials<00:00:25.070> for<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.160> head<00:00:26.400> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
creating the materials for the head the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.750 
creating the materials for the head the
arms<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.660> shirt<00:00:28.160> things<00:00:29.160> like<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:34.760> then

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
arms the shirt things like that and then

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.180 
arms the shirt things like that and then
i'm<00:00:36.300> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:37.010> unwrap<00:00:38.270> the<00:00:39.270> head<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.190> then

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
i'm going to unwrap the head and then

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
i'm going to unwrap the head and then
i'm<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> show<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> little

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
i'm going to just going to show a little

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:55.600 
i'm going to just going to show a little
bit<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:44.690> texture<00:00:45.690> painting<00:00:46.879> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.809> 3d<00:00:49.309> model

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.760 

what<00:00:56.610> i'm<00:00:56.699> doing<00:00:56.969> here<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.770> selecting

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
what i'm doing here is selecting

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
what i'm doing here is selecting
different<00:00:59.100> parts<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.879> model<00:01:00.629> and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
different parts of the model and

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.399 
different parts of the model and
creating<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.590> materials<00:01:05.869> what<00:01:06.869> i<00:01:06.900> usually<00:01:07.080> do

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
creating the materials what i usually do

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.679 
creating the materials what i usually do
for<00:01:07.439> something<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.360> create

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
for something like this just to create

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.600 
for something like this just to create
is<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:11.030> delete<00:01:12.030> all<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.630> materials<00:01:13.280> first<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
is to delete all the materials first and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
is to delete all the materials first and
then<00:01:14.930> create<00:01:17.810> a<00:01:19.310> base<00:01:20.310> material<00:01:21.470> when<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
then create a base material when you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
then create a base material when you
create<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:23.009> material<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:24.140> blender<00:01:25.140> its<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:26.479> it

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
create a material and blender its of it

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.140 
create a material and blender its of it
selects<00:01:28.200> everything<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.220> first<00:01:29.759> material

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
selects everything the first material

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.230 
selects everything the first material
you<00:01:30.509> create<00:01:31.049> selects<00:01:31.500> everything<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.250> then

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
you create selects everything and then

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
you create selects everything and then
every<00:01:34.700> subsequent<00:01:35.700> material<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.860> create<00:01:37.860> off

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
every subsequent material I create off

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.149 
every subsequent material I create off
of<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.020> basement<00:01:40.020> or<00:01:40.409> you'll<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.740> me<00:01:40.860> going

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
of that basement or you'll see me going

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
of that basement or you'll see me going
back<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.909> base<00:01:42.090> every<00:01:42.450> time<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.869> I'll

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
back to the base every time and I'll

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
back to the base every time and I'll
show<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.200> why<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.640> just<00:01:44.909> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
show you why I do that here in just a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.340 
show you why I do that here in just a
moment

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.649 

some<00:01:50.040> materials<00:01:50.610> i'll<00:01:51.119> use<00:01:52.040> procedural

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
some materials i'll use procedural

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.870 
some materials i'll use procedural
texturing<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.780> like<00:01:55.110> these<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.920> grommets

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
texturing on like these little grommets

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.450 
texturing on like these little grommets
on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.150> shoes<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.750> i<00:01:58.619> think<00:01:59.190> i'm<00:01:59.280> going<00:01:59.369> to

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
on the shoes and i think i'm going to

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:09.160 
on the shoes and i think i'm going to
use<00:01:59.580> five<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.630> six<00:02:00.900> different<00:02:01.110> UV<00:02:02.630> maps<00:02:03.630> here

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.080 

now<00:02:10.170> what<00:02:10.350> i'm<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:11.069> go<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.580> and

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
now what i'm going to do is go back and

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.460 
now what i'm going to do is go back and
select<00:02:13.819> well<00:02:14.819> here<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.120> just<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.660> minute<00:02:16.170> i'll

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
select well here in just a minute i'll

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.500 
select well here in just a minute i'll
select<00:02:18.050> i'll<00:02:19.050> go<00:02:19.350> back<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:20.180> base<00:02:21.180> material

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
select i'll go back to the base material

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.890 
select i'll go back to the base material
hit<00:02:22.170> select<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.220> will<00:02:23.370> tell<00:02:23.610> me<00:02:23.900> any

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
hit select and it will tell me any

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.870 
hit select and it will tell me any
polygons<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.769> i<00:02:27.230> missed<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.980> long<00:02:29.580> as<00:02:29.610> i

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
polygons that i missed as long as i

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:40.710 
polygons that i missed as long as i
created<00:02:30.180> all<00:02:30.480> my<00:02:30.780> materials<00:02:31.319> off<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.769> base

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350 

so<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.620> go<00:02:41.770> back<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.550> base<00:02:42.730> hit<00:02:43.090> select

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
so here I go back to the base hit select

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.720 
so here I go back to the base hit select
and<00:02:43.810> sure<00:02:43.990> enough<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.410> forgot<00:02:44.890> to<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:45.700> the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
and sure enough I forgot to do the

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.660 
and sure enough I forgot to do the
little<00:02:46.860> 70s<00:02:47.860> comb<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.020> the<00:02:50.020> belt<00:02:51.480> belt<00:02:52.480> buckle

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
little 70s comb and the belt belt buckle

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.360 
little 70s comb and the belt belt buckle
so<00:02:54.670> that's<00:02:55.060> just<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.360> helpful<00:02:55.600> trick<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.380> always

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
so that's just a helpful trick to always

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.720 
so that's just a helpful trick to always
create<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.790> off<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.180> it<00:02:58.330> off<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:59.400> base<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.700> you

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
create it off of it off of a base so you

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.340 
create it off of it off of a base so you
can<00:03:01.000> keep<00:03:01.240> track<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:03.030> what<00:03:04.030> still<00:03:04.390> needs<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:05.170> be

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
can keep track of what still needs to be

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.560 
can keep track of what still needs to be
done<00:03:05.530> on<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:06.990> complicated<00:03:08.790> model<00:03:09.790> here<00:03:10.450> I'm

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
done on a complicated model here I'm

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.430 
done on a complicated model here I'm
creating<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.260> UV<00:03:13.800> UV<00:03:14.800> texture<00:03:15.930> layers<00:03:16.930> that

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
creating the UV UV texture layers that

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:28.220 
creating the UV UV texture layers that
the<00:03:17.770> UV<00:03:18.270> maps<00:03:19.270> will<00:03:19.690> be<00:03:20.490> created<00:03:21.490> from

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.180 

selecting<00:03:29.230> edges<00:03:29.709> here<00:03:30.340> to<00:03:33.090> break<00:03:34.090> up<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.570> UV

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
selecting edges here to break up the UV

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.540 
selecting edges here to break up the UV
UV<00:03:36.190> map<00:03:36.760> with<00:03:37.590> control<00:03:38.590> you<00:03:38.709> can<00:03:38.890> select<00:03:39.160> an

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
so I've selected the head UV texture

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:01.770 
so I've selected the head UV texture

map here I'm creating an image these are
all<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.150> things<00:04:07.180> you<00:04:07.510> got<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.690> do<00:04:07.900> before<00:04:08.380> you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
all the things you got to do before you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.320 
all the things you got to do before you
hit<00:04:09.700> a<00:04:09.910> unwrap<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.140> once<00:04:11.890> i<00:04:12.070> hit<00:04:12.250> unwrap<00:04:12.880> i<00:04:13.120> get

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
hit a unwrap and once i hit unwrap i get

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.550 
hit a unwrap and once i hit unwrap i get
this<00:04:13.540> very<00:04:13.930> strange<00:04:15.330> UV<00:04:16.330> map<00:04:16.570> with<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:17.260> neck

the<00:04:31.120> top<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.870> head<00:04:32.640> and<00:04:33.640> that<00:04:33.940> doesn't

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
the top of the head and that doesn't

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.150 
the top of the head and that doesn't
really<00:04:34.330> seem<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.720> help<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:37.950> sometimes<00:04:38.950> you

moving them pinning them with the p key

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.010 
moving them pinning them with the p key
you<00:05:08.070> can<00:05:08.130> select<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.850> point<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.240> hit<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.510> p<00:05:09.720> key

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
you can select a point and hit the p key

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.230 
you can select a point and hit the p key
and<00:05:10.230> pin<00:05:11.010> a<00:05:11.450> point<00:05:12.450> and<00:05:13.700> then<00:05:14.700> hitting<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.150> e

and pin a point and then hitting the e
key<00:05:15.900> to<00:05:16.260> unwrap<00:05:16.860> again<00:05:18.139> and<00:05:19.139> i'm<00:05:20.040> just<00:05:20.220> doing

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
key to unwrap again and i'm just doing

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.090 
key to unwrap again and i'm just doing
this<00:05:20.639> time<00:05:20.970> and<00:05:21.300> time<00:05:21.540> again<00:05:21.570> to<00:05:22.560> try<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.950> come

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 
this time and time again to try and come

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.280 
this time and time again to try and come
up<00:05:23.130> with<00:05:23.370> something<00:05:23.970> that<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:24.270> like<00:05:28.669> and<00:05:30.290> this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
up with something that I like and this

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.450 
up with something that I like and this
is<00:05:31.470> all<00:05:31.740> just<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:33.470> maximize<00:05:34.470> the<00:05:34.919> amount<00:05:35.040> of

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
is all just to maximize the amount of

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.210 
is all just to maximize the amount of
space<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:37.430> face<00:05:38.430> takes<00:05:38.850> up<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.389> map<00:05:39.660> I

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
space the face takes up in the map I

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.219 
space the face takes up in the map I
didn't<00:05:41.220> need<00:05:41.430> the<00:05:41.820> the<00:05:42.680> neck<00:05:43.680> to<00:05:43.710> be<00:05:44.130> so

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
didn't need the the neck to be so

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:52.460 
didn't need the the neck to be so
prominent<00:05:46.229> on<00:05:46.410> the<00:05:47.010> map<00:05:50.539> so<00:05:51.539> it's<00:05:51.750> just<00:05:51.960> a<00:05:52.200> lot

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
prominent on the map so it's just a lot

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.890 
prominent on the map so it's just a lot
of<00:05:53.390> footsie<00:05:54.390> work<00:05:55.169> trying<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.770> make<00:05:56.070> sure<00:05:56.900> also

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
of footsie work trying to make sure also

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.490 
of footsie work trying to make sure also
here<00:05:58.620> that<00:05:58.650> I<00:05:59.280> don't<00:05:59.880> have<00:06:00.000> any<00:06:00.120> overlaps<00:06:00.600> you

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
here that I don't have any overlaps you

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.650 
here that I don't have any overlaps you
can<00:06:01.650> see<00:06:01.919> by<00:06:02.130> the<00:06:02.190> difference<00:06:03.180> in<00:06:03.330> the<00:06:03.419> color

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
can see by the difference in the color

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.840 
can see by the difference in the color
of<00:06:03.750> the<00:06:04.050> map<00:06:04.260> when<00:06:04.680> there's<00:06:04.919> an<00:06:05.070> overlap<00:06:05.340> I

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
of the map when there's an overlap I

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.240 
of the map when there's an overlap I
think<00:06:06.539> I<00:06:06.630> go<00:06:06.840> in<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.229> work<00:06:07.380> on<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.650> ears<00:06:07.860> here

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
think I go in and work on the ears here

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.059 
think I go in and work on the ears here
in<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.370> moment

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:25.600 

here<00:06:15.069> we<00:06:15.190> go

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:25.610 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.040 

so<00:06:26.610> now<00:06:26.790> that<00:06:26.970> I've<00:06:27.060> pretty<00:06:27.270> much<00:06:27.360> got<00:06:27.690> this

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
so now that I've pretty much got this

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:34.159 
so now that I've pretty much got this
now<00:06:28.800> I've<00:06:29.070> got<00:06:29.340> my<00:06:29.990> edited<00:06:30.990> UV<00:06:31.530> map<00:06:31.790> over<00:06:33.169> the

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
now I've got my edited UV map over the

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:40.939 
now I've got my edited UV map over the
image<00:06:34.710> i<00:06:34.949> created<00:06:38.570> the<00:06:39.570> target<00:06:40.410> image<00:06:40.710> i

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:40.949 
image i created the target image i

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:46.180 
image i created the target image i
created<00:06:41.639> so<00:06:41.940> now<00:06:43.970> what<00:06:44.970> I'm<00:06:45.120> going<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.449> do<00:06:45.720> is

created so now what I'm going to do is

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.969 
created so now what I'm going to do is
load<00:06:47.190> that<00:06:47.520> image<00:06:48.440> onto<00:06:49.440> my<00:06:49.919> texture<00:06:50.850> layer

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:51.979 
load that image onto my texture layer

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.689 
load that image onto my texture layer
switch<00:06:52.979> to<00:06:53.370> texture<00:06:54.120> painting<00:06:54.330> and<00:06:55.550> I'm<00:06:56.550> going

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:56.699 
switch to texture painting and I'm going

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:58.879 
switch to texture painting and I'm going

using it to paint the 3d model and this

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.580 
using it to paint the 3d model and this
is<00:07:24.210> just<00:07:24.360> the<00:07:24.510> beginning<00:07:24.630> this<00:07:25.110> is<00:07:25.289> just<00:07:25.500> to

is just the beginning this is just to
get<00:07:25.770> a<00:07:25.800> base<00:07:26.310> layer<00:07:26.850> down<00:07:27.389> on<00:07:27.780> that<00:07:28.050> UV<00:07:28.650> map<00:07:28.889> to

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
get a base layer down on that UV map to

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.100 
get a base layer down on that UV map to
kind<00:07:30.210> of<00:07:30.389> tell<00:07:31.110> me<00:07:31.139> where<00:07:32.690> the<00:07:33.690> different

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110 
kind of tell me where the different

kind of tell me where the different
features<00:07:34.560> are<00:07:34.770> on<00:07:34.979> the<00:07:35.100> face<00:07:35.990> and<00:07:36.990> I'll<00:07:37.889> be

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
features are on the face and I'll be

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:45.890 
features are on the face and I'll be
going<00:07:38.729> through<00:07:40.099> part<00:07:41.099> 2<00:07:41.750> to<00:07:44.330> deal<00:07:45.330> with<00:07:45.539> more

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:45.900

going through part 2 to deal with more
of<00:07:46.139> the<00:07:47.360> texture<00:07:48.360> painting<00:07:48.650> so<00:07:49.650> I<00:07:49.680> hope<00:07:49.770> that

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:49.950 
of the texture painting so I hope that

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.220
