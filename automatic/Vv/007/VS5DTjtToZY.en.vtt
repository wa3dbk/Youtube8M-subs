00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530
 ski 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.580
 hello people here is back in Europe 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.530
 I will show you this video 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.110
 Guide to three successes call of 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.490
 duty calls campaign yes with this follow 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.529
 it is sometimes a bit confusing 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.439
 what you had to do there or 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.850
 where you have to make these successes and yes 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:23.320
 Now I'll show you how you do these 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.910
 had to do and probably the successes 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.400
 we'll come to the same 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.130
 first success of this is called Dornröschen 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.930
 gives ten games choir or one bronze 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.210
 trophy and the success story 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.949
 means turn off the sleeping 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.440
 while they are upside down 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.149
 You have to achieve this success in one level 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.950
 make the Federation day 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.899
 you come in this mission someday 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.820
 to a point where you hedge the server 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.040
 and then you have to go back to the 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.960
 wire rope must be off and yes first 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.940
 you have the power with the phone 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.500
 make a button press and then 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.559
 you have two left on the left side 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 enemies shoot off easily and yes if 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.890
 you have to go further now you have to 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.960
 Pay attention to the windows as always 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.730
 little look at the windows 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.039
 have behind you because you are yours 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.869
 upside down and yes you have to have now 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.060
 just wait until you get one 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.010
 sleeping cdu-tip weekends essl 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.060
 sleep there and then you have to 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.619
 just turn off age by the 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.040
 Shoot window and as soon as you see this 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.570
 have killed quietly and then have targeted 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.700
 her success already in the bag he 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.979
 will get ten first successes 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.140
 and thus you have the first success of the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.490
 a bit confusing was good then 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.750
 I would say we do the same with order 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.030
 the second success of a bit 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.979
 confusing was further and this is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.689
 Fine dust in the face and gets for it 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.150
 one ten gamerscore or one bronze 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.159
 troop of wet description is 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.110
 start photocopying with her 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.670
 face as the success of the first 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.040
 once I've read hey thought 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.649
 courier so catch her face photo 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.140
 Something the height of me want but something 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.729
 it 's actually quite simple 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.890
 success in any case is the 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.020
 success also in the level day of the promotion 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.299
 and yes, when you got the elevators 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.070
 have deactivated that is sometime 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.200
 There you are back to computers 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.969
 disable the lifts after that 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.850
 you kill a few opponents and you are 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.620
 get off a railing again and yes 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.840
 if now has you from this terrain 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.390
 you have to turn aside or activate yours 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.970
 partner an explosion he has up c4 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.650
 laid and comes in this explosion 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 photo copied down and this one 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.610
 you just have to stand down so 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.500
 to rip you and harm you 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.030
 and if you are actually so in 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.770
 the middle one stops and you do not 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.060
 moved then found him looking automatically 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.460
 just up there where everything 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.620
 explodes and as soon as he looks around 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.450
 just move in the direction where he is 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.190
 to the world and once the harm of 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.170
 you got that too 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.210
 Success in the bag and therefore you have 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.180
 Again, both of the gamerscore in the ten 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.830
 call of duty oscar peine deserves it 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.540
 Let's come to the last success I have 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.459
 wants to show you in this video today 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.500
 and this jackpot he is this 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.110
 there are 20 gamescom or one 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.900
 concert op and yes in this success must 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.910
 to destroy 21 one-armed bandits if 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.540
 I know what one-armed bandits are 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.560
 These are the kind of slot machines you have 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.690
 Actually, I do not know if you are 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.790
 now on note or whether the league is 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.280
 definitely behind slot machines and 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.650
 yes you can find that in the mission sin 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.930
 city ​​and in this mission you will 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.370
 Eventually a large staircase 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.990
 if you ran down this staircase 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.480
 be many enemies on you 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.680
 come and kill them all and yes then 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.269
 Do you still have to follow the escalator 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 circulate and as soon as he escalates 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.600
 have run down 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.700
 who the idea on the left or the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.530
 on the right side a few vending machine scenes 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.330
 and focus only on the right 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.040
 side because there are only the one-armed 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.320
 bandits are the one-armed bandits 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.880
 the small vending machines and there you have to 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.739
 the windows or the 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.390
 screens destroy these vending machines 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:45.340
 and I'm just there for safety 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.530
 always a few grenades thrown because 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.760
 even if the windows were destroyed 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.350
 you have to shoot it again 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.060
 you are really sure that you are the 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.459
 destroyed and not some opponent 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.870
 or a team made and shoots 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.910
 again on the security and yes 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.000
 now you have 20 destroyed is standing 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.310
 namely company 5 these vending machines there as 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.080
 20 pieces but you have to destroy 21 of them 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.150
 and now therefore need through the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.370
 Metal gate run to the next one 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.810
 Escalator but goes this escalator 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.580
 not yet and looks up 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.620
 the other side to the balcony 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.870
 because there is still hidden 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.459
 five more vending machines and destroyed 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.350
 just there will be a few screens 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 and you have the success in the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.060
 pocket and again 20 gamerscore in the 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.710
 correction the oskar pannier deserves yes

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.500
 main channel wants to see then it shows 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240
