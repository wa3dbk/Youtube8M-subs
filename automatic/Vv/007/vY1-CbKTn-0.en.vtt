00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.150
 hello everyone easy portal with you 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.160
 humanoid. 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.350
 if you see me now it means it's come 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.270
 time for a new review without long from 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.230
 I think about it 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.720
 new group 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.779
 devte for the original syn which is pegu 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.390
 as if it deserves close attention 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.699
 drove the action of original syn 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.079
 take place from decades to the most 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.180
 first sofa couch tee 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.120
 we have the role of hunters 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.190
 the source of most members of the guild of warriors 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.190
 close definition of some will 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.840
 magical police all and nonsense of sin 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.239
 conceal accustomed to co-passage 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.489
 diablo-like action-rpg 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.920
 but here is the co-flow mode 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.579
 the classic role-playing game is something 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.940
 new 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.350
 But I decided to sim that case 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.989
 the phrase new experience is possible 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.530
 use without conscience and not for the sake of 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.530
 red word 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.869
 we have two main characters you don't 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.820
 misheard and I did not make a reservation which 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.200
 have an equal effect on the outcome of any 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.759
 events that is suitable for you 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.390
 some citizen to interrogate 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.270
 him 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.220
 he throws out a story about a difficult childhood 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.560
 about toys nailed to the floor 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.830
 diskette for this he stole fish with 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.140
 the counter so here's the outcome of the whole interrogation 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.079
 may be unexpected because your 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.390
 heroes simply did not agree in 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.330
 such cases they solve ethical sport 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.590
 grown-up playing 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 rock-paper-scissors to the bitter end 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.039
 and such a humor hero and in the whole game 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 cart and little cart for it like 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:55.880
 says and love the world by which we 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.399
 have to travel first 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.319
 big pass again end card in 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:02.149
 another in five minutes sleep well no way 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.970
 come out and secondly it's like me 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.649
 nice bonus colorful over each 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.780
 corner in some ruined 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.150
 the villages did their best 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.310
 but it will already merge them so easily 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.590
 pass will not work because the plot 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.810
 revolves around the treacherous orcs who 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.730
 got hold of the terrible magic and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.370
 now turns the time like you 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.470
 take in your head and not to add hours to 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.470
 day 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.420
 in the common morgue zombie skeletons rebel 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.180
 other scum animals 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.670
 and strive to crawl out of the nearest 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.810
 pebbles 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.810
 hero how much in vain 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.409
 here we go to what 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.310
 the game stands apart gently and reverently 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:55.170
 love turn-based strategy as soon as you 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.060
 find yourself in a battle for each member 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.349
 skirmishes some quantity appears 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.739
 active points 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.420
 which can be spent in one move 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.790
 they spent literally everything well, even if 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.489
 he and eating potion from death on 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.450
 hits on special skills and here already 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.909
 will have to think 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.470
 because if you do not think that hello 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.470
 boot from last save 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.069
 It looks like a fight, and indeed any action 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.439
 everything is wonderful for me beautiful 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.930
 animated even the easiest reception 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.939
 accompanied by special effects ordinary 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.890
 the ice cone is represented by a dragon 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.019
 rendering mage and freezing 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.939
 an adversary of your cold breath 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.099
 when the battle ends and 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.099
 really feel yourself on the field 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.129
 traces of explosions scorched earth 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.950
 ice debris of summoned elementals 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.609
 on fractions marking the places of death and 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.030
 other 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.530
 and traces of slaughter remain forever 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.359
 very convenient then to navigate where 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.359
 there was no where 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.230
 to 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.540
 Role-playing games haven't done that for a long time. 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.180
 made original sin fascinating 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.489
 turn-based battles root system with 1000 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.830
 alone skill which is by no means for 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.510
 ticks 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.460
 lots of small details are all in place 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.140
 everything allows you to play such 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.870
 combinations that even a great combinator 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.440
 Ostap Bender will cry in the corner from 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.810
 envy 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.580
 that can do when they want to 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.100
 this i lech say goodbye to you and wish 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.500
 smooth passing with you was there and 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.160
 will eat humanoid dot py and reviews 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.460
 new games 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.460
 until
