00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
like 12 cards and sometimes they might

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.900 
like 12 cards and sometimes they might
be<00:02:33.750> boring<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.319> more<00:02:35.160> importantly<00:02:35.610> there

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
be boring and more importantly there

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
be boring and more importantly there
might<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.090> something<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.690> haven't
