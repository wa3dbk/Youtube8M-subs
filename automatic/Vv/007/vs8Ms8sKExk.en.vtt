are the dual loudspeakers on the front

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
are the dual loudspeakers on the front
so<00:00:57.930> above<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.440> below<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.680> display<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
so above and below the display and you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
so above and below the display and you
also<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.670> forward<00:01:00.629> facing<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.320> camera

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
about 1.2 megapixel on the top so you

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.969 
about 1.2 megapixel on the top so you
can<00:01:05.880> actually<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> phone<00:01:07.170> pad<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.560> and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.530 
which volume rocker and something which
looks<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.280> micro<00:01:56.610> SD<00:01:56.670> card<00:01:57.090> slot<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
looks like a micro SD card slot so

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940 
looks like a micro SD card slot so
that's<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.110> covered<00:01:58.320> so<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.770> actually

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that's not covered so you're actually

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.270 
that's not covered so you're actually
you<00:01:59.219> can<00:02:00.079> insert<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> microSD<00:02:01.619> card<00:02:02.009> slot<00:02:02.070> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
you can insert the microSD card slot and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.749 
you can insert the microSD card slot and
take<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.670> out<00:02:02.729> pop<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.180> very<00:02:03.360> easily<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
take it out pop it out very easily so

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.429 
take it out pop it out very easily so
there's<00:02:05.759> about<00:02:06.030> does<00:02:06.540> not<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.990> not<00:02:07.170> sure<00:02:07.320> how

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
there's about does not do not sure how

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.199 
there's about does not do not sure how
much<00:02:07.560> internal<00:02:08.009> storage<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.000> should<00:02:09.119> be

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
much internal storage think it should be

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.720 
much internal storage think it should be
about<00:02:09.300> 8<00:02:09.569> or<00:02:09.599> 16gb<00:02:10.110> but<00:02:10.920> it's<00:02:11.039> supposed<00:02:11.340> cards
