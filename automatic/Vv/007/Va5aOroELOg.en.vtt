that's been sized for the hook it'll be
my<00:02:54.480> legs<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:59.069> I've<00:02:59.190> noticed<00:02:59.430> anything<00:02:59.790> about

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
my legs and I've noticed anything about

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.330 
my legs and I've noticed anything about
ants<00:03:00.660> that<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.900> spent<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> lake<00:03:02.190> or

ants that are spent on a on a lake or

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.729 
ants that are spent on a on a lake or
something<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:03.330> twinkle<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:04.290> well<00:03:04.500> and

something they twinkle really well and

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.170 
something they twinkle really well and
that's<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.980> reason<00:03:05.310> for<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.519> peacock<00:03:05.970> curl

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that's the reason for the peacock curl

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.309 
that's the reason for the peacock curl
and<00:03:06.480> then<00:03:07.410> also<00:03:07.590> I'm<00:03:07.860> going<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.069> be<00:03:08.190> using

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:57.920 
in the middle and I'm going to fold it

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:04.320 
in the middle and I'm going to fold it
over<00:04:58.040> on<00:04:58.910> itself

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.050 

when<00:05:04.870> I<00:05:04.900> see<00:05:05.169> these<00:05:05.379> ants<00:05:05.770> laying<00:05:06.580> in<00:05:06.789> a<00:05:06.849> lake

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
when I see these ants laying in a lake

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.760 
when I see these ants laying in a lake
it<00:05:07.240> looks<00:05:07.449> like<00:05:07.599> they've<00:05:07.780> got<00:05:07.960> multiple<00:05:08.229> wings

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.740 
it looks like they've got multiple wings
autumn<00:05:09.639> and<00:05:09.819> the<00:05:11.430> their<00:05:12.430> wings<00:05:12.789> trap<00:05:13.300> them<00:05:13.539> in

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
autumn and the their wings trap them in

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.559 
autumn and the their wings trap them in
the<00:05:14.289> water<00:05:14.470> they<00:05:14.710> can't<00:05:14.949> get<00:05:15.099> loose<00:05:15.280> and<00:05:15.729> so<00:05:16.270> I

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
the water they can't get loose and so I

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.779 
the water they can't get loose and so I
really<00:05:17.080> like<00:05:17.259> the<00:05:17.409> medallion<00:05:17.860> cheating<00:05:18.220> it

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
really like the medallion cheating it

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:26.779 
really like the medallion cheating it
really<00:05:19.330> mimics<00:05:19.539> those<00:05:19.990> wings<00:05:20.289> really<00:05:20.560> well

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.700 

and<00:05:27.789> now<00:05:28.659> we're<00:05:28.840> going<00:05:28.930> to<00:05:28.990> do<00:05:29.080> is<00:05:29.169> hold<00:05:29.379> both

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
and now we're going to do is hold both

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.240 
and now we're going to do is hold both
pieces<00:05:30.099> of<00:05:31.050> medallion<00:05:32.050> sheeting<00:05:32.379> matched<00:05:32.919> up

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
pieces of medallion sheeting matched up

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.969 
pieces of medallion sheeting matched up
it's<00:05:33.580> best<00:05:33.879> can<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:34.449> then<00:05:35.199> create<00:05:35.620> a<00:05:35.650> little

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
it's best can and then create a little

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:49.660 
it's best can and then create a little
bit<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.310> a<00:05:36.370> crease<00:05:36.639> in<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:37.000> middle

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.850 

I'm<00:05:50.390> creating<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.870> crease<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:53.120> like<00:05:53.270> a

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
I'm creating that crease it's like a

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.610 
I'm creating that crease it's like a
mountain<00:05:54.860> fold<00:05:55.220> an<00:05:55.490> origami<00:05:55.580> but<00:05:56.240> just<00:05:56.450> a

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
mountain fold an origami but just a

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.860 
mountain fold an origami but just a
crease<00:05:57.620> as<00:05:57.770> you<00:05:57.920> can<00:05:58.070> see<00:05:58.510> I'm<00:05:59.510> going<00:05:59.660> to<00:05:59.750> take

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
crease as you can see I'm going to take

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.900 
crease as you can see I'm going to take
my<00:06:00.080> scissors<00:06:00.320> and<00:06:00.530> hold<00:06:00.890> it<00:06:01.040> flat<00:06:02.770> and<00:06:03.910> cut

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
my scissors and hold it flat and cut

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.940 
my scissors and hold it flat and cut
across<00:06:05.030> there<00:06:05.660> and<00:06:07.750> see<00:06:08.750> how<00:06:08.870> it<00:06:09.020> creates<00:06:09.590> the

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
across there and see how it creates the

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.950 
across there and see how it creates the
wings<00:06:12.190> and<00:06:13.190> that's<00:06:13.580> what<00:06:13.880> I<00:06:13.910> see<00:06:14.240> when<00:06:14.480> I<00:06:14.510> see<00:06:14.720> a

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
wings and that's what I see when I see a

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.340 
wings and that's what I see when I see a
trapped<00:06:16.120> ant<00:06:17.120> sitting<00:06:17.540> on<00:06:17.660> the<00:06:17.750> waters<00:06:18.170> those

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
trapped ant sitting on the waters those

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.530 
trapped ant sitting on the waters those
wings<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:19.010> I'm<00:06:19.070> hoping<00:06:19.610> even<00:06:19.850> when<00:06:20.120> they<00:06:20.240> land

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:20.540 
wings and I'm hoping even when they land

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.260 
wings and I'm hoping even when they land
though<00:06:20.870> they'll<00:06:21.290> flop<00:06:21.590> over<00:06:21.830> it<00:06:22.070> won't<00:06:22.190> be<00:06:22.490> you

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
though they'll flop over it won't be you

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.120 
though they'll flop over it won't be you
know<00:06:23.300> right-side<00:06:23.870> up<00:06:24.080> but<00:06:24.440> it<00:06:24.560> looks<00:06:24.770> just

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
know right-side up but it looks just

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:26.890 
know right-side up but it looks just
like<00:06:25.400> a<00:06:25.460> spent<00:06:25.880> ant<00:06:26.120> that's<00:06:26.270> been<00:06:26.540> blowing<00:06:26.750> off

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
like a spent ant that's been blowing off

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.860 
like a spent ant that's been blowing off
the<00:06:26.960> trees<00:06:27.320> into<00:06:27.500> the<00:06:27.710> lake

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.950 

a<00:06:34.900> little<00:06:35.650> dab<00:06:35.860> of<00:06:36.150> UV<00:06:37.150> resin<00:06:37.360> just<00:06:37.660> for<00:06:37.870> the

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 
a little dab of UV resin just for the

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.040 
a little dab of UV resin just for the
head<00:06:38.140> and<00:06:38.770> also<00:06:38.920> to<00:06:39.070> keep<00:06:39.880> the<00:06:40.090> threat<00:06:40.930> from

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
head and also to keep the threat from

00:06:41.050 --> 00:07:15.510 
head and also to keep the threat from
going<00:06:41.380> anywhere

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.580
