00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
there for the other one beside the chip

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
there for the other one beside the chip
there<00:00:43.200> there's<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.430> cartridge<00:00:45.149> case<00:00:45.390> there

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
there there's the cartridge case there

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.150 
there there's the cartridge case there
and<00:00:45.930> there<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> here<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:49.010> here<00:00:50.010> is

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and there and here is where the here is

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
and there and here is where the here is
where<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> power<00:00:50.579> port<00:00:50.910> would<00:00:51.180> have<00:00:51.329> been<00:00:51.539> but

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
where the power port would have been but

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260 
where the power port would have been but
already<00:00:52.260> soldered<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.219> two<00:00:53.399> pieces<00:00:53.789> off

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
already soldered it the two pieces off

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.020 
already soldered it the two pieces off
of<00:00:54.300> here<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.280> here<00:00:57.829> so<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.640> new<00:00:59.820> one

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
of here and here so when I get a new one

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.049 
of here and here so when I get a new one
I<00:01:00.239> apply<00:01:00.449> solder<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:01.559> new<00:01:01.770> one<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.760> again

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
I apply solder the new one to here again

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.100 
I apply solder the new one to here again
and<00:01:03.589> here<00:01:04.589> again<00:01:04.739> now<00:01:05.510> you<00:01:06.510> also<00:01:06.750> want<00:01:06.930> to

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
and here again now you also want to

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.830 
and here again now you also want to
solder<00:01:07.760> why<00:01:08.760> believe<00:01:09.240> you're<00:01:09.360> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.659> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
solder why believe you're going to so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.310 
solder why believe you're going to so
during<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> two<00:01:10.590> little<00:01:11.479> other<00:01:12.479> pieces<00:01:12.810> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
during the two little other pieces to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.080 
during the two little other pieces to
here<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.360> you'll<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.780> on<00:01:17.090> my

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
here and here and you'll see it on my

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.410 
here and here and you'll see it on my
friends<00:01:18.540> sons<00:01:18.810> totally<00:01:20.060> destroyed<00:01:21.060> power

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
friends sons totally destroyed power

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:29.749 
friends sons totally destroyed power
port<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:25.799> can<00:01:25.950> see<00:01:27.950> here<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.520> right

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
port you can see here you can see right

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.560 
port you can see here you can see right
there<00:01:29.820> there<00:01:30.470> on<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:32.369> end<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.000> where

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
there there on the end of that is where

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.420 
there there on the end of that is where
the<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:34.020> go<00:01:34.200> solder<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.310> wood

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the you go solder and that actually wood

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.240 
the you go solder and that actually wood
was<00:01:35.670> sitting<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:37.530> top<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:40.250> piece

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
was sitting down on top of the piece

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.370 
was sitting down on top of the piece
right<00:01:41.520> there<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> gold

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
right there and then you had the gold

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.399 
right there and then you had the gold
contact<00:01:44.450> which<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.630> guess<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
contact which I guess if you put it on a

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.469 
contact which I guess if you put it on a
charging<00:01:47.040> dock<00:01:47.250> would<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.610> been<00:01:47.729> we<00:01:48.299> touch

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
charging dock would have been we touch

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.550 
charging dock would have been we touch
the<00:01:48.630> charging<00:01:49.020> dock<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.320> charge<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.649> battery

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the charging dock and charge the battery

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.749 
the charging dock and charge the battery
this<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.860> piece<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.250> referring<00:01:53.610> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this is the piece I was referring to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.420 
this is the piece I was referring to
part<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> charging<00:01:54.750> port<00:01:54.869> that's

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
part of the charging port that's

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.580 
part of the charging port that's
surrounded<00:01:56.430> by<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.579> bracket<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:58.759> has<00:01:59.759> two

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
surrounded by the bracket and has two

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.569 
surrounded by the bracket and has two
probably<00:02:01.590> positive<00:02:02.040> negative<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
probably positive negative and that

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.889 
probably positive negative and that
actually<00:02:03.079> probably<00:02:04.079> solder<00:02:04.560> right<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.899> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
actually probably solder right in to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.229 
actually probably solder right in to
here<00:02:07.290> again<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:11.160> probably<00:02:11.489> also<00:02:11.849> charged

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
here again and the probably also charged

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.670 
here again and the probably also charged
the<00:02:12.450> battery<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.900> way

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the battery that way

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.770 
the battery that way
but<00:02:13.799> when<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:14.969> power<00:02:15.180> port<00:02:15.420> then<00:02:15.659> we'll

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
but when I get the power port then we'll

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.920 
but when I get the power port then we'll
do<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:17.150> I'm<00:02:18.150> waiting<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.599> to<00:02:18.780> come

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
do that so I'm waiting for that to come

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.420 
do that so I'm waiting for that to come
in<00:02:19.079> right<00:02:19.260> now<00:02:19.439> so<00:02:19.769> hopefully<00:02:22.069> that<00:02:23.069> isn't<00:02:23.340> too

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
in right now so hopefully that isn't too

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.630 
in right now so hopefully that isn't too
hard<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.640> solder<00:02:23.879> back<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.099> always<00:02:26.489> had

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
hard to solder back in so I always had

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.130 
hard to solder back in so I always had
got<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.849> new<00:02:27.000> piece<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:27.299> looks<00:02:27.810> like<00:02:27.930> that

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
got the new piece that looks like that

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.690 
got the new piece that looks like that
and<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.409> was<00:02:28.500> able<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.799> kind<00:02:29.129> of<00:02:29.159> solder<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.640> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
and I was able to kind of solder it it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.890 
and I was able to kind of solder it it
looks<00:02:29.909> like<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.090> burned<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.629> I<00:02:30.659> don't<00:02:30.810> know

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
looks like I burned it I don't know

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.990 
looks like I burned it I don't know
whether<00:02:31.049> it<00:02:31.139> burned<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:32.129> solder<00:02:32.430> or<00:02:32.609> not<00:02:32.760> but

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
whether it burned the solder or not but

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.179 
whether it burned the solder or not but
just<00:02:33.030> probably<00:02:33.870> too<00:02:34.139> hot<00:02:34.409> for<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.680> solder<00:02:34.920> but

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
just probably too hot for the solder but

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.979 
just probably too hot for the solder but
I<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.969> able<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> solder<00:02:36.420> there<00:02:36.659> are<00:02:36.750> six

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
I was able to solder there are six

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.479 
I was able to solder there are six
points<00:02:37.260> now<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:37.889> this<00:02:38.819> power<00:02:39.810> port<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.489> you

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
points now with this power port and you

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.490 
points now with this power port and you
kind<00:02:41.819> of<00:02:41.879> want<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> flush<00:02:43.230> there's<00:02:43.439> a

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
kind of want to have a flush there's a

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.699 
kind of want to have a flush there's a
little<00:02:43.739> ledge<00:02:44.489> right<00:02:45.260> there<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.349> I<00:02:46.439> can<00:02:46.620> see

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
little ledge right there and I can see

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:47.960 
little ledge right there and I can see
at<00:02:46.889> lids<00:02:47.129> you<00:02:47.310> want<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.519> have<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:47.730> flush<00:02:47.939> with

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
at lids you want to have it flush with

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.089 
at lids you want to have it flush with
that<00:02:48.209> ledge<00:02:48.450> when<00:02:49.139> I<00:02:49.200> first<00:02:49.470> started<00:02:49.829> today<00:02:50.069> I

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
that ledge when I first started today I

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.640 
that ledge when I first started today I
kind<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.489> was<00:02:50.870> didn't<00:02:51.870> have<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.079> had<00:02:52.500> an

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
kind of was didn't have it had an

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.789 
kind of was didn't have it had an
overhang<00:02:53.099> that<00:02:53.129> and<00:02:53.519> couldn't<00:02:54.329> get<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.799> back

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
overhang that and couldn't get the back

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.399 
overhang that and couldn't get the back
back<00:02:56.069> on<00:02:56.510> initially<00:02:57.510> but<00:02:57.689> eventually<00:02:57.989> I<00:02:58.200> kind

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
back on initially but eventually I kind

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.490 
back on initially but eventually I kind
of<00:02:58.909> soldered<00:02:59.909> it<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.239> got<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.169> melt<00:03:01.379> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
of soldered it and got it to melt and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.830 
of soldered it and got it to melt and
then<00:03:01.560> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> wiggled<00:03:02.700> it<00:03:02.790> back<00:03:03.120> further<00:03:03.450> so

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
then kind of wiggled it back further so

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.429 
then kind of wiggled it back further so
I<00:03:03.870> could<00:03:04.200> get<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.439> back<00:03:04.889> on<00:03:05.129> the<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:09.019> 3ds<00:03:10.019> and

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
I could get the back on the the 3ds and

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.339 
I could get the back on the the 3ds and
then<00:03:11.040> I<00:03:11.069> was<00:03:11.310> well<00:03:11.669> before<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.269> did<00:03:12.450> that<00:03:12.599> you

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
then I was well before I did that you

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.690 
then I was well before I did that you
want<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.650> plug<00:03:13.859> it<00:03:14.010> in<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.280> check<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.579> make

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
want to plug it in and check to make

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.059 
want to plug it in and check to make
sure<00:03:14.760> at<00:03:14.939> least<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.329> orange<00:03:15.900> power<00:03:16.769> light

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
sure at least the orange power light

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:18.530 
sure at least the orange power light
lights<00:03:17.310> up<00:03:17.459> it'll<00:03:17.760> light<00:03:17.909> up<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:18.120> about<00:03:18.269> three

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
lights up it'll light up for about three

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.469 
lights up it'll light up for about three
seconds<00:03:19.159> or<00:03:20.159> four<00:03:20.430> seconds<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:20.940> then<00:03:21.060> go<00:03:21.269> out

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
seconds or four seconds and then go out

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.530 
seconds or four seconds and then go out
because<00:03:22.379> I<00:03:22.409> think<00:03:23.040> there's<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.359> safety<00:03:24.359> in<00:03:24.449> it

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
because I think there's a safety in it

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.599 
because I think there's a safety in it
that<00:03:24.659> if<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> doesn't<00:03:25.109> find<00:03:25.260> a<00:03:25.379> battery<00:03:25.650> it'll

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
that if it doesn't find a battery it'll

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:29.929 
that if it doesn't find a battery it'll
it<00:03:26.699> shuts<00:03:26.879> itself<00:03:27.120> off<00:03:27.359> or<00:03:28.400> or<00:03:29.400> something<00:03:29.639> else

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:29.939 
it shuts itself off or or something else

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:34.369 
it shuts itself off or or something else
so<00:03:31.939> you<00:03:32.939> just<00:03:33.150> see<00:03:33.329> that<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.780> what<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.169> want<00:03:34.319> to

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
so you just see that so what you want to

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:36.559 
so you just see that so what you want to
do<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.430> backing<00:03:35.790> on<00:03:35.909> now<00:03:36.090> remember<00:03:36.419> to

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
do is put the backing on now remember to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.580 
do is put the backing on now remember to
attach<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.199> two<00:03:37.349> Clips<00:03:37.739> here<00:03:38.040> there<00:03:38.909> and<00:03:39.590> your

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
attach the two Clips here there and your

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.830 
attach the two Clips here there and your
seal<00:03:40.739> went<00:03:40.919> away<00:03:40.979> over<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:41.729> right<00:03:42.569> there

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
seal went away over here right there

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.129 
seal went away over here right there
okay<00:03:43.349> now<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:44.310> can<00:03:44.430> see<00:03:44.759> I've<00:03:45.000> got<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.269> cover

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
okay now you can see I've got the cover

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.179 
okay now you can see I've got the cover
back<00:03:46.379> on<00:03:46.650> here<00:03:47.040> and<00:03:47.930> the<00:03:48.930> power<00:03:49.139> ports<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
back on here and the power ports you

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.770 
back on here and the power ports you
know<00:03:50.340> in<00:03:51.049> it's<00:03:52.049> not<00:03:52.290> perfect<00:03:52.919> obviously<00:03:53.819> it's

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
know in it's not perfect obviously it's

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:55.999 
know in it's not perfect obviously it's
not<00:03:54.870> going<00:03:55.019> to<00:03:55.079> be<00:03:55.169> like<00:03:55.290> factory<00:03:55.650> condition

00:03:55.999 --> 00:03:56.009 
not going to be like factory condition

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:57.439 
not going to be like factory condition
but<00:03:56.129> at<00:03:56.250> least<00:03:56.340> it's<00:03:56.549> functional<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.329> the

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:57.449 
but at least it's functional to the

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:59.300 
but at least it's functional to the
point<00:03:57.689> and<00:03:57.930> you<00:03:58.530> can<00:03:58.650> kind<00:03:58.799> of<00:03:58.859> see<00:03:59.009> it's<00:03:59.129> like

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
point and you can kind of see it's like

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.439 
point and you can kind of see it's like
kind<00:03:59.489> of<00:03:59.629> not<00:04:00.629> equal<00:04:01.439> to<00:04:01.590> spacing<00:04:01.859> around<00:04:02.449> the

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
kind of not equal to spacing around the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:10.569 
kind of not equal to spacing around the
power<00:04:03.659> ports<00:04:04.049> not<00:04:04.229> completely<00:04:05.810> symmetrical

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.249 

comparatively<00:04:11.579> but<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.900> know<00:04:12.989> you<00:04:13.079> should<00:04:13.229> be

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:13.259 
comparatively but you know you should be

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.689 
comparatively but you know you should be
able<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:13.439> plug<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.709> in<00:04:13.799> at<00:04:13.919> least<00:04:14.220> have<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.519> work

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
able to plug it in at least have it work

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.689 
able to plug it in at least have it work
now<00:04:15.659> you<00:04:15.720> want<00:04:15.959> to<00:04:15.989> obviously<00:04:16.650> put<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.979> screws

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
now you want to obviously put the screws

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.279 
now you want to obviously put the screws
back<00:04:17.789> in<00:04:18.060> there's<00:04:18.239> one<00:04:18.419> central<00:04:18.840> one<00:04:19.019> right

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
back in there's one central one right

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.009 
back in there's one central one right
where<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.829> game<00:04:20.220> cartridge<00:04:20.699> gives<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.269> your

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
where the game cartridge gives and your

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.000 
where the game cartridge gives and your
other<00:04:22.200> ones<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.590> you<00:04:22.680> took<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:22.979> earlier

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
other ones that you took out earlier

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.290 
other ones that you took out earlier
also<00:04:23.639> put<00:04:23.789> the<00:04:23.880> battery<00:04:24.180> back<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.590> okay

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
also put the battery back in okay

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.300 
also put the battery back in okay
I'll<00:04:28.050> do<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.470> now

thing
so<00:05:27.120> it's<00:05:27.270> charging<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:28.470> battery<00:05:28.830> here<00:05:29.240> now

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
so it's charging the battery here now

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.210 
so it's charging the battery here now
all<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.140> have<00:05:31.170> to<00:05:31.290> do<00:05:31.380> is<00:05:31.470> put<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.680> backing<00:05:32.070> on

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
all you have to do is put the backing on

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.670 
all you have to do is put the backing on
okay<00:05:33.180> don't<00:05:33.960> forget<00:05:34.170> there's<00:05:34.320> as<00:05:34.440> little

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
okay don't forget there's as little

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.440 
okay don't forget there's as little
sliding<00:05:35.250> tabs<00:05:35.640> in<00:05:35.790> the<00:05:35.850> back<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.180> you<00:05:36.240> have<00:05:36.360> to

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
sliding tabs in the back so you have to

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.960 
sliding tabs in the back so you have to
put<00:05:36.570> this<00:05:36.810> part<00:05:37.140> in<00:05:37.230> first<00:05:37.590> and<00:05:37.880> just<00:05:38.880> so<00:05:38.940> I

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:38.970 
put this part in first and just so I

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.550 
put this part in first and just so I
didn't<00:05:39.180> leave<00:05:39.300> the<00:05:39.450> screws<00:05:39.750> I<00:05:39.960> kind<00:05:40.200> of<00:05:40.230> left

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
didn't leave the screws I kind of left

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.130 
didn't leave the screws I kind of left
them<00:05:40.770> inside<00:05:41.040> decay<00:05:41.760> inside<00:05:42.060> the<00:05:42.510> plastic

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
them inside decay inside the plastic

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.810 
them inside decay inside the plastic
backing<00:05:43.530> here<00:05:43.970> so<00:05:46.460> they<00:05:47.460> wouldn't<00:05:47.640> go

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
backing here so they wouldn't go

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.810 
backing here so they wouldn't go
anywhere<00:05:48.180> since<00:05:48.600> they're<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:48.900> small<00:05:49.170> and

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
anywhere since they're so small and

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.650 
anywhere since they're so small and
basically<00:05:50.820> we'll<00:05:50.910> put<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.270> on<00:05:51.330> here<00:05:51.900> okay<00:05:53.660> in

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
basically we'll put that on here okay in

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:00.390 
basically we'll put that on here okay in
fact<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.170> might<00:05:55.440> try<00:05:55.770> to<00:05:55.860> do<00:05:56.130> it

God and I believe it's charging I hope
that's<00:06:33.200> a<00:06:33.290> charging<00:06:33.620> symbol<00:06:34.000> yeah<00:06:36.100> uh<00:06:37.630> uh<00:06:38.630> you

that's a charging symbol yeah uh uh you
know<00:06:39.200> I<00:06:40.330> forgot<00:06:41.330> to<00:06:41.450> check<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:41.900> see<00:06:42.050> what<00:06:42.170> I

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.200 
know I forgot to check to see what I

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.450 
know I forgot to check to see what I
wanted<00:06:42.590> to<00:06:42.710> know<00:06:42.800> what<00:06:43.010> I<00:06:43.040> look<00:06:43.160> like<00:06:43.220> when

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
it's charging but I'm guessing the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.090 
it's charging but I'm guessing the
blinking<00:06:45.350> thing<00:06:45.500> means<00:06:45.740> it's<00:06:45.920> charging<00:06:48.100> we'll

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.100 
blinking thing means it's charging we'll

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.890 
blinking thing means it's charging we'll
see<00:06:49.370> when<00:06:49.910> after<00:06:50.180> I<00:06:50.210> charge<00:06:50.480> it<00:06:50.570> for<00:06:50.690> a<00:06:50.750> little

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
see when after I charge it for a little

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:57.220 
see when after I charge it for a little
bit<00:06:51.160> and<00:06:52.690> see<00:06:53.690> if<00:06:53.780> it<00:06:53.870> works<00:06:54.220> so
