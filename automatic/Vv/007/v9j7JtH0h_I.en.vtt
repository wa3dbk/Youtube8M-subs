00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello and welcome to this 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.759
 new edition of what things you do today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.400
 together super delicious airy easy 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.410
 light vegan apple pancakes and 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.809
 this even without white sugar only 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:18.750
 sweetened with dates nothing tells going on 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:21.150
 It's the seat you need prescription 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.250
 the following ingredients should be added 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.050
 he was born or you have to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.550
 absolutely right at the beginning 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.320
 you do not enter so that afterwards 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.689
 forget as it happened to me as 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.640
 I then shot this video 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.579
 you need 80 milliliters of water around you 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.579
 dates to soft then angle 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.670
 or wheat flour buckwheat flour big 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.989
 apples 500 milliliters of mineral water at 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.940
 best with carbonated so the whole 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.850
 really so airy easy becomes easy 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.180
 then a pinch of rock salt something 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 vanilla and or cinnamon powder like and oil 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.940
 around the whole course later in the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.890
 pan to bake 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 Here then just start with that you 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.359
 30 minutes in the dates in the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 soak in water and then work together with 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.769
 the soaking water should be pureed 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.659
 I think that the stone must be pitted 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.890
 We can not say it often enough 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.780
 that actually happened 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.900
 when I shot this video here 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.450
 then you have to forget that 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.770
 just this mass along with the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 flour and the mineral water in one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.580
 big bowl gives then also the 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.200
 salt rock and if you 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.000
 I want to go here now 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 for example, change powder because I do that 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.200
 just think super delicious and so 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.990
 whole crazy then really good 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.290
 together and then reread 30 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.000
 covered for a few minutes because of the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.579
 the flours should stop then 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.439
 really dissolve really well and 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.119
 soak with the water and afterwards 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.350
 then you had your finished dough the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.299
 should be really nice from the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.850
 consistency be relatively fluid 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.000
 bit sticky and then you can 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.740
 then heat in the pan and in it 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.060
 unpack natures natures 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.340
 I always do that so that I 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.310
 like a ladle full of that 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.260
 participants and then purely afterwards the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.140
 apple slices 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.450
 so draped and then all around with it 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.800
 3 because then we stop baking like that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.600
 do not fly apart 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.350
 and the whole thing is so relatively good 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.510
 turn around 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.180
 yes and that was already the recipe 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.070
 super easy super tasty that really 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.630
 not an absolute favorite recipe if it is 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.580
 you can go to pancakes then 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.680
 Of course, other fruits too 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.240
 So once you can go through there 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.550
 bananas, for example, also replace the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.140
 her so little man to sweeten the whole thing 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.420
 and to give the whole thing such a bond 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.660
 or you take banana slices instead of the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.760
 Apple slices as a fruit insert or 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.380
 the all kinds of strawberries 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.050
 raspberries blueberries or something like that 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.700
 definitely on super I have now once 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.500
 I tried because it will be season 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.570
 starts now soon first years 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.340
 at least for strawberries that he himself 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.040
 but definitely also test again 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.320
 otherwise this recipe is here 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.180
 pink picked up two weeks ago and wanted 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.570
 one of the veggie days i believe that 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.580
 he or she had written halo rubber 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.610
 you can not quite say that from the name 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.010
 rauslesen if I get ready and 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.370
 What can not imagine a recipe is hard 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.090
 will and will not dry and so and so 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.250
 I have done well here now 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.180
 really my absolute favorite recipe 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.700
 for pancakes 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.410
