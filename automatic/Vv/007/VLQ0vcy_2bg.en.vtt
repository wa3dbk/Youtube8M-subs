00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.570
 so people have a test that gets a 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.490
 time to post videos on the channel but 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.650
 now I came back and impunity this time with 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.240
 channel slightly different in a name to 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 We had to change some of our lives. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.010
 complications and copyright 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.990
 but this story is for another video 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 so guys after I posted the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.579
 video I went up the streets to want a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.980
 guys came to me and asked me 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.059
 to post about the allowed ones in their 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.160
 talents 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.340
 so I decided to post it to you, no 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.410
 have afterwards let's go there the information 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 besides those two that surpassed to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 You can now easily be 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.120
 used in those champions in which this 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.079
 touch of magic here for you all 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.719
 magicians 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.109
 they can be used for these 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.050
 champions team produced 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.879
 so guys get together in the sales system 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.689
 which uses a system of a simple 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:10.020
 agent counts in the quarters with penetration 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.810
 magic that is in the seals we count 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 where the armor is in the books that the 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 magical existence you may be 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.020
 placing one of the clips 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.720
 separately from three magic defense 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.210
 18 is also feasible 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.700
 here in the fifth and sciences we sing 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.290

 I totally promised that I 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.890
 should be as simple as possible. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.020
 you can see is 21 power and ability 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:45.110

 The Dangerous Game Spread With 11 Strokes 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.409
 devastating and defensive we do not put 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.290
 nothing because they are already enough 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.439
 balanced and here we will put 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.630

 are the same already allowed team is not the 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.190
 most correct way of using it but it is a 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.980
 a good and balanced way for those who 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.470
