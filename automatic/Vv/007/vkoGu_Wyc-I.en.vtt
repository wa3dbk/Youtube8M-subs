00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 Hello friends, how are you? 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.420
 mood personally I woke up with today 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.730
 thought in my head what to do 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.380
 I do not know what this is about, but I decided 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.750
 today jailbreak is not your iphone and 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.490
 thought why not show you how 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 do it so what's the video today 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.260
 dedicated jailbreak ios 8.1 interesting 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.260
 but kate then drove 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.350
 so just recently and i said 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.330
 unexpectedly for many 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.420
 jailbreak that is capable 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.760
 hack with 81 by the way remember that people 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.460
 shouted would not be like more all the hotels 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.790
 blocked off how to prevent jail and so 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.530
 further and the like and there friends jail 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.720
 there is or is it installed by the way not 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.730
 harder previous I think it is worth voicing 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.100
 device supporting this 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:03.710
 the procedure is iphone 4s 5 5 5 6 6 + 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.680
 ipad mini mini mini 3i 2 2 3 4 2 and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 of course ipod touch of the fifth generation 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.490
 by the way honestly i was a little 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.860
 surprised that such an old man what by 2 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.140
 still holding onto the market this is what he 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.660
 jailbreak is supported very cool 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.869
 ok let's continue everything you need 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.670
 download pangu 1.1 on your computer 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.009
 this program will help you 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.500
 create a link to it I 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.020
 leave in the description under the video and so 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.060
 downloaded now click on the program 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.060
 right-click and open on behalf of 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.400
 admin if everything is open means 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.810
 so far everything is going smart but before 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.450
 start jailbreak is worth doing 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.119
 The following things to start go to 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.310
 settings of your device menu touch id and 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.560
 password on and off and password protected 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.040
 gadget after jailbreak without 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.150
 problems return 2 fad it needs 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.090
 open settings 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:00.320
 then aiklaud and find fad find 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.979
 iphone or iphone fan so here it is too 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.200
 need to turn it off let's do another 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.780
 process to switch the device to airplane mode 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.580
 well, the last is perhaps the most important thing 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.310
 please make a backup 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.130
 flashing the device for if suddenly 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.350
 something goes wrong and it could be 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.269
 then without any problems you can 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.420
 restore device or backup 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:25.549
 and everything will be fine Well now you can 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.549
 connect firmware and device to computer 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:31.070
 Through yusb cord pangu must find the device 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.560
 it looks something like this 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.690
 if ready you can safely click on 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.060
 jailbreak start button 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.270
 just reminds you what to do 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.130
 backup copy 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.320
 before the process switch the device to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.100
 airplane mode since we already did it 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.860
 You can safely click and regedit and wait 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.300
 the process has begun it seems to me today 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.550
 day jailbreak does not cause such 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.160
 delight as would cause about a couple 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.410
 years ago all these tweaks hacking 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.660
 got rid of myself of course I understand that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.740
 mainstream wanting to install 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.440
 jail for piracy 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.930
 but the developers also do not sit still i 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.270
 I mean that the games on the appstore shelves 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.370
 or almost all free programs 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.860
 but it contains in-app purchases 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.590
 all sorts of syncs with and palladium and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.050
 so on and so forth it's your 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.030
 kind of know the game alone trying to do 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.190
 your content so that nobody 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.280
 hacked nobody stole others the opposite 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.260
 such answers know pirates who 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.160
 would rather peck on clave scribble 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.710
 some codes 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.050
 looking for ways to hack than to spend 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.010
 miserable 30 60 rubles for the efforts 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.900
 developer 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.810
 I think it will always happen 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.720
 and here comes the end of the iphone process 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.560
 reboots 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.709
 ok reboot now looking for icon 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.900
 sitting here she and click on her now 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.600
 She upload all files and actually on 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.350
 This whole procedure is finished the process on 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.660
 really 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.500
 dreadfully simple there is absolutely nothing 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.420
 complex 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.920
 then you can do something for what you 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.080
 actually bother data 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.570
 process pumping your device 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.750
 tvikami or download pirated content 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.530
 until conscience tortures you on on this 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.810
 perhaps all 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.940
 if the video was somehow useful to you 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.190
 subscribe to the channel will be very you 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.709
 thankful if there are questions then 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.239
 write to the group vkontakte I will 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.400
 I will help with all I can 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.280
 All links I leave in the description under this 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.590
 video good luck with you all thank you 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.720
 and pokeda more pumped your character 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.569
 the more likely that you can 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.270
 go further than your friends 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.669
 there is certainly no specific goal 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.589
 as in many games of this genre but 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.139
 it didn't stop me from enjoying the game 

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:48.330
 You know, I've been playing 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.429
 games of this genre and began to notice for 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.999
 that I nafig did not give up cool 

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:52.999
 heaped
