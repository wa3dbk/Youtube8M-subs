00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
here we can actually have aircraft if we

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.690 
here we can actually have aircraft if we
want<00:02:08.149> to<00:02:08.240> our<00:02:08.810> goal<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.350> to<00:02:09.530> build<00:02:09.770> out<00:02:10.100> this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
want to our goal is to build out this

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.840 
want to our goal is to build out this
entire<00:02:11.110> massive<00:02:12.110> massive<00:02:12.440> world<00:02:13.250> that's<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
fighting for survival we have base

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.300 
fighting for survival we have base
building<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.470> game<00:02:24.740> is<00:02:24.920> going<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:25.190> be

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
building and this game is going to be

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.400 
building and this game is going to be
our<00:02:26.209> first<00:02:26.510> game<00:02:26.720> that<00:02:26.900> we're<00:02:27.020> putting<00:02:27.200> out

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
our first game that we're putting out

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.699 
our first game that we're putting out
that<00:02:28.040> we<00:02:28.190> call<00:02:28.370> with<00:02:28.490> emergent<00:02:28.970> AI<00:02:29.090> where<00:02:29.959> the

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
that we call with emergent AI where the

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.699 
that we call with emergent AI where the
zombies<00:02:31.190> themselves<00:02:31.820> have<00:02:32.530> their<00:02:33.530> own

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
zombies themselves have their own

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.040 
zombies themselves have their own
individually<00:02:34.700> either<00:02:34.910> not<00:02:35.209> they're<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:35.840> on

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
individually either not they're not on

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.479 
individually either not they're not on
some<00:02:36.230> free<00:02:36.380> program<00:02:36.680> script<00:02:37.040> they<00:02:37.130> actually

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
some free program script they actually

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.630 
some free program script they actually
think<00:02:37.640> for<00:02:37.820> themselves<00:02:37.970> now<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.520> it's

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
think for themselves now this so it's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.220 
think for themselves now this so it's
not<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.850> same<00:02:41.030> experience<00:02:41.480> over<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:41.810> over<00:02:41.900> oh

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
not the same experience over and over oh

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.050 
not the same experience over and over oh
no<00:02:42.530> no<00:02:42.680> you<00:02:42.830> know<00:02:42.950> it's<00:02:42.980> radically<00:02:43.760> different

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
no no you know it's radically different

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.759 
no no you know it's radically different
you<00:02:44.180> can<00:02:44.330> loot<00:02:44.510> stores<00:02:44.900> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.320> you<00:02:45.620> know<00:02:45.709> you

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
you can loot stores you can you know you

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.890 
you can loot stores you can you know you
can<00:02:46.100> build<00:02:46.400> fortresses<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:47.360> you're<00:02:47.510> seeing

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
can build fortresses what you're seeing

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.390 
can build fortresses what you're seeing
in<00:02:48.170> some<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.530> these<00:02:48.590> other<00:02:48.769> survival<00:02:49.250> games

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
in some of these other survival games

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.340 
in some of these other survival games
taken<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:49.940> the<00:02:50.060> next<00:02:50.180> level<00:02:50.360> because<00:02:50.930> we<00:02:51.200> have

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
taken to the next level because we have

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.930 
taken to the next level because we have
an<00:02:51.620> engine<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:52.040> can<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.489> outperform

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
an engine that can just outperform

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.750 
an engine that can just outperform
anything<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:54.500> that<00:02:54.800> I've<00:02:54.890> seen<00:02:55.160> in<00:02:55.370> these

anything that that I've seen in these
other<00:02:55.940> games<00:02:56.209> we're<00:02:56.600> a<00:02:56.630> milestone<00:02:56.870> away<00:02:57.230> right

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
other games we're a milestone away right

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.870 
other games we're a milestone away right
now<00:02:57.440> from<00:02:57.860> a<00:02:57.920> whole<00:02:58.040> bunch<00:02:58.220> more<00:02:58.370> zombies<00:02:58.760> and
