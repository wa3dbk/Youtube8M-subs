00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
these these impacts in the way that we

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.389 
these these impacts in the way that we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
feel on our energy levels in fact a pH

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.479 
feel on our energy levels in fact a pH
that<00:00:35.640> drops<00:00:35.940> down<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.540> approximately<00:00:37.010> 6.9<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
that drops down to approximately 6.9 you

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.490 
that drops down to approximately 6.9 you
would<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.760> into<00:00:39.149> cardiac<00:00:39.540> arrest<00:00:39.809> so<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
would go into cardiac arrest so it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.229 
would go into cardiac arrest so it
doesn't<00:00:40.739> have<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> move<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.059> body

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
doesn't have to move much so the body

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.410 
doesn't have to move much so the body
does<00:00:42.510> everything<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.649> can<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.399> maintain<00:00:44.940> that

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
does everything it can to maintain that

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.150 
does everything it can to maintain that
delicate<00:00:45.870> balance<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> most

delicate balance one of the most

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.850 
delicate balance one of the most
important<00:00:47.730> things<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:49.079> do<00:00:49.350> to

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
important things that one can do to

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.549 
important things that one can do to
begin<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> process<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:51.469> neutralizing<00:00:52.469> the

foods wheat and also for metabolism is
the<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:01.140> important<00:01:01.680> thing<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.829> we<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.160> do

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
the most important thing that we can do

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.270 
the most important thing that we can do
is<00:01:02.370> start<00:01:02.579> changing<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> water<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:05.100> we're

is start changing the water that we're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.789 
is start changing the water that we're
drinking<00:01:05.390> that<00:01:06.390> water<00:01:06.689> has<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.710> an

water and it's got to be void of of

elements that are going to be acidifying

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.780 
elements that are going to be acidifying
and<00:01:30.869> contribute<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:31.890> congestion<00:01:32.400> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
and contribute to more congestion and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.480 
and contribute to more congestion and
breakdown<00:01:33.479> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.659> body<00:01:33.900> so<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.590> need<00:01:34.829> pure

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
breakdown on the body so we need pure

breakdown on the body so we need pure
water<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.150> water<00:01:36.360> has<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.840> filtered<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
has to be energized we have to increase

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
has to be energized we have to increase
its<00:01:40.079> electrical<00:01:40.590> potential<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.729> need<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
its electrical potential we need to

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.969 
its electrical potential we need to
break<00:01:42.600> down<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.899> clustering<00:01:43.470> effect<00:01:43.829> which

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
break down the clustering effect which

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
break down the clustering effect which
is<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.189> simple<00:01:44.729> when<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.970> remove<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.479> acid

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
is very simple when we remove the acid

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.899 
is very simple when we remove the acid
because<00:01:46.200> what<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.920> said<00:01:47.100> earlier<00:01:47.369> acid

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
because what as I said earlier acid

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.090 
because what as I said earlier acid
causes<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.750> molecules<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.470> water<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.860> stick

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
causes the molecules of water to stick

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.179 
causes the molecules of water to stick
together<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:51.570> can<00:01:51.600> break<00:01:52.020> those<00:01:52.259> down<00:01:52.320> into

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
together we can break those down into

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.789 
together we can break those down into
smaller<00:01:53.729> molecular<00:01:54.420> States<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.439> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
smaller molecular States so that the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.450 
smaller molecular States so that the
water<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.549> wetter<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.570> we're<00:01:57.750> looking<00:01:58.020> for

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
water is wetter so we're looking for

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
water is wetter so we're looking for
more<00:01:59.460> bioavailable<00:02:00.090> water<00:02:00.719> water<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
more bioavailable water water that can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.820 
more bioavailable water water that can
permeate<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:02.070> cell<00:02:02.310> membranes
