 in Argentina as in Chile with 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.640

 maximiliano staiman who did all the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.820
 I traveled the last stage of the 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.470

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.599
 [Music] 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.409
 here on the banks of the parana the city ​​of 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.750
 final deck for this dakar 2015 a 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.269
 competition that eluded the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.689
 Argentine pilots since only one and 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.060
 we talk about the young pilot Jeremiah 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.810
 Gonzalez was able to get on the podium in 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 ATVs 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.230
 I worked all year round throughout the year to 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.549
 we can do that so it's very, very 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.819
 the winner of the test in four and 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:09.769
 century finally was the Polish sonik and 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:14.560
 your demanding demanding in there were 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:18.709
 the moment like install web world 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.799
 almost stop believing the weekend stream 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:24.709
 on moto2 nothing changed at the top and the 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.030
 triumph was again for the pilot 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.890
 Spanish marc eat 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.620
 in the truck category still 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.840
 sending the Russians in this opportunity 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.500
 the winner was weaker than ever 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.050
 more in cars the triumph was for the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.959
 Qatari Prince will be born of the threshing 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.990
 but with good representation of the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.890
 Argentine pilots in this category 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.890
 armstrong 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.010
 of fantastic people time for everybody 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.190
 that's why it makes me a good balance 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.500
 know where 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.630
 we are fine where we are wrong which 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.480
 the mistakes have been the successes and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:11.600
 we have 11 months to work and the idea 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.090
 is to reach at least 10% stronger than 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.250
 we know that at that level it will cost 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.680
 reaching the topic if you talk about 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.650
 mistakes but I miss a stone 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.660
 on the road that breaks you and delays six 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.770
 hours when you won four tapas because 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.050
 you end up making a 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.660
 carrerón but maybe you have in that 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:33.950
 place I should have felt that there 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:36.110
 a little more risk and lower by 2% and 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.430
 surely now we have passed but 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.740
 well we felt that we have a good 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.590
 controlled speed and there was the 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.820
 mistake if we were not discussing today 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.820
 surely the podium
