for the way to Train it doesn't give you
more<00:00:42.480> stretch<00:00:42.899> or<00:00:43.230> more<00:00:44.219> power<00:00:44.520> just<00:00:45.300> puts<00:00:45.840> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
more stretch or more power just puts you

in a little bit disadvantage for injury
tormund<00:00:48.780> safety<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.800> number<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.129> most

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
tormund safety is the number one most

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.340 
tormund safety is the number one most
important<00:00:51.120> thing<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.449> training<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.170> don't

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
important thing with training we don't

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
important thing with training we don't
want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> eat<00:00:52.649> we<00:00:53.100> pre<00:00:53.370> exhausted<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.030> muscles

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
want to eat we pre exhausted the muscles

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.750 
want to eat we pre exhausted the muscles
by<00:00:54.539> doing<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> incline<00:00:55.320> press<00:00:55.620> first<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
by doing the incline press first so that

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.610 
by doing the incline press first so that
you<00:00:56.910> can<00:00:57.090> avoid<00:00:57.360> any<00:00:57.629> risk<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.109> injury<00:00:58.410> by

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you can avoid any risk of injury by

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.279 
you can avoid any risk of injury by
having<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.010> use<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.370> weight<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.579> this<00:01:00.289> yeah

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
having to use a more weight on this yeah

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
having to use a more weight on this yeah
this<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> probably<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.280> most<00:01:02.520> basic<00:01:03.239> bench

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019

past parallel right exactly you don't

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
past parallel right exactly you don't
want<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.650> jeopardize<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.400> stretch<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.090> to
