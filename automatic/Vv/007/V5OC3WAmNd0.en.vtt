00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.170
 Hey guys, beauty is coming back and 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 this time with once in the last 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
 video had no way to record with fescan 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.199
 and explained the reasons including myself 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 I asked the opinion of some people 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.900
 about some different way or 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.820
 some other is gambling and most opined that 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.040
 I played for ba2 I thought it was nice to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 Damn because my favorite game is me 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.010
 It was fun, huh? 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.020
 I was with four other girls in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 so he had no way to play he asked 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 2 but still hope you 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.210
 like it was a game of domino nation 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.910
 today she is talking about the community 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 in the code is and where else 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.090
 objectives here in ig was also 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.149
 encouraged many of the girls who 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.430
 invention is losing interest in 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.059
 become competitive and I believe that the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.340
 biggest reason today is the prejudice with 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.789
 the girls in relation to playing videogame 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.030
 play mostly boys game, right? 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.380
 say so and when I started to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.110
 play code when I started playing 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.869
 video game is I received a lot of messages and 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.240
 in fact I get until today, right? 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.470
 This was never a reason for me to get out of control. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 let down quite the opposite 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:25.950
 This motivates me even more and I've been seeing 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:27.570
 and as one can not say that I was me 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 I was kind of expecting all this in the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.530
 At first I was very ill. 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.400
 Messages from a few minutes a year 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.090
 Something like that 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.299
 only we can go out and stop ignoring 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.220
 and I was accepted as motivation 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.079
 Why does this even send me a message? 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.880
 because he is inferior to me if he is 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.649
 dying for me straight through something 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.890
 like he was becoming inferior to me 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.000
 so there's no need to call me that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.240
 I was going for Mother 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.210
 some team videos of girls will ts 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.610
 is to get it out and there but there's all that 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.380
 support on all the play support and I 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.550
 I hope someday it will be like this and also 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.800
 that there are not many 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.810
 the difference between the boy and 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.820
 today there are many girls who play a lot 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.650
 more than a few - including the same 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.890
 that I know and many of my friends 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:18.420
 You play the fuck, so you do not have to 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.640
 demotivates right now and what else has 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.140
 resources to become competitive you 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.450
 You see so many videos teaching 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.790
 create class then there is a history of 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.040
 game then you do not have to stay for 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.600
 under the sector supports girl played more 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760
 play competitive and I think it's cool to 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.760
 My biggest dream is to play a 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.710
 time for girls in a camp is 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.670
 Until this happens, I will. 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.440
 doing on video show geovanna 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.090
 competitive I hope it still gives time 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.990
 to play damn 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.370

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.810

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.190
 More fun to record 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.810
