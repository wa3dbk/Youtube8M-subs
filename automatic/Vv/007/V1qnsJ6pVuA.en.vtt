more<00:00:27.019> long<00:00:28.019> before<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.710> car<00:00:29.330> this<00:00:30.330> one

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
more long before I got the car this one

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.389 
more long before I got the car this one
always<00:00:30.720> went<00:00:31.289> down<00:00:31.470> whatever<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.920> wanted<00:00:32.219> to

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and that's why I've already cleaned the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.709 
and that's why I've already cleaned the
whole<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:36.680> it<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.219> reamer<00:00:38.940> first

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:44.600 

and<00:00:42.719> then<00:00:42.870> just<00:00:43.590> read<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> plug<00:00:44.160> through<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
and then just read the plug through the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then just read the plug through the
insertion<00:00:45.480> tool<00:00:46.039> lots<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.570> adhesive<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:48.719> it

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
insertion tool lots of adhesive on it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.950 
insertion tool lots of adhesive on it
and<00:00:48.989> jamming<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.710> about<00:00:49.980> half<00:00:50.250> way<00:00:50.809> pull<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
and jamming in about half way pull the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.330 
and jamming in about half way pull the
tool<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.559> should<00:00:52.590> come<00:00:52.890> out<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.280> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
tool out it should come out there's a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.910 
tool out it should come out there's a
slot<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.899> leave<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> plug<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
slot in it leave the plug in there and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.709 
slot in it leave the plug in there and
you<00:00:56.160> just<00:00:56.309> trim<00:00:56.550> off<00:00:56.579> all<00:00:56.940> but<00:00:57.360> maybe<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
you just trim off all but maybe a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.090 
you just trim off all but maybe a
quarter<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.140> an<00:00:58.230> inch<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> most<00:00:58.770> on<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
quarter of an inch at the most on the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.529 
quarter of an inch at the most on the
outside<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.260> they<00:01:01.260> work<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.590> right

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
outside and they work a little right

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.770 
outside and they work a little right
yeah<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.780> we<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:03.870> so<00:01:04.680> I've<00:01:04.769> done<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:06.540> pretty

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
yeah there we go so I've done in pretty

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.670 
yeah there we go so I've done in pretty
much<00:01:06.840> inflate<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.380> straight<00:01:07.650> away

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
much inflate them straight away

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.039 
much inflate them straight away
afterwards<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.460> haven't<00:01:08.700> seen<00:01:08.850> people<00:01:09.270> quickly

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
afterwards I haven't seen people quickly

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
afterwards I haven't seen people quickly
rain<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> whole<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.159> jam<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.490> plug<00:01:11.640> in

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
rain the whole out and jam and plug in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
it lost its still fully inflated and it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.469 
it lost its still fully inflated and it
still<00:01:13.740> holds<00:01:14.030> long<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> get<00:01:15.270> enough

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
still holds long as you get enough

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.710 
still holds long as you get enough
adhesive<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.049> there<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:18.000> gone<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.360> hard

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
adhesive in there it's gone really hard

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.780 
adhesive in there it's gone really hard
and<00:01:18.869> crunchy<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> Maritimes

been<00:01:21.000> sitting<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:22.189> it's<00:01:23.189> definitely<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.880> for

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
been sitting it it's definitely do for

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.429 
been sitting it it's definitely do for
the<00:01:24.119> rubbish<00:01:24.360> bin<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.780> don't<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.200> tires

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the rubbish bin I just don't have tires

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.070 
the rubbish bin I just don't have tires
at<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.740> moment<00:01:26.210> at<00:01:27.210> least<00:01:27.270> ones<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.720> stay<00:01:27.900> up

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
at the moment at least ones that stay up

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.200 
at the moment at least ones that stay up
anyway<00:01:28.439> yeah<00:01:29.100> well<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:29.729> can't<00:01:29.970> be<00:01:30.060> bothered

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
anyway yeah well I can't be bothered

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.550 
anyway yeah well I can't be bothered
swapping<00:01:30.720> him<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> other<00:01:31.170> ones<00:01:31.380> which

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
swapping him for the other ones which

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.969 
swapping him for the other ones which
are<00:01:31.740> good<00:01:32.250> tread<00:01:32.579> but<00:01:32.790> still<00:01:33.030> full<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.240> cracks

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
are good tread but still full of cracks

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
are good tread but still full of cracks
so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> should<00:01:35.280> really<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.610> bothered<00:01:35.759> swapping

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
so I should really be bothered swapping

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.620 
so I should really be bothered swapping
him<00:01:36.509> over<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.500> will<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.950> now<00:01:38.420> yeah<00:01:39.420> okay

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
him over this will do for now yeah okay

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.649 
him over this will do for now yeah okay
tires<00:01:40.229> done<00:01:40.409> holding<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.579> fine<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.090> just

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
tires done holding just fine I just

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
tires done holding just fine I just
remember<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> go<00:01:43.200> clean<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.470> spark<00:01:43.799> plugs

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
remember I go clean the spark plugs

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
remember I go clean the spark plugs
before<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.520> move<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.790> because<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.030> flooded

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
before I can move it because it flooded

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.840 
before I can move it because it flooded
again

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
again

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.820 
again
that's<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.720> main<00:01:47.869> problem<00:01:48.049> why<00:01:48.500> I<00:01:48.530> haven't

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
that's the main problem why I haven't

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.130 
that's the main problem why I haven't
done<00:01:48.950> much<00:01:49.159> to<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:50.180> money<00:01:50.420> spending<00:01:50.990> it

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
done much to it it's money spending it

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.560 
done much to it it's money spending it
all<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.409> Jaguar<00:01:52.420> otherwise<00:01:53.420> I<00:01:53.479> probably

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
all on the Jaguar otherwise I probably

pressure washer afterwards it's going to

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.710 
pressure washer afterwards it's going to
move<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.050> thing<00:03:35.260> first

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
