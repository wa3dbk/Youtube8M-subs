different best full really you want it
to<00:02:28.660> look<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:30.190> don't<00:02:30.280> want<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.640> look

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
to look you don't want it to look

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.130 
to look you don't want it to look
different<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.300> want<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.570> look<00:02:31.750> how<00:02:31.960> its

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
different you want it to look how its

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.010 
different you want it to look how its
gonna<00:02:32.260> render<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.040> you<00:02:33.970> shouldn't<00:02:34.959> be

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
gonna render and you shouldn't be

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.170 
gonna render and you shouldn't be
rendering<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.530> Auto<00:02:35.910> because<00:02:36.910> then<00:02:37.030> it's

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
rendering in Auto because then it's

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.900 
rendering in Auto because then it's
pixelated<00:02:37.660> so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.920> want<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.250> be<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.580> best

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
pixelated so you want it to be in best

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:43.050 
pixelated so you want it to be in best
full<00:02:40.740> even<00:02:41.740> if<00:02:41.830> it's<00:02:41.980> gonna<00:02:42.070> be<00:02:42.280> slow<00:02:42.580> you're

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
full even if it's gonna be slow you're

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.880 
full even if it's gonna be slow you're
just<00:02:43.240> staying<00:02:43.930> on<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.260> still<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.770> your

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
just staying on one still so your

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.260 
just staying on one still so your
computer<00:02:45.220> should<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.459> able<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.790> handle<00:02:46.030> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
computer should be able to handle it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.900 
computer should be able to handle it
even<00:02:47.020> if<00:02:47.110> you<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.740> a<00:02:47.980> wooden<00:02:48.310> computer<00:02:48.730> or

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
even if you have a wooden computer or

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.050 
even if you have a wooden computer or
whatnot<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:50.220> we're<00:02:51.220> gonna<00:02:51.310> go<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.520> show<00:02:51.790> mask

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
whatnot so we're gonna go to show mask

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.770 
whatnot so we're gonna go to show mask
only<00:02:52.590> make<00:02:53.590> sure<00:02:53.620> this<00:02:53.890> is<00:02:54.040> precise<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:55.630> can

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
only make sure this is precise you can

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.020 
only make sure this is precise you can
see<00:02:55.959> here<00:02:56.320> we<00:02:57.100> have<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.340> grayness<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.940> that

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
see here we have the grayness and that

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:06.930 
see here we have the grayness and that
means<00:02:58.209> it's<00:02:58.420> not<00:02:58.570> heat<00:02:59.050> up<00:02:59.080> completely

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.030 

there<00:03:08.230> as<00:03:09.230> this<00:03:09.380> one<00:03:09.530> goes<00:03:09.680> up<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.980> means

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
there as this one goes up that means

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.310 
there as this one goes up that means
that<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.550> stuff<00:03:10.820> isn't<00:03:11.210> being<00:03:11.570> heated

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
that this stuff isn't being heated

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.140 
that this stuff isn't being heated
actually<00:03:12.830> it's<00:03:12.950> being<00:03:13.100> keyed<00:03:13.340> out<00:03:13.520> right<00:03:13.730> now

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
actually it's being keyed out right now

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.840 
actually it's being keyed out right now
so<00:03:14.840> you<00:03:15.320> just<00:03:15.440> want<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.800> whole<00:03:15.920> figure<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.820> be

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
so you just want the whole figure to be

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.890 
so you just want the whole figure to be
white<00:03:19.150> so<00:03:20.150> let's<00:03:20.180> bring<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.450> down<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.690> where

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
white so let's bring that down to where

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:26.350 
white so let's bring that down to where
it<00:03:20.960> was<00:03:23.710> see<00:03:24.710> this<00:03:24.920> news<00:03:25.130> moved<00:03:25.400> it<00:03:26.030> looks<00:03:26.180> good

where it is let's move down the high a

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.370 
where it is let's move down the high a
little<00:03:29.060> bit<00:03:30.670> see<00:03:31.670> how<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.880> looks

it's<00:04:07.269> called<00:04:07.569> key<00:04:07.930> light<00:04:08.140> I<00:04:08.349> think<00:04:08.769> one<00:04:09.010> two<00:04:09.310> or

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
it's called key light I think one two or

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:09.960 
it's called key light I think one two or
something

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
something

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.240 
something
it's<00:04:10.390> called<00:04:10.569> key<00:04:10.810> light<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.260> it's<00:04:11.410> the<00:04:12.040> best

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
it's called key light and it's the best

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.309 
it's called key light and it's the best
cure<00:04:12.519> that<00:04:12.700> I've<00:04:12.819> ever<00:04:12.970> used<00:04:13.299> but<00:04:13.629> we're<00:04:14.230> doing

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
cure that I've ever used but we're doing

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.809 
cure that I've ever used but we're doing
it<00:04:14.500> in<00:04:14.590> Vegas<00:04:14.950> because<00:04:15.160> most<00:04:15.459> people<00:04:15.730> don't

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
it in Vegas because most people don't

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.909 
it in Vegas because most people don't
have<00:04:15.940> After<00:04:16.299> Effects<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:17.350> now<00:04:17.440> these<00:04:17.560> three

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
have After Effects so now these three

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.120 
have After Effects so now these three
are<00:04:17.950> keyed<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:19.419> can<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:19.840> the<00:04:20.739> difference

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
are keyed you can see the difference

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.940 
are keyed you can see the difference
here<00:04:21.270> this<00:04:22.270> one<00:04:22.510> looks<00:04:22.750> decent<00:04:23.169> this<00:04:23.650> is<00:04:23.800> the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
here this one looks decent this is the

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.909 
here this one looks decent this is the
GM<00:04:24.400> construct<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.780> shadows<00:04:26.169> on<00:04:26.410> his<00:04:26.530> face<00:04:26.710> are

GM construct the shadows on his face are

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:31.650 
GM construct the shadows on his face are
kind<00:04:27.070> of<00:04:27.130> weird<00:04:27.360> one<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:29.430> chroma<00:04:30.430> key<00:04:30.660> map

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
kind of weird one on the chroma key map

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.900 
kind of weird one on the chroma key map
is<00:04:32.130> way<00:04:33.130> too<00:04:33.190> right

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
is way too right

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.719 
is way too right
doesn't<00:04:34.510> fit<00:04:34.690> in<00:04:34.840> you<00:04:35.500> can<00:04:35.650> it's<00:04:36.070> well<00:04:36.610> at

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
doesn't fit in you can it's well at

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.700 
doesn't fit in you can it's well at
least<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:37.090> can<00:04:37.330> clearly<00:04:37.990> tell<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.320> this<00:04:38.560> has

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
least I can clearly tell that this has

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.219 
least I can clearly tell that this has
been<00:04:38.830> green<00:04:39.039> screen<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:41.050> white

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
been green screen and the white

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:43.770 
been green screen and the white
highlights<00:04:41.650> really<00:04:41.830> give<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.100> away<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:43.510> when

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
highlights really give it away but when
