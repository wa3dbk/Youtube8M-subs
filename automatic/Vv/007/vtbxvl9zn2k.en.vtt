of here first all right so right at the

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.860 
of here first all right so right at the
front<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:35.420> that's<00:00:36.420> an<00:00:36.600> RP<00:00:36.930> 4<00:00:37.200> 52<00:00:37.680> times<00:00:38.010> 2

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
front we have that's an RP 4 52 times 2

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
front we have that's an RP 4 52 times 2
reservoir<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.920> dual<00:00:41.100> bay<00:00:41.250> reservoir

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
reservoir and it's a dual bay reservoir

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.940 
reservoir and it's a dual bay reservoir
I<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.239> serial<00:00:42.629> connector<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.590> there<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I have the serial connector in there so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
I have the serial connector in there so
both<00:00:45.410> reservoir<00:00:46.410> bays<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:48.270> have

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
both reservoir bays there are our have

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.350 
both reservoir bays there are our have
cooling<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.440> them<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.770> then<00:00:50.550> there<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.300> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
cooling in them and then there are a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.049 
cooling in them and then there are a
couple<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:53.120> mCP<00:00:54.120> 6:55<00:00:54.989> pumps<00:00:55.670> mounted<00:00:56.670> inside

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
couple of mCP 6:55 pumps mounted inside

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.439 
couple of mCP 6:55 pumps mounted inside
on<00:00:58.050> either<00:00:58.350> side<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.890> there<00:00:59.100> and<00:01:00.030> then<00:01:00.210> you<00:01:00.300> can

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
on either side of there and then you can

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.369 
on either side of there and then you can
see<00:01:00.629> coming<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:02.570> reservoir<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.350> a

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
see coming out of the reservoir I have a

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.460 
see coming out of the reservoir I have a
disconnect<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> there's<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.420> male<00:01:06.840> Wan<00:01:07.080> going

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
disconnect so there's a male Wan going

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.469 
disconnect so there's a male Wan going
in<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> inside<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.000> back<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
in on the inside of the the back of the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.710 
in on the inside of the the back of the
off<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.189> reservoir<00:01:11.189> block<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.510> there's

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
off the reservoir block and then there's

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.359 
off the reservoir block and then there's
a<00:01:12.780> female<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.380> compression<00:01:13.680> fitting<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
a female with a compression fitting and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.469 
a female with a compression fitting and
it<00:01:14.790> runs<00:01:14.939> down<00:01:15.180> into<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:16.189> radiator<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.479> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
it runs down into the radiator and I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:19.969 
it runs down into the radiator and I
don't<00:01:18.869> know<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.200> don't<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.740> side

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
don't know I don't have the other side

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.950 
don't know I don't have the other side
off<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.700> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> show<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
off so I'm not going to show you that

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
off so I'm not going to show you that
connected<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.310> connected<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
connected but it's connected to the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.160 
connected but it's connected to the
bottom<00:01:25.490> port<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.640> that's<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:26.970> input<00:01:27.509> port<00:01:27.960> on

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
bottom port and that's my input port on

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.899 
bottom port and that's my input port on
the<00:01:28.350> radiator<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.220> reason<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.610> did<00:01:29.880> that

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
the radiator and the reason I did that

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.350 
the radiator and the reason I did that
is<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> fill<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> loop<00:01:32.070> it'll<00:01:33.030> help<00:01:33.180> get

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
is when you fill the loop it'll help get

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.160 
is when you fill the loop it'll help get
the<00:01:33.509> air<00:01:33.659> out<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.439> as<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.640> Kohen<00:01:36.630> comes<00:01:37.020> up

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the air out as the as the Kohen comes up

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
the air out as the as the Kohen comes up
to<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.350> top<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.860> comes<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to the top and it comes out of the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
to the top and it comes out of the
radiator<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:41.090> then<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.299> comes<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.759> from

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
radiator and then it comes out and from

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
radiator and then it comes out and from
the<00:01:44.909> bottom<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.780> TJ<00:01:46.110> 11<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> goes

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
the bottom of the TJ 11 and then it goes

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.520 
the bottom of the TJ 11 and then it goes
into<00:01:48.090> my<00:01:48.450> cpu<00:01:48.990> block<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.439> that's<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.649> cones<00:01:51.530> CPU

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.990 
output of the CPU block same thing on
the<00:02:23.750> chipset<00:02:24.750> block<00:02:25.020> on<00:02:25.590> all<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:26.010> them<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
the chipset block on all of them so the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.300 
the chipset block on all of them so the
pieces<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.450> connect<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.960> are<00:02:28.110> all<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
pieces that connect them are all the the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.030 
pieces that connect them are all the the
female<00:02:29.820> quick<00:02:30.270> disconnects<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:31.080> are<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
female quick disconnects that are the

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.640 
female quick disconnects that are the
compression<00:02:32.490> fitted<00:02:32.820> ones<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.810> that's<00:02:34.500> how

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
compression fitted ones so that's how

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.590 
compression fitted ones so that's how
this<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.860> all<00:02:35.100> set<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.310> so<00:02:35.670> theoretically<00:02:36.330> I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
this is all set up so theoretically I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.510 
this is all set up so theoretically I
should<00:02:36.960> be<00:02:37.350> able<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.590> just<00:02:37.830> disconnect<00:02:38.190> them

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
should be able to just disconnect them

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.540 
should be able to just disconnect them
and<00:02:39.080> not<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.260> any<00:02:40.440> fluid<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:41.040> fluid<00:02:41.190> stays

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
and not have any fluid the fluid stays

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.810 
and not have any fluid the fluid stays
within<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:42.180> tubes<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:43.100> inside<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> block<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
within the tubes or inside the block and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.970 
within the tubes or inside the block and
of<00:02:45.540> course<00:02:45.780> inside<00:02:46.050> the<00:02:46.200> reservoir<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
of course inside the reservoir and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.080 
of course inside the reservoir and
inside<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:48.000> radiator<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.030> to

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
inside the radiator so so I'm going to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.730 
inside the radiator so so I'm going to
put<00:02:51.270> you<00:02:51.390> back<00:02:51.570> on<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.810> stand<00:02:52.110> right<00:02:52.200> now<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
put you back on the stand right now and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.540 
put you back on the stand right now and
then<00:02:53.600> disconnect<00:02:54.600> them<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.840> take<00:02:54.990> them<00:02:55.110> out

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
then disconnect them and take them out

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.950 
then disconnect them and take them out
and<00:02:56.550> we'll<00:02:56.880> take<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.060> look<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.420> see<00:02:57.600> if<00:02:57.750> we've

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
and we'll take a look and see if we've

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.430 
and we'll take a look and see if we've
gotten<00:02:58.410> any<00:02:58.500> any<00:02:59.220> issues<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.110> bottom<00:03:01.110> line<00:03:01.260> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
gotten any any issues but bottom line is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.750 
gotten any any issues but bottom line is
I'm<00:03:01.590> just<00:03:01.770> going<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.070> popping<00:03:02.310> those<00:03:02.550> off

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
I'm just going to be popping those off

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.540 
I'm just going to be popping those off
should<00:03:03.030> take<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.320> minute<00:03:04.320> or<00:03:04.410> two<00:03:04.560> and<00:03:04.830> then

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
should take a minute or two and then

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.040 
should take a minute or two and then
I'll<00:03:05.700> be<00:03:05.850> able<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.210> unscrew<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.750> remove<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
I'll be able to unscrew and remove the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.310 
I'll be able to unscrew and remove the
motherboard<00:03:07.650> tray<00:03:07.860> out<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.090> TJ<00:03:09.420> 11<00:03:09.780> so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
motherboard tray out of the TJ 11 so

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.100 
motherboard tray out of the TJ 11 so
I'll<00:03:10.440> hang<00:03:10.620> on<00:03:10.770> for<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> second<00:03:11.510> before<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.750> take

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
I'll hang on for a second before I take

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.840 
I'll hang on for a second before I take
it<00:03:13.140> out<00:03:13.380> I<00:03:13.410> wanted<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.830> turn<00:03:14.070> on<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> system<00:03:14.700> so

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
it out I wanted to turn on the system so

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.750 
it out I wanted to turn on the system so
you<00:03:14.880> can<00:03:15.180> see<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:16.380> there<00:03:16.710> is<00:03:16.860> a<00:03:16.890> coolant<00:03:17.580> in

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
you can see that there is a coolant in

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.720 
you can see that there is a coolant in
the<00:03:17.820> reservoir<00:03:18.660> Bay<00:03:18.870> I<00:03:19.140> have<00:03:20.010> Mayhem's<00:03:20.430> die<00:03:20.670> in

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
the reservoir Bay I have Mayhem's die in

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.850 
the reservoir Bay I have Mayhem's die in
there<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.300> I<00:03:21.360> have<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.570> UV<00:03:21.870> light<00:03:22.260> outside<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.800> a

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
there and I have a UV light outside of a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.199 
there and I have a UV light outside of a
blue<00:03:23.040> light<00:03:23.280> so<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.520> should<00:03:23.730> be<00:03:23.820> able<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.030> see

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
blue light so you should be able to see

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.620 
blue light so you should be able to see
just<00:03:24.480> colored<00:03:25.470> liquid<00:03:25.860> inside<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.400> Bay<00:03:26.630> so

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
just colored liquid inside that Bay so

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:35.800 
just colored liquid inside that Bay so
I'm<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:27.930> turn<00:03:28.110> them<00:03:28.230> on<00:03:28.290> now

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.050 

so<00:03:36.350> you<00:03:36.770> can<00:03:36.950> see<00:03:38.500> there<00:03:39.500> is<00:03:39.740> coolant<00:03:40.430> inside

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
so you can see there is coolant inside

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.100 
so you can see there is coolant inside
the<00:03:41.360> reservoir<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:43.510> pumps<00:03:44.510> just<00:03:44.720> started

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
the reservoir and pumps just started

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.010 
the reservoir and pumps just started
kicking<00:03:45.319> in<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:46.180> now<00:03:47.180> I'm<00:03:47.390> going<00:03:47.630> to<00:03:47.780> shut<00:03:47.990> it

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
kicking in and now I'm going to shut it

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:59.979 
kicking in and now I'm going to shut it
off<00:03:52.540> alrighty<00:03:53.540> let's<00:03:55.660> see<00:03:56.660> here<00:03:56.989> we<00:03:57.080> got<00:03:58.989> this

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
off alrighty let's see here we got this

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:06.100 
off alrighty let's see here we got this
in<00:04:00.200> view<00:04:01.420> alright<00:04:02.420> now<00:04:04.510> what<00:04:05.510> I'll<00:04:05.600> do<00:04:05.780> is<00:04:05.959> I'll

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
in view alright now what I'll do is I'll

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.910 
in view alright now what I'll do is I'll
start<00:04:06.140> with<00:04:07.989> taking<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.170> off<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.380> chipset

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
start with taking it off the chipset

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.009 
start with taking it off the chipset
block<00:04:10.160> all<00:04:10.550> you<00:04:10.760> got<00:04:10.880> to<00:04:10.970> do<00:04:11.120> is<00:04:11.330> push<00:04:11.570> down<00:04:11.600> and

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
block all you got to do is push down and

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:18.009 
block all you got to do is push down and
twist<00:04:13.570> all<00:04:14.570> right<00:04:14.690> and<00:04:15.019> that's<00:04:15.200> one<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:17.209> then

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
twist all right and that's one and then

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.440 
twist all right and that's one and then
same<00:04:18.440> thing<00:04:18.470> for<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:20.650> thank<00:04:21.650> you

same thing for the thank you
there's<00:04:23.450> no<00:04:23.660> drops<00:04:23.990> there's<00:04:24.230> a<00:04:24.320> little<00:04:24.919> bit<00:04:25.340> of

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
there's no drops there's a little bit of

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.969 
there's no drops there's a little bit of
a<00:04:25.550> drop<00:04:25.760> right<00:04:26.000> here<00:04:29.169> alright<00:04:30.169> so<00:04:30.590> these<00:04:30.800> are

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
a drop right here alright so these are

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.820 
a drop right here alright so these are
just<00:04:31.160> connected<00:04:31.669> right<00:04:31.880> now<00:04:32.410> now<00:04:33.410> this<00:04:33.620> loop

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
just connected right now now this loop

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.290 
just connected right now now this loop
is<00:04:34.010> right<00:04:34.190> on<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.460> motherboard<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:35.090> can

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
is right on the motherboard I can

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.090 
is right on the motherboard I can
actually<00:04:35.419> I<00:04:35.630> designed<00:04:36.410> -<00:04:36.530> so<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:36.860> height

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
actually I designed - so this height

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.640 
actually I designed - so this height
will<00:04:37.910> clear<00:04:38.270> so<00:04:38.540> I<00:04:38.570> could<00:04:38.870> actually<00:04:39.020> just<00:04:39.229> take

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
will clear so I could actually just take

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.440 
will clear so I could actually just take
it<00:04:39.770> out<00:04:39.890> as<00:04:40.070> it<00:04:40.190> is<00:04:40.280> right<00:04:40.490> now<00:04:40.640> but<00:04:41.300> I'm<00:04:41.360> just

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
it out as it is right now but I'm just

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.400 
it out as it is right now but I'm just
gonna<00:04:41.570> go<00:04:41.690> ahead<00:04:41.840> and<00:04:41.960> take<00:04:42.110> them<00:04:42.229> off

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
gonna go ahead and take them off

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:48.780 
gonna go ahead and take them off
completely

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.159 

alright<00:04:49.790> this<00:04:50.120> guy's<00:04:50.330> got<00:04:50.570> fluid<00:04:50.810> in<00:04:51.020> all

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
alright this guy's got fluid in all

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.230 
alright this guy's got fluid in all
course<00:04:52.150> but<00:04:53.150> he's<00:04:53.930> done<00:04:54.430> these<00:04:55.430> guys<00:04:55.640> going<00:04:56.120> to

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
course but he's done these guys going to

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.380 
course but he's done these guys going to
the<00:04:56.330> reservoir<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:58.070> in<00:04:58.280> up<00:04:58.460> here<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.940> can<00:04:59.210> take

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
the reservoir and in up here I can take

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.930 
the reservoir and in up here I can take
this<00:04:59.539> one<00:04:59.720> off<00:05:04.300> so<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.570> line<00:05:05.810> going<00:05:06.140> from<00:05:06.169> the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
this one off so the line going from the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.460 
this one off so the line going from the
return<00:05:07.940> from<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.180> chipset<00:05:08.630> block<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.350> the

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
return from the chipset block to the

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.240 
return from the chipset block to the
reservoir<00:05:09.890> is<00:05:10.100> right<00:05:10.370> here<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:12.500> then<00:05:12.740> the

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
reservoir is right here and then the

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.890 
reservoir is right here and then the
other<00:05:13.400> one<00:05:13.610> I<00:05:13.640> have<00:05:13.760> right<00:05:14.090> here<00:05:14.120> runs<00:05:14.479> down<00:05:14.720> to

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
other one I have right here runs down to

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.750 
other one I have right here runs down to
the<00:05:15.080> reservoir<00:05:15.470> baby<00:05:15.710> butt<00:05:15.919> and<00:05:16.190> I'll<00:05:16.640> be

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
the reservoir baby butt and I'll be

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.490 
the reservoir baby butt and I'll be
taking<00:05:17.060> that<00:05:17.090> off<00:05:21.760> and<00:05:22.760> she's<00:05:22.970> out<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:24.350> there

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
taking that off and she's out and there

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.550 
taking that off and she's out and there
was<00:05:24.680> a<00:05:24.710> drop<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.460> came<00:05:25.640> out<00:05:25.820> of<00:05:25.850> here<00:05:26.560> so

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
was a drop that came out of here so

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.200 
was a drop that came out of here so
that's<00:05:28.340> it<00:05:28.690> that's<00:05:29.690> how<00:05:29.930> easy<00:05:29.960> it<00:05:30.320> is<00:05:30.530> to<00:05:31.210> use

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
that's it that's how easy it is to use

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.420 
that's it that's how easy it is to use
quick<00:05:32.419> disconnects<00:05:32.870> now<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.380> can<00:05:33.770> take<00:05:34.250> this

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
quick disconnects now I can take this

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.890 
quick disconnects now I can take this
motherboard<00:05:34.760> tray<00:05:35.090> out<00:05:35.419> of<00:05:35.570> here

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
motherboard tray out of here

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.040 
motherboard tray out of here
service<00:05:36.860> the<00:05:36.890> system<00:05:37.430> and<00:05:37.940> then<00:05:38.570> connect<00:05:38.930> it

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
service the system and then connect it

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.820 
service the system and then connect it
back<00:05:39.169> up<00:05:39.410> run<00:05:39.680> it

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
back up run it

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.500 
back up run it
I<00:05:39.919> might<00:05:40.130> have<00:05:40.310> to<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.760> know<00:05:40.880> just<00:05:41.120> the<00:05:41.240> only

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
I might have to you know just the only

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.290 
I might have to you know just the only
air<00:05:41.660> that<00:05:41.900> may<00:05:42.020> get<00:05:42.200> in<00:05:42.260> is<00:05:42.610> from<00:05:43.610> connecting

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
air that may get in is from connecting

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.700 
air that may get in is from connecting
them<00:05:44.419> back<00:05:44.570> up<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:44.990> there<00:05:45.169> might<00:05:45.320> be<00:05:45.349> a<00:05:45.470> tiny

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
them back up so there might be a tiny

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.420 
them back up so there might be a tiny
little<00:05:45.950> bit<00:05:46.190> of<00:05:46.400> bleeding<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.940> might<00:05:47.120> have

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
little bit of bleeding that might have

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.700 
little bit of bleeding that might have
to<00:05:47.490> be<00:05:47.610> done<00:05:47.820> I've<00:05:48.810> done<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.110> before<00:05:49.200> and<00:05:49.410> I<00:05:49.590> had

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
to be done I've done it before and I had

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.920 
to be done I've done it before and I had
no<00:05:49.860> issues<00:05:50.130> at<00:05:50.280> all<00:05:50.370> so<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:51.120> mean<00:05:51.570> it's<00:05:51.750> not<00:05:51.810> like

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
no issues at all so I mean it's not like

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.630 
no issues at all so I mean it's not like
when<00:05:52.230> you<00:05:52.320> first<00:05:52.500> fill<00:05:52.980> it<00:05:53.070> up<00:05:53.130> and<00:05:53.310> bleed<00:05:53.490> it

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:53.640 
when you first fill it up and bleed it

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.700 
when you first fill it up and bleed it
so<00:05:53.900> anyway<00:05:54.900> that's<00:05:54.990> the<00:05:55.140> beauty<00:05:55.410> of<00:05:55.440> quick

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
so anyway that's the beauty of quick

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.450 
so anyway that's the beauty of quick
disconnects<00:05:56.250> and<00:05:57.380> this<00:05:58.380> trace<00:05:58.680> coming<00:05:59.310> out

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
disconnects and this trace coming out

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.310 
disconnects and this trace coming out
I'll<00:05:59.670> work<00:05:59.850> on<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.330> put<00:06:00.960> it<00:06:01.050> back<00:06:01.140> together

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 
I'll work on it and put it back together

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.620 
I'll work on it and put it back together
and<00:06:01.590> then<00:06:01.860> connect<00:06:02.250> them<00:06:02.370> back<00:06:02.490> up<00:06:02.730> and<00:06:02.940> I'm

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
and then connect them back up and I'm

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.270 
and then connect them back up and I'm
good<00:06:03.780> to<00:06:03.900> go<00:06:03.930> again<00:06:04.170> oh<00:06:06.050> I<00:06:07.050> wanted<00:06:07.590> to<00:06:07.650> tell<00:06:08.160> you

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
good to go again oh I wanted to tell you

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.210 
good to go again oh I wanted to tell you
that<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:10.080> cost<00:06:10.350> to<00:06:10.470> use<00:06:10.710> these<00:06:10.920> quick

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:11.220 
that the cost to use these quick

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.370 
that the cost to use these quick
disconnects<00:06:11.820> though<00:06:12.510> they<00:06:12.780> give<00:06:13.170> they're<00:06:13.350> a

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
disconnects though they give they're a

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.450 
disconnects though they give they're a
little<00:06:13.620> bit<00:06:13.710> expensive<00:06:14.010> they<00:06:14.250> probably

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
little bit expensive they probably

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.160 
little bit expensive they probably
average<00:06:14.850> 12<00:06:15.150> or<00:06:15.270> 13<00:06:15.600> bucks<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:16.190> cup<00:06:17.190> but<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:18.210> so

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
average 12 or 13 bucks a cup but one so

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.600 
average 12 or 13 bucks a cup but one so
in<00:06:19.380> this<00:06:19.470> system<00:06:19.650> there's<00:06:20.010> eight<00:06:20.220> of<00:06:20.250> them<00:06:20.460> so

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
in this system there's eight of them so

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.450 
in this system there's eight of them so
it's<00:06:20.760> about<00:06:20.940> 200<00:06:21.390> bucks<00:06:21.480> in<00:06:21.840> in<00:06:22.460> couplings

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
it's about 200 bucks in in couplings

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.400 
it's about 200 bucks in in couplings
quick<00:06:24.210> disconnects<00:06:24.720> that<00:06:24.960> you<00:06:25.080> would<00:06:25.230> need

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
quick disconnects that you would need

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.130 
quick disconnects that you would need
for<00:06:26.310> doing<00:06:26.640> it<00:06:26.760> like<00:06:26.940> I<00:06:27.150> do<00:06:27.210> it<00:06:27.390> now<00:06:27.840> some

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
for doing it like I do it now some

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.430 
for doing it like I do it now some
people<00:06:28.290> don't<00:06:29.160> use<00:06:30.150> them<00:06:30.480> from<00:06:31.020> the<00:06:31.110> reservoir

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
people don't use them from the reservoir

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.020 
people don't use them from the reservoir
they<00:06:31.710> just<00:06:31.920> have<00:06:32.040> one<00:06:32.070> quick<00:06:32.460> disconnect

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
they just have one quick disconnect

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.440 
they just have one quick disconnect
going<00:06:33.300> right<00:06:33.560> to<00:06:34.560> the<00:06:34.830> entry<00:06:35.490> point<00:06:35.730> so<00:06:36.000> your

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.450 
going right to the entry point so your

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.040 
going right to the entry point so your
reservoir<00:06:37.230> and<00:06:37.560> your<00:06:38.540> you<00:06:39.540> only<00:06:39.660> need<00:06:39.840> the<00:06:39.930> one

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
reservoir and your you only need the one

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.780 
reservoir and your you only need the one
quick<00:06:40.260> disconnect<00:06:40.800> at<00:06:40.920> the<00:06:41.010> end<00:06:41.220> so<00:06:41.460> you<00:06:41.520> know

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:41.790 
quick disconnect at the end so you know

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:42.980 
quick disconnect at the end so you know
there<00:06:41.970> are<00:06:42.060> ways<00:06:42.240> you<00:06:42.270> can<00:06:42.510> cut<00:06:42.690> it<00:06:42.810> you<00:06:42.900> can

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
there are ways you can cut it you can

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.720 
there are ways you can cut it you can
probably<00:06:43.080> cut<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:43.500> in<00:06:43.650> half<00:06:43.680> so<00:06:44.490> I<00:06:44.520> made<00:06:44.700> a

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:44.730 
probably cut that in half so I made a

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.670 
probably cut that in half so I made a
little<00:06:44.910> over<00:06:45.150> a<00:06:45.210> hundred<00:06:45.330> bucks<00:06:45.600> you<00:06:46.410> can<00:06:46.560> do

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.260 
little over a hundred bucks you can do
it<00:06:46.830> I<00:06:46.980> just<00:06:47.040> like<00:06:47.370> the<00:06:47.520> flexibility<00:06:48.150> of<00:06:48.180> being

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
it I just like the flexibility of being

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.120 
it I just like the flexibility of being
able<00:06:48.480> to<00:06:48.660> take<00:06:48.840> it<00:06:49.020> apart<00:06:49.230> at<00:06:49.380> any<00:06:49.530> point<00:06:49.830> and

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
able to take it apart at any point and

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.600 
able to take it apart at any point and
have<00:06:50.840> have<00:06:51.840> my<00:06:52.110> my<00:06:53.100> connections

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
have have my my connections

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.220 
have have my my connections
quick-disconnect<00:06:54.060> so<00:06:54.540> I<00:06:54.570> can<00:06:54.900> really

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
quick-disconnect so I can really

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.230 
quick-disconnect so I can really
literally<00:06:55.680> maintenance<00:06:56.580> any<00:06:56.820> particular

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 
literally maintenance any particular

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.100 
literally maintenance any particular
thing<00:06:57.860> any<00:06:58.860> any<00:06:59.220> piece<00:06:59.790> of<00:06:59.820> my<00:07:00.090> system<00:07:00.510> without

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.110 
thing any any piece of my system without

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.350 
thing any any piece of my system without
having<00:07:01.440> to<00:07:01.590> drain<00:07:01.830> a<00:07:01.860> full<00:07:02.190> loop<00:07:02.370> and<00:07:02.850> so<00:07:03.210> like

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
having to drain a full loop and so like

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.480 
having to drain a full loop and so like
I<00:07:03.450> said<00:07:03.510> there's<00:07:03.840> a<00:07:03.900> way<00:07:04.050> that<00:07:04.290> ways<00:07:04.770> to<00:07:05.100> if<00:07:05.280> you

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
I said there's a way that ways to if you

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.070 
I said there's a way that ways to if you
if<00:07:05.970> you're<00:07:06.780> you<00:07:07.290> plan<00:07:07.530> it<00:07:07.710> ahead<00:07:08.510> you<00:07:09.510> can<00:07:09.720> you

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
if you're you plan it ahead you can you

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.750 
if you're you plan it ahead you can you
can<00:07:10.260> do<00:07:10.380> it<00:07:10.500> for<00:07:10.620> cheaper<00:07:10.950> than<00:07:10.980> that<00:07:11.250> I<00:07:11.520> just

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
can do it for cheaper than that I just

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.310 
can do it for cheaper than that I just
like<00:07:12.150> them<00:07:12.360> at<00:07:12.450> all<00:07:12.540> the<00:07:12.690> connection<00:07:13.050> points

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
like them at all the connection points

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.530 
like them at all the connection points
and<00:07:13.440> that's<00:07:13.500> the<00:07:13.680> way<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:13.950> I've<00:07:14.070> done<00:07:14.540> now

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:15.540 
and that's the way that I've done now

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:16.910 
and that's the way that I've done now
there<00:07:15.840> is<00:07:15.960> a<00:07:15.990> border<00:07:16.410> of<00:07:16.440> course<00:07:16.740> from<00:07:16.830> the

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:16.920 
there is a border of course from the

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:17.330 
there is a border of course from the
waterblock

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
waterblock

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:20.240 
waterblock
but<00:07:17.640> I<00:07:17.670> can<00:07:18.020> disassemble<00:07:19.020> that<00:07:19.230> and<00:07:19.590> take

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:20.250 
but I can disassemble that and take

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.580 
but I can disassemble that and take
those<00:07:20.430> off<00:07:20.640> and<00:07:20.910> the<00:07:21.870> coolant<00:07:22.200> would<00:07:22.320> come<00:07:22.470> out

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.590 
those off and the coolant would come out

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.020 
those off and the coolant would come out
of<00:07:22.650> that<00:07:22.860> if<00:07:23.010> I<00:07:23.130> wanted<00:07:23.370> to<00:07:23.490> drain<00:07:23.640> that<00:07:23.820> kind

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
of that if I wanted to drain that kind

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.790 
of that if I wanted to drain that kind
and<00:07:24.300> the<00:07:24.720> beauty<00:07:25.020> of<00:07:25.050> this<00:07:25.170> I<00:07:25.290> can<00:07:25.440> just<00:07:25.470> remove

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 
and the beauty of this I can just remove

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.730 
and the beauty of this I can just remove
that<00:07:26.070> reservoir<00:07:26.820> completely<00:07:27.390> and<00:07:28.110> take<00:07:28.560> that

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:28.740 
that reservoir completely and take that

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.090 
that reservoir completely and take that
to<00:07:28.950> a<00:07:28.980> bin<00:07:29.670> or<00:07:29.700> sink<00:07:30.270> and<00:07:30.480> drain<00:07:30.720> it<00:07:30.870> out

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:31.100 
to a bin or sink and drain it out

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.470 
to a bin or sink and drain it out
without<00:07:32.100> any<00:07:32.400> problems<00:07:32.820> and<00:07:32.940> then<00:07:33.090> to<00:07:33.330> do<00:07:33.450> the

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:33.480 
without any problems and then to do the

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:36.650 
without any problems and then to do the
hoses<00:07:33.930> I<00:07:34.200> just<00:07:34.740> take<00:07:34.920> a<00:07:34.950> male<00:07:35.610> one<00:07:35.880> and<00:07:36.420> put<00:07:36.630> it

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 
hoses I just take a male one and put it

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.240 
hoses I just take a male one and put it
in<00:07:36.840> here<00:07:37.020> and<00:07:37.080> that<00:07:37.230> becomes<00:07:37.590> the<00:07:37.800> drain<00:07:38.010> point

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:38.250 
in here and that becomes the drain point

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.060 
in here and that becomes the drain point
and<00:07:38.700> it'll<00:07:38.880> drain<00:07:39.150> right<00:07:39.390> out<00:07:39.570> into<00:07:39.930> it<00:07:40.320> so<00:07:40.530> it

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:41.070 
and it'll drain right out into it so it

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.740 
and it'll drain right out into it so it
makes<00:07:41.280> it<00:07:41.400> very<00:07:41.550> simple<00:07:41.850> to<00:07:42.060> maintain<00:07:42.330> your

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:42.750 
makes it very simple to maintain your

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:44.810 
makes it very simple to maintain your
water<00:07:43.110> cooling<00:07:43.440> loop<00:07:43.650> when<00:07:44.280> you're<00:07:44.400> using<00:07:44.580> a

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:44.820 
water cooling loop when you're using a

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:46.280 
water cooling loop when you're using a
quick<00:07:45.030> disconnects<00:07:45.630> I<00:07:45.750> can't<00:07:45.960> say<00:07:46.140> enough

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.290 
quick disconnects I can't say enough

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.830 
quick disconnects I can't say enough
about<00:07:46.410> on<00:07:46.740> mine<00:07:46.890> I<00:07:47.070> don't<00:07:47.640> never<00:07:48.240> have<00:07:48.480> a<00:07:48.510> water

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 
about on mine I don't never have a water

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.910 
about on mine I don't never have a water
cooling<00:07:49.230> build<00:07:49.710> that<00:07:50.430> I<00:07:50.490> will<00:07:50.760> not<00:07:50.910> use<00:07:51.180> them

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:51.920 
cooling build that I will not use them

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:57.860 
cooling build that I will not use them
so<00:07:53.300> that's<00:07:54.300> it<00:07:54.960> I<00:07:55.140> hope<00:07:55.320> that<00:07:55.590> does<00:07:55.800> help<00:07:56.870> if

00:07:57.860 --> 00:07:57.870 
so that's it I hope that does help if

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.390 
so that's it I hope that does help if
