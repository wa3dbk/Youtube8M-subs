variation<00:00:11.889> of<00:00:12.129> like<00:00:12.309> a<00:00:12.340> snapper<00:00:12.910> kind<00:00:13.180> of

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.270 
variation of like a snapper kind of

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.080 
variation of like a snapper kind of
monster<00:00:13.719> kind<00:00:14.020> of<00:00:14.080> thing<00:00:14.289> and<00:00:14.889> you<00:00:15.549> can<00:00:15.850> you

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
monster kind of thing and you can you

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.550 
monster kind of thing and you can you
know<00:00:16.119> painting<00:00:16.539> up<00:00:16.750> and<00:00:16.900> design<00:00:17.170> it<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.350> make

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
know painting up and design it to make

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.510 
know painting up and design it to make
it<00:00:17.680> all<00:00:17.770> sorts<00:00:17.980> of<00:00:18.039> different<00:00:18.220> things

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
it all sorts of different things

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.310 
it all sorts of different things
depending<00:00:18.699> on<00:00:19.060> what<00:00:19.330> you<00:00:19.480> want<00:00:19.689> it<00:00:19.779> to<00:00:19.810> pretend

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
depending on what you want it to pretend

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.950 
depending on what you want it to pretend
it<00:00:20.439> to<00:00:20.560> be<00:00:20.679> but<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:22.029> particular<00:00:22.269> origami

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
it to be but this particular origami

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.990 
it to be but this particular origami
works<00:00:23.140> really<00:00:23.439> well<00:00:23.710> with<00:00:24.039> rectangular<00:00:24.670> paper

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
works really well with rectangular paper

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.050 
works really well with rectangular paper
so<00:00:25.810> it's<00:00:26.560> really<00:00:26.919> kind<00:00:27.220> of<00:00:27.400> well<00:00:27.609> suited<00:00:28.029> for

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
so it's really kind of well suited for

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.989 
so it's really kind of well suited for
printer<00:00:28.749> paper<00:00:29.099> whether<00:00:30.099> that<00:00:30.339> be<00:00:30.490> like<00:00:30.699> us

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
printer paper whether that be like us

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:34.020 
printer paper whether that be like us
letter<00:00:31.210> or<00:00:31.509> a<00:00:31.539> for<00:00:32.020> those<00:00:32.920> kinds<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.340> sizes<00:00:33.640> all

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
letter or a for those kinds of sizes all

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.720 
letter or a for those kinds of sizes all
work<00:00:34.210> really<00:00:34.390> good<00:00:34.630> so<00:00:35.050> and<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.010> paper<00:00:36.220> folds

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
work really good so and the paper folds

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.540 
work really good so and the paper folds
are<00:00:36.940> pretty<00:00:37.240> limit<00:00:37.930> are<00:00:38.170> you<00:00:38.500> know<00:00:38.620> not<00:00:39.310> very

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
are pretty limit are you know not very

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.160 
are pretty limit are you know not very
difficult<00:00:39.820> so<00:00:40.240> you<00:00:40.270> can<00:00:40.540> use<00:00:40.690> thicker<00:00:41.020> paper

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
difficult so you can use thicker paper

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.320 
difficult so you can use thicker paper
and<00:00:41.410> have<00:00:41.590> it<00:00:41.800> work<00:00:41.980> really<00:00:42.280> good<00:00:42.580> I'm<00:00:43.120> just

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
and have it work really good I'm just

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.480 
and have it work really good I'm just
gonna<00:00:43.510> be<00:00:43.720> using<00:00:43.900> some<00:00:44.140> paper<00:00:44.620> that's<00:00:45.070> origami

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
gonna be using some paper that's origami

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.550 
gonna be using some paper that's origami
paper<00:00:45.730> that's<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.150> little<00:00:46.360> it's<00:00:47.230> about<00:00:47.410> the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
paper that's a little it's about the

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.370 
paper that's a little it's about the
same<00:00:47.770> dimension<00:00:48.250> as<00:00:48.400> an<00:00:48.760> a4<00:00:49.000> so<00:00:49.450> it's<00:00:49.540> about<00:00:49.750> 17

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:50.380 
same dimension as an a4 so it's about 17

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.290 
same dimension as an a4 so it's about 17
and<00:00:50.590> 1/2<00:00:50.650> centimeters<00:00:51.630> by<00:00:52.630> 12<00:00:53.290> point<00:00:53.890> 2

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and 1/2 centimeters by 12 point 2

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.480 
and 1/2 centimeters by 12 point 2
centimeters<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.680> need<00:00:56.830> one<00:00:56.860> piece<00:00:57.160> and

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
centimeters you just need one piece and

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.890 
centimeters you just need one piece and
then<00:00:57.640> I'll<00:00:57.940> let<00:00:58.060> you<00:00:58.120> guys<00:00:58.300> know<00:00:58.330> how<00:00:58.690> big

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
our paper and I want to actually start

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.370 
our paper and I want to actually start
off<00:01:17.650> with<00:01:18.010> my<00:01:18.280> color<00:01:18.550> side<00:01:18.880> facing<00:01:19.690> up<00:01:19.870> and

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
off with my color side facing up and

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.010 
off with my color side facing up and
we're<00:01:21.340> just<00:01:21.370> gonna<00:01:21.670> go<00:01:21.820> ahead<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.150> fold<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.630> in

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
we're just gonna go ahead and fold it in

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.880 
we're just gonna go ahead and fold it in
half<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:25.180> fold<00:01:25.480> it<00:01:25.600> in<00:01:25.690> half<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.170> then<00:01:26.560> we<00:01:26.680> want

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
half so fold it in half and then we want

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.890 
half so fold it in half and then we want
to<00:01:26.950> go<00:01:27.070> ahead<00:01:27.159> and<00:01:27.460> actually<00:01:27.640> create<00:01:28.240> another

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
to go ahead and actually create another

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.210 
to go ahead and actually create another
crease<00:01:29.230> like<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:29.560> see<00:01:29.770> here<00:01:29.980> I've<00:01:30.130> already

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
crease like you see here I've already

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.590 
crease like you see here I've already
folded<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.850> we're<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.000> gonna<00:01:31.180> go<00:01:31.390> ahead<00:01:31.450> and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
folded it we're just gonna go ahead and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.630 
folded it we're just gonna go ahead and
fold<00:01:31.870> in<00:01:32.170> half<00:01:32.380> again<00:01:32.620> here<00:01:33.159> in<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.340> center

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
fold in half again here in the center

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.630 
fold in half again here in the center
get<00:01:34.330> a<00:01:34.360> good<00:01:34.600> crease<00:01:34.810> going<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:36.070> then<00:01:36.550> you

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
get a good crease going and then you

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.830 
get a good crease going and then you
want<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.790> make<00:01:36.940> sure<00:01:37.120> that<00:01:37.270> you've<00:01:37.450> got<00:01:37.510> those

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
want to make sure that you've got those

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.580 
want to make sure that you've got those
open<00:01:38.320> flaps<00:01:38.650> facing<00:01:39.520> towards<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.659> we're

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
open flaps facing towards you and we're

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.440

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
going to take to that Center crease

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.569 
going to take to that Center crease
we'll<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.269> take<00:02:10.420> each<00:02:10.599> one<00:02:10.810> of<00:02:10.959> these<00:02:11.579> fold

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
we'll just take each one of these fold

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.780 
we'll just take each one of these fold
it<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:13.469> towards<00:02:14.469> that<00:02:14.650> creased<00:02:15.040> line<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.670> we

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
it in towards that creased line that we

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.140 
it in towards that creased line that we
see

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
see

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:26.190

right<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> middle<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.780> you<00:02:25.840> something

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
right in the middle so you something

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.339 
right in the middle so you something
like<00:02:26.349> this<00:02:27.480> then<00:02:28.480> I'm<00:02:28.810> just<00:02:28.930> gonna<00:02:29.079> go<00:02:29.260> and

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
weird so we've got these four places now

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:11.039 
weird so we've got these four places now
that<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.939> can<00:03:10.090> fold<00:03:10.329> up<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:10.750> what<00:03:10.840> we're<00:03:10.959> gonna

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049 
that we can fold up and what we're gonna

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:13.140 
that we can fold up and what we're gonna
do<00:03:11.290> is<00:03:11.409> just<00:03:11.439> take<00:03:11.680> and<00:03:12.220> fold<00:03:12.400> from<00:03:12.700> that<00:03:12.879> point

where we cut all the way over to this

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.780 
where we cut all the way over to this
corner<00:03:16.859> try<00:03:17.859> your<00:03:17.980> best<00:03:18.099> to<00:03:18.250> keep<00:03:18.340> things

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
corner try your best to keep things

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.050 
corner try your best to keep things
straight<00:03:19.180> if<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:21.310> smooth<00:03:21.760> things

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
straight if you can and smooth things

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.509

out<00:03:22.269> so<00:03:22.599> that<00:03:22.720> you<00:03:22.780> get<00:03:22.900> an<00:03:23.049> even<00:03:23.500> kind<00:03:24.340> of

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
out so that you get an even kind of

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:27.569 
out so that you get an even kind of
crease<00:03:24.849> going<00:03:25.299> both<00:03:25.480> ways<00:03:25.510> here<00:03:26.400> get<00:03:27.400> both<00:03:27.549> of

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
crease going both ways here get both of

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.150 
crease going both ways here get both of
those<00:03:27.819> sides<00:03:28.060> fold<00:03:28.269> it<00:03:28.419> over<00:03:28.510> like<00:03:28.720> this<00:03:29.160> I'll

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160
