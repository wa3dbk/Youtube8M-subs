 which they are about the points of jay things 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.409

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.440
 of prize 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.190
 because we are really interested in the phantom 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.829
 2 with true beauty for example 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.309
 here is the control which operates if not 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.440
 I'm wrong in 5.8 in exercise if I 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.710
 I would put it wrong here 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.290
 I ordered this package by ebay hong 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.870
 kong and I take approximately two 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.130
 weeks to arrive 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:20.360
 now search quickly everything 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.000
 remains in the box and put it on one side 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.510
 It is important to mention that this phantom 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.790
 I asked for it with the senior stabilizer 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.180
 and this is practically all that 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.250

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.340
 very expensive lights that come in the 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.680
 phantom to know if there is any problem 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.760
 with the 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.420
 what I have here is the senior 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.090

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.800

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.950

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.920
 down and in turn to tennis and this 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:21.590
 accessory is like an insurance so that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:25.410

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.830
 inscription 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.180
 this type 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.630
 and we are going to do practically 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.490
 return to the bag for 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.920
 not lose anything 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.930
 that is to open now what are the propellers 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.880
 to mount them quickly but what 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.390
 important to mention is that a 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.600
 difference of the phantom one these are 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.320
 self screwed that is when they are 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.460
 working 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.310
 anthony squeeze themselves 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.630
 in the holy world had to be screwed 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.420
 from school 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.770
 with a nut no longer necessary in the 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.640
 phantom 2 is a great update to me 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.630
 seem to compare them quickly let's say 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.730
 these insurance is important to read well 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.290
 the instructions here as you can see 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.660
 this container and here they do not have to 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.230
 understand a white dot serves to 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.230
 know how to put socially 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.400
 it's important I remind you to read all the 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.769
 manual before first school 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:23.870
 childish 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.729
 highlight how passes next charger 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.729
 it also comes with a cable 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.090
 It is also important to download the 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:38.439
 fandom software both the bank as 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:43.419
 of the control where it stops 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:43.419
 charger enough 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.680
 at that time we were able to adjust 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.630
 quickly how to connect your cable to 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 control 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:56.230
 it's important as I say download 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.880
 the software and update verify if 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.790

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.720
 remote control as for the phantom 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.070
 that's the way a god works 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:12.310
 so much so that you share 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.930
 it remains really horizontal and not only 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.680
 that can also be controlled with this 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.680
 small knob
