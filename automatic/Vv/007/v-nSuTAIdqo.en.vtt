have to actually put me on the heart and
lung<00:03:54.829> machine<00:03:55.010> which<00:03:55.700> means<00:03:55.970> they<00:03:56.060> have<00:03:56.209> to

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:56.389 
lung machine which means they have to

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.129 
lung machine which means they have to
stop<00:03:56.810> my<00:03:57.739> heart<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.720> essentially<00:03:59.720> stop<00:03:59.959> my

if I'm a bit nervous I'm a little bit a

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.960 
if I'm a bit nervous I'm a little bit a
little<00:05:35.180> bit<00:05:35.660> nervous<00:05:35.990> but<00:05:36.320> not<00:05:36.380> not<00:05:37.310> a<00:05:37.370> lot<00:05:37.729> I

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
little bit nervous but not not a lot I

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.240 
little bit nervous but not not a lot I
mean<00:05:38.150> not<00:05:38.900> as<00:05:39.050> much<00:05:39.200> as<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.470> probably<00:05:39.710> should<00:05:39.860> be
