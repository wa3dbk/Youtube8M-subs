blues nail on the one chord then it'll

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.360 
blues nail on the one chord then it'll
switch<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> four<00:01:01.440> chord<00:01:01.739> which<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.949> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.020 

then<00:01:10.770> it'll<00:01:10.979> go<00:01:11.100> back<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.729> chord

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
then it'll go back to the one chord

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.070 
then it'll go back to the one chord
which<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> where<00:01:12.630> we<00:01:12.750> should<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:18.080> here

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
which is where we should not in here

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.210 
which is where we should not in here
comes<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> tricky<00:01:19.619> part<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
comes a tricky part we're going to

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.710 
comes a tricky part we're going to
instead<00:01:20.490> of<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.970> four<00:01:21.210> chord<00:01:21.509> we're

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
instead of going to the four chord we're

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.690 
instead of going to the four chord we're
going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> move<00:01:22.110> two<00:01:22.770> steps<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.310> from<00:01:23.580> where

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to move two steps up from where

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to move two steps up from where
that<00:01:23.850> four<00:01:24.150> chord<00:01:24.420> was<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.869> play<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> blues

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that four chord was and play a blues

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.410 
that four chord was and play a blues
scale<00:01:25.470> there<00:01:31.700> then<00:01:32.700> we're<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> move<00:01:33.119> two

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
scale there then we're going to move two

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
scale there then we're going to move two
frets<00:01:33.689> downward<00:01:34.259> back<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> four<00:01:35.130> chord

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
frets downward back to the four chord

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
frets downward back to the four chord
position<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.299> finally<00:01:42.299> back<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.780> one

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
position and finally back to the one

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.000 
position and finally back to the one
chord

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.770 

so<00:01:49.010> this<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.310> playing<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.729> blue<00:01:49.970> scale<00:01:50.360> on<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
so this is playing the blue scale on the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.980 
so this is playing the blue scale on the
one<00:01:51.020> four<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:52.070> five<00:01:52.400> chord<00:01:52.760> positions<00:01:53.330> what

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
one four and five chord positions what

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.450 
one four and five chord positions what
someone<00:01:54.380> would<00:01:54.560> be<00:01:54.650> doing<00:01:54.950> while<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.310> were

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
someone would be doing while you were

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.980 
someone would be doing while you were
doing<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.850> scales<00:01:56.180> there<00:01:56.450> like<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.810> would

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
doing the scales there like that would

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.070 
doing the scales there like that would
be<00:01:57.110> they'd<00:01:57.260> be<00:01:57.320> playing<00:01:57.650> the<00:01:57.830> one<00:01:58.190> chord<00:01:59.080> then

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
be they'd be playing the one chord then

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.160 
be they'd be playing the one chord then
they'd<00:02:00.259> be<00:02:00.320> playing<00:02:00.650> the<00:02:00.950> four<00:02:01.250> chord<00:02:02.170> then

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
they'd be playing the four chord then

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.109 
they'd be playing the four chord then
they'd<00:02:03.380> be<00:02:03.440> playing<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:04.009> five<00:02:04.280> chord<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:08.000> it

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
they'd be playing the five chord so it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.790 
they'd be playing the five chord so it
all<00:02:08.239> fits<00:02:08.450> together<00:02:08.630> have<00:02:09.170> fun<00:02:09.200> playing<00:02:09.679> the

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
