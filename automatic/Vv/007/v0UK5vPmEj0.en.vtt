00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.500
 playful quality in one 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.329
 want caked future scenario but 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.219
 it has been very quiet for some time now 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.020
 the project has probably been there 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.229
 the development focus is fully on the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.000
 witcher 3 is still about new picture 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.740

 whole concept around the brand deus ex 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.920
 universe includes titles for pc consoles 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.009

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.709
 Books at e3 2014, however, was of it 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.510
 no trace here, too 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:19.400
 We learn more at gamescom 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.370
 It was that look at the fair 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.549
 her new song like survival crafting fun 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.079
 shooter mix fortnight but not man 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.389
 just talked to others 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.099
 companies about companies things press their 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:35.440
 however, it was possible to imagine new projects 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.440
 apparently not planning on the i3 2014 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.130
 the new gearbox shooter furious before the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 By the way, nothing more with the brothers in 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.419
 arms row has remained to do the i3 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.530
 Details on the game by randy 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.269
 pitchford in february 2013 and the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.799
 announcement that ubisoft the title 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.799
 definitely will not drive away 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.090
 half life 3 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.670
 a game of its development actually 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.910
 as official as 2013 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.710
 military restricted area 5 yuan 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.000
 The US military base area 5 was won 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.740
 and thus the subject of many 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.960
 conspiracy theories long time as 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.600
 not existing is the continuation of the 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.180
 legendary shooters as well 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.310
 mysterious as overdue becomes the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.950
 title exclusively for the cinema it appears 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.770
 Exclusive fairway only with oculus rift 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.230
 competition team via as many 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.209
 also leads after the g3 2014 of the years 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:36.840
 title has three to nothing more than 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:39.300
 Pure speculation becomes a triple a 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.730
 title for pc and next gen consoles with 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.800
 the main character agent for the seven the 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.120
 same 2 engine should be the largest and 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.580
 most detailed levels of the hitman 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.010
 history does not offer sandbox gameplay 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.959
 linear and no checkpoints one 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.450
 living world you want more 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.770
 Details are not just this info 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.110
 snippets since theirs 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.880
 leak beginning in 2014 until the release 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.220
 could still blatantly change 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.080
 also jo interactive active window on 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.080
 the three in 2014 by absence 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.370
 evelin studios and thus the makers of 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.680
 just cause work from warner bros 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.840
 a mad max title which actually like 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.419
 the blow ring fisted open 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.280
 After all , it's mad max with the 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.050
 Template for an open world title with 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.810
 sprawling post-apocalyptic 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.970
 Landscapes are ideal on the 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.919
 gamescom 2013 already has gameplay scenes 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.450
 later this title at the e3 2014 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.000
 warner bros wants to get closer to the release 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.710
 the 2015 appear new mad max movie 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.750
 actually do not put a bad idea 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.000
 from a player's point of view, however, a pity 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.710
 the game has potential for big ones 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.810
 game humor of arrival and 2011 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 published trailer to prey 2 knew 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.540
 to inspire 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.460
 after alleged attitudes of the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.110
 project through zenimax media and the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.880
 Developer Studio to recognize change 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.410
 studios seething it now in the 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.610
 rumored kitchen and it's the title 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.500
 will be further developed 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.479
 in comparison to the former concept 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.639
 however, these titles are completely changed 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.500
