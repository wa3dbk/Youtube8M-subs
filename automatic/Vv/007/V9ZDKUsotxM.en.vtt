00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.320
 behalf of the day dear lovers of solar 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:21.160
 grapes near many heard in 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 reward such a term as extensions here 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:29.920
 I want to show some example when 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.960
 the decision then which berries from flowering 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.489
 fertilized berries are obtained and 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.140
 peculiar to the variety 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:40.690
 such small seedless here if such 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.260
 berries should be here full 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.710
 seed 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:50.379
 berries are characteristic of the size of these berries 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:53.170
 they are both small and seedless and it happens 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.720
 mainly functional varieties 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:00.100
 female type of flower and or variety there is 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.949
 such bisexual prone to irrigation and so 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.930
 why does this happen mainly if 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.760
 on the functional types of female 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:14.380
 the flower is not enough pollen which 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.509
 pollinates the inflorescence itself and the board does not 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.329
 the fruit itself develops the berries remain 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:24.909
 such small bessie itself is not formed 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:28.829
 the basis then comes also from when go 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:31.270
 rains during pollination or extreme heat 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:36.429
 also about the product already in grade there are such 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:39.520
 tend to avoid so here is the flaw 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:41.490
 you can because it does not allow 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.429
 neglect inflorescence during flowering 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 plus additional processing 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.200
 trace elements with high content 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.689
 bora 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.149
 zinc availability varietal water or those 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.210
 no less refuse these varieties 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.619
 us functionally female type of flower i 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.990
 I think no one will be like that 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.950
 popular varieties that have become classics 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:09.490
 as clara's present for a couple right there 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.910
 mascot cache 1 well of course 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.670
 flaws are not marketability 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.200
 most berries though these berries which 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.069
 smaller they are more sludge and sweeter 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.540
 on my 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:29.709
 both taste and ripen a little earlier 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.639
 full I basically so obvious 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.510
 a sign of strong irrigation luck 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.510
 stable yields
