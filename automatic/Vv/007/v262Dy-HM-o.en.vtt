00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.370
 servers so that the big ones we're going to 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.860
 enter to serve the games 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:32.260
 games the game alone is not in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 service so they can try the 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:38.549
 server 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.560
 one is called the survival one I imagine that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.840
 this as well as the server there 74 74 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.840
 people are 500 so if they can enter 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.150
 here as you see they give us an armor of 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:02.490
 full iron I put it 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.320

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:17.420
 read the rules in the server's forum 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:20.910
 of tutorials and then we got off 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.150
 let's see why as well here they are 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.570
 the worlds the normal the desert and the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.350
 fear or be the normal I imagine it will be 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:35.880
 a biome as well as any other 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:40.320
 Desert desert and the desert 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:44.420
 search resources in google stores 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.790
 well maybe and here are the portals and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.790
 the warriors 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:10.180
 the world nor the color 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:10.180
 I'm going to go to the farm over here 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.470
 and also for that interruption but already 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:19.560
 we are here of equality and 1 this is the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.390
 farm guardian who is inside the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:28.650
 works from the server world its rival and 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.870
 right here I just players imagine that 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.130
 it will be a farm with cows action for 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.520
 get eating as good maybe 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.520
 because imagine 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:48.790
 I'll prove I'm your baby and is 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.069
 absolutely what you have to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.209
 previously 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:58.370
 to see with a center 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.819
 because as nap and mediation 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.180
 watch 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.450
 as you see here according to response of being two 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.900
 you can kill them and it 's who gets 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.860
 money look like they say the chat 20 by 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:16.760
 kill a pig are fixed 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:20.390
 but we checked and I did not this server 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.060
 it is for the appearance 1.7 points 11 11 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:25.400
 points 7 104 to which I am in 1.7 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.020
 points 2 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.740
 I say you can not notice them perfectly 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 so let's see 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:52.470
 a bit a favorite online subscription 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.129
 can help us a lot internally more 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.050
 because this one has just started 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:00.620
 when I hope you like the content 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:04.400
 that goes up so much 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.990
 and well let's continue killing sheep and 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.470
 well this is a bit of what the 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.470
 server 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.889
 4 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.540
 I'm going to put drugs 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.320
 drugs are our idols were us 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:38.340
 and see if this is going to see the vodka here 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:44.070
 they all go to see how much I have fretes 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:46.890
 just like the week and I have one thousand 220 more 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:50.500
 but for cannes 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:52.900
 this cocaine is sugar the vodka is 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.200
 I imagine that a bottle of rum from 'la 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:58.990
 stain 'is good these are the drugs 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.760
 the different drugs that there are and here 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.830
 is the store also as you see here 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:05.500
 you can buy it way you see it all oak 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:07.960
 for making your house 18 good but that 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.820
 keeps showing this server if this one 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.930
 remember that with a layman a 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.380
 subscription because it helps a lot 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.650
 train and well I'm wiland and up
