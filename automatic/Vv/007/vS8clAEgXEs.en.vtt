00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.649
 sam in rome for the press conference of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 launch presentation of the congress 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.120
 national yacht association 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.559
 Italian thoracic oncology yes 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.790
 will open tomorrow in Naples 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.740
 the congress has as its theme 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 immunotherapy, cancer, the field in 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.750
 this case the lung tumor one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.340
 of the big killers a tumor for which 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
 until very recently the answers 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.720
 therapeutic treatments were very limited and for 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.010
 which now truly opens one 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.500
 new care perspective thanks 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.020
 to immunotherapy we talk about it with the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.969
 Dr. Cesare Gridelli President of the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.050
 yacht and director of the department of 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.520
 onco hematology at the company 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.719
 hospital of avellino 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.430
 then doctor see I told him 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.930
 generically immuno cancer therapy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.700
 but what are these drugs and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.809
 especially how they work 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.960
 today they get up understand so many things up 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.890
 for for decades already about 50 years it is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 proven 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.820
 immunotherapy in the treatment of tumors but 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.350
 in reality, little had been understood 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.550
 understood little because one only tries to 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 stimulate the immune system 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 of the organism however in reality it was not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.030
 understood that the tumor put gods 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.680
 defense mechanisms that went to 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.520
 block to inactivate the system 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.130
 immune 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.909
 so today they are new drugs 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.280
 we are inhibitors of the check point ie of 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.009
 an important hub that they are 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.619
 drugs mainly anti pd uno 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.810
 of the ancient pdl one that in reality 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.350
 they only go monoclonal antibody which 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.930
 they go to block 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.580
 actually some receptors present 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.560
 on cancer cells that have their own 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.299
 the task of going to inactivate the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.680
 lymphocytes and therefore the answer 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.450
 body immune system 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.190
 these drugs already have names they are 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.570
 al nivolo but villepin bronze but have 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.890
 others known for now only as 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.540
 of the abbreviations the first one is already even 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.880
 been approved in america already had 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.979
 the preliminary okay in europe here is that 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.570
 prospects of care open up in the tumor 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.810
 of the lung which are the advantages that 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.880
 they can take a lot 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.770
 important to date are already a standard 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.729
 There is a second line of treatment 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.679
 crazy who made one 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.560
 chemotherapy that they had a 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.810
 success with so-called chemotherapy 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.229
 to the first-line treatment in second 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.819
 line the nivolo but becomes a standard 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.069
 both for the scaly and the non 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.519
 scaly make that already tried at 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.920
 moment in the united states and knowing how to be 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.540
 approved in Europe and is a common use 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.340
 just in the united states right there then 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.590
 in second line of treatment in place 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.180
 of chemotherapy 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.890
 here they are press conference, let's say 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.880
 emphasized important difference between 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.890
 traditional chemotherapy 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.079
 immunotherapy especially as far as 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.610
 then it concerns the parameters with which these 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.410
 drugs through which these 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.930
 drugs are judged and that is the 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.600
 median survival because there is this 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.859
 difference normally we are used to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.870
 to evaluate also knows that suffering 

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:47.299
 median of the entire population of the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.769
 patients is already even in this respect 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.480
 to chemotherapy in studies 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.890
 registrations that have demonstrated the 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 superiority over chemo by 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.790
 second line with docetaxel taxotere 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.010
 in flight but has shown an advantage 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.660
 net of a 3-month suffering increase 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.370
 median compared to the end but what 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.450
 it is important to see instead 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.400
 these so-called cases of 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.970
 chronic disease that is, 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.560
 patients living in two years to three years 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.329
 normally with chemotherapy i 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.420
 patients have a survival in 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.190
 second line of 8 9 months ten months e 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.989
 instead with these muds it begins to 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.640
 see from the first data even from the phase 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.680
 1 enlarged over a few hundred 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.959
 patients with volumes in patients 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.030
 heavily pre processed about 20 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.380
 percent are alive at three years then 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.730
 this is important however for the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.670
 production of these children is not 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.860
 answer when the ball pfs progression 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.950
 free survival the median 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.680
 the percentage of patients living at 2 to 3 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.030
 years went very important 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.860
 taking into account that we are not talking a 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.690
 patient we say yes standard but of 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.190
 patients in the most severe phases when 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.260
 now the prospects were before 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.330
 really very limited and so we talk 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.730
 always of patients tax me in phase 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.860
 largely advanced smoking patients 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.810
 this is another feature of 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 benefit of however they are made in 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.200
 smoking patients because it is good 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.790
 who seeks the last few years with 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.310
 lengthening by setting the solvency 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.150
 with molecular target drugs 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.590
 lurking in a small group of 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.750
 patients about 15 percent 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.880
 predominantly non-smoking 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.739
 oral drugs small molecules 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.180
 while instead these makes me 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.530
 demonstrating the benefit just one 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.010
 therefore most patients 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.440
 let's talk about 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.209
 finally to 80 85 percent of the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.620
 population and you think I understand 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.840
 that there is also the big difference in 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 terms of tolerability between chemo and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.890
 these immunotherapeutic drugs figure 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.750
 better and the comparison studies the 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.700
 Immunotherapy was clearly better 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.110
 tolerated than doce tax to 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.000
 second-line chemo therapy 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.400
 there are however some toxicities that 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.530
 they must be identified immediately with experience 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.360
 and those generally treated by difficult nick 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.919
 steroids with good results of 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.660
 resolution but is a small leh keen 

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:46.580
 percentage of cases linked to the system 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.280
 I always do the inter.it e 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.780
 or there and the hypophysis as a case of 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.250
 pneumonia but we want to mess in 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.200
 low around one percent then 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.270
 really the restraining to recommend 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.030
 very well tolerated without the professor 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.740
 congress is called reality and hopes e 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.390
 I wish we started with congress 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.280
 I would like to finish with the congress which is the 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.320
 reality today what are the hopes 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.750
 I imagine for the future linked to these 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.640
 This and keep drugs in Naples is a 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.760
 international congress are the most 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.330
 world leading experts in immunotherapy 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.490
 and then on all immunotherapy 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.050
 in the field of lung cancer 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.330
 actually they are the ones we have already seen 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.400
 that actually the nivolo a hub is a 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.409
 standard frozen drug in ds 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.110
 second line of invasive treatments 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.000
 and we advanced with a small casone 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.830
 cells that are progressing with the 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.539
 chimera for hopes are to bring 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.009
 these drugs are on the front line 

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:38.050
 use them instead of chemotherapy 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.639
 as a first treatment and I already have this 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.129
 there are more studies in progress than 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.020
 expect the result is here we are 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.969
 also participating in the other large one 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.370
 hope is always bring these fans there 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:49.629
 an earlier stage of illness but this 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.400
 it is also here that the parties have also started 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.810
 studies after surgery that 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.729
 unfortunately in lung cancer of the 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.800
 most patients relapse e 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.629
 instead there are practically these 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.280
 studies where after surgery comes 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.840
 then performed at immunotherapy 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.330
 in the hope that then these benefits 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:07.530
 they bring in this case in the 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.530
 concreteness of healing
