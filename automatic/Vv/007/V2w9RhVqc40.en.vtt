 varieties in the history of cooks 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:05:02.280
 that we eat that is something that is given away 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.280
 for what is missing 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:11.920
 the book already has it there surely 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:11.920
 some tree is missing something but not 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.050

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.390
 classic of the erÃ­a of yesteryear we are going to 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.460

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.230
 with banana sweet milk but the banana 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.840
 split into a dessert that would translate 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:44.140
 classically in such an elongated dish a 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.370
 shallow and he had a banana like that 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:51.430
 as it is cut in half along 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.410
 between these two slices of bananas they were going 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.320
 three bags of ice cream that guesses that 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.810
 attracting leonardo because he already knows several 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.580
 tastes had chocolate had sweet 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:04.800
 American milk and frutillar 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.800
 we all put half of the banana 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:15.639
 let's put the second one is propitious that 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.990
 here is already prepared a genie in the 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:18.990
 deposit I have a warm hand 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:23.900
 the 87 a classic but plastic and by the 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.000
 classic 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:31.190
 and we have the chocolate here 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.729
 of different tastes of the banana a 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:38.199
 banana side of the other we close here 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.199
 As if this were not enough 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.260
 on each side 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.400
 very good and even him for chocolate 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.120
 and the creams 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.020
 it has come true 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.069
 beautiful 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.069
 but a little bit 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.850
 of soul rating but I'm not such a fan 

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:15.520
 then I prefer to be these natural 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:15.520
 to share the first date 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.200
 put it you put it in the middle and one of 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.520
 each side 

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:26.150
 being there until you get to the 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.150
 sachet of me 

00:07:32.989 --> 00:07:35.989
 delegation 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:44.710
 super classic and finally we have 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.710
 to queue for entry 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:54.090
 there goes classic forest chocolate sauce 

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.090
 Awesome
