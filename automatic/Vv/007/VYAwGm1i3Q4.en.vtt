00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
South Carolina being the entire breadth

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.530 
South Carolina being the entire breadth
of<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:26.460> military<00:01:27.210> having<00:01:27.840> Florida<00:01:28.320> Texas

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540

California<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:32.130> touched<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.970> over<00:01:33.150> here<00:01:33.329> so

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
California I touched it over here so

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990 
California I touched it over here so
that's<00:01:33.630> good<00:01:33.810> enough<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.259> this<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.520> here

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that's good enough for this to be here

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.890 
that's good enough for this to be here
so<00:01:36.390> basically<00:01:37.970> when<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.299> thing<00:01:39.600> finally

this being the entire breadth of the
Jade<00:02:18.080> helm<00:02:21.160> situation<00:02:22.160> now<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.240> imagine<00:02:23.780> that

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
Jade helm situation now I imagine that

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.350 
Jade helm situation now I imagine that
there<00:02:24.319> are<00:02:24.790> yes<00:02:25.790> this<00:02:26.000> coming<00:02:26.270> from

there are yes this coming from
Washington<00:02:26.540> state<00:02:27.110> search<00:02:27.380> comets<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.250> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
Washington state search comets and that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.820 
Washington state search comets and that
I<00:02:28.550> used<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.060> also<00:02:29.780> cut<00:02:30.080> it<00:02:30.200> down<00:02:30.319> so<00:02:30.380> I<00:02:30.650> can

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
I used I also cut it down so I can

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.180 
I used I also cut it down so I can
actually<00:02:31.010> use<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.489> for<00:02:31.520> this<00:02:31.790> purpose<00:02:32.090> and<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
actually use it for this purpose and I

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.380 
actually use it for this purpose and I
still<00:02:34.610> believe

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.680 

let's<00:02:38.390> do<00:02:38.569> black<00:02:39.110> being<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:40.120> solid<00:02:41.120> color<00:02:41.390> so

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
let's do black being the solid color so

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.300 
let's do black being the solid color so
that<00:02:41.720> everybody<00:02:42.200> knows<00:02:42.319> everything<00:02:43.160> that's

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
do partial arrows here and if you look

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.620 
do partial arrows here and if you look
even<00:04:16.359> closely<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:18.340> imagine<00:04:18.850> some<00:04:19.299> out<00:04:19.600> of

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
even closely and I imagine some out of

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.350 
even closely and I imagine some out of
here<00:04:20.109> I'll<00:04:20.380> just<00:04:20.620> do<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.070> little<00:04:21.280> arrow<00:04:21.880> here<00:04:22.030> to

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
here I'll just do a little arrow here to

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.850 
here I'll just do a little arrow here to
show<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:23.020> original<00:04:23.500> 13<00:04:25.260> I'll<00:04:26.260> just<00:04:26.410> do<00:04:26.620> this

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
show the original 13 I'll just do this

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.300 
show the original 13 I'll just do this
down<00:04:27.130> here<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:28.650> that's<00:04:29.650> basically<00:04:30.040> what<00:04:30.280> I

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
down here so that's basically what I

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.240 
down here so that's basically what I
think<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:30.760> JDL<00:04:31.150> would<00:04:31.419> be<00:04:31.860> absolute<00:04:33.130> hit

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
think the JDL would be absolute hit

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.490 
think the JDL would be absolute hit
the<00:04:33.280> fan<00:04:33.810> and<00:04:34.810> if<00:04:35.470> you<00:04:35.590> notice<00:04:35.950> there's<00:04:36.520> a<00:04:36.610> nice

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
the fan and if you notice there's a nice

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.800 
the fan and if you notice there's a nice
line<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:39.190> they<00:04:39.340> can<00:04:39.490> either<00:04:39.610> push<00:04:39.940> up<00:04:40.120> or

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
line that they can either push up or

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.870 
line that they can either push up or
push<00:04:41.110> down<00:04:42.600> so<00:04:43.860> basically<00:04:44.860> folks<00:04:45.160> this<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.700> it

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
push down so basically folks this is it

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.550 
push down so basically folks this is it
and<00:04:47.280> if<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:48.490> are<00:04:48.640> how<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.000> did<00:04:49.330> this<00:04:49.540> if<00:04:49.930> you

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
and if you are how I did this if you

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.790 
and if you are how I did this if you
have<00:04:50.740> xsplit<00:04:51.250> what<00:04:51.430> I<00:04:51.460> did<00:04:51.990> was<00:04:52.990> I<00:04:53.320> opened<00:04:53.710> the

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
have xsplit what I did was I opened the

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.820 
have xsplit what I did was I opened the
image<00:04:54.360> okay<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.600> then<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:55.870> put<00:04:56.110> my<00:04:56.140> white<00:04:56.590> board

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
image okay and then I put my white board

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.100 
image okay and then I put my white board
up<00:04:57.190> over<00:04:57.669> it<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.970> then<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.660> allowed<00:04:58.900> me<00:04:59.080> to

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
up over it and then that allowed me to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.340 
up over it and then that allowed me to
draw<00:04:59.500> on<00:04:59.680> what<00:04:59.950> I<00:04:59.979> saw
