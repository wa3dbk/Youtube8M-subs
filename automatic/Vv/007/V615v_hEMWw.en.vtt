00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
found my about page this game was just

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.079 
found my about page this game was just
updated<00:00:13.380> i<00:00:13.559> open<00:00:13.830> steamed<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.280> it<00:00:14.370> updated<00:00:14.790> to

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
updated i open steamed and it updated to

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.080 
updated i open steamed and it updated to
hatch<00:00:15.570> one<00:00:15.900> point<00:00:16.199> five<00:00:16.529> point<00:00:16.590> one<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.029> a

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
hatch one point five point one it was a

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.090 
hatch one point five point one it was a
really<00:00:18.270> small<00:00:18.570> update<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:19.230> think<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.039> was

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
really small update i think it was

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.840 
really small update i think it was
around<00:00:20.189> nineteen<00:00:20.760> megabytes<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:23.730> the

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
around nineteen megabytes so so here the

okay<00:00:45.679> cpu<00:00:46.679> usage<00:00:48.500> this<00:00:49.500> is<00:00:49.739> very<00:00:49.920> high<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:51.800> think

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
okay cpu usage this is very high I think

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.619 
okay cpu usage this is very high I think
was<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.129> high<00:00:53.370> last<00:00:53.729> time<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> tested<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:59.629> 84

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
