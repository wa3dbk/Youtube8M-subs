 children and why are not we going to give tips 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.440
 the hair cuts because they 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.110
 they are also worried about their image 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.330
 for its appearance and especially in these 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.210
 dates so hot that no 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.550
 Give them a refreshed with a new look 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.470
 a new image so do not get lost 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.250
 this capsule that will be sensational 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.989
 we are here with an expert miriam 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.259
 and gap stylist team tourist colorist 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.140
 that already made me cut me I want that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.590
 know that it is because they are going to analyze it very 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.080
 nice new ones that take a little bit more 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.229
 traditional let's call now we have a 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.380
 11 year old lovely boy that you are going to 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.380
 do as you are seeing your hair that 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.330
 has a heavy fall thickness 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.890
 let's see it was worth to be with pure scissors 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.619
 so that we can have a finish 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.810
 perfect in all the contours and let's go 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.940
 to comb the modern points so that he 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.440
 can do it and no longer wear the 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.530
 that he says because he 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.320
 should be used to stain a lot the hair 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.180
 it gets very very very white it seems that 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.940
 there is scarce for then go that he 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.370
 it's not a good option so I talked to 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 our dear stylist look though 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:54.900
 from now on it will be yours and 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.900
 let's see the first step what do you think 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.740
 we think here almost in the last 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.790
 details I want to ask Miriam 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.100
 Why is the finishing so important? 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.780
 with the scissors and especially the hair 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.850
 lacio account 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.770
 Well, because everything is marked here 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.510
 absolutely everything is marked before 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.170
 we have to fade give a good 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.060
 degrafted so that it is completely 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.120
 parejito all the hair and watching 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.459
 this list and besides you are like 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.820
 some way structuring according to 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.820
 his skull to his head shape and in those 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.950
 lips is more complicated than the Chinese 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.989
 exact and then equal but the pencil 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.030
 frames everything as I tell you everything everything is 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 mark then this is where we battle 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.660
 maybe a little more is never never 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.640
 difficult to make a good core 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.970
 I felt when they always go with a good 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 sequence and that is completely 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:15.030
 faded and also so the way in which 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.700
 he will be able to comb and the tips that 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.550
 give him miriam is going to be much easier and 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.120
 not only have a style in the 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.380
 hairstyle for the day another for the afternoon 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 another for at night although the children 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.970
 they do not care about that but from today 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.220
 if you are going to care about our beloved 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.200
 model then look how wonderful we are 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.390
 seeing how with this cut they are 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.780
 mocking a lot more his face looks like 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:44.640
 much sharper and gives it much more air 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.800
 his eyes look even bigger 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.760
 eyes that you did with the hairstyle with 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.340
 the dryer we only dry in the air 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.590
 free we go to go to the side 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.240
 another we manage the hair and right now 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.520
 what we are going to do is put nothing else 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.370
 little bit of modeler or wax for not 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.170
 put so much gel and now make a cute 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.480
 combed to make it look much better 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.710
 before exactly by this step the 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.710
 modeler 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:13.170
 if you give us the necessary tips 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.510
 what amount to employ that is a 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.560
 droplet as we are seeing for you 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.330
 you realize or that this arrived and 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.630
 so there is a special way in 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.880
 where you should apply the product of 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.590
 neck or in front where should 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.460
 start the usually you have to 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.350
 always start from the bottom 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.930
 lateral and ending if they are fixed with 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.190
 very little in the front 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.960
 depending where we want 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.680
 comb it either towards the part of 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.940
 opposite as now it is used a lot 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.940
 and lift a little 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.620
 there are usually several hairstyles 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.930
 what are you doing even without 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.910
 that is still the one that we are going to 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.300
 present at the end but there are many 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.139
 options with this this cut and I think that 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.900
 it truly looks very modern still 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:11.090
 being cool for this spring and 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.560
 besides, I think it's for a child 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.720
 because because also up to an adult 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.729
 you can use it is clear that you feel so much 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.160
 pretty modern pretty to the past 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.050
 know come out latest trends and 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.020
 he sees very little boy that so much for children 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.389
 as for large resolution the model 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.830
 he's super happy with his way 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.610
 I think so, because I 'm seeing it 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:34.639
 he smiles that he is happy and that good and 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.620
 girls at school they will start 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.300
 say good greetings to those who already greet you 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:43.230
 but now more because we are happy already 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.790
 nothing more than marvel 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.350
 so the last touches and the 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.200
 recommendations that I would like you to 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:51.840
