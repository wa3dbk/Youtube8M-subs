got a cup of butter and I cut it up to
help<00:00:51.250> it<00:00:51.460> melt<00:00:51.610> more<00:00:51.880> quickly<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:54.880> put

help it melt more quickly want to put
that<00:00:55.149> in<00:00:55.300> first<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.829> the<00:00:57.010> sugar<00:00:57.219> doesn't<00:00:57.640> stick

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.280 

here<00:01:02.079> is<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.260> cup<00:01:02.559> of<00:01:02.800> evaporated<00:01:02.920> milk<00:01:03.520> a<00:01:07.290> point

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
here is a cup of evaporated milk a point

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:14.460 
here is a cup of evaporated milk a point
of<00:01:08.500> heavy<00:01:08.830> whipping<00:01:09.070> cream<00:01:13.320> I'm<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.350> to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
of heavy whipping cream I'm going to

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.789 
of heavy whipping cream I'm going to
turn<00:01:14.649> this<00:01:14.740> up<00:01:14.890> to<00:01:14.920> medium<00:01:15.250> high<00:01:15.580> heat<00:01:16.799> alright

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
turn this up to medium high heat alright

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:28.149 
turn this up to medium high heat alright
I'm<00:01:18.040> going<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.190> take<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.369> cup<00:01:18.760> of<00:01:19.420> corn<00:01:19.750> syrup

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.819 

so<00:01:28.729> I<00:01:28.790> used<00:01:28.969> the<00:01:29.149> light<00:01:29.329> corn<00:01:29.659> syrup<00:01:29.740> but<00:01:30.740> I'm

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
so I used the light corn syrup but I'm

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.209 
so I used the light corn syrup but I'm
going<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.039> compensate<00:01:32.530> by<00:01:33.530> using<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.979> dark

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
going to compensate by using the dark

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:41.910 
going to compensate by using the dark
brown<00:01:34.460> sugar<00:01:34.759> and<00:01:35.180> this<00:01:35.329> is<00:01:35.450> one<00:01:35.689> cup<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.110> that

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.059 

and<00:01:42.920> then<00:01:43.039> two<00:01:43.340> cups<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.000> white<00:01:44.299> sugar<00:01:48.069> I'm

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
and then two cups of the white sugar I'm

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.999 
and then two cups of the white sugar I'm
gonna<00:01:49.280> start<00:01:49.549> stirring<00:01:49.909> it<00:01:50.710> again<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.890> don't

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
gonna start stirring it again you don't

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.410 
gonna start stirring it again you don't
want<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.369> sugar<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.700> stick<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:53.149> the<00:01:53.240> bottom

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
want the sugar to stick to the bottom

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.730 
want the sugar to stick to the bottom
now<00:01:55.270> just<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.360> with<00:01:56.479> all<00:01:56.689> candies<00:01:57.229> the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
now just like with all candies the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.370 
now just like with all candies the
temperature<00:01:58.310> is<00:01:58.520> really<00:01:58.819> important<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.259> we're

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
temperature is really important so we're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.990 
temperature is really important so we're
gonna<00:02:00.470> want<00:02:00.679> to<00:02:00.770> watch<00:02:00.950> that<00:02:01.220> but<00:02:01.520> we're<00:02:01.939> gonna

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
gonna want to watch that but we're gonna

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.389 
gonna want to watch that but we're gonna
try<00:02:02.209> to<00:02:02.299> get<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.599> to<00:02:02.659> just<00:02:03.319> under<00:02:03.649> 250

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
try to get this to just under 250

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.100 
try to get this to just under 250
degrees<00:02:04.729> and<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:05.060> reason<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:05.420> say<00:02:05.599> is<00:02:05.869> just

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
degrees and the reason I say is just

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.219 
degrees and the reason I say is just
under<00:02:06.530> because<00:02:07.310> it<00:02:08.239> can<00:02:08.390> go<00:02:08.479> up<00:02:08.599> so<00:02:08.899> quickly

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
under because it can go up so quickly

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.660 
under because it can go up so quickly
once<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.649> starts<00:02:09.920> reaching<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.340> high<00:02:10.399> of

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
once it starts reaching that high of

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.339 
once it starts reaching that high of
temperatures<00:02:11.090> by<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.630> time<00:02:11.810> you<00:02:11.930> pull<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.230> off

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
temperatures by the time you pull it off

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.410 
temperatures by the time you pull it off
its<00:02:12.620> temperature<00:02:12.920> still<00:02:13.280> rising<00:02:13.760> a<00:02:13.940> degree<00:02:14.269> or

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
its temperature still rising a degree or

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.420 
its temperature still rising a degree or
two<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:15.410> don't<00:02:15.709> want<00:02:15.920> to<00:02:15.980> turn<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.280> all<00:02:16.400> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
two you don't want to turn it all the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.580 
two you don't want to turn it all the
way<00:02:16.519> to<00:02:16.640> high<00:02:16.880> heat<00:02:17.120> or<00:02:17.330> else<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.690> could<00:02:17.930> scorch

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
way to high heat or else it could scorch

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.880 
way to high heat or else it could scorch
the<00:02:18.920> sugar<00:02:19.640> mixture<00:02:20.260> once<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.380> happens<00:02:21.739> it's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
the sugar mixture once that happens it's

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.500 
the sugar mixture once that happens it's
gonna<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> burnt<00:02:22.489> taste<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:23.090> not<00:02:23.299> gonna

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
gonna have a burnt taste it's not gonna

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.500 
gonna have a burnt taste it's not gonna
set<00:02:23.780> properly<00:02:24.200> it's<00:02:24.950> about<00:02:25.280> 160<00:02:25.849> right<00:02:26.269> now

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
set properly it's about 160 right now

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.720 
set properly it's about 160 right now
and<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.110> good<00:02:27.260> good<00:02:27.470> progress<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:27.950> far

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and that's good good progress so far

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.370 
and that's good good progress so far
I<00:02:28.760> might<00:02:29.030> actually<00:02:29.209> turn<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:29.810> down<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.019> notch

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
I might actually turn it down a notch

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.170 
I might actually turn it down a notch
just<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:31.010> make<00:02:31.160> sure<00:02:31.190> like<00:02:31.549> I<00:02:31.640> said<00:02:31.910> that<00:02:32.090> we

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
just to make sure like I said that we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.289 
just to make sure like I said that we
don't<00:02:32.390> scorch<00:02:32.870> it<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.850> want<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.180> keep

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
don't scorch it you want to keep

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.479 
don't scorch it you want to keep
stirring<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.200> there<00:02:36.470> aren't<00:02:36.650> any<00:02:36.799> spots

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
stirring so that there aren't any spots

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.979 
stirring so that there aren't any spots
that<00:02:37.700> gets<00:02:37.850> stuck<00:02:38.090> on<00:02:38.299> the<00:02:38.390> bottom<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.870> those

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
that gets stuck on the bottom and those

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.640 
that gets stuck on the bottom and those
will<00:02:39.200> get<00:02:39.319> burned<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:41.720> this<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.019> an<00:02:42.170> enamel

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
will get burned now this is an enamel

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.160 
will get burned now this is an enamel
covered<00:02:42.980> cast-iron<00:02:43.549> pot<00:02:43.970> which<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.870> really

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
covered cast-iron pot which I really

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.509 
covered cast-iron pot which I really
like<00:02:45.350> because<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.769> kind<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.010> buffers<00:02:46.489> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
like because it kind of buffers the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.729 
like because it kind of buffers the
temperature<00:02:47.180> and<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:48.079> not<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.410> to<00:02:48.470> stick

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
temperature and it's not going to stick

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.400 
temperature and it's not going to stick
either<00:02:49.359> but<00:02:50.359> you'll<00:02:50.480> make<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.720> nice<00:02:50.959> but<00:02:51.139> clean

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
either but you'll make it nice but clean

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.059 
either but you'll make it nice but clean
up<00:02:51.910> alright<00:02:52.910> we're<00:02:53.060> up<00:02:53.090> at<00:02:53.329> 217<00:02:54.260> it's<00:02:54.709> reached

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
up alright we're up at 217 it's reached

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.440 
up alright we're up at 217 it's reached
a<00:02:55.489> boil<00:02:56.530> we<00:02:57.530> need<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.769> reach<00:02:57.920> almost<00:02:58.819> 250<00:02:59.299> so

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
a boil we need to reach almost 250 so

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.120 
a boil we need to reach almost 250 so
we're<00:02:59.569> gonna<00:02:59.660> keep<00:02:59.870> going<00:03:00.130> definitely

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
we're gonna keep going definitely

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.680 
we're gonna keep going definitely
starting<00:03:01.370> to<00:03:01.459> smell<00:03:01.670> more<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:01.910> caramel<00:03:02.510> now

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
starting to smell more like caramel now

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.170 
starting to smell more like caramel now
it's<00:03:03.260> really<00:03:03.530> coming<00:03:03.829> through<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.940> have<00:03:05.090> to

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
it's really coming through you have to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.970 
it's really coming through you have to
be<00:03:05.269> careful<00:03:05.600> because<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.680> starting<00:03:06.799> to

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
be careful because it's starting to

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.440 
be careful because it's starting to
bubble<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.489> really<00:03:07.760> could<00:03:07.940> make<00:03:07.970> sure<00:03:08.269> you

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
bubble you really could make sure you

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.710 
bubble you really could make sure you
don't<00:03:08.540> get<00:03:08.660> splashed<00:03:09.489> gonna<00:03:10.489> burn

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.420 

all<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:16.930> through<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.230> two<00:03:17.350> 20s<00:03:17.740> and<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.040> 30s

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
all right through the two 20s and to 30s

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.890 
all right through the two 20s and to 30s
it's<00:03:18.580> pretty<00:03:18.850> slow<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.090> but<00:03:19.420> once<00:03:19.600> it<00:03:19.750> gets

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
it's pretty slow going but once it gets

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.810 
it's pretty slow going but once it gets
to<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.110> two<00:03:20.260> 40s<00:03:20.740> it<00:03:20.860> really<00:03:21.160> speeds<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.640> so

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
to the two 40s it really speeds up so

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.870 
to the two 40s it really speeds up so
you<00:03:21.910> have<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.090> be<00:03:22.150> careful<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:22.870> just<00:03:23.290> hit

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you have to be careful and I just hit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.570 
you have to be careful and I just hit
249<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.030> I'm<00:03:25.330> gonna<00:03:25.510> pull<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.160> I'm<00:03:27.160> gonna<00:03:27.340> keep

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
249 so I'm gonna pull it I'm gonna keep

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.160 
249 so I'm gonna pull it I'm gonna keep
stirring<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.150> I<00:03:28.210> don't<00:03:28.540> want<00:03:28.690> it<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.810> get<00:03:28.960> hot

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
stirring it I don't want it to get hot

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.810 
stirring it I don't want it to get hot
this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.190> point<00:03:30.400> where<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:30.580> add<00:03:30.790> our

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
this is the point where we add our

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.520 
this is the point where we add our
vanilla<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.600> again<00:03:31.870> I'm<00:03:32.050> just<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.260> little

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
vanilla but again I'm just a little

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.960 
vanilla but again I'm just a little
worried<00:03:32.830> I'm<00:03:33.010> going<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.190> keep<00:03:33.370> stirring<00:03:33.850> it<00:03:33.910> so

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
worried I'm going to keep stirring it so

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.110 
worried I'm going to keep stirring it so
that<00:03:34.360> doesn't<00:03:35.020> burn<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:36.640> since<00:03:36.850> we<00:03:36.940> want<00:03:37.090> to

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
that doesn't burn now since we want to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.780 
that doesn't burn now since we want to
make<00:03:37.270> caramel<00:03:37.750> apples<00:03:38.320> or<00:03:39.130> apple<00:03:39.160> slices

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
make caramel apples or apple slices

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.130 
make caramel apples or apple slices
because<00:03:40.270> really<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:40.660> can<00:03:40.840> eat<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.960> whole

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
because really we can eat a whole

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.550 
because really we can eat a whole
caramel<00:03:41.590> apple<00:03:42.750> we're<00:03:43.750> gonna<00:03:43.870> want<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.200> dip<00:03:44.380> it

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
caramel apple we're gonna want to dip it

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.550 
caramel apple we're gonna want to dip it
in<00:03:44.910> but<00:03:45.910> not<00:03:46.090> right<00:03:46.360> away<00:03:46.390> because<00:03:46.990> I've<00:03:47.140> heard

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
in but not right away because I've heard

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.650 
in but not right away because I've heard
that<00:03:47.770> it'll<00:03:48.130> start<00:03:48.310> cooking<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.940> apple<00:03:49.360> and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
that it'll start cooking the apple and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.140 
that it'll start cooking the apple and
then<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.380> won't<00:03:50.560> be<00:03:50.650> so<00:03:50.800> crisp<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.940> I'm<00:03:52.030> gonna

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
then it won't be so crisp so I'm gonna

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.180 
then it won't be so crisp so I'm gonna
pour<00:03:52.420> one<00:03:52.720> pan<00:03:53.050> for<00:03:53.080> dipping<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.920> let<00:03:54.040> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
pour one pan for dipping and let that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.520 
pour one pan for dipping and let that
cool<00:03:54.460> I'm<00:03:55.300> gonna<00:03:55.450> spray<00:03:55.750> it<00:03:55.780> with<00:03:55.990> some<00:03:56.050> light

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
cool I'm gonna spray it with some light

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:06.480 
cool I'm gonna spray it with some light
cooking<00:03:57.280> spray<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.500> I've<00:04:05.590> really<00:04:06.010> pre-washed

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
cooking spray so I've really pre-washed

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.670 
cooking spray so I've really pre-washed
these<00:04:06.730> apples<00:04:07.120> they're<00:04:07.300> good<00:04:07.510> to<00:04:07.630> go<00:04:07.680> these

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
these apples they're good to go these

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.910 
these apples they're good to go these
are<00:04:08.740> apples<00:04:09.100> I<00:04:09.160> actually<00:04:09.310> picked<00:04:13.620> there<00:04:14.620> I

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
are apples I actually picked there I

are apples I actually picked there I
like<00:04:15.280> these<00:04:15.400> kinds<00:04:15.700> of<00:04:15.730> slicers<00:04:16.180> I<00:04:16.360> think<00:04:16.540> they

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
like these kinds of slicers I think they

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.849 
like these kinds of slicers I think they
do<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.750> great<00:04:16.959> job<00:04:17.080> even<00:04:19.230> slices<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.380> takes<00:04:20.650> out

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.320 
the core I'm going to dip it in I'll get
all<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.740> edges<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.330> Apple<00:04:25.630> flesh<00:04:25.930> covered

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
all the edges of the Apple flesh covered

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.050 
all the edges of the Apple flesh covered
now<00:04:28.330> how<00:04:28.510> did<00:04:28.630> it<00:04:28.720> cool<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:29.050> dip<00:04:29.260> this<00:04:29.410> into

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
now how did it cool to dip this into

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.170 
now how did it cool to dip this into
