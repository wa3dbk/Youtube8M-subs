apart this one has three parts you can
fall<00:00:39.960> parts<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:41.489> parts<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:44.340> again<00:00:44.760> is

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
fall parts for parts and this again is

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.150 
fall parts for parts and this again is
three<00:00:46.289> parts<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:47.129> same<00:00:47.160> with<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.730> nibs<00:00:49.160> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
three parts the same with a nibs this
