00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 and ojito to the last words of the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.950
 president of nintendo america reggie 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.440
 fils-aime has said the catalog of 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.859
 launch of playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.930
 is my axis ensures that nintendo is not 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 obsessed with technology we are going to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.510
 see why king and feel 6000 has gotten 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.699
 in a good garden he does not seem very nervous 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.520
 aware of the release of xbox one and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.340
 playstation 4 has in fact rated the 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.870
 initial catalog of these consoles 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.879
 with the word me mh asked about his 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 opinion after the rebate of will you king and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.870
 I answered the following important 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.120
 are the games the systems of the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.149
 competition have announced their catalog 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.219
 initial I can afford to tell me if 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 You look at our games I'm happy with 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.329
 the catalog we have cell we have mario 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.030
 we have don kelly with great additions 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.600
 games like pikmin 3 and wonderful 101 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.580
 I'm confident with the games and I'm 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.230
 very satisfied with the offer of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.690
 because we have for the consumer 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.290
 we have cloud technology in wii u 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.510
 Nintendo TV is cloud technology 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.370
 but the difference is that we do not 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.710
 we talk about technology we talk about the 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.780
 experience we have to make sure of 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.060
 the consumer's fun with the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.100
 games that we offer if you compare the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.960
 nintendo players with others to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.690
 we are about the games the 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.090
 Fun entertainment and not over 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.680
 good technology that I think the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.780
 people have it quite clear that 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.940
 precisely uy one is the most technology 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.040
 tip for the next generation but 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.960
 yes it is true that reggie fils amy 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.180
 is right in certain things is that there 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.100
 little by little there is a great catalog 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.860
 let's leave a little more time to 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.680
 wii but yes you need a good chute 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.640
 of games and I think that also the lord 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.460
 fils aime 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.470
 let's say you've gone a little ahead of 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.360
 talk bad about the playstation 4 catalog 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 and xbox when I should have done 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.470
 this because now they could 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.090
 raining attacks on him especially in the 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.080
 situation that is will 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.080
 you in terms of sales 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.469
 very well
