00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
up here you can see the steering box is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500 
up here you can see the steering box is
sitting<00:02:13.040> right<00:02:13.070> there<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.790> once<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:14.360> remove

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
sitting right there and once you remove

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.310 
sitting right there and once you remove
those<00:02:15.610> power<00:02:16.610> steering<00:02:17.060> lines<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.990> thing

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
those power steering lines that thing

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.110 
those power steering lines that thing
will<00:02:18.950> move<00:02:19.160> kind<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.550> think<00:02:19.730> pretty<00:02:20.000> much

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
will move kind of think pretty much

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.410 
will move kind of think pretty much
slide<00:02:20.600> right<00:02:20.870> out<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.050> there

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
slide right out of there

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.510 
slide right out of there
we're<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.660> give<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.050> shot<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:25.370> can

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
we're going to give that a shot you can

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.270 
we're going to give that a shot you can
see<00:02:25.550> all<00:02:26.510> access<00:02:27.200> once<00:02:27.530> you<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.890> hoses

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
see all access once you get the hoses

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.310 
see all access once you get the hoses
out<00:02:28.430> move<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> wires<00:02:29.450> out<00:02:29.780> of<00:02:29.810> your<00:02:29.959> way<00:02:30.080> I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
out move the wires out of your way I

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.320 
out move the wires out of your way I
think<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.250> gives<00:02:31.340> plenty<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.880> room<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.180> come

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
think it gives plenty of room to come

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.920 
think it gives plenty of room to come
out<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.600> there

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
out of there

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.790 
out of there
so<00:02:33.280> we're<00:02:34.280> going<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.459> give<00:02:34.610> that<00:02:34.850> a<00:02:34.880> shot<00:02:35.800> okay

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
so we're going to give that a shot okay

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.260 
so we're going to give that a shot okay
I'm<00:02:36.980> going<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.160> break<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.610> power<00:02:37.880> steering

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
eating a super-short a wrench this is

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.880 
eating a super-short a wrench this is
just<00:02:51.800> like<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> tubing<00:02:52.400> wrench<00:02:52.640> only<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.120> got

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
just like a tubing wrench only it's got

there just crow's feet to go on the end
of<00:02:56.510> your<00:02:56.570> ratchet<00:02:57.280> makes<00:02:58.280> it<00:02:58.430> real<00:02:58.610> sweet<00:02:58.970> to

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
of your ratchet makes it real sweet to

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.890 
of your ratchet makes it real sweet to
pull<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.480> off

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.699 
it loose first and that's an excellent
little<00:03:11.180> tool<00:03:11.450> for<00:03:11.720> that<00:03:11.840> right<00:03:12.140> tools<00:03:12.410> for<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
little tool for that right tools for the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.560 
little tool for that right tools for the
right<00:03:12.739> job

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
right job

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.000 
right job
anyway<00:03:14.570> it's<00:03:15.170> coming<00:03:15.500> out<00:03:15.620> of<00:03:15.650> there<00:03:15.860> and

anyway it's coming out of there and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.350 
anyway it's coming out of there and
we'll<00:03:19.010> go<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.250> our<00:03:19.400> next<00:03:19.610> half<00:03:19.970> which'll

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
we'll go to our next half which'll

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.820 
we'll go to our next half which'll
probably<00:03:21.250> be<00:03:22.250> remove<00:03:22.850> the<00:03:23.560> bolt<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.800> holds

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
probably be remove the bolt that holds

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.830 
probably be remove the bolt that holds
the<00:03:25.190> steering<00:03:25.640> shaft<00:03:25.670> into<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.300> steering<00:03:26.660> box

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
reservoir that hose from the reservoir

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.860 
reservoir that hose from the reservoir
the<00:05:32.770> two<00:05:32.949> cooler<00:05:33.310> lines<00:05:36.449> of<00:05:37.449> course<00:05:37.630> you'll

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
the two cooler lines of course you'll

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.320 
the two cooler lines of course you'll
have<00:05:38.050> to<00:05:38.110> hook<00:05:38.440> up<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:39.300> steering<00:05:40.300> shaft

before you even bolt the Box up so it's

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.779 
before you even bolt the Box up so it's
pretty<00:05:43.539> Elementary<00:05:44.440> you<00:05:44.620> just<00:05:44.860> kind<00:05:45.099> of<00:05:45.250> keep

pretty Elementary you just kind of keep
your<00:05:45.940> wheels

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
your wheels

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.439 
your wheels
pointed<00:05:47.259> forward<00:05:47.620> straight<00:05:47.970> the<00:05:48.970> pitman<00:05:49.330> arm

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
pointed forward straight the pitman arm

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.870 
pointed forward straight the pitman arm
in<00:05:49.780> straight<00:05:50.410> position<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:51.280> then<00:05:51.610> it's<00:05:51.729> got<00:05:51.820> a

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
in straight position and then it's got a

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.189 
in straight position and then it's got a
flat<00:05:52.090> spot<00:05:52.539> on<00:05:52.750> it<00:05:52.900> only<00:05:53.080> go<00:05:53.289> on<00:05:53.320> one<00:05:53.710> way<00:05:54.150> so

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
flat spot on it only go on one way so

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:58.800 
flat spot on it only go on one way so
you<00:05:56.199> hook<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.650> bolt<00:05:56.860> up<00:05:57.100> into<00:05:57.400> that<00:05:57.630> get<00:05:58.630> that

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
you hook the bolt up into that get that

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.320 
you hook the bolt up into that get that
