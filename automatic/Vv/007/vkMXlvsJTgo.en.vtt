00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.770 
have for the food truck challenge I
guess<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.860> only<00:01:44.009> thing<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.210> this

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
guess the only thing is you know this

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
guess the only thing is you know this
must<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.200> blind<00:01:46.439> tasting<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.100> I<00:01:47.159> think<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
must be a blind tasting but I think it

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.130 
must be a blind tasting but I think it
might<00:01:47.610> become<00:01:47.759> obvious<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.600> our<00:01:49.250> our<00:01:50.250> dishes

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
might become obvious that our our dishes

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.930 
might become obvious that our our dishes
which<00:01:51.920> which<00:01:52.370> were<00:01:52.520> in<00:01:52.580> our<00:01:52.670> district

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940
