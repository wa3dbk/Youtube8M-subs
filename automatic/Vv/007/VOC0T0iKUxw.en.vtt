here<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.370> die<00:02:17.370> right<00:02:17.850> off<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> bat<00:02:18.210> you<00:02:18.330> see<00:02:18.570> uh

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
here I die right off the bat you see uh

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.670 
here I die right off the bat you see uh
as<00:02:20.280> soon<00:02:20.340> as<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.670> run<00:02:20.970> off<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.300> die<00:02:21.360> and<00:02:22.110> then<00:02:22.650> I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
as soon as I run off I die and then I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.000 
as soon as I run off I die and then I
figure<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.130> know<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.430> uh<00:02:23.610> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.570> most

figure you know what uh this is the most

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.370 
figure you know what uh this is the most
familiar<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.640> most<00:02:27.000> high<00:02:27.480> traffic<00:02:27.780> area<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
familiar and most high traffic area in

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.350 
familiar and most high traffic area in
this<00:02:28.530> map<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.220> anyways<00:02:29.520> this<00:02:29.790> building

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
this map I think anyways this building

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.440 
this map I think anyways this building

right<00:03:38.070> here<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.580> pretty<00:03:39.270> nice<00:03:39.540> cuz<00:03:40.340> they'll

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
right here is pretty nice cuz they'll

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.160 
right here is pretty nice cuz they'll
keep<00:03:41.550> spawning<00:03:41.880> in<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.270> open<00:03:42.600> area<00:03:42.750> there

keep spawning in that open area there
and<00:03:43.200> it<00:03:43.980> accounts<00:03:44.250> for<00:03:44.459> most<00:03:44.760> of<00:03:44.940> my<00:03:45.000> kills<00:03:45.330> in

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.060 
and it accounts for most of my kills in
this<00:03:45.600> chopper<00:03:45.959> gunner<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.350> it<00:03:46.470> gives<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.830> just

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
this chopper gunner but it gives me just

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.190

enough<00:03:47.300> to<00:03:48.300> get<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.450> really<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.780> lead<00:03:49.170> on

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
enough to get a really good lead on

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.000 
enough to get a really good lead on
these<00:03:49.500> guys

and<00:03:52.010> I<00:03:52.400> like<00:03:52.550> to<00:03:52.640> talk<00:03:52.760> about<00:03:52.940> the<00:03:53.300> killstreaks

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
and I like to talk about the killstreaks

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.560 
and I like to talk about the killstreaks
i'm<00:03:53.930> using<00:03:54.350> as<00:03:54.670> far<00:03:55.670> as<00:03:55.820> how<00:03:55.970> effective<00:03:56.450> they

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
i'm using as far as how effective they

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.320 
i'm using as far as how effective they
are<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.870> free<00:03:57.110> for<00:03:57.350> all<00:03:57.500> i'm<00:03:58.430> using<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.060> spy

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
are and free for all i'm using the spy

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.620

plane and the Blackbird in combination

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.360 
plane and the Blackbird in combination
and<00:04:02.900> honestly<00:04:03.380> i<00:04:03.440> think<00:04:03.590> those<00:04:03.950> are<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.160> two

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370
