00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.340
 for the mission 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.400
 5 lessons learned from working in 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.400
 a prison for the mentally ill 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.220
 frequent fights most of the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.589
 prisoners had only been detained 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.470
 for little things such as theft or 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:31.179
 invasion of private property but the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.129
 mental imbalance that makes a 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.710
 person gets in the neighbor's garage 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:37.720
 I want to steal some tool and 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.640
 finally commit an assault when it is 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.800
 discovered is the same imbalance 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 mental that can make you totally 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.089
 unpredictable at any other time 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.040
 one of these thieves once 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.409
 spit for no reason to a serious prisoner 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.239
 background was an inmate that one day 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.190
 he killed and butchered his girlfriend for the 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.690
 tomorrow while at night it 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.719
 He dedicated to driving on the highway 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.399
 throwing his pieces through the window I think 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.929
 I do not need to tell you who 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.410
 the two was the one who spent a month in the 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.410
 Nursing 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.200
 workers without special qualification 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.670
 despite the danger we ran to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.130
 work with these prisoners 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.439
 they never taught us effective techniques 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 of personal defense the explanation 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.250
 official was that if we received training 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.100
 we would be the legal responsible for 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.049
 any incident that would end badly just 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.909
 we were taught techniques to try 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.280
 appease the anxiety attacks of the 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.619
 prisoners that despite being effective in 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.470
 many cases were useless when a 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.179
 inmate was already beside himself was once a 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.759
 patient was dedicated to chasing a 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.409
 employed throughout the dining room 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.270
 threatening him with a broomstick and what 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.130
 only that my partner could do to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.009
 to get safe was to climb on top of a 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.869
 counter on the other hand the level 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.209
 academic required for these positions 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.039
 it was nothing special to have 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.470
 finished the institute and pass a test 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.459
 of skills you could earn ten euros to 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.459
 the time an entire summer 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.960
 frequent abuse of power if working with 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.510
 mentally ill is already in itself a 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.490
 difficult task to add behavior 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.400
 violence of these prisoners turned him into 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.080
 an almost impossible mission of course 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.240
 that our wish was that the inmates 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.070
 Sin is rehabilitated but we are not 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.920
 we wanted to play life every day 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.530
 to try to get it the most 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.420
 sure at the same time that more abusive was 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.180
 isolate the conflicted prisoner in his cell 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.610
 for a long period of time when 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.950
 I started working an inmate was already wearing 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.480
 more than two years of imprisonment but it was him 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 himself who already warned that if 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.650
 they left free I was going to try to crush 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.620
 everybody all a proof that it 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.000
 can be crazy and be realistic at the same time 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.070
 if the nurses wanted to pass 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.140
 calm the weekend on Friday 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.750
 they tried to find the tickle of the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.520
 conflicting prisoners so they could report 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.810
 some incident with what the doctor 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.810
 isolated during the weekend 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.940
 great sexual activity was very common 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.050
 meet residents masturbating 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.890
 anywhere and any 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.260
 moment 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.120
 often excuses were invented for 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.760
 that we go to their rooms and 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.370
 we could catch them in the act by 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.320
 some strange reason certain people are 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.080
 her libido up while working with 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.600
 mentally ill at night 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.490
 inmates slept in their rooms their 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 doors always remained closed 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.860
 although there was a kind of trapdoor 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 that opened to pass the food 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.790
 Well, this trapdoor fell to the 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.740
 height of the crotch what was 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.090
 used by a security guard and 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.420
 an inmate to maintain relationships 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.000
 sexual ones one night the guard knew of the 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.410
 existence of security cameras 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.780
 It was she who was in charge of 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.580
 monitor the maybe it was just that not 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.540
 could resist to make his 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.540
 desired fantasy 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.020
 and the medication is essential 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.520
 stories with happy ending are not very 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.650
 abundant when you work with 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.360
 Mentally ill 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.820
 once they brought us a young man of so 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.310
 only 18 years of age that after reoffending 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.470
 in several misdemeanors was finally 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.140
 condemned to stay in our center 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.390
 penitentiary some time its 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.100
 stay with us was horrible not 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.560
 there was day that will not be dedicated to provoke 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.180
 and insult the rest of the inmates so 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.940
 the day that went out the door all 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.300
 we breathe a sigh of relief after a few 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.470
 months and for our initial upset 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.320
 they sent us back to the kid 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.910
 back but this time his behavior 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.040
 his previous ones were exemplary 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.890
 provocations were only due to fear of 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.140
 that the rest of people mess with him 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:44.430
 In view of his change I decided to help him 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.470
 to pass the exam 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.300
 basic skills and for me 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.070
 satisfaction a few days after leaving 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.740
 I had already got a job like 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.300
 kitchen assistant but one day not 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.700
 took the medication before going to 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.440
 restaurant and I end up having a lot of fat 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.440
 so again start again 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.320

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.960

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.750

 keep doing jobs so you can

 days
