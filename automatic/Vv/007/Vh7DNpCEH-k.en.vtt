00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
first of all for sending in your basis

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.110 
first of all for sending in your basis
via<00:00:23.970> Twitter<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.960> get<00:00:25.290> reviewed<00:00:25.770> so<00:00:26.370> let's<00:00:26.910> go

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
via Twitter to get reviewed so let's go

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.300 
via Twitter to get reviewed so let's go
ahead<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.360> start<00:00:27.840> with<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.290> space<00:00:28.530> and<00:00:28.860> as

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
ahead and start with this space and as

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.440 
ahead and start with this space and as
you<00:00:29.430> can<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.850> Town<00:00:30.060> Hall<00:00:30.090> has<00:00:30.360> already

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
you can see the Town Hall has already

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.030 
you can see the Town Hall has already
been<00:00:30.750> taken<00:00:31.020> out<00:00:31.290> so<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> looks<00:00:31.680> like<00:00:31.830> he<00:00:31.890> has<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
been taken out so it looks like he has a

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.970 
been taken out so it looks like he has a
shield<00:00:32.370> right<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.760> but<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.780> terms<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.650> just

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
shield right now but in terms of just

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.440 
shield right now but in terms of just
minor<00:00:35.340> points<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.910> improvement<00:00:36.330> it's

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
minor points of improvement it's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.390 
minor points of improvement it's
actually<00:00:36.720> a<00:00:36.810> really<00:00:36.989> good<00:00:37.110> base<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
actually a really good base but what I

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.729 
actually a really good base but what I
would<00:00:38.610> say<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.270> mortars<00:00:39.750> on<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.200> top<00:00:40.470> side

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
would say is the mortars on the top side

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
would say is the mortars on the top side
of<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:40.950> base<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.600> air<00:00:42.780> defenses

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
of the base as well as the air defenses

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.710 
of the base as well as the air defenses
on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.739> bottom<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.400> bit<00:00:44.640> exposed<00:00:45.180> now<00:00:45.690> I

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
on the bottom are a bit exposed now I

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.390 
on the bottom are a bit exposed now I
think<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.080> simple<00:00:46.440> solution<00:00:46.590> would<00:00:46.950> actually

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
think the simple solution would actually

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.180 
think the simple solution would actually
be<00:00:47.580> if<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> zoom<00:00:47.940> in<00:00:48.540> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.230> clan<00:00:49.500> castle<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
be if you zoom in on the clan castle the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.280 
be if you zoom in on the clan castle the
core<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> base<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.269> see<00:00:51.300> he's<00:00:51.660> protecting

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
core of the base you see he's protecting

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.070 
core of the base you see he's protecting
the<00:00:52.650> two<00:00:53.010> dark<00:00:53.370> elixir<00:00:53.670> collectors<00:00:54.330> and<00:00:54.540> you

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
the two dark elixir collectors and you

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.750 
the two dark elixir collectors and you
might<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.260> thinking<00:00:55.559> well<00:00:55.800> isn't<00:00:56.339> dark<00:00:56.519> elixir

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
might be thinking well isn't dark elixir

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.579 
might be thinking well isn't dark elixir
pretty<00:00:57.210> precious<00:00:57.449> shouldn't<00:00:58.080> i<00:00:58.140> protect<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
pretty precious shouldn't i protect the

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.500 
pretty precious shouldn't i protect the
drill<00:00:58.890> well<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.400> answer<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.699> not<00:00:59.940> necessarily

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
drill well the answer is not necessarily

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.899 
drill well the answer is not necessarily
mainly<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.260> if<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:02.190> are<00:01:02.370> farming

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
mainly because if you are farming

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.880 
mainly because if you are farming
chances<00:01:03.600> are<00:01:03.809> you'll<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.199> playing<00:01:04.589> pretty

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
chances are you'll be playing pretty

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
chances are you'll be playing pretty
actively<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.670> before<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.120> log<00:01:06.330> off<00:01:06.540> all<00:01:06.870> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
actively so before you log off all you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.630 
actively so before you log off all you
got<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.920> collect<00:01:08.220> your<00:01:08.370> dark

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
got to really do is collect your dark

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
got to really do is collect your dark
elixir<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:09.720> if<00:01:09.870> someone<00:01:10.170> takes<00:01:10.320> your

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
elixir and then if someone takes your

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410 
elixir and then if someone takes your
town<00:01:10.740> hall<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.159> away<00:01:11.430> then<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.030> can<00:01:12.180> sit<00:01:12.390> on

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
town hall right away then you can sit on

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120 
town hall right away then you can sit on
a<00:01:12.540> shield<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.320> don't<00:01:13.530> have<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> worry

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
a shield and you don't have to worry

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
a shield and you don't have to worry
about<00:01:14.310> your<00:01:14.640> dark<00:01:14.880> elixir<00:01:15.150> drills<00:01:15.630> being

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
about your dark elixir drills being

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.899 
about your dark elixir drills being
taken<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.770> lot<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.040> loot<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.760> can

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
taken for a lot of loot so you can

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.640 
taken for a lot of loot so you can
actually<00:01:17.940> put<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.690> dark<00:01:18.900> elixir<00:01:19.110> drills<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
actually put your dark elixir drills on

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.860 
actually put your dark elixir drills on
the<00:01:19.740> outside<00:01:20.100> make<00:01:20.790> some<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.240> room<00:01:21.540> for

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
the outside make some more room for

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.540 
the outside make some more room for
maybe<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.320> storage<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:23.070> middle<00:01:23.340> or

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
maybe like a storage in the middle or

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.430 
maybe like a storage in the middle or
even<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.210> wanted<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.540> move<00:01:24.720> in<00:01:24.900> your

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
even if you wanted to move in your

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.500 
even if you wanted to move in your
wizard<00:01:26.100> towers<00:01:26.430> but<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.790> move<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.150> your

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
wizard towers but if you move in your

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.540 
wizard towers but if you move in your
storages<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.590> wizard<00:01:28.980> towers<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
storages or your wizard towers on the

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.340 
storages or your wizard towers on the
left<00:01:29.760> or<00:01:29.910> right<00:01:29.940> then<00:01:30.660> that<00:01:30.930> would<00:01:31.080> give<00:01:31.230> you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
left or right then that would give you

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
left or right then that would give you
an<00:01:31.440> opportunity<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.070> put<00:01:32.550> your<00:01:32.730> air<00:01:33.060> defenses

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
an opportunity to put your air defenses

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.570 
an opportunity to put your air defenses
a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:34.410> bit<00:01:34.530> more<00:01:34.650> centralized<00:01:35.220> within

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
a little bit more centralized within

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.700 
a little bit more centralized within
that<00:01:35.670> secondary<00:01:36.120> layer<00:01:36.390> of<00:01:36.540> walls<00:01:36.810> or<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.560> can

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that secondary layer of walls or you can

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.140 
that secondary layer of walls or you can
move<00:01:37.830> in<00:01:37.980> your<00:01:38.100> mortars<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:38.940> more

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
move in your mortars a little bit more

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.180 
move in your mortars a little bit more
but<00:01:39.690> right<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.080> air<00:01:40.470> defenses<00:01:41.010> are<00:01:41.160> a

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 
but right now the air defenses are a

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:43.250 
but right now the air defenses are a
little<00:01:41.370> bit<00:01:41.580> too<00:01:41.730> exposed<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.510> really

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
little bit too exposed and really

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.620 
little bit too exposed and really
vulnerable<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.100> balloon<00:01:44.790> yin<00:01:44.940> type<00:01:45.210> rate

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
vulnerable to a balloon yin type rate

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.090 
vulnerable to a balloon yin type rate
now<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.900> other<00:01:46.080> thing<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.470> would<00:01:46.590> mention<00:01:46.620> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
now the other thing I would mention is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.620 
now the other thing I would mention is
you<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.550> that<00:01:47.730> builder<00:01:48.060> Hut<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> right

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
you see that builder Hut on the right

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.380 
you see that builder Hut on the right
hand<00:01:48.840> side<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.590> makes<00:01:50.010> it<00:01:50.250> an<00:01:50.400> easy<00:01:50.670> sort<00:01:51.270> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
hand side that makes it an easy sort of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.930 
hand side that makes it an easy sort of
way<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.870> have<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.830> clan<00:01:53.190> castle<00:01:53.400> troops<00:01:53.610> get

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
way to have your clan castle troops get

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.790 
way to have your clan castle troops get
lured<00:01:54.180> out<00:01:54.300> really<00:01:54.690> easily<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:55.320> know<00:01:55.680> they're

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
lured out really easily I know they're

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.140 
lured out really easily I know they're
going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.950> take<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> Town<00:01:56.430> Hall<00:01:56.460> anyway<00:01:56.970> but

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
going to take the Town Hall anyway but

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.430 
going to take the Town Hall anyway but
you<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.420> want<00:01:57.570> to<00:01:57.660> give<00:01:57.750> away<00:01:57.780> any<00:01:58.170> type<00:01:58.410> of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
you don't want to give away any type of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.440 
you don't want to give away any type of
free<00:01:58.740> percentage<00:01:59.190> points<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> quick<00:02:00.240> fix

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
free percentage points so a quick fix

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.790 
free percentage points so a quick fix
would<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.660> just<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.050> move<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.320> builder<00:02:01.650> Hut

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
would be just to move that builder Hut

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.250 
would be just to move that builder Hut
in<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.070> little<00:02:02.340> bit<00:02:02.460> more<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:03.720> within<00:02:03.960> range

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
in a little bit more and be within range

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.530 
in a little bit more and be within range
of<00:02:04.440> your<00:02:04.590> defenses<00:02:05.160> now<00:02:05.670> my<00:02:05.820> last<00:02:06.060> point<00:02:06.360> is

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
of your defenses now my last point is

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.050 
of your defenses now my last point is
your<00:02:06.870> Tesla's<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> top<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.399> bottom<00:02:08.670> I

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
your Tesla's on the top and the bottom I

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
your Tesla's on the top and the bottom I
wouldn't<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.629> dedicated<00:02:10.080> wall

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
wouldn't have dedicated wall

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.559 
wouldn't have dedicated wall
compartments<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> mainly<00:02:12.420> because

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
compartments for it and mainly because

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.479 
compartments for it and mainly because
the<00:02:13.080> hidden<00:02:13.319> Tesla<00:02:13.739> supposed<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.129> be<00:02:14.250> sort<00:02:14.459> of

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
the hidden Tesla supposed to be sort of

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.100 
the hidden Tesla supposed to be sort of
like<00:02:14.610> an<00:02:14.730> element<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> surprise<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.080> I

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
like an element of surprise so I

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.750 
like an element of surprise so I
wouldn't<00:02:16.440> leave<00:02:16.590> obvious<00:02:17.099> spaces<00:02:17.580> within

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
wouldn't leave obvious spaces within

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.580 
wouldn't leave obvious spaces within
your<00:02:18.000> base<00:02:18.209> because<00:02:18.900> then<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.349> attacker

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
your base because then the attacker

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.290 
your base because then the attacker
would<00:02:19.950> most<00:02:20.250> likely<00:02:20.489> know<00:02:20.760> that's<00:02:21.000> where<00:02:21.209> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
would most likely know that's where the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.390 
would most likely know that's where the
hidden<00:02:21.569> Tesla's<00:02:22.019> are<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.890> would<00:02:23.190> say<00:02:23.370> just

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
hidden Tesla's are so I would say just

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.000 
hidden Tesla's are so I would say just
try<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.819> maybe<00:02:24.360> put<00:02:24.660> them<00:02:24.870> where<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.739> know<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
try to maybe put them where you know the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.520 
try to maybe put them where you know the
attacker<00:02:26.340> might<00:02:27.030> go<00:02:27.359> but<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.319> make<00:02:28.469> it

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
attacker might go but just don't make it

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.410 
attacker might go but just don't make it
too<00:02:28.650> obvious<00:02:28.829> alright<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:29.849> let's<00:02:30.030> move<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.329> to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
too obvious alright so let's move on to

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.820 
too obvious alright so let's move on to
the<00:02:30.569> second<00:02:30.900> base<00:02:31.019> I<00:02:31.260> would<00:02:31.349> say<00:02:31.499> for<00:02:31.709> the

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
the second base I would say for the

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.890 
the second base I would say for the
space<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.310> has<00:02:32.340> really<00:02:32.730> good<00:02:33.150> fundamentals

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
space it has really good fundamentals

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.440 
space it has really good fundamentals
the<00:02:34.230> mortars<00:02:34.740> are<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.190> centralized<00:02:35.790> sort

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
the mortars are really centralized sort

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.270 
the mortars are really centralized sort
of<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.750> trapezoidal<00:02:37.470> type<00:02:37.770> shape<00:02:38.100> as

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of in that trapezoidal type shape as

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.940 
of in that trapezoidal type shape as
well<00:02:38.970> as<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.540> wizard<00:02:40.320> towers<00:02:40.680> are

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
well as the wizard towers are

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.340 
well as the wizard towers are
triangulated<00:02:41.700> clan<00:02:42.270> castle<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.780> centralized

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
triangulated clan castle is centralized

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.160 
triangulated clan castle is centralized
so<00:02:43.800> I<00:02:43.830> wasn't<00:02:44.310> able<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.760> find<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.150> lot<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.570> sort

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
so I wasn't able to find a lot of sort

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.750 
so I wasn't able to find a lot of sort
of<00:02:46.230> room<00:02:46.620> for<00:02:46.800> improvement<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.550> base

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
of room for improvement with this base

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.640 
of room for improvement with this base
at<00:02:47.940> first<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.330> have<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.630> be<00:02:48.780> really<00:02:48.930> nitpicky<00:02:49.560> on

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
at first I have to be really nitpicky on

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.860 
at first I have to be really nitpicky on
this<00:02:49.860> but<00:02:50.400> first<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.060> would<00:02:51.180> probably<00:02:51.330> say<00:02:51.630> if

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
this but first I would probably say if

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.210 
this but first I would probably say if
you<00:02:51.990> want<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> improve<00:02:52.440> it<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.650> little<00:02:52.830> bit<00:02:53.040> more

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
you want to improve it a little bit more

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.710 
you want to improve it a little bit more
I<00:02:53.430> would<00:02:53.820> say<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> first<00:02:54.270> thing<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.570> I

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
I would say the first thing that I

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.690 
I would say the first thing that I
noticed<00:02:54.750> was<00:02:55.260> your<00:02:55.410> top<00:02:55.650> air<00:02:55.890> defense<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.490> is

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
noticed was your top air defense that is

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.240 
noticed was your top air defense that is
pretty<00:02:57.120> exposed<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:57.870> well<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.770> would<00:02:59.040> try<00:02:59.190> to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
pretty exposed as well so I would try to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.980 
pretty exposed as well so I would try to
move<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.610> in<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.910> little<00:03:00.060> bit<00:03:00.210> right<00:03:00.810> now<00:03:00.840> I

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
move that in a little bit right now I

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.450 
move that in a little bit right now I
notice<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:01.650> have<00:03:01.740> your<00:03:01.980> builder<00:03:02.310> Hut

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
notice that you have your builder Hut

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.520 
notice that you have your builder Hut
sort<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:02.940> placeholder<00:03:03.270> for<00:03:03.660> your<00:03:04.200> town

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
sort of as a placeholder for your town

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.380 
sort of as a placeholder for your town
hall<00:03:04.770> as<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.520> see<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.790> move<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.240> that

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
hall as you can see you can move in that

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.810 
hall as you can see you can move in that
town<00:03:06.630> hall<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.020> have<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.530> 4<00:03:07.920> by<00:03:08.070> 4<00:03:08.100> space<00:03:08.640> for

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
town hall and have a 4 by 4 space for

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.430 
town hall and have a 4 by 4 space for
that<00:03:08.910> town<00:03:09.150> hall<00:03:09.390> but<00:03:09.810> i<00:03:09.840> would<00:03:09.990> say<00:03:10.170> in<00:03:10.260> this

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
that town hall but i would say in this

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.350 
that town hall but i would say in this
instance<00:03:10.890> it<00:03:11.070> probably<00:03:11.520> makes<00:03:11.700> more<00:03:11.910> sense<00:03:12.180> to

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
instance it probably makes more sense to

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.240 
instance it probably makes more sense to
move<00:03:12.540> your<00:03:12.720> air<00:03:12.930> defence<00:03:13.350> in<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.830> middle<00:03:14.130> of

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
move your air defence in the middle of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.949 
move your air defence in the middle of
your<00:03:14.430> base<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.850> then<00:03:15.209> swap<00:03:15.510> it<00:03:15.660> out<00:03:15.750> with<00:03:15.810> the

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
your base and then swap it out with the

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.960 
your base and then swap it out with the
builder<00:03:16.320> hut<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.220> protect<00:03:17.670> your<00:03:17.820> air

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
builder hut just to protect your air

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.600 
builder hut just to protect your air
defence<00:03:18.330> a<00:03:18.510> little<00:03:18.930> bit<00:03:19.110> more<00:03:19.470> now<00:03:20.250> notice

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
defence a little bit more now notice

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.160 
defence a little bit more now notice
that<00:03:20.640> your<00:03:20.940> laboratory<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.600> on<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> outside

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
that your laboratory is on the outside

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:23.960 
that your laboratory is on the outside
so<00:03:22.440> again<00:03:22.709> I<00:03:22.740> wouldn't<00:03:23.040> leave<00:03:23.310> any<00:03:23.580> free

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
so again I wouldn't leave any free

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.870 
so again I wouldn't leave any free
percentage<00:03:24.450> points<00:03:24.780> or<00:03:24.959> an<00:03:25.110> easy<00:03:25.350> way<00:03:25.740> for

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
percentage points or an easy way for

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.280 
percentage points or an easy way for
someone<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.150> lure<00:03:27.480> out<00:03:27.630> your<00:03:27.780> clan<00:03:28.050> castle

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
someone to lure out your clan castle

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.170 
someone to lure out your clan castle
troops<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.370> next<00:03:29.670> bit<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.850> advice<00:03:30.120> would

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
troops now the next bit of advice would

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.510 
troops now the next bit of advice would
probably<00:03:30.840> be<00:03:31.020> for<00:03:31.260> your<00:03:31.350> walls<00:03:31.650> now<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.340> have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
probably be for your walls now you have

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.100 
probably be for your walls now you have
your<00:03:32.550> stronger<00:03:32.970> walls<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> outside<00:03:33.959> which

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
your stronger walls on the outside which

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.570 
your stronger walls on the outside which
are<00:03:34.320> going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.650> taken<00:03:34.980> out<00:03:35.100> by<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.340> wall

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
are going to be taken out by the wall

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.820 
are going to be taken out by the wall
breakers<00:03:35.940> anyway<00:03:36.420> so<00:03:36.959> i<00:03:36.989> would<00:03:37.260> say<00:03:37.440> bring

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
breakers anyway so i would say bring

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.979 
breakers anyway so i would say bring
your<00:03:38.100> stronger<00:03:38.459> walls<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.360> them<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:39.810> the

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
your stronger walls and make them in the

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.020 
your stronger walls and make them in the
core<00:03:40.290> of<00:03:40.470> your<00:03:40.560> base<00:03:40.800> because<00:03:41.280> at<00:03:41.519> that<00:03:41.700> point

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
core of your base because at that point

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.000 
core of your base because at that point
maybe<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.630> attacker<00:03:42.930> will<00:03:43.230> run<00:03:43.560> out<00:03:43.590> of<00:03:43.769> wall

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
maybe the attacker will run out of wall

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.860 
maybe the attacker will run out of wall
breakers<00:03:44.430> or<00:03:44.610> miss<00:03:45.090> deploy<00:03:45.480> his<00:03:45.630> wall

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
breakers or miss deploy his wall

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.660 
breakers or miss deploy his wall
breakers<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.800> then<00:03:47.010> you<00:03:47.130> would<00:03:47.250> want<00:03:47.459> to<00:03:47.580> have

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
breakers so then you would want to have

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.430 
breakers so then you would want to have
your<00:03:47.820> strongest<00:03:48.269> walls<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> middle<00:03:49.170> now

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
your strongest walls in the middle now

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.470 
your strongest walls in the middle now
my<00:03:49.560> last<00:03:49.769> bit<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.010> advice<00:03:50.130> is<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.880> notice<00:03:51.269> that

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
my last bit of advice is I notice that

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.840 
my last bit of advice is I notice that
your<00:03:51.600> collectors<00:03:52.140> are<00:03:52.320> really<00:03:52.739> focused<00:03:53.640> on

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
your collectors are really focused on

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.310 
your collectors are really focused on
the<00:03:54.000> left<00:03:54.209> side<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.720> right<00:03:54.750> side<00:03:54.930> and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
the left side and the right side and

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.720 
the left side and the right side and
then<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.739> have<00:03:55.860> all<00:03:55.890> your<00:03:56.190> barracks<00:03:56.519> on<00:03:56.640> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
then you have all your barracks on the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.910 
then you have all your barracks on the
bottom<00:03:57.030> left<00:03:57.209> bottom<00:03:57.630> right-hand<00:03:57.989> side<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:58.890> I

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
bottom left bottom right-hand side so I

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.160 
bottom left bottom right-hand side so I
would<00:03:59.190> just<00:03:59.340> probably<00:03:59.580> try<00:04:00.269> to<00:04:00.300> scatter<00:04:00.780> your

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
would just probably try to scatter your

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.470 
would just probably try to scatter your
collectors<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.860> little<00:04:02.220> bit<00:04:02.340> more<00:04:02.580> switch<00:04:03.239> them

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
collectors a little bit more switch them

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.300 
collectors a little bit more switch them
up<00:04:03.630> exchange<00:04:04.230> them<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.560> with<00:04:04.680> your<00:04:04.860> barracks

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
up exchange them out with your barracks

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.650 
up exchange them out with your barracks
so<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.850> you're<00:04:05.970> able<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.150> kind<00:04:06.330> of<00:04:06.360> spread

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
so that you're able to kind of spread

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.300 
so that you're able to kind of spread
them<00:04:06.900> out<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.050> little<00:04:07.290> bit<00:04:07.500> more<00:04:07.769> because<00:04:07.950> say

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
them out a little bit more because say

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.460 
them out a little bit more because say
you<00:04:08.370> were<00:04:08.670> to<00:04:08.790> go<00:04:08.970> inactive<00:04:09.330> then<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.260> would<00:04:10.350> be

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
you were to go inactive then it would be

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.840 
you were to go inactive then it would be
really<00:04:10.650> easy<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:11.220> take<00:04:11.400> all<00:04:11.640> of<00:04:11.670> your

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
really easy to take all of your

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.400 
really easy to take all of your
collector<00:04:12.330> loot<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.810> left<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.200> right

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
collector loot on the left and right

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:14.810 
collector loot on the left and right
side<00:04:13.620> of<00:04:13.739> your<00:04:13.800> base<00:04:14.010> but<00:04:14.400> that's<00:04:14.550> about<00:04:14.670> it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
side of your base but that's about it

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.340 
side of your base but that's about it
guys<00:04:14.940> know<00:04:15.239> before<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:15.630> guys<00:04:15.750> go<00:04:15.989> if<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.200> like
