00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
about five nights at freddy's 3 now a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.740 
about five nights at freddy's 3 now a
lot<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:34.579> people<00:00:34.670> haven't<00:00:35.300> really<00:00:35.510> played<00:00:35.690> the

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
lot of people haven't really played the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.160 
lot of people haven't really played the
game<00:00:36.079> yet<00:00:36.110> because<00:00:36.649> one<00:00:37.840> people<00:00:38.840> don't<00:00:39.020> have

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
game yet because one people don't have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.110 
game yet because one people don't have
the<00:00:39.380> money<00:00:39.559> to<00:00:39.770> buy<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:39.980> yet<00:00:40.370> so<00:00:40.700> i<00:00:40.730> guess

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
the money to buy it yet so i guess

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.150 
the money to buy it yet so i guess
people<00:00:41.270> just<00:00:41.420> want<00:00:41.570> to<00:00:41.719> see<00:00:41.899> like<00:00:42.160> some

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
people just want to see like some

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.130 
people just want to see like some
gameplay<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.000> some<00:00:44.390> personal<00:00:44.809> thoughts<00:00:44.929> and

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
gameplay and some personal thoughts and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.270

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
and i've kind of thinking of some

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.669 
and i've kind of thinking of some
theories<00:00:50.300> and<00:00:50.480> stuff<00:00:50.690> like<00:00:50.839> that<00:00:50.899> um<00:00:51.289> just

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:51.679 
theories and stuff like that um just

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.520 
theories and stuff like that um just
assumptions<00:00:52.070> really<00:00:52.609> uh<00:00:52.870> but<00:00:53.870> later<00:00:54.109> on<00:00:54.199> i<00:00:54.320> am

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
assumptions really uh but later on i am

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.720 
assumptions really uh but later on i am
going<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:54.710> do<00:00:54.829> some<00:00:55.010> more<00:00:55.100> research<00:00:55.339> and<00:00:55.609> i

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
going to do some more research and i

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.399 
going to do some more research and i
will<00:00:55.879> be<00:00:55.909> doing<00:00:56.120> plenty<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.690> theory<00:00:56.989> videos<00:00:57.289> in

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409 
will be doing plenty of theory videos in

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:59.169 
will be doing plenty of theory videos in
the<00:00:57.499> future<00:00:57.530> i'll<00:00:58.159> do<00:00:58.519> theory<00:00:58.789> of<00:00:58.909> videos

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
the future i'll do theory of videos

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.819 
the future i'll do theory of videos
about<00:00:59.420> everything<00:01:00.019> that<00:01:00.140> i<00:01:00.170> find<00:01:00.499> that<00:01:00.679> it's

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
about everything that i find that it's

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.380 
about everything that i find that it's

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
impressions about five nights at

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.510 
impressions about five nights at
freddy's<00:01:15.170> 3<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.530> what<00:01:15.620> I<00:01:15.650> think<00:01:15.710> about<00:01:15.980> it<00:01:16.280> so

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
freddy's 3 and what I think about it so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.060 
freddy's 3 and what I think about it so
far<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:17.690> I<00:01:17.810> said<00:01:17.870> I'm<00:01:18.200> on<00:01:18.290> night<00:01:18.470> 3<00:01:18.800> i've<00:01:18.950> been

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
far like I said I'm on night 3 i've been

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.210 
far like I said I'm on night 3 i've been
night<00:01:19.310> one<00:01:19.640> and<00:01:19.820> two<00:01:20.030> i<00:01:20.990> think<00:01:21.620> this<00:01:21.800> is<00:01:21.860> better

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
night one and two i think this is better

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.610 
night one and two i think this is better
than<00:01:22.370> five<00:01:23.240> nights<00:01:23.450> at<00:01:23.600> Freddy's<00:01:23.900> one<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:24.380> two

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.620 
than five nights at Freddy's one and two

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.650 
than five nights at Freddy's one and two
a<00:01:25.250> lot<00:01:25.640> of<00:01:25.670> people<00:01:25.760> will<00:01:26.060> think<00:01:26.090> oh<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.450> like

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
a lot of people will think oh I like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.690 
a lot of people will think oh I like
women<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.350> better<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:27.950> better<00:01:28.160> but<00:01:28.310> I<00:01:28.340> really

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
women one better to better but I really

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.650 
women one better to better but I really
like<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.030> one<00:01:29.210> like<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:29.480> really

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
like this one like it's really

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.810 
like this one like it's really
complicated<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.440> stuff<00:01:30.620> like<00:01:30.740> that<00:01:30.800> but<00:01:31.310> it's

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
complicated and stuff like that but it's

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.550 
complicated and stuff like that but it's
the<00:01:32.090> only<00:01:32.120> reason<00:01:32.600> why<00:01:32.690> it's<00:01:32.900> complicated

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
the only reason why it's complicated

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.710 
the only reason why it's complicated
it's<00:01:33.650> because<00:01:34.430> finest<00:01:34.910> phrase<00:01:35.090> wanted<00:01:35.510> to

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
it's because finest phrase wanted to

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.260 
it's because finest phrase wanted to
already<00:01:36.140> came<00:01:36.320> out<00:01:36.500> and<00:01:36.710> I'm<00:01:37.580> assuming<00:01:37.970> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
already came out and I'm assuming that

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
called the I forgot the name of it i

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.310 
called the I forgot the name of it i
think<00:03:09.950> it's<00:03:10.280> called<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.840> spring<00:03:11.840> trap<00:03:12.170> i

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
think it's called the spring trap i

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.510 
think it's called the spring trap i
believe<00:03:12.650> i'm<00:03:12.890> not<00:03:13.040> sure<00:03:13.190> if<00:03:13.310> that's<00:03:13.400> the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
believe i'm not sure if that's the

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.100 
believe i'm not sure if that's the
official<00:03:13.820> name<00:03:14.180> but<00:03:14.209> i<00:03:14.480> think<00:03:14.810> people<00:03:15.020> are

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
official name but i think people are

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.050 
official name but i think people are
calling<00:03:15.260> it<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.500> spring<00:03:15.890> trap<00:03:16.160> pretty<00:03:16.850> much

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
calling it the spring trap pretty much

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.210 
calling it the spring trap pretty much
uh<00:03:17.330> he<00:03:17.870> is<00:03:18.110> an<00:03:18.230> animatronic<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:18.950> he's<00:03:19.040> trying

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
uh he is an animatronic and he's trying

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.010 
uh he is an animatronic and he's trying
to<00:03:19.310> kill<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.670> stuff<00:03:19.970> like<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.150> and<00:03:20.480> if

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020

you want to get him away from your room

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.860 
you want to get him away from your room
you<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.790> play<00:03:23.030> these<00:03:23.209> sounds<00:03:23.690> and<00:03:23.720> you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
you have to play these sounds and you

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.420 
you have to play these sounds and you
can<00:03:23.989> play<00:03:24.140> like<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> sound<00:03:24.650> like<00:03:24.920> if<00:03:25.100> you<00:03:25.190> play<00:03:25.400> a

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
can play like a sound like if you play a

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.530 
can play like a sound like if you play a
sound<00:03:25.700> through<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.060> speakers<00:03:26.420> in<00:03:26.450> the

sound through the speakers in the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.740 
sound through the speakers in the
hallway<00:03:26.900> um<00:03:27.910> animatronics<00:03:28.910> are<00:03:29.030> designed<00:03:29.480> to

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
hallway um animatronics are designed to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.540 
hallway um animatronics are designed to
go<00:03:29.959> follow<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.440> sound<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.860> the<00:03:31.040> kids<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:31.459> if

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
go follow the sound of the kids so if

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.670 
go follow the sound of the kids so if
you<00:03:31.670> play<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.510> sound<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.470> don't<00:03:33.620> know

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
you play the sound and I don't know

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.830 
you play the sound and I don't know
camera<00:03:34.070> five<00:03:34.459> or<00:03:34.760> something<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.510> he'll<00:03:35.690> go

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
camera five or something that he'll go

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.000 
camera five or something that he'll go
to<00:03:35.900> that<00:03:36.080> camera<00:03:36.350> and<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.620> can<00:03:36.739> keep<00:03:36.890> them

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
to that camera and you can keep them

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.229 
to that camera and you can keep them
distracted<00:03:37.130> and<00:03:37.640> stuff<00:03:37.850> like<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.030> and

distracted and stuff like that and

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.960 
distracted and stuff like that and
sometimes<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:39.140> audio<00:03:39.470> it<00:03:39.980> will<00:03:40.220> like<00:03:40.489> have<00:03:40.850> an

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
sometimes the audio it will like have an

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.190 
sometimes the audio it will like have an
error<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.540> have<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.750> go<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.930> your<00:03:42.080> other

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
error and you have to go to your other

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.900 
error and you have to go to your other
camera<00:03:42.650> view<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.040> like<00:03:43.190> reboot<00:03:43.610> the<00:03:43.760> system

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
camera view and like reboot the system

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.400 
camera view and like reboot the system
and<00:03:44.239> stuff<00:03:44.420> like<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.780> it<00:03:44.989> keeps<00:03:45.170> you<00:03:45.290> on

your toes because when you're rebooting
the<00:03:46.790> system<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.600> can't<00:03:47.840> put<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.080> camera<00:03:48.410> back

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
you later there's other animatronics in

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.160 
you later there's other animatronics in
the<00:04:01.250> game<00:04:01.459> but<00:04:01.730> see<00:04:01.970> the<00:04:02.180> only<00:04:02.540> animatronic

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
the game but see the only animatronic

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.410 
the game but see the only animatronic
that<00:04:03.290> will<00:04:03.440> kill<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:04.120> that<00:04:05.120> new

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
that will kill you is that new

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.330 
that will kill you is that new
animatronic<00:04:06.080> called<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.380> spring<00:04:06.769> trap<00:04:07.100> and

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
animatronic called the spring trap and

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.880 
animatronic called the spring trap and
that<00:04:08.030> a<00:04:08.209> metronic<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:08.870> the<00:04:08.989> only<00:04:09.200> one<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:09.799> can

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
that a metronic is the only one that can

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.860 
that a metronic is the only one that can
actually<00:04:10.280> move<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.970> kill<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.660> stuff

like<00:04:11.989> that<00:04:12.049> i'm<00:04:12.350> not<00:04:12.380> sure<00:04:12.620> if<00:04:12.709> there's<00:04:12.860> other

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
like that i'm not sure if there's other

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.800 
like that i'm not sure if there's other
ones<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.790> will<00:04:13.910> actually<00:04:14.060> move<00:04:14.420> and<00:04:14.630> kill

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
ones that will actually move and kill

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.630 
ones that will actually move and kill
you<00:04:14.930> but<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.260> far<00:04:15.470> as<00:04:15.650> i<00:04:15.799> know<00:04:15.860> that's<00:04:16.280> the<00:04:16.400> only

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
you but so far as i know that's the only

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.009 
you but so far as i know that's the only
way<00:04:16.729> i<00:04:16.760> can<00:04:16.910> kill<00:04:17.120> you<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.450> there's<00:04:17.840> other

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
way i can kill you and there's other

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.449 
way i can kill you and there's other
animatronics<00:04:18.830> but<00:04:19.040> see<00:04:19.220> they're<00:04:19.430> not

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
animatronics but see they're not

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.190 
animatronics but see they're not
necessarily<00:04:19.780> animatronic<00:04:20.780> they're<00:04:21.019> more

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
necessarily animatronic they're more

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.370 
necessarily animatronic they're more
like<00:04:21.350> demons<00:04:21.890> or<00:04:22.100> spirits<00:04:22.130> or<00:04:23.260> something<00:04:24.260> like

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
like demons or spirits or something like

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.710 
like demons or spirits or something like
i<00:04:24.590> don't<00:04:24.830> know<00:04:24.979> what<00:04:25.310> they<00:04:25.460> are<00:04:25.490> but<00:04:25.940> it<00:04:26.240> seems

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
i don't know what they are but it seems

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.440 
i don't know what they are but it seems
that<00:04:26.900> they<00:04:27.080> can<00:04:27.229> come

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
that they can come

spirit that's like floating around in
there<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.120> if<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.270> close<00:05:06.510> off<00:05:06.690> the<00:05:06.840> vents

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
there and if you close off the vents

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.600 
there and if you close off the vents
then<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.410> spirit<00:05:07.770> will<00:05:07.860> kill<00:05:08.100> you<00:05:08.250> anymore
