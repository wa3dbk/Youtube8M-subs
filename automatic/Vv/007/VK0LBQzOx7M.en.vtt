00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
never even made this character I really

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580 
never even made this character I really
don't<00:00:24.029> like<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.330> character<00:00:24.720> at<00:00:24.840> all<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.380> toys

not<00:00:25.920> terrible<00:00:26.460> but<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.150> character<00:00:27.510> itself<00:00:27.750> I

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
not terrible but the character itself I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
not terrible but the character itself I
think<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.289> silly<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> might<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
think is just silly so I might be a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.939 
think is just silly so I might be a

guess he has a move that does something

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.960

like that it kind of is supposed to snap
onto<00:01:18.210> his<00:01:18.479> fists<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:20.250> he's<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> bit

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
onto his fists like this like he's a bit

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.929 
onto his fists like this like he's a bit
swinging<00:01:21.270> back<00:01:21.509> hand<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.369> doesn't<00:01:23.700> snap

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
swinging back hand but it doesn't snap

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
swinging back hand but it doesn't snap
on<00:01:24.119> very<00:01:24.420> well<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.689> fits<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.290> perfectly

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
on very well it fits in there perfectly

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.740 
on very well it fits in there perfectly
it's<00:01:25.920> molded<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.820> hold<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> fits<00:01:27.330> perfectly

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
it's molded to hold it fits perfectly

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.810 
it's molded to hold it fits perfectly
but<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> doesn't<00:01:28.350> snap<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.829> that's<00:01:29.610> why<00:01:29.729> I'm

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
but it doesn't snap on that's why I'm

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.460 
but it doesn't snap on that's why I'm
not<00:01:29.970> showing<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> on<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.170> figure

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
because it doesn't stay on at all maybe

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.819

like<00:02:05.579> some<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> other<00:02:06.030> figures<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
like some of the other figures the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.410 
like some of the other figures the
alternate<00:02:08.099> head<00:02:08.310> has<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.879> wind<00:02:09.119> blowing

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
alternate head has the wind blowing

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.750 
alternate head has the wind blowing
kinda<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.229> looks<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.860> little<00:02:11.009> bit<00:02:11.220> play-doh<00:02:11.489> he

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
kinda it looks a little bit play-doh he

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.830 
kinda it looks a little bit play-doh he
just<00:02:12.000> because<00:02:12.300> they<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> put<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.319> in<00:02:13.410> chun

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
just because they kind of put it in chun

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.720 
just because they kind of put it in chun
even<00:02:14.769> though<00:02:14.830> there's<00:02:15.010> detail<00:02:15.430> for<00:02:15.700> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
even though there's detail for the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.240 
even though there's detail for the
individual<00:02:16.300> strands<00:02:16.870> on<00:02:16.989> there<00:02:17.260> it's<00:02:17.890> just

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
individual strands on there it's just

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.770 
individual strands on there it's just
kind<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.790> chunky<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.330> it<00:02:19.420> looks<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.660> little

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
kind of chunky so it looks a little

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.839 
kind of chunky so it looks a little
strange<00:02:19.989> but<00:02:20.500> still<00:02:20.800> paint<00:02:21.099> apps<00:02:21.250> good<00:02:21.489> sculpt

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
strange but still paint apps good sculpt

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.110

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
stitching all the way around one of the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.199 
stitching all the way around one of the
problems<00:02:55.920> with<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.160> figure<00:02:56.519> aside<00:02:57.120> from

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
problems with this figure aside from

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.180 
problems with this figure aside from
having<00:02:57.390> gigantic<00:02:57.989> feet<00:02:58.170> is<00:02:58.379> they<00:02:58.890> made<00:02:59.069> the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
having gigantic feet is they made the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.490 
having gigantic feet is they made the
bottoms<00:02:59.489> of<00:02:59.610> his<00:02:59.700> pants<00:02:59.940> at<00:03:00.120> soft<00:03:00.360> vinyl<00:03:00.690> which

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
bottoms of his pants at soft vinyl which

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.809 
bottoms of his pants at soft vinyl which
would<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.799> okay<00:03:02.129> but<00:03:02.310> they<00:03:02.400> don't<00:03:02.579> really

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
would be okay but they don't really

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.130 
would be okay but they don't really
match<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.120> rest<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.629> the<00:03:03.720> pants<00:03:03.989> they're

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
match the rest of the pants they're

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.420 
match the rest of the pants they're
darker<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.650> they<00:03:04.739> don't<00:03:04.890> line<00:03:05.069> up<00:03:05.099> perfectly

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
darker and they don't line up perfectly

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.819 
darker and they don't line up perfectly
so<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.000> looks<00:03:06.150> kind<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.450> bad<00:03:06.829> functionally

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
so it looks kind of bad functionally

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.119 
so it looks kind of bad functionally
it's<00:03:07.980> fine<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.489> looks<00:03:08.670> kind<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:08.970> goofy<00:03:09.390> in

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:10.129 
it's fine but it looks kind of goofy in

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.440 
it's fine but it looks kind of goofy in
terms<00:03:11.129> of<00:03:11.250> articulations<00:03:12.000> got<00:03:12.180> all<00:03:12.329> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
terms of articulations got all the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.089 
terms of articulations got all the
articulation<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.200> would<00:03:13.319> expect<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.859> got<00:03:14.010> the

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
articulation you would expect it got the

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.699 
articulation you would expect it got the
double<00:03:14.129> jointed<00:03:14.609> elbows<00:03:15.349> everything<00:03:16.349> else<00:03:16.500> is

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
double jointed elbows everything else is

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.099 
double jointed elbows everything else is
normal<00:03:17.099> shoulders<00:03:18.030> are<00:03:18.180> somewhat<00:03:18.629> restricted

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:19.109 
normal shoulders are somewhat restricted

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.349 
normal shoulders are somewhat restricted
to<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.410> sculpt<00:03:19.799> of<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.010> torso<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.120> not

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
to to the sculpt of the torso but not

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:22.910 
to to the sculpt of the torso but not
really<00:03:21.660> not<00:03:21.810> too<00:03:21.989> much<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.379> actually<00:03:22.500> looks

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
really not too much it actually looks

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.970 
really not too much it actually looks
nice<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:24.260> size<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> balls<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:25.890> the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
nice the size of the balls and the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.069 
nice the size of the balls and the
joints<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.609> just<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.359> overall<00:03:27.510> design<00:03:27.870> of

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
joints and just the overall design of

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.690 
joints and just the overall design of
the<00:03:28.230> figure<00:03:28.530> it<00:03:28.680> flows<00:03:28.950> nicely<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.549> looks

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
the figure it flows nicely it looks

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.030 
the figure it flows nicely it looks
really<00:03:29.910> good<00:03:30.150> it's<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.349> kind<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.680> a<00:03:31.769> goofy

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
really good it's just kind of a goofy

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.870 
really good it's just kind of a goofy
character<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.790> my<00:03:32.910> opinion<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.790> don't<00:03:35.790> know

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
character in my opinion and I don't know

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.250 
character in my opinion and I don't know
I<00:03:35.910> guess<00:03:36.299> he's<00:03:36.569> supposed<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.900> be<00:03:37.019> tall<00:03:37.230> and

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
I guess he's supposed to be tall and

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.839 
I guess he's supposed to be tall and
lanky<00:03:37.560> but<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.010> think<00:03:38.220> he<00:03:38.280> looks<00:03:38.489> kind<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.790> weird

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
lanky but I think he looks kind of weird

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.390 
lanky but I think he looks kind of weird
as<00:03:39.450> a<00:03:39.480> figure<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.200> then<00:03:40.829> of<00:03:40.950> course<00:03:40.980> he<00:03:41.310> has

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
as a figure and then of course he has

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.069 
as a figure and then of course he has
the<00:03:41.519> problem<00:03:41.849> with<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> gigantic<00:03:42.510> feet<00:03:42.780> and

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
the problem with the gigantic feet and

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.409 
the problem with the gigantic feet and
silly<00:03:43.470> pants<00:03:43.769> so<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.639> not<00:03:44.760> bad<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.269> not

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
silly pants so it's not bad but it's not

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.420 
silly pants so it's not bad but it's not
great<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:46.530> torso<00:03:46.889> is<00:03:46.950> kind<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.190> nice<00:03:47.250> because

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
great the torso is kind of nice because

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.099 
great the torso is kind of nice because
when<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.700> swivel<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.239> torso<00:03:48.660> he's<00:03:48.810> mostly

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
when you swivel the torso he's mostly

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.140 
when you swivel the torso he's mostly
round<00:03:49.470> so<00:03:49.859> none<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.430> really<00:03:50.459> hangs<00:03:50.880> over

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
round so none of it really hangs over

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.940 
round so none of it really hangs over
too<00:03:51.329> much<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.690> looks<00:03:51.840> kind<00:03:52.079> of<00:03:52.139> natural<00:03:52.620> rather

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950

no

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.189 
no
there<00:04:44.760> and<00:04:45.030> just<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.449> sculpt<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:45.810> still<00:04:46.020> off<00:04:46.169> a

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
there and just the sculpt is still off a

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:47.930 
there and just the sculpt is still off a
little<00:04:46.470> bit<00:04:46.680> but<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:46.980> more<00:04:47.160> forgivable<00:04:47.639> that

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
little bit but it's more forgivable that

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.010 
little bit but it's more forgivable that
since<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.389> colors<00:04:48.720> match<00:04:49.230> so<00:04:49.889> I<00:04:50.840> like<00:04:51.840> this

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
since the colors match so I like this

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.469 
since the colors match so I like this
one<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.860> then<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.850> black<00:04:54.000> when<00:04:54.240> i'll<00:04:54.330> show

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
one and then the black when i'll show

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:55.820 
one and then the black when i'll show
you<00:04:54.540> in<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.690> minute<00:04:54.810> the<00:04:55.260> best<00:04:55.500> out<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.680> the

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
you in a minute the best out of the

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.200 
you in a minute the best out of the
whole<00:04:55.979> line<00:04:56.160> since<00:04:56.490> they<00:04:56.610> match<00:04:56.790> the<00:04:56.820> most

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
whole line since they match the most

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.100 
whole line since they match the most
they<00:04:57.449> look<00:04:57.630> the<00:04:57.750> best<00:04:57.960> in<00:04:58.290> my<00:04:58.979> opinion

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
they look the best in my opinion

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.960 
they look the best in my opinion
speaking<00:05:01.110> of<00:05:01.199> the<00:05:01.320> black<00:05:01.530> one<00:05:01.770> here<00:05:02.040> it<00:05:02.160> is<00:05:02.280> the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
speaking of the black one here it is the

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.550 
speaking of the black one here it is the
only<00:05:03.120> reason<00:05:03.660> they<00:05:03.780> don't<00:05:03.870> match<00:05:04.169> is<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
only reason they don't match is the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.680 
only reason they don't match is the
black<00:05:04.889> is<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.190> soft<00:05:05.790> part<00:05:06.030> on<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.270> black<00:05:06.479> is

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
black is the soft part on the black is

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960 
black is the soft part on the black is
just<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.960> little<00:05:07.199> bit<00:05:07.470> shiny<00:05:08.190> otherwise<00:05:08.790> the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
just a little bit shiny otherwise the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.090 
just a little bit shiny otherwise the
color<00:05:09.180> is<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.540> same<00:05:09.780> sculpt<00:05:10.620> still<00:05:10.860> doesn't

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
color is the same sculpt still doesn't

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.409 
color is the same sculpt still doesn't
line<00:05:11.220> up<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:11.490> what<00:05:11.610> can<00:05:11.699> you<00:05:11.820> do<00:05:11.970> there<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 
line up but what can you do there and

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.810 
line up but what can you do there and
then<00:05:13.350> I<00:05:13.680> guess<00:05:13.949> technically<00:05:14.310> it's<00:05:14.460> not<00:05:14.520> black

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
then I guess technically it's not black

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.640 
then I guess technically it's not black
it's<00:05:14.850> like<00:05:15.060> really<00:05:15.449> really<00:05:15.810> dark<00:05:16.080> brown<00:05:16.380> for

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
it's like really really dark brown for

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.560 
it's like really really dark brown for
the<00:05:16.740> pants<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.729> ball<00:05:17.970> joints<00:05:18.330> are<00:05:18.419> a<00:05:18.450> little

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
the pants the ball joints are a little

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.180 
the pants the ball joints are a little
darker<00:05:19.020> they're<00:05:19.139> almost<00:05:19.260> black<00:05:19.680> so<00:05:19.950> I<00:05:19.979> wonder

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
darker they're almost black so I wonder

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.140 
darker they're almost black so I wonder
if<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.580> was<00:05:20.760> just<00:05:20.790> a<00:05:21.180> mistake<00:05:21.330> by<00:05:21.990> soda<00:05:22.350> or

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
if that was just a mistake by soda or

to just pick one I get the player one

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.240 
to just pick one I get the player one
