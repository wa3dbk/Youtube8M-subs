a quick note my version is in the key of
C<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.019> the<00:00:13.019> original<00:00:13.380> song<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.920> in<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.040> key<00:00:14.130> of

an F an E minor and the name on it and
then<00:04:30.400> back<00:04:30.639> to<00:04:30.790> D<00:04:30.940> minor<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.169> then<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.500> G

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.820 

and<00:04:39.930> that's<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.199> pre-course<00:04:42.710> finally<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and that's the pre-course finally the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.279 
and that's the pre-course finally the
last<00:04:43.979> part<00:04:44.190> is<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.669> bridge<00:04:44.940> I'll<00:04:45.900> put<00:04:46.259> a

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
last part is the bridge I'll put a

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:59.860 
last part is the bridge I'll put a
bridge<00:04:46.470> for<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.710> first<00:04:46.949> see

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:15.909 

you

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:15.919 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.230 

so<00:05:16.919> there<00:05:17.099> is<00:05:17.250> a<00:05:17.310> key<00:05:17.550> change<00:05:17.789> in<00:05:17.970> the<00:05:18.030> bridge

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
so there is a key change in the bridge

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.529 
so there is a key change in the bridge
but<00:05:18.509> it's<00:05:18.720> not<00:05:18.870> too<00:05:19.020> bad<00:05:20.210> so<00:05:21.210> for<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.479> bridges

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
but it's not too bad so for the bridges

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.450 
but it's not too bad so for the bridges
you<00:05:21.720> want<00:05:21.870> to<00:05:21.930> first<00:05:22.110> start<00:05:22.259> off<00:05:22.349> the<00:05:22.620> D<00:05:23.220> minor

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
you want to first start off the D minor

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.970 
you want to first start off the D minor
7

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:34.570 

go<00:05:28.610> to<00:05:28.670> an<00:05:28.880> e<00:05:30.550> there<00:05:31.550> you<00:05:31.670> go<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:31.850> an<00:05:32.000> a.1<00:05:33.580> you

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
go to an e there you go to an a.1 you

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:41.700 
go to an e there you go to an a.1 you
play<00:05:34.760> that<00:05:34.880> again

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.410 

and<00:05:42.710> then<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.280> key<00:05:43.460> change<00:05:43.760> you<00:05:44.300> go<00:05:44.510> into<00:05:44.870> a

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:46.420 
and then the key change you go into a

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:54.280 
and then the key change you go into a
it's<00:05:47.420> a<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.750> flat<00:05:47.990> over<00:05:48.440> a<00:05:48.470> flat<00:05:52.750> then<00:05:53.750> it's<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.080> B

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
it's a a flat over a flat then it's a B

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:07.659 
it's a a flat over a flat then it's a B
flat<00:05:54.470> over<00:05:54.830> G<00:06:01.510> it's<00:06:02.510> an<00:06:02.690> a5<00:06:03.110> /<00:06:03.290> f

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:17.269 

and<00:06:08.669> then<00:06:08.849> it<00:06:08.969> ends<00:06:09.149> with<00:06:09.209> the<00:06:09.329> G<00:06:15.709> and<00:06:16.709> that's

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
and then it ends with the G and that's

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:20.509 
and then it ends with the G and that's
basically<00:06:17.579> the<00:06:17.729> whole<00:06:17.849> song<00:06:19.159> all<00:06:20.159> right<00:06:20.369> now

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
I'll do a quick demonstration of the
