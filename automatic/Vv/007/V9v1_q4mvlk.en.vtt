00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
world but it it up honestly black ops

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.719 
world but it it up honestly black ops
wasn't<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.770> worst<00:01:29.009> call<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> duty<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.640> the

wasn't the worst call of duty in the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.670 
wasn't the worst call of duty in the
world<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.150> personally<00:01:30.990> believe<00:01:31.229> there<00:01:31.590> were

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
world I personally believe there were

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.350 
world I personally believe there were
some<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> worst<00:01:32.130> call<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.430> duty's<00:01:32.729> i<00:01:32.970> think

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
some the worst call of duty's i think

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.630 
some the worst call of duty's i think
modern<00:01:33.570> warfare<00:01:33.780> 3<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.320> way<00:01:34.530> worse<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.490> only

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
modern warfare 3 was way worse the only

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 
modern warfare 3 was way worse the only
reason<00:01:35.790> why<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.060> kept<00:01:36.540> playing<00:01:36.659> modeller<00:01:37.079> 43<00:01:37.409> as

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
reason why I kept playing modeller 43 as

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.410 
reason why I kept playing modeller 43 as
long<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:37.950> did<00:01:38.159> is<00:01:38.579> because<00:01:38.850> there<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.329> a

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
long as I did is because there was a

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.480 
long as I did is because there was a
MOAB<00:01:39.810> type<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.259> sorcery<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.009> that's<00:01:41.280> why

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
MOAB type of sorcery and that's why

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.819 
MOAB type of sorcery and that's why
that's<00:01:42.150> why<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.509> was<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.079> fun<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.320> play<00:01:43.619> with

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
that's why that was so fun to play with

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
that's why that was so fun to play with
because<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> always<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:44.850> for<00:01:45.060> something

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
because you can always go for something

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.830 
because you can always go for something
and<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.350> cool<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:46.619> there's<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.579> be

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
and it's cool that there's going to be

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480 
and it's cool that there's going to be
something<00:01:48.109> like<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.439> in<00:01:48.560> all<00:01:48.740> beauty<00:01:48.979> go<00:01:49.130> so
