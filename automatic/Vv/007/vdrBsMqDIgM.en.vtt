00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.290

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.510
 mistake on your thing that will not work 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:55.590

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.829

 Come on now I'm going to get into the mistakes. 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:52.170
 more complicated are more difficult to 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.479

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.140

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.810

 It was worth to pass on now to the mistake. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.260

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.080

 first here was the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:03.380
 the best I found low first 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.570
 so I downloaded staley on the non- computer 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.460

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.790
 the time has to stay in the video then 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.740
 I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.720
 video if someone has a video card 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.970
 Just like mine, I'll leave this link 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.250
 down and install if you want 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.130
 know if it is installed you see that the 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.590
 screen resolution settings 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.210
 advanced hotel 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.750
 voter drive 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.820
 This is the business I thought she saw. 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.940
 the graphic properties come here close 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:37.010
 which is good 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.360
 I think that if I want to change some 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.700
 thing, that's it, I've changed 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.480
 something here so that 's it then 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:50.210
 galerinha that's what I have to say 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.730
 these are the only mistakes I know 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.280
 which is one that not only get to know a lot 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.900
 material error of three that mine never 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.150
 That's when I'm at my computer. 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.000
 Dad, my father's account is great, I do not 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.370
 I was able to install this one here because 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.820
 give me some more mistake, tell me I'm going 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:10.790
 search on youtube there and I come to 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.310

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.280
 anyone you think can talk 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:20.570
 I was looking for youtube video on 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.370
 If you tried to solve the self for you and 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.870
 No, I will not try to get into the 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.340
 butterfield 3 because I know that in this 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.550
 computer that does not work because I already 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.320
 I tried everything does not work because my 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:34.220
 Video card sucks on the computer 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:37.790
 My father is great, I already played it already 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.490
 so it 's just that youtube movie 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.500
 there is nothing last- minute about 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.480
 Speak what I had to say I already spoke 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.880
 The only good thing is for you to talk now is 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.240
 You must go, I like going there. 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.480

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.430
 even if you liked liked then your 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.430
 that's all there is worth
