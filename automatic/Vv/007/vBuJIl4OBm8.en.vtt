00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.769
 What's up kids today I 'm going to teach you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.160
 a little how to feed the clowns 

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:09.299
 and in general to marine fish the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.040
 first thing that we have to give 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.200
 account is that marine fish have 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.260
 better vision than fish 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.310
 of fresh water or they see you 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.650
 approximately from five meters from 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.590
 aquarium thing that the fresh water you 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.360
 come when you are over 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.100
 the first that comes technification with 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.140
 the sailors always teach him the food 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.510
 they are like little dogs to teach 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.110
 fijaros food how they have approached 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.760
 see her 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.460
 I mean it's not a joke, it's not that it's a 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.860
 you already know that this is the sack 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.860
 of food then you open it 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.920
 is that it is all very difficult of a 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.949
 fuck fuck 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.930
 open the sack of food if I can I'll 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.480
 touch open it with your mouth 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.550
 clear as you know also 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.200
 take some balls but this with 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.930
 any pc 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.120
 if the fish is fish it's a blow to 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.190
 the glass 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.220
 realize how they have just come up 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.140
 all above because they already have an associate 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.200
 the blow of the crystal to see how they eat 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.700
 do not you think this is natural with everyone 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.550
 it's not that you have to teach a little bit 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.280
 how to feed them they have to 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.290
 associate as they see that already know that 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.740
 they are prepared and good and it is time to 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:30.329
 eating is a little hit in the glass 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.850
 raise your hand and you throw the food as 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.170
 You see eating is a short video but that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.189
 it's quite interesting also what 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 you can do with freshwater 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.939
 because I do it in marine because the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.670
 marine sitges the food and the fish do not 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.590
 they eat it then they will leave 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 algae because you are going to have a lot of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.450
 nitrates yes I hope you liked it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.310
 this trick and as you see in a couple of days 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.540
 Well, I already have my payasete 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.520
 designed to eat 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.490
 so then also when I approached 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.250
 see them come visit them if they do not see the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.510
 stroke and do not see the bag of food for 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.060
 They know I'm not going to feed them 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.490
 then do not get stressed in this way 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.110
 them whenever they hear the hit or 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 they notice the vibration of the water and see the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:14.260
 bag you already know it's time to eat and you 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.880
 they activate just to eat so I hope 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.770
 that you liked the trick and good 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.770
 Well here you have the aquarium 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.730
 how beautiful are we going to give you another 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.870
 little bit and it is and in this case you're going 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.870
 feeding until you see 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.470
 that they no longer eat more than they do not want 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.240
 but come on they are pretty dragons and they 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.210
 I usually give twice a day three times 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.480
 little fish or three handfuls of balls 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.989
 and out 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.120
 Well, nothing, guys, a little baby 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.280
 here you have the aquarium I start to have 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.470
 already the problem of algae although already as 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.990
 You see it cleans up a lot 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.610
 but it is normal it is normal that right now 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.530
 I'm getting practically everything 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.190
 brown until I do not put the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.930
 skimmer and let's say you start 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.140
 disappear nitrates and phosphates 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.390
 that came in the on the rocks so 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.950
 nothing 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.270
 let's zoom in here to see 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.270
 some little one and we leave it
