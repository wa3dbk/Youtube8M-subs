scent and I like the idea of cedar up
here<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.280> me<00:02:30.430> it's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.670> great<00:02:30.790> cover

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
let me ask you two guys really quickly

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.730 
let me ask you two guys really quickly
what<00:02:33.940> are<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.150> two<00:02:34.390> key<00:02:35.110> things<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.530> you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
what are the two key things that you

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.680 
what are the two key things that you
guys<00:02:35.920> focus<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.550> one<00:02:36.790> from<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.360> maybe<00:02:37.480> one

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
guys focus in one from you and maybe one

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.020 
guys focus in one from you and maybe one
from<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.990> Jameson<00:02:38.530> Aaron<00:02:39.190> what<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.610> key

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
from you Jameson Aaron what is a key

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.670 
from you Jameson Aaron what is a key
factor<00:02:40.540> for<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.810> brushing<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.260> ground<00:02:41.470> blind

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
factor for you brushing the ground blind

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.560 
factor for you brushing the ground blind
well<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.190> think<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.550> key<00:02:42.700> factor<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.120> brushing

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
well I think the key factor to brushing

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.600 
well I think the key factor to brushing
of<00:02:43.690> ground<00:02:43.930> bond<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.380> using<00:02:45.070> the<00:02:45.160> natural

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
of ground bond is using the natural

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.090 
of ground bond is using the natural
foliage<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:46.360> have<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.660> your<00:02:46.750> area<00:02:47.100> the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
foliage that you have in your area the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.530 
foliage that you have in your area the
more<00:02:48.250> natural<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.790> looks<00:02:48.850> in<00:02:49.330> your

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
more natural it looks in your

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.330 
more natural it looks in your
