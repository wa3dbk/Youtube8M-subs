00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 hi friends want to tell you how in 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.250
 homemade cook prunes 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.830
 we will cook plums of this sort as 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.830
 Hungarian she's so oblong 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.140
 such a beautiful lilac 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.760
 this year a very large crop leaked 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.949
 we have already prepared and jams and preserves 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 various bird sauces to grilled vegetables 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.510
 so I decided to try cooking 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.980
 prune will cook for the first time so 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.620
 what is it like to say its kind 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.610
 experiment found on the Internet 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.739
 tips from people who know how 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.920
 cook prunes try together with 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.719
 you to conduct this experiment today 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.539
 here I mean have two kilograms 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 ripe plum varieties hungarian 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.379
 I previously here and myself from the tree 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.359
 spread out on a baking sheet and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.149
 to see how much we 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.159
 it will be necessary i will call 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.770
 or dry such as they say this 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.159
 prunes in an electric oven 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.100
 I have at the top and bottom of the price 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.770
 I will cook on 2 baking trays 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.930
 for a start we now have this plum mine 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.710
 then as advised by experts 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 put half a minute into the soda solution 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.479
 tablespoon per liter of boiling water and immediately 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 rinse with cold water then give 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:38.369
 dry it in the air so we poured 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.009
 our if you boil over soda 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.770
 the amount of drains I poured half a liter 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.460
 water and a half tablespoon of soda 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.530
 soak for half a minute and immediately perry 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.979
 we put our plum in cold water 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.920
 having done such manipulations, we 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.590
 got rid of the wax on the surface of the drain 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.490
 part now we wash them and give our 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 drain dry and so here is dried 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 of our plum we start drying in 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.640
 the oven means the whole drying process we 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.670
 we will break into three parts we will begin with the first 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.690
 parts this will be dried prunes when 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.290
 temperature 50 55 degrees we dry it 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.489
 will be 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.489
 4 to 5 hours 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.260
 and so it took 5 hours we got out 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.290
 oven prunes such here has the form 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.860
 some if you let the juice 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.950
 who have already started taking frown 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 so as they say and now we 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.950
 it will be necessary to turn the whole 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.250
 prune on the back so we 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:57.760
 do with each merge leave 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.700
 we will cool to room temperature 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.840
 proceed to the second stage of drying increase 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:08.080
 oven temperature at 10 degrees and 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:12.130
 just about 60 65 and also dependencies 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.400
 from your oven we will hold 45 hours 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:18.250
 This is our future 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.530
 prunes after the second stage of drying 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.980
 now we will do the same thing 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.660
 after the first stage we turn all the plums 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:31.390
 let cool to room temperature we 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:35.770
 come to the third stage of drying plums we 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:40.080
 increase the oven temperature to 80 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.470
 85 degrees and will also dry them 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:47.620
 four four and a half hours and so here 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.290
 after the third stage of drying it turns out 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.510
 Here is such a prune result more 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.120
 less satisfactory i will repeat 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.060
 made it the first time more it 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.010
 it was like an experiment 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.280
 We will try of course as his taste 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.980
 qualities will say about my comments 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.500
 prunes need to take a large small 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.200
 prunes here are heard very much 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.140
 and it is unlikely that you can get it 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.370
 bones cook something out of it 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.280
 see as they say the result here 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.799
 such here it is worth it or not worth it of course 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.770
 it's a very long time I count with him 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.530
 I was busy for two days and of course 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.230
 small get plum lost 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.540
 a lot of moisture experts write that 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.090
 need to store in a closed bank in 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.600
 fridge advise if you are sure 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.910
 what prunes 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.490
 and dried as expected if not sure 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.940
 it is advised to keep in the freezer what 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.750
 I guess I'll do it because I'm not sure 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.400
 Well, in general, something like this, try to try 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.490
 I want to start adding that baking sheet 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.600
 preferably of course zastilat parchment 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.600
 or foil
