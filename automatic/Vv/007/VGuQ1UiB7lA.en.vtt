for your Galaxy s3 this time we're
reviewing<00:00:07.870> a<00:00:08.200> ballistic<00:00:08.740> case<00:00:08.950> called<00:00:09.340> the

reviewing a ballistic case called the
ballistic<00:00:09.970> SG<00:00:10.120> as<00:00:10.630> we<00:00:11.110> know<00:00:11.230> ballistics<00:00:11.740> has

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
ballistic SG as we know ballistics has

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.440 
ballistic SG as we know ballistics has
some<00:00:12.130> features<00:00:12.310> which<00:00:12.520> include<00:00:12.940> they're

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
some features which include they're

some features which include they're
reinforced<00:00:14.110> corners<00:00:14.410> this<00:00:15.070> is<00:00:15.400> the<00:00:15.610> SG<00:00:16.029> serie

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
reinforced corners this is the SG serie

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.690 
reinforced corners this is the SG serie
which<00:00:16.900> provides<00:00:17.439> two<00:00:17.920> levels<00:00:18.400> of<00:00:18.550> protection

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:18.700 
which provides two levels of protection

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.570 
which provides two levels of protection

strong<00:00:56.799> we<00:00:57.549> see<00:00:57.789> in<00:00:57.879> this<00:00:57.999> case<00:00:58.299> before<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.899> my

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
strong we see in this case before in my

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.199 
strong we see in this case before in my
other<00:00:59.260> devices<00:00:59.619> and<00:01:00.069> I've<00:01:00.519> been<00:01:00.670> happy<00:01:00.940> with

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:01.209 
other devices and I've been happy with

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.029 
other devices and I've been happy with
the<00:01:01.329> performance<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:02.139> the<00:01:02.260> look<00:01:02.440> this<00:01:02.829> case

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
the performance and the look this case

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.399 
the performance and the look this case
adds<00:01:03.280> significant<00:01:03.969> bolt<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.479> but<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.140> also

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
adds significant bolt to it but it also

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.680 
adds significant bolt to it but it also
is<00:01:05.620> adding<00:01:06.100> extra<00:01:06.370> protection<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:07.480> front

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
is adding extra protection the front

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.450 
is adding extra protection the front
part<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.020> case<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.350> very<00:01:08.500> raised<00:01:08.890> this

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
part of the case is very raised this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.640 
part of the case is very raised this
protects<00:01:10.210> when<00:01:10.570> there<00:01:10.840> is<00:01:10.930> a<00:01:10.960> fall<00:01:11.320> from<00:01:11.470> the

on the back part this part that we

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.560 
on the back part this part that we
review<00:01:26.980> before<00:01:27.460> putting<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.820> case<00:01:28.030> in<00:01:28.270> it's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
review before putting the case in it's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.310 
review before putting the case in it's
definitely<00:01:29.200> adding<00:01:30.160> some<00:01:30.850> grip<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.600> it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
definitely adding some grip to it and it

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.590 
definitely adding some grip to it and it
also<00:01:32.560> protects<00:01:33.490> from<00:01:33.820> impact<00:01:34.270> as<00:01:34.420> well

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
also protects from impact as well

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.830 
also protects from impact as well
