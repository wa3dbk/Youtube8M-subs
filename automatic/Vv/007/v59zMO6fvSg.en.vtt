in<00:00:07.049> GarageBand<00:00:08.929> as<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.170> probably<00:00:10.500> know<00:00:10.860> if

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
in GarageBand as you probably know if

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.950 
in GarageBand as you probably know if
you<00:00:11.070> use<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.300> iPad<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.870> iOS<00:00:14.839> you<00:00:15.839> in

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
you use it on the iPad and iOS you in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.910 
you use it on the iPad and iOS you in
gate<00:00:16.170> tracks<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> bit<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.640> limiting

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 
gate tracks which is a bit of limiting

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
gate tracks which is a bit of limiting
what<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> can<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.310> now<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.900> merge<00:00:21.900> all<00:00:22.170> these

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
what you can do now is merge all these

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.080 
what you can do now is merge all these
tracks<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:23.670> together<00:00:24.300> into<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.289> track<00:00:26.090> three

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
tracks all together into one track three

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.140 
tracks all together into one track three
and<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.300> seven<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:28.289> tracks<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.220> think<00:00:29.939> you

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
and up seven more tracks and I think you

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.089 
and up seven more tracks and I think you
can<00:00:30.359> well<00:00:30.750> I've<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.140> tried<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:31.650> assuming

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
can well I've not tried it well assuming

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.729 
can well I've not tried it well assuming
you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> same<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.960> each<00:00:34.110> track<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you can do the same on each track to you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.940 
you can do the same on each track to you
run<00:00:34.890> out<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.480> eight<00:00:36.780> tracks<00:00:37.140> on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
run out and so you have eight tracks on

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.049 
run out and so you have eight tracks on
each<00:00:38.570> master<00:00:39.570> track<00:00:41.960> any<00:00:42.960> one<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
each master track any one you use the

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.340 
each master track any one you use the
old<00:00:45.059> four<00:00:45.300> tracks<00:00:45.570> back<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.020> day<00:00:46.170> your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
old four tracks back in the day your

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.990 
old four tracks back in the day your
task<00:00:46.649> cabs<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:47.250> forth<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> we'll

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
task cabs and so forth and we'll

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.130 
task cabs and so forth and we'll
probably<00:00:48.360> know<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.899> trick<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:51.960> you

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
probably know this trick so what you

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.900 
probably know this trick so what you
need<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.620> you've<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.039> all<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.370> tracks

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
need to do you've got all your tracks

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
need to do you've got all your tracks
you've<00:00:54.570> tweaked<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.590> how<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.770> think<00:00:56.399> it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
you've tweaked them to how you think it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.910 
you've tweaked them to how you think it
sound<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.030> good<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.649> choose

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
sound pretty good and then you choose

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.660 
sound pretty good and then you choose
one<00:00:59.160> track<00:00:59.899> you<00:01:00.899> tap<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.550> an

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
one track you tap on it and you get an

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.590 
one track you tap on it and you get an
option<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.300> delete<00:01:04.260> or<00:01:04.860> emerge<00:01:05.519> sorry<00:01:06.420> my

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
option to delete or emerge sorry my

option to delete or emerge sorry my
camera's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.020> very<00:01:07.290> good<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.340> really

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
camera's not very good so I'm really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.520 
camera's not very good so I'm really
getting<00:01:08.729> very<00:01:08.820> close<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.080> says<00:01:10.260> much

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.330 
it's a really cool feature something
that<00:01:41.490> was<00:01:41.580> missing<00:01:41.910> ages<00:01:42.180> ago<00:01:43.070> it'd<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.190> nice

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
that was missing ages ago it'd be nice

that was missing ages ago it'd be nice
if<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.820> few<00:01:45.120> more<00:01:45.150> tracks<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.750> release

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
if they put few more tracks on release

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.100 
if they put few more tracks on release
or<00:01:46.320> 12<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.979> but<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.180> this<00:01:48.300> is<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.750> good<00:01:48.930> way<00:01:49.080> of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
or 12 and but but this is a good way of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:02:13.500 
or 12 and but but this is a good way of
working<00:01:54.050> again<00:01:55.050> there

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.610 

should<00:02:13.990> have<00:02:14.050> chosen<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.440> short<00:02:14.650> song<00:02:14.920> training

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.619 

it<00:02:22.250> goes<00:02:22.459> normalizing<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:25.269> now<00:02:26.269> it's<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:26.599> in

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
it goes normalizing and now it's all in

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.869 
it goes normalizing and now it's all in
one<00:02:26.959> track<00:02:27.290> here<00:02:27.650> it's<00:02:28.190> wait<00:02:28.400> for<00:02:28.549> it<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.700> build

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
one track here it's wait for it to build

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.479 
one track here it's wait for it to build
itself<00:02:29.409> but<00:02:30.409> basically<00:02:30.739> everything<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.220> was

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
itself but basically everything that was

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.270 
itself but basically everything that was
individual<00:02:32.450> tracks<00:02:32.900> are<00:02:33.709> now<00:02:33.860> all<00:02:34.069> merged

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
individual tracks are now all merged

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:42.390 
individual tracks are now all merged
onto<00:02:34.549> one<00:02:34.790> track<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.049> play<00:02:39.290> that

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.899 

there<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.489> go

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
there you go

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:47.050 
there you go
as<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.750> you<00:02:44.840> tracks<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.760> can<00:02:46.940> add

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
as all you tracks on one now you can add

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.920 
as all you tracks on one now you can add
more<00:02:48.340> tracks<00:02:50.829> and<00:02:52.239> more<00:02:53.239> tracks<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:56.569> more

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
more tracks and more tracks and more

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.680 
more tracks and more tracks and more
trucks<00:02:58.569> and<00:02:59.569> that's<00:02:59.660> basically<00:03:00.200> how<00:03:00.829> emerge

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
trucks and that's basically how emerge

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.000 
trucks and that's basically how emerge
Ori<00:03:02.690> tracks<00:03:02.989> together<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.560> free<00:03:03.769> up<00:03:03.859> more
