00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.670
 Nasa I have come the next question 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.599
 please explain what it means 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 permanent 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.820
 but a brief prayer under this matter is not 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.540
 spiritual to the rules of course prayer 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.840
 Jesus 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.070
 Lord Jesus Christ Have mercy on the Son of God 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.720
 I'm a sinner 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.689
 this business is not very ancient it goes back to 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.059
 fourth century that is exactly his 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.280
 received development in this century because 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.949
 unceasingly people prayed before but 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.429
 somehow taking shape this thing is not what 4 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:45.339
 century and reached its zenith of course 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:49.749
 same century already this seventh-eighth 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:52.600
 and accordingly when a person prays 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:55.120
 of this brief prayer he constantly 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:58.269
 thinks of God drives away this prayer 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:02.190
 thoughts and gathers himself inside 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:05.320
 that is, is engaged in the most concentrations 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.430
 besides the jesus prayer many fathers 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.410
 used to have different prayers 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.310
 there is God's mercy and wake me a sinner 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.030
 jesus prayer itself was enough 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.650
 brief god jesus christ for sweet and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:24.210
 there were other prayers let's say here prayer 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.640
 evening rules which of my hope 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 father refuge her son then big spirit 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.450
 holy trinity, then I thank you this too 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.330
 one of these prayers of one saint 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.610
 which this prayer practiced all its 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.590
 the life of such prayers used to be many but 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.060
 today it all happened and 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.360
 embodied precisely in Jesus prayer and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.950
 so this prayer is dedicated very much 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.649
 lot 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.590
 theological spiritual works which 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.320
 describe how to pray like 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 doing the right thing smart 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:01.170
 which is very soon and quickly effective 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.680
 human substitutes from the world of people to the world 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 angels 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.229
 that is, to heaven and therefore of course 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.110
 every Christian he possibly 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.550
 must constantly pray but in order 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010
 to pray without ceasing 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.299
 man must of course lead 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.549
 godly life because prayer 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.580
 will not happen in the heart which 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.200
 defiled by constant desecration of their 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.200
 help let conscience
