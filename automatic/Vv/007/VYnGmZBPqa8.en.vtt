I started paying more attention to music
being<00:01:33.700> outside<00:01:34.060> doing<00:01:34.750> them<00:01:34.930> just<00:01:35.740> kind<00:01:35.920> of

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
being outside doing them just kind of

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.830 
being outside doing them just kind of
the<00:01:36.100> lively<00:01:36.850> things<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:37.390> not<00:01:37.450> trying<00:01:37.750> to

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
the lively things and not trying to

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.940 
attach myself so much to the internet
but<00:01:39.610> then<00:01:39.910> I<00:01:39.940> decided<00:01:40.330> that<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.780> kinda<00:01:41.619> need<00:01:41.800> the

but then I decided that I kinda need the
internet<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:43.270> I'm<00:01:44.100> deciding<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.340> come<00:01:45.490> back

internet so I'm deciding to come back
the<00:01:46.600> original<00:01:46.840> plan<00:01:47.260> was<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.560> start<00:01:48.040> a<00:01:48.130> new

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the original plan was to start a new

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.429 
the original plan was to start a new
channel<00:01:48.549> which<00:01:49.000> is<00:01:49.210> actually<00:01:49.420> started<00:01:50.229> and

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
channel which is actually started and

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.240 
channel which is actually started and
has<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.070> total<00:01:51.729> of<00:01:52.000> no<00:01:52.780> videos<00:01:53.200> on<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.530> I<00:01:53.890> was

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
has a total of no videos on it I was

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.580 
has a total of no videos on it I was
just<00:01:54.369> thinking<00:01:54.760> about<00:01:54.850> it<00:01:55.060> why<00:01:55.960> leave<00:01:56.259> shadow

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
just thinking about it why leave shadow

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.499 
just thinking about it why leave shadow
cult<00:01:56.920> when<00:01:57.070> it's<00:01:57.220> a<00:01:57.310> perfectly<00:01:57.790> good<00:01:57.880> channel

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
cult when it's a perfectly good channel

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.840 
cult when it's a perfectly good channel
and<00:01:58.750> there's<00:01:59.350> already<00:01:59.590> decent<00:02:00.130> content<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.820> it

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
and there's already decent content on it

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.210 
and there's already decent content on it
so<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.960> guess<00:02:02.200> this<00:02:02.350> is<00:02:02.530> kind<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.830> like<00:02:02.979> my

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220
