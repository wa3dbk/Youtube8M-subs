00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
you don't really need to take off the

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.249 
you don't really need to take off the
screen<00:00:05.250> or<00:00:05.490> anything<00:00:05.730> on<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.910> PSP<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:07.140> a

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
screen or anything on the PSP just a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.799 
screen or anything on the PSP just a
face<00:00:07.410> plate<00:00:07.649> but<00:00:07.950> i<00:00:08.220> feel<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:09.030> like<00:00:09.240> more

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
face plate but i feel it's like more

face plate but i feel it's like more
safe<00:00:10.050> because<00:00:10.880> the<00:00:11.880> first<00:00:12.150> time<00:00:12.440> I'm<00:00:13.440> audit<00:00:13.799> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
safe because the first time I'm audit a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.470 
safe because the first time I'm audit a
PSP<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:16.049> first<00:00:16.320> man<00:00:16.830> log<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.220> muttered<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
PSP the first man log I muttered to

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.950 
PSP the first man log I muttered to
analog<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.990> some<00:00:19.710> solder<00:00:20.100> fit<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> screen

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
analog of some solder fit on the screen

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960 
analog of some solder fit on the screen
and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.199> tried<00:00:22.470> taking<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.130> off<00:00:23.279> it<00:00:23.519> really

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
and then I tried taking it off it really

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.790 
and then I tried taking it off it really
damaged<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> screaming<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.930> lot<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.529> just

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
damaged the screaming a lot so I just

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.410 
damaged the screaming a lot so I just
took<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.160> or<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.180> just<00:00:27.269> put

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.210 
took it out or you can just put
something<00:00:27.720> over<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> but<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.529> makes<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> lot

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
to cut the tips on each one of them just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.070 
to cut the tips on each one of them just
so<00:01:38.490> we<00:01:38.580> have<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> little<00:01:38.970> bit<00:01:39.240> sticking<00:01:39.899> out

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
so we have a little bit sticking out

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.779 
so we have a little bit sticking out
there<00:01:40.289> we're<00:01:40.380> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.560> put<00:01:40.710> solder<00:01:41.550> on<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
tips that way we could just solve them

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.190 
tips that way we could just solve them
on<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.580> all<00:01:45.299> right<00:01:45.450> now<00:01:45.780> they're<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.110> going

someone are going to be really really

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.119 
someone are going to be really really
short<00:01:50.720> cut<00:01:51.720> depends<00:01:52.110> with<00:01:52.229> what<00:01:52.470> area<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:53.129 
short cut depends with what area the

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.619 
short cut depends with what area the
only<00:01:53.369> long<00:01:53.580> one<00:01:53.819> the<00:01:54.030> longest<00:01:54.360> one<00:01:54.509> is

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:54.629 
only long one the longest one is

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:57.290 
only long one the longest one is
probably<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.649> ground<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.280> triangle<00:01:57.000> cuz

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
probably the ground and the triangle cuz

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.089 
probably the ground and the triangle cuz
it<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.629> really<00:01:57.869> far<00:01:58.050> away<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.830> have<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.009> go
