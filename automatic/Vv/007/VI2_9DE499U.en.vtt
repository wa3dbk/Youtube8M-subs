00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
sophisticated ways of both updating and

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.160 
sophisticated ways of both updating and
displaying<00:00:11.639> automation<00:00:12.450> data<00:00:12.660> which<00:00:12.929> means

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
displaying automation data which means

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.320 
displaying automation data which means
it's<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.530> wonderful<00:00:14.309> way<00:00:14.490> very<00:00:15.269> quickly

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it's a wonderful way very quickly

it's a wonderful way very quickly
churning<00:00:15.929> through<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.410> generating<00:00:16.890> highly

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
churning through and generating highly

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.910 
churning through and generating highly
automated<00:00:17.400> mixes<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.840> for<00:00:19.350> example<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.770> I'm

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
automated mixes now for example if I'm

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.090 
automated mixes now for example if I'm
here<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:21.390> automation<00:00:22.050> data<00:00:22.289> being<00:00:22.769> played

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
here I see automation data being played

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.120 
here I see automation data being played
back<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:24.150> my<00:00:24.210> channels<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.500> example<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
back on all my channels so for example I

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.040 
back on all my channels so for example I
can<00:00:26.670> see<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.060> faders<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:27.390> moving<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.869> and

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
can see what faders are moving up and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.859 
can see what faders are moving up and
down<00:00:28.170> under<00:00:28.800> automation<00:00:29.340> for<00:00:29.490> example<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:30.750> if

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
down under automation for example now if

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.569 
down under automation for example now if
I'm<00:00:30.990> curious<00:00:31.230> as<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.650> what<00:00:31.769> automation<00:00:32.309> state

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
I'm curious as to what automation state

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.610 
I'm curious as to what automation state
the<00:00:32.730> whole<00:00:32.910> console<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> i<00:00:33.780> press<00:00:34.380> the

here I just grab a fader and I'm
wiggling<00:00:57.059> making<00:00:57.660> new<00:00:57.809> lines<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:03.750> set<00:01:03.930> them

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
wiggling making new lines to set them

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.359 
wiggling making new lines to set them
back<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.320> read<00:01:04.530> now<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:04.860> I've<00:01:05.010> got<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.280> is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.359 
back in a read now all I've got to do is
go<00:01:05.519> read<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.030> inject<00:01:06.960> them<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.470> indeed

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
go read and inject them like that indeed

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.399 
go read and inject them like that indeed
I<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:09.330> any<00:01:09.689> channel<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.200> front

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
I can do that for any channel in front

of me or again I can use the ark just by

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
of me or again I can use the ark just by
going<00:01:13.409> read<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.820> wiping<00:01:15.210> across<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
going read and then wiping across the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260 
going read and then wiping across the
arc<00:01:16.340> what's<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.549> nice<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.729> actually<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
able to use the controls to automate

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.249 
able to use the controls to automate
your<00:01:19.799> plugins<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.600> example<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.110> want

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
your plugins so here for example I want

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.359 
your plugins so here for example I want
to<00:01:22.320> add<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.799> movement<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
to add a little bit of movement of the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.450 
to add a little bit of movement of the
channel<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.880> add<00:01:24.270> let's<00:01:24.720> say<00:01:24.869> DJ<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:26.070> plug<00:01:26.280> in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
channel I add let's say DJ to plug in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.539 
channel I add let's say DJ to plug in
let's<00:01:26.820> add<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.290> now<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.619> open<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.220> had

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
let's add that now if I open it up I had

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.760 
let's add that now if I open it up I had
all<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> parameters<00:01:29.939> grab<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> gain<00:01:31.079> let's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
all the parameters grab the gain let's

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:49.419 
all the parameters grab the gain let's
pump<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:32.579> up<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.850> little<00:01:33.060> hit<00:01:33.329> play<00:01:33.659> and

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.649 

now<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.490> course<00:01:50.549> those<00:01:50.819> moves<00:01:51.119> will<00:01:51.299> come<00:01:51.450> back

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
now of course those moves will come back

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
now of course those moves will come back
on<00:01:51.929> the<00:01:52.380> same<00:01:52.590> motorized<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> can

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
on the same motorized not so you can

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.859 
on the same motorized not so you can
actually<00:01:53.880> any<00:01:54.149> point<00:01:54.450> if<00:01:54.539> you're<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.719> touch

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
actually any point if you're in touch

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.480 
actually any point if you're in touch
mode<00:01:55.110> just<00:01:55.259> grab<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.709> we<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> top<00:01:56.340> add
