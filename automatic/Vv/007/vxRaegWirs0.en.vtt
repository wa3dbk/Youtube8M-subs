and Quick Start Guide it's obviously

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.729 
and Quick Start Guide it's obviously
going<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.780> be<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.930> very<00:02:36.109> simple<00:02:36.410> guide<00:02:36.560> because

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
going to be a very simple guide because

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.410 
going to be a very simple guide because
you're<00:02:37.310> not<00:02:37.519> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.790> get<00:02:37.910> simpler<00:02:38.239> than

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
you're not going to get simpler than

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.410 
you're not going to get simpler than
this<00:02:38.540> operation<00:02:39.230> now<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:40.370> they<00:02:40.670> say<00:02:40.700> made<00:02:41.269> for

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
this operation now as they say made for

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.390 
this operation now as they say made for
a<00:02:41.480> smartphone<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.109> I<00:02:42.470> want<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.040> fire<00:02:43.220> it<00:02:43.310> up

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
a smartphone so I want to fire it up

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.729 
a smartphone so I want to fire it up
just<00:02:43.549> fire<00:02:43.790> up<00:02:43.970> your<00:02:44.090> smartphone<00:02:44.650> start<00:02:45.650> up

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
just fire up your smartphone start up

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.270 
just fire up your smartphone start up
some<00:02:45.890> music<00:02:47.320> time<00:02:48.320> gets<00:02:48.650> typical<00:02:49.070> smartphone

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
some music time gets typical smartphone

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.640 
some music time gets typical smartphone
sound<00:02:52.299> obviously<00:02:53.299> not<00:02:53.870> really<00:02:54.140> enough<00:02:54.409> to<00:02:54.560> be

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
sound obviously not really enough to be

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.750 
sound obviously not really enough to be
heard<00:02:54.890> you<00:02:55.099> know

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
heard you know

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.460 
heard you know
but<00:02:56.390> if<00:02:56.569> anywhere<00:02:57.370> just<00:02:58.370> place<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:58.700> down

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:19.430 

suddenly<00:03:03.730> you<00:03:04.730> got<00:03:04.909> significantly<00:03:06.519> more<00:03:07.519> sad

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.430 

as<00:03:20.330> you<00:03:21.330> can<00:03:21.420> see<00:03:21.630> moving<00:03:21.870> around<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.290> will

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
as you can see moving around you will

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.020 
as you can see moving around you will
find<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.800> sweet<00:03:23.010> spot<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.310> your<00:03:23.820> phone<00:03:24.120> to

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
find the sweet spot for your phone to

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.390 
find the sweet spot for your phone to
get<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.090> absolute<00:03:27.420> ultimate<00:03:27.990> volume<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.920> of

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
get the absolute ultimate volume and of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500 
get the absolute ultimate volume and of
course<00:03:29.640> if<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:29.940> want<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.180> plug<00:03:30.270> it<00:03:30.420> in

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
course if you want to plug it in

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
course if you want to plug it in
directly<00:03:30.930> that's<00:03:31.350> fine<00:03:31.650> as<00:03:31.800> well<00:03:31.920> but<00:03:32.070> as<00:03:32.190> you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
directly that's fine as well but as you

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.770 
directly that's fine as well but as you
can<00:03:32.370> see<00:03:32.430> also<00:03:32.880> it's<00:03:33.300> going<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.540> give<00:03:33.690> you

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
can see also it's going to give you

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.420 
can see also it's going to give you
significantly<00:03:34.350> more<00:03:34.560> volume<00:03:35.040> than<00:03:35.220> you<00:03:35.250> would

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
significantly more volume than you would

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.460 
significantly more volume than you would
probably<00:03:35.970> expect<00:03:36.360> it's<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.380> be

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
probably expect it's not going to be

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.780 
probably expect it's not going to be
enough<00:03:37.680> to<00:03:37.800> fill<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.010> large<00:03:38.220> room<00:03:38.520> of<00:03:38.640> course

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
enough to fill a large room of course

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.520 
enough to fill a large room of course
but<00:03:39.240> it's<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.540> be<00:03:39.660> plenty<00:03:40.020> for<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.410> know

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
but it's going to be plenty for you know

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.280 
but it's going to be plenty for you know
on<00:03:41.190> the<00:03:41.430> go<00:03:41.580> type<00:03:41.820> things<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.390> mean<00:03:42.840> really<00:03:43.140> a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
on the go type things I mean really a

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.900 
on the go type things I mean really a
perfect<00:03:43.740> solution<00:03:43.980> for<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.460> kind<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.730> thing

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
perfect solution for that kind of thing

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.540 
perfect solution for that kind of thing
is<00:03:45.210> it<00:03:45.480> audiophile<00:03:46.050> type<00:03:46.260> sound<00:03:46.560> no<00:03:46.950> but<00:03:47.340> it's

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
is it audiophile type sound no but it's

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:48.920 
is it audiophile type sound no but it's
significantly<00:03:48.390> better<00:03:48.570> than<00:03:48.690> your

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
significantly better than your

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.200 
significantly better than your

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
little bit better sound quality now you

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.980 
little bit better sound quality now you
do<00:03:53.820> lose<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> little<00:03:54.270> bit<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.510> volume<00:03:54.660> when<00:03:54.900> you

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
do lose a little bit of volume when you

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.990 
do lose a little bit of volume when you
go<00:03:55.080> direct<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:56.250> you<00:03:56.430> will<00:03:56.610> get<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.790> little

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
go direct in but you will get a little

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.050 
go direct in but you will get a little
bit<00:03:57.180> better<00:03:57.330> sound<00:03:57.660> quality<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:59.610> course<00:03:59.880> with

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
bit better sound quality of course with

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.880 
bit better sound quality of course with
the<00:04:00.150> direct<00:04:00.420> took<00:04:00.630> up<00:04:00.810> rather<00:04:01.170> than<00:04:01.500> using<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
the direct took up rather than using the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.290 
the direct took up rather than using the
inductive<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:04.800> just<00:04:05.070> plug<00:04:05.280> it<00:04:05.400> straight<00:04:05.520> in<00:04:05.820> to

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
inductive so just plug it straight in to

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:13.030 
inductive so just plug it straight in to
your<00:04:06.390> headphone<00:04:06.750> once<00:04:07.110> again<00:04:07.430> start<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.520> up

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.830 

and<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.190> do<00:04:14.340> get<00:04:14.490> significantly<00:04:15.210> well<00:04:15.510> note<00:04:15.810> I

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
and you do get significantly well note I

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.599 
and you do get significantly well note I
should<00:04:16.109> say<00:04:16.410> significant<00:04:17.010> noticeably<00:04:17.489> better

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
should say significant noticeably better

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.030 
should say significant noticeably better
sound<00:04:17.970> quality<00:04:18.140> going<00:04:19.140> with<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.320> hardwire<00:04:19.769> in

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
sound quality going with a hardwire in

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.860 
sound quality going with a hardwire in
rather<00:04:20.609> than<00:04:20.820> going<00:04:21.060> with<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.450> inductive

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
rather than going with the inductive

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.640 
rather than going with the inductive
type<00:04:22.680> sound<00:04:22.980> quality<00:04:23.370> but<00:04:23.850> either<00:04:24.120> way<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:24.390> mean

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
type sound quality but either way I mean

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.010 
type sound quality but either way I mean
works<00:04:25.650> very<00:04:26.130> very<00:04:26.280> well<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.480> just<00:04:27.720> can't

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
works very very well and you just can't

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.230 
works very very well and you just can't
ask<00:04:28.230> for<00:04:28.320> easier<00:04:28.800> than<00:04:28.950> that<00:04:29.070> drop<00:04:29.370> on<00:04:29.580> that<00:04:30.150> we

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
ask for easier than that drop on that we

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:46.909 
ask for easier than that drop on that we
saw<00:04:30.450> before<00:04:30.660> so<00:04:44.270> very<00:04:45.270> very<00:04:45.780> easy<00:04:45.930> very<00:04:46.650> very

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
saw before so very very easy very very

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.159 
saw before so very very easy very very
simple<00:04:47.280> to<00:04:47.340> use<00:04:47.370> does<00:04:47.970> exactly<00:04:48.570> what<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.990> says

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
simple to use does exactly what it says

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.810 
simple to use does exactly what it says
it's<00:04:49.350> going<00:04:49.440> to<00:04:49.500> do<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:49.890> actually<00:04:50.580> does<00:04:50.730> it

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
it's going to do and actually does it

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.890 
it's going to do and actually does it
with<00:04:50.910> better<00:04:51.120> sound<00:04:51.390> quality<00:04:51.480> and<00:04:51.840> you
