even been a month yet so i'm going to be
going<00:00:33.149> over<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.570> features<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.620> case<00:00:34.890> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
going over the features of this case and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.400 
going over the features of this case and
just<00:00:36.180> drop<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> couple<00:00:36.989> times<00:00:37.200> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
just drop it in a couple times and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.459 
just drop it in a couple times and
showing<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.920> that<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.719> really<00:00:39.960> absorbs

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
showing you that it this really absorbs

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.650 
showing you that it this really absorbs
the<00:00:40.649> impact<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:41.670> into<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.000> case<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.540> does

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
the impact right into the case it does

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.650 
the impact right into the case it does
not<00:00:42.860> mess<00:00:43.860> with<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.070> phone<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.460> all<00:00:44.660> nothing

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
not mess with the phone at all nothing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.600 
not mess with the phone at all nothing
touches<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> phone<00:00:46.559> it's<00:00:46.950> really<00:00:47.460> great

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
touches the phone it's really great

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.119 
touches the phone it's really great
unless<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.000> drop<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:49.020> screen<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.860> right

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
unless you drop the screen like right

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.840 
unless you drop the screen like right
here<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.989> sharp<00:00:51.989> corner<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:53.039> pointy<00:00:53.399> object

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
here on a sharp corner or pointy object

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.889 
here on a sharp corner or pointy object
then<00:00:55.129> you'll<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.280> good<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.510> don't<00:00:57.780> know

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
then you'll be good like I don't know

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.110 
then you'll be good like I don't know
why<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.289> trying<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> do<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.770> anyway<00:00:59.120> but

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
why you be trying to do that anyway but

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.290 
why you be trying to do that anyway but
uh<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.699> called<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> ballistic

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
uh this is the called the ballistic

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.039 
uh this is the called the ballistic
shell<00:01:03.809> gel<00:01:04.559> case<00:01:05.280> like<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.420> said<00:01:06.600> for<00:01:06.630> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
shell gel case like as I said for the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.210 
shell gel case like as I said for the
epic<00:01:07.409> touch<00:01:07.590> 4G<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:09.240> has<00:01:09.500> three<00:01:10.500> layers<00:01:10.740> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
epic touch 4G and it has three layers of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
epic touch 4G and it has three layers of
protection<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:12.570> got<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:14.299> ballistic<00:01:15.299> shop

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
protection it's got the a ballistic shop

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.460 
protection it's got the a ballistic shop
absorbent<00:01:16.320> polymer<00:01:17.659> the<00:01:18.659> tough

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
absorbent polymer the tough

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.679 
absorbent polymer the tough
polycarbonate<00:01:20.220> shell<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> soft

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
polycarbonate shell and the soft

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.140 
polycarbonate shell and the soft
silicone<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:26.009> rounded<00:01:26.580> corners<00:01:27.500> so<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:30.000> is

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
silicone with rounded corners so this is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.010 
silicone with rounded corners so this is
really<00:01:30.299> thick<00:01:30.680> silicone<00:01:31.680> right<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:33.020> it

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
really thick silicone right here at it

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.810 
really thick silicone right here at it
absorbs<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.740> lot<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.040> stuff<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.520> leaving<00:01:35.790> my

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
absorbs a lot of stuff like leaving my

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.730 
absorbs a lot of stuff like leaving my
laptop<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:37.549> like<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.909> am<00:01:39.710> scared<00:01:40.710> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
sits not damaging the phone at all it's

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
sits not damaging the phone at all it's
really<00:01:49.530> nice<00:01:49.799> it's<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.100> easy<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.579> take<00:01:51.180> on

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
really nice it's really easy to take on

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.679 
really nice it's really easy to take on
and<00:01:51.390> off<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.920> this<00:01:52.920> ballistic<00:01:53.509> backing<00:01:54.509> right

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
and off to this ballistic backing right

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:00.679 
and off to this ballistic backing right
here<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.770> take<00:01:55.979> off<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:57.530> I'm<00:01:58.530> afraid<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.689> try

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
here just take off and I'm afraid to try

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.219 
here just take off and I'm afraid to try
to<00:02:00.750> squeeze<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.770> bend<00:02:02.250> down<00:02:02.399> too<00:02:02.729> hard<00:02:03.229> but

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to squeeze or bend down too hard but

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.109 
to squeeze or bend down too hard but
because<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.820> don't<00:02:05.820> know<00:02:05.880> how<00:02:06.030> exactly

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
because that I don't know how exactly

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.109 
because that I don't know how exactly
how<00:02:06.570> are<00:02:06.689> strong<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.710> bliss<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.879> think

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
how are strong this is bliss you think

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
how are strong this is bliss you think
it<00:02:09.179> would<00:02:09.239> take<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.450> bullet<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.140> hey<00:02:10.379> maybe<00:02:10.739> this

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it would take a bullet so hey maybe this

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.110 
it would take a bullet so hey maybe this
will<00:02:10.920> save<00:02:11.069> your<00:02:11.190> life<00:02:11.250> someday

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
will save your life someday

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.530 
will save your life someday
but<00:02:12.870> uh<00:02:13.280> yeah<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> mean<00:02:14.730> it's<00:02:15.030> pretty<00:02:15.299> tough

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
but uh yeah so I mean it's pretty tough

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.830 
but uh yeah so I mean it's pretty tough
it's<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.170> little<00:02:16.590> flimsy<00:02:16.980> but<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.730> mean<00:02:18.510> just<00:02:18.750> for

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
it's a little flimsy but I mean just for

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720 
it's a little flimsy but I mean just for
