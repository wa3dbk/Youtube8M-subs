hello everybody today I want to tell you
about<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.300> human<00:00:03.659> proportions<00:00:03.990> for<00:00:04.350> artists

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:05.240 
about the human proportions for artists

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.509 
about the human proportions for artists
many<00:00:06.240> artists<00:00:06.899> especially<00:00:07.170> sculptors<00:00:08.010> 3d

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
many artists especially sculptors 3d

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.310 
many artists especially sculptors 3d
artists<00:00:08.970> or<00:00:09.090> illustrators<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.960> can<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
artists or illustrators you can have a

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.740 
artists or illustrators you can have a
struggle<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> human<00:00:11.639> figure<00:00:11.790> it<00:00:12.540> looks

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
struggle with a human figure it looks

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.010 
struggle with a human figure it looks
strange<00:00:13.190> but<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:14.429> is<00:00:14.549> wrong<00:00:14.730> where<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.690> one

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
strange but what is wrong where is one

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.460 
strange but what is wrong where is one
exam<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.890> example<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.550> found<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:19.350> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
exam one example I found it in a in a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.310 
exam one example I found it in a in a
Google<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.730> somebody<00:00:21.029> made<00:00:21.240> made<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> drawing

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
Google that somebody made made a drawing

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.230 
Google that somebody made made a drawing
and<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.460> looks<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.060> looks<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.390> bit<00:00:24.420> weird<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
and it looks it looks a bit weird and

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.939 
and it looks it looks a bit weird and
seems<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.720> some<00:00:27.810> something<00:00:28.439> wrong<00:00:28.740> with

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
seems there is some something wrong with

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.330 
seems there is some something wrong with
proportions

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
proportions

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.760 
proportions
so<00:00:32.340> maybe<00:00:32.579> hands<00:00:33.059> are<00:00:33.180> too<00:00:33.329> short<00:00:33.630> or<00:00:34.020> head<00:00:34.559> is

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
so maybe hands are too short or head is

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.270 
so maybe hands are too short or head is
too<00:00:34.980> big<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.750> we<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.899> draw<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.140> hand<00:00:37.770> shorter

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
too big or we can draw of hand shorter

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
too big or we can draw of hand shorter
but<00:00:39.000> how<00:00:39.210> much<00:00:39.360> shorter<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> draw<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
but how much shorter we have to draw it

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.160 
but how much shorter we have to draw it
how<00:00:40.920> much<00:00:41.070> how<00:00:41.760> much<00:00:41.910> how<00:00:42.570> much<00:00:42.629> we<00:00:42.930> have<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
how much how much how much we have to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.160 
how much how much how much we have to
reduce<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> size<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.160> hand<00:00:44.930> so<00:00:45.930> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
reduce the size of the hand so the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.420 
reduce the size of the hand so the
problem<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.890> proportion<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:49.430> yeah

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
problem is proportion so what to do yeah

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.830 
problem is proportion so what to do yeah
must<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.329> solution<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> there<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.420> thousands

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
must be solution and there is thousands

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.229 
must be solution and there is thousands
of<00:00:54.930> books<00:00:55.140> out<00:00:55.320> there<00:00:55.610> about<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.940> human

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
of books out there about the human

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.510 
of books out there about the human
anatomy<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.870> about<00:00:58.079> proportions<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> we<00:00:59.340> can

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
anatomy and about proportions so we can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.029 
anatomy and about proportions so we can
read<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.780> thousands<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> thousands

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
read all of them thousands and thousands

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.479 
read all of them thousands and thousands
and<00:01:02.129> thousands<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.019> study<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.409> formulas<00:01:05.339> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
and thousands and study in formulas and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.070 
and thousands and study in formulas and
principles<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:08.040> also<00:01:08.580> we<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:09.960> go

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
principles and also we can go we can go

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.789 
principles and also we can go we can go
internet<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> there<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.210> lot<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:13.170> lot<00:01:13.619> of

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
internet and there is a lot of a lot of

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.460 
internet and there is a lot of a lot of
a<00:01:14.040> lot<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.549> toriel's<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> lot<00:01:15.900> of<00:01:15.930> different

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
a lot of toriel's and a lot of different

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.789 
a lot of toriel's and a lot of different
formulas<00:01:17.220> also<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:20.600> it<00:01:21.600> takes<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.229> ages<00:01:22.650> to

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
formulas also so it takes like ages to

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.179 
formulas also so it takes like ages to
study<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.189> these<00:01:23.369> things<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:24.150> know<00:01:25.130> even<00:01:26.130> if

study all these things you know even if

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.780 
study all these things you know even if
I<00:01:26.340> know<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.759> lot<00:01:27.119> about<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.790> still

have some reference materials with me
every<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.540> make<00:01:36.810> realistic<00:01:37.500> figure

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
every time and I make realistic figure

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.109 
every time and I make realistic figure

example<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.100> male<00:02:02.340> we<00:02:02.969> change<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
example this is male we change it to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.160 
example this is male we change it to
female<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:05.030> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> adult<00:02:06.329> we<00:02:06.719> change<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
female and this is adult we change it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.630 
female and this is adult we change it
let's<00:02:07.409> say<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.879> teenager<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:10.459> we<00:02:11.459> use

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
let's say it teenager and we use

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.309 
let's say it teenager and we use
centimeters

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
centimeters

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.280 
centimeters
then<00:02:13.530> we<00:02:14.099> entered<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.110> amount<00:02:16.110> of

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
then we entered the amount of

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.559 
then we entered the amount of
centimeters<00:02:16.860> we<00:02:17.010> want<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.430> have<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.269> this<00:02:18.450> is

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
centimeters we want to have so this is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.140 
centimeters we want to have so this is
the<00:02:18.719> height<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.799> figure<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.519> want<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:20.909> create

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the height of figure you want to create

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.539 
the height of figure you want to create
so<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.930> decide<00:02:22.349> to<00:02:22.379> make<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.680> figure<00:02:22.920> height<00:02:23.340> of

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
so I decide to make a figure height of

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.599 
so I decide to make a figure height of
let's<00:02:23.879> say<00:02:24.349> 58<00:02:25.349> centimeters<00:02:25.890> high<00:02:26.280> it's<00:02:26.519> a

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:26.609 
let's say 58 centimeters high it's a

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:28.849 
let's say 58 centimeters high it's a
little<00:02:26.900> little<00:02:27.900> small<00:02:28.170> statue<00:02:28.439> and<00:02:28.650> then<00:02:28.739> we

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
little little small statue and then we

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:34.670 
little little small statue and then we
click<00:02:29.040> calculate<00:02:30.349> and<00:02:32.540> here<00:02:33.540> we<00:02:33.629> go<00:02:33.780> we<00:02:34.470> have

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
click calculate and here we go we have

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.800 
click calculate and here we go we have
all<00:02:34.920> numbers<00:02:36.170> it's<00:02:38.150> for<00:02:39.150> example<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.599> height

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
all numbers it's for example the height

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.050 
all numbers it's for example the height
of<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.049> head<00:02:40.260> someone<00:02:41.069> had<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> unit<00:02:41.579> it's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
of the head someone had a unit it's

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.869 
of the head someone had a unit it's
eight<00:02:42.420> point<00:02:42.810> three<00:02:42.870> centimeters<00:02:43.700> chained<00:02:44.700> to

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
eight point three centimeters chained to

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.390 
eight point three centimeters chained to
the<00:02:45.000> shoulder<00:02:45.329> line<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.109> zero<00:02:46.980> point<00:02:47.220> three

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the shoulder line it's zero point three

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.729 
the shoulder line it's zero point three
head<00:02:47.609> units<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.209> it's<00:02:48.780> two<00:02:49.230> point<00:02:49.500> six

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
head units and it's two point six

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.929 
head units and it's two point six
centimeters<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:51.030> we<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.359> we<00:02:52.290> have<00:02:52.470> already

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
centimeters so we have we have already

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:56.330 
centimeters so we have we have already
the<00:02:53.939> Rayleigh<00:02:54.150> numbers<00:02:54.599> and<00:02:55.040> if<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.189> have<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
the Rayleigh numbers and if we have a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.129 
the Rayleigh numbers and if we have a
question<00:02:56.609> for<00:02:57.150> example<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.720> what<00:02:57.930> means

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
question for example like what means

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.909 
question for example like what means
length<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> forearm<00:02:59.639> and<00:03:00.150> hand<00:03:01.109> so<00:03:01.799> we

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:01.919 
length of the forearm and hand so we

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.710 
length of the forearm and hand so we
click<00:03:02.419> and<00:03:03.419> we<00:03:03.569> get<00:03:03.829> we<00:03:04.829> get<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:06.209> red<00:03:06.480> line

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
click and we get we get this red line

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.199 
click and we get we get this red line
here<00:03:07.939> it<00:03:08.939> shows<00:03:09.239> where<00:03:10.079> is<00:03:10.169> this<00:03:11.030> what<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.180> this

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
here it shows where is this what is this

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.000 
here it shows where is this what is this
and<00:03:12.629> also<00:03:12.959> we<00:03:13.079> have<00:03:13.909> sizes<00:03:14.909> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.180> head<00:03:16.010> it

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
and also we have sizes of the head it

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.789 
and also we have sizes of the head it
gives<00:03:17.310> us<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:18.449> height<00:03:18.659> of<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.260> head<00:03:19.440> it's

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
gives us the height of the head it's

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.409 
gives us the height of the head it's
eight<00:03:20.190> point<00:03:20.519> three<00:03:20.579> service<00:03:21.030> with<00:03:21.150> what<00:03:21.329> is

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:21.419 
eight point three service with what is

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:22.699 
eight point three service with what is
height<00:03:21.599> of<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.840> head<00:03:21.959> probably<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.470> still

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
height of the head probably it's still

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.879 
height of the head probably it's still
here<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.370> we<00:03:23.459> don't<00:03:23.639> count<00:03:23.819> hairs<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.709> take

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
here so we don't count hairs so we take

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.559 
here so we don't count hairs so we take
here<00:03:26.220> yeah<00:03:26.549> this<00:03:26.760> is<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.000> height<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.389> head
