00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:08.080
 late 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.080

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.860
 well last night sergio bouquets surprised to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.700
 blond pillar 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.860
 appearing by surprise in the 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.529
 anthill and not only that but also 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.030
 He did it singing yes yes it's lost 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.750
 I heard 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.750
 I have more 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.970
 the way life lived 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.400
 let's call because it's a shame 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.400
 let him sing in Pablo Pablo's program 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.150
 we close 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 how about what happens here 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.140
 is from Rodriguez, because earlier than 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.729
 the song of the night is attached and 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.760
 I do not take it out of my head but, but 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.590
 This is not the worst, they have already hit me and 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.390
 then people think it's not ready 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 they let someone think that I think 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.710
 a little clear that you do not turn towards the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.570
 truth neither bisbal nor bad nor rozana and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.560
 this we are colleagues are not those in the 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.880
 12 on telecinco and I said to upload 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.130
 he explained where he linked with clear weights 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.539
 and that was a little lower not also 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.610
 this too but good as it does not have 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.590
 a posture because no good fish that a 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.200
 Sometimes I also like to give rest to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.780
 coconut does not know how to jump to allergy if 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.250
 you know that yesterday left everyone wrong 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.259
 the uncles because because all the brides 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.149
 from spain are saying look that's a 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.909
 surprise in which you do like that was not 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.189
 normal was not a romantic not to do 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.630
 always making candles but good what 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.269
 I'm convinced that with the match this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.530
 that bad but there have to see what 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.880
 we learn with you is what you did not know 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.650
 that was is so responsible that you do not drink 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.019
 before the matches I listened I was in 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.090
 your house a week or two ago we were 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.860
 a little preparing things and I prepare a 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:29.239
 gin and tonic the next day I had a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:32.260
 party I say tomato one and I do not know if what 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.260
 I would have taken it would not count 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.370
 but good is good what happens is that 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.410
 this day I was without tonic and with no 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.239
 lower the tones I said because I did not drink 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.190
 we do not wait here at home not be the one 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.050
 he dealt with when I joined the middle 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.239
 from the gardens the other day 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.450
 I look at the middle of the gardens of the 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.880
 medium andy lucas we also went out to 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.709
 andy lucas are two sergios like they are 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.319
 two who do not hear from the middle are two alone 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.750
 truth is that it was the fat man who had 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.690
 thinned and also have very 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.660
 good birds are burning trees of 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.380
 stomach burning that kill burning that 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.940
 look at trees that stop saving a 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.700
 little does not need to recite the hair and 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.230
 look what song he did not learn 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.480
 comes 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.580
 He has hidden guitars you want him to 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.090
 touch with the organillo that the lamb 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.090
 Its in the closet 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.849
 thanks to the family 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.750
 the others I have already been four I know that it does not stop 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.750
