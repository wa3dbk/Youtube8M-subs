 we find here on one of the plots 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.930
 who found the 50 hectares of the estate 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.279
 traditional areas of houses of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.380
 champagne where we master the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.599
 production from the plantation until 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.160

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.779
 own vineyards with manual labor 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.439

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.790
 date from the 60s that are still in 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.229

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.550
 many champagne houses we 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.720
