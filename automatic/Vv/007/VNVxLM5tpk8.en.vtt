00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.350

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.000
 I was your talk variety for Japan 2 c until now 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:19.230
 In the story 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.130
 We also talk about which terminals can use this sim card of JCR . 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.730
 The 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:32.250
 I strongly recommend today when using this Japan Communication Moment 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 I would like to introduce Smart Four 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 First, when you say from conclusion 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.710
 The smartphone that I strongly recommend is 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.710
 Here 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.920
 galaxy nexus 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:54.039
 why 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:55.650
 Recommend this galaxy nexus rather than the other ntt DoCoMo mobile 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.000
 Or 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:04.170
 First of all, this smartphone 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.580
 google is a genuine smartphone mother 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:16.420
 In this word just I would like to Dechotto various description of hard to understand in very 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.690
 First of all, ntt docomo's smartphone 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.290
 It is equipped with these things 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.290
 Lee market 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.440
 d Shopping 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.220
 d games 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.970
 d music 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.970
 t hits 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.700
 This is the service of DoCoMo 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.190
 d video d anime store 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.650
 t book 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.180
 Such as Softbank and au 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.830
 There is a service 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.130
 Saying 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.909
 Well own app I'm that contains a variety of each carrier 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.140
 Just 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.550
 This is the same for any career 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:10.060
 There are too many unique apps 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.480
 We have a pretty me be or the way tired or freezes occur Baku 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.040
 However 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.239
 This galaxy nexus is ntt docomo 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.239
 I'm out but 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.560
 Docomo 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:32.230
 Most of my own apps are not included 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:37.110
 Only this sp mode mail is included 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.980
 I went and d is the market Toka d shop after 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.980
 Your own app is 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.460
 Not at all 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.760
 Because 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.190
 This terminal is very 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.830
 Snappy also Oite to what do 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.610
 What 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:59.590
 Is this galaxy nexus alone not included? 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:04.410
 There is actually a good reason for this 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:10.550
 So far , in what form Google 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:12.310
 You were allowed to put your own app or your own glans 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:18.640
 Because 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:21.069
 ntt DoCoMo smartphone is your wallet mobile phone on equipped with android 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.310
 Infrared communication 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:33.430
 I wanted to put in a docomo unique app such as d Market. 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:37.000
 From now on Google, especially this galaxy nexus and others nexus 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.340
 Such as 7 Toka nexus 10 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.840
 google genuine terminal 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:48.800
 Also 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:52.280
 Starting with android 4.2, I will not put any unique features or unique apps 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:04:00.300
 It is said that we decided on the policy 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 So why say what was in that you do not put a sudden own app uh unique feature 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.170
 After all, I failure had occurred by putting the unique features and apps were Ssoi 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.620
 is not it 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:19.970
 First, as the first reason is a place that does not have its own app for DoCoMo 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:23.180
 There is almost no bug or freeze caused by not including such things 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.500
 There is one more reason 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:32.350
 That is the price 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:34.009
 This galaxy nexus is certainly what was released around 2011 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.430
 But 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:40.430
 You can buy cheap for secondhand 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.070
 If it is Sofmap 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.810
 Here 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:52.020
 You can buy for 800 yen before the first salary 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:54.480
 Android terminal so you red rom guarantee also opened if further its smap in 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:59.190
 If you choose 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:06.420
 I think this galaxy nexus is enough 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:07.550
 Today I will introduce a smartphone that I personally explain about my back when using Nippon Telecommunications 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.370
 The 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.370
 Thank you for watching today to here
