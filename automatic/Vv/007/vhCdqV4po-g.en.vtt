00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:15.730
 Nice to meet you, and it is the chief live of Miyoshi Music School drum lecturer 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:18.460
 It is feeling of 8 16 beats this time about dram for beginners 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.939
 I want to lecture on a phrase that contains 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:25.270
 8 Well usually is a little phrase of 8 beat 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.820
 This 16 beats when you want to give a feeling of running 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.369
 effective 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.369
 So you now wish my best regards, please master 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:44.740
 Yes as a way to get 16 beat heroes 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.490
 There are various methods and methods to engrave in 16 parts of the peninsula and methods to put in h for 16 parts in Sune . 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.940
 But 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:53.870
 How to make the feeling of 16 parts by the position to step on the simplest bass drum this time 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.140
 I would like to teach you 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.300
 Then 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.300
 I really want to tap lightly 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.450
 Had 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 Oh oh oh 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.470
 I am 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.980
 I 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.260
 th 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.320
 I am 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.320
 Oh 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.259
 th 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.330
 deh 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:41.640
 Well then I would like to explain a little lightly on the phrase that I just made 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.630
 8 right hand in eight minutes 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.700
 I have carved it but it is moe 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.700
 I think a little hunt wants to do it 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.690
 The hat was carved in the Hachibe like this 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.640
 What 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:06.350
 It's an 8-pass worm but basically it's 8 peninsula 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:12.440
 8 beat and though I do not is almost the same because it carved in 8 parts 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:17.810
 16 beats by stepping on the back of the rice hi-hat with the bass drum at the head 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:21.100
 Now I'm putting out the ring, so this time only the bus will fit to the previous hi-hat . 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.100
 I think I want to 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:53.650
 If you think of it as a rice mother during winter, do you understand that the throw is coming ? 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.710
 Though I think that there is an unknown , I have a sixteenth note on the back of the prisoner of rice at 8 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:01.160
 I think there is a boss drum in the position of 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:06.710
 It's like this , behind Eto Hachimin's hi-hat 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:10.610
 Though you can add the 16 degrees of the troops by putting the sound of some kind 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:16.940
 Although only we put on the back eight minutes now this one place 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:20.390
 It is 8 depending on the number of this because it can be added to the last 7 by addition 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.180
 You can get the feeling of 16 more beats 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.120
 Well then 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.120
 I also want to be high pattern by 8 windows 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.069
 Ray 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.770
 Masu Tei 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.439
 th 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.920
 th 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.560
 It has been 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.020
 th 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.150
 Day 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.409
 th 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.409
 It is 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:04.409
 th 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.740
 th 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.740
 th 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.740
 th 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.100
 beitr e 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.440
 Yes actually in various patterns 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:42.100
 I received a pattern of 16 beats, but it is also the first one 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.590
 I had gotten the same pattern as the earlier gotten this 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.120
 Four 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.650
 Masu Tei 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.529
 Had 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.249
 Hmm 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:57.069
 Only one person further next two turning eyes 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:57.069
 The last looks like this bust is that I tried one increase to more 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.020
 th 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.639
 th 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.569
 Day 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:12.650
 Yes, but I think that has changed nuances only a little number of the next phrase is further boss 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:14.210
 It is such a feeling that is increasing 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.780
 th 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.300
 Masu Tei 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.330
 th 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:25.120
 th 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:31.090
 It is this feeling 8 last of the four bars is not a 8 lotus river 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:35.159
 A phrase that gives a feeling of 16 beats by putting a snare at 16 parts of 1 o'clock 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.159
 I felt like I got a little 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.770
 ten 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:51.439
 Yes really a lot in such a feeling 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:53.490
 And you can think of a phrase of 16 beats, so you devise your own play image 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:57.860
 Please try to make 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.860
 Thank you for crossing 16 beats
