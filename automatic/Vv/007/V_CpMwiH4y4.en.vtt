00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
basic command block tutorial I know bit

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.289 
basic command block tutorial I know bit
about<00:02:49.920> command<00:02:50.220> block<00:02:50.400> for<00:02:50.580> not<00:02:50.700> much<00:02:51.000> okay

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
about command block for not much okay

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.539 
about command block for not much okay
I'm<00:02:51.360> rambling<00:02:51.750> now<00:02:51.900> anyway<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:53.100> this<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.370> a

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
these coordinates so yeah I might be

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.860 
these coordinates so yeah I might be
doing<00:03:28.650> oka<00:03:29.190> complex<00:03:29.730> command<00:03:30.209> block<00:03:30.390> tutorial

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
doing oka complex command block tutorial

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.259 
doing oka complex command block tutorial
maybe<00:03:31.230> not<00:03:31.530> not<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.670> good<00:03:32.730> with<00:03:32.880> command

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
maybe not not that good with command

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.569 
maybe not not that good with command
blocks<00:03:33.540> I<00:03:33.750> know<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:34.170> like<00:03:34.739> high<00:03:34.980> pixel<00:03:35.400> and

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
blocks I know I like high pixel and

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.250 
blocks I know I like high pixel and
that's<00:03:36.209> being<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.810> good<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.170> just

that's being a really good you just

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.170 
that's being a really good you just
check<00:03:37.440> them<00:03:37.620> out<00:03:37.709> they<00:03:38.280> made<00:03:38.489> awesome<00:03:38.700> custom

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
check them out they made awesome custom

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.930 
check them out they made awesome custom
maps<00:03:39.329> with<00:03:39.480> command<00:03:39.810> blocks<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:41.340> yeah<00:03:41.489> you

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
maps with command blocks and yeah you

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.090 
maps with command blocks and yeah you
can<00:03:41.970> experiment<00:03:42.840> with<00:03:43.049> these<00:03:43.290> really<00:03:43.859> fun

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
can experiment with these really fun

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.949 
can experiment with these really fun
actually<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:45.030> can<00:03:45.150> make<00:03:45.269> loads<00:03:45.750> of<00:03:45.900> things

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
actually you can make loads of things

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.500 
actually you can make loads of things
like<00:03:46.380> you<00:03:46.470> can<00:03:46.620> spawn<00:03:46.859> monsters<00:03:47.819> with<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.239> don't

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
like you can spawn monsters with I don't
