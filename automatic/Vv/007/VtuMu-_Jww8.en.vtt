00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.900
 marked for free on the way 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.929
 abraum from the ball and every day each 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.090
 wait departure curves to look at times 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.510
 times both curves times is the underground 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 Loosely come speak quite a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.600
 Challenge 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.160
 we look at each other the best we can 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 the curves get around with the e 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.910
 we are mostly in the mountain bike 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.050
 terrain en route speak on gravel 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.149
 evil forest would 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.000
 It is important that we bend 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.590
 drive with a tilt of the bike and 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 we stay centrally over the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.789
 bar to the inclination of the bikes 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.670
 to reach curves directions 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.739
 Let's go to the bend and look 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 then with the body where he goes 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.580
 wanted 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.950
 speak we turn our body 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.900
 look in the curve entrance and from it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.689
 then to watch out kaarst and the wheel 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.540
 through the Christmas in the curves tend 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.700
 and follows our movement a whole 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.040
 important indicator for the correct 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.770
 inclination of the bike is the fifth contact 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.259
 speak the date leans on the inner 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.479
 Wine can left turn on the left leg 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.270
 right turn on the right leg come 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.390
 sometimes depending on geometry and crank 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.579
 position is also the frame around the 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.180
 bend radius even closer time to 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.369
 example at youtube seventeen or for 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.369
 even more attractions we can do 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.240
 add to the inclination by using the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.750
 handlebar with the inner arm continues 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.729
 Inside 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.740
 That's how we put the wheel in more 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.650
 the passion and have more 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.659
 functions with the sides strongly straight 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.479
 we can change at fast turns 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.909
 to work with dynamic footwork 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.690
 speak a left turn we open the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.090
 left knee 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.340
 this relieves the inner pedal 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.610
 and we get more pressure on the outside 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.130
 pedal on many trails are waiting a lot 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.290
 earn pointed kerner and most 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.630
 Cases can be well done by driving there 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.010
 we brought in the same things 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.959
 amiens normal curves 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.810
 it is precisely the guidance of the eye that is decisive 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.519
 the wheel is also inclined and 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.790
 Drove at slow speed through the 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.769
 turn a very important element on the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.190
 There was the correct braking 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.500
 before the turn, he slow down more 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.290
 the curve as in the curve fleeting 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.180
 Departures link is often even in the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.750
 curve completely to run 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.790
 2 slow technical curves we brake 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.500
 even more before the turn can that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.980
 anyway I run in the curve 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.299
 Conclusion, the wheel tends in the curve 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.000
 on the cardboard rotation and the 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.739
 sightseeing also on the city council 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.600
 the way to work the frequent the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:06.209
 things hypo better you can do this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.209
 then automated motion in the trot
