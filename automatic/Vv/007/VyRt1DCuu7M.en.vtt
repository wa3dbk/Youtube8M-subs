not on my waterline it's my lower lash
line<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.140> i'm<00:02:33.830> using<00:02:34.099> physicians<00:02:34.700> formula<00:02:34.909> I

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
line and i'm using physicians formula I

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.320 
line and i'm using physicians formula I
booster<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.200> because<00:02:37.099> it<00:02:37.280> has<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.489> really<00:02:37.940> fine

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
booster and because it has a really fine

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.130 
booster and because it has a really fine
tip<00:02:38.840> so<00:02:39.440> it's<00:02:39.680> easier<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.280> draw<00:02:40.549> out<00:02:40.760> what<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.239> um

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
tip so it's easier to draw out what I um

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:49.229 
tip so it's easier to draw out what I um
I<00:02:43.480> think<00:02:44.480> our<00:02:44.810> her<00:02:45.049> like<00:02:45.620> her<00:02:46.069> tentacles<00:02:46.549> and

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.399 

it<00:02:50.239> doesn't<00:02:50.480> have<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.659> be<00:02:50.720> perfect<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.379> mean

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:51.409 
it doesn't have to be perfect I mean

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:53.680 
it doesn't have to be perfect I mean
mine<00:02:52.159> were<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.370> little<00:02:52.579> uneven<00:02:53.000> on<00:02:53.239> both<00:02:53.390> sides

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
mine were a little uneven on both sides

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.979 
mine were a little uneven on both sides
because<00:02:53.959> it's<00:02:54.200> kind<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.379> hard<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.650> make<00:02:55.220> for<00:02:55.430> me

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
because it's kind of hard to make for me

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.800 
because it's kind of hard to make for me
so<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:58.400> looks<00:02:58.430> good<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.910> that's<00:02:59.090> what's<00:02:59.269> that

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
so it looks good and that's what's that

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.509 
so it looks good and that's what's that
that<00:03:00.079> is<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:00.470> matters<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.859> I'm<00:03:01.099> sorry<00:03:01.370> I'm

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
that is what matters and I'm sorry I'm

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.430 
that is what matters and I'm sorry I'm
really<00:03:01.670> stumbling<00:03:02.239> I'm<00:03:02.329> really<00:03:02.569> tired<00:03:03.430> yeah
