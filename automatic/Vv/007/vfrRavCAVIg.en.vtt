same<00:01:50.850> as<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.479> other<00:01:52.170> three

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
same as the other three

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.880 
same as the other three
then<00:01:53.039> you<00:01:53.189> need<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> replace<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> number

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
then you need to replace that number

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.020 
then you need to replace that number
many<00:01:55.890> times<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.310> technician<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.820> use<00:01:57.000> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
many times the technician will use a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.980 
many times the technician will use a
pick<00:01:57.539> 90<00:01:57.990> degree<00:01:58.200> pick<00:01:58.409> between<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.520> knuckles

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
pick 90 degree pick between the knuckles

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.039 
pick 90 degree pick between the knuckles
in<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.140> c-clip<00:02:01.500> through<00:02:02.539> this<00:02:03.539> is<00:02:03.659> okay<00:02:03.929> as

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
in the c-clip through this is okay as

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.559 
in the c-clip through this is okay as
long<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.259> you're<00:02:04.470> pretty<00:02:04.590> careful<00:02:05.360> not<00:02:06.360> to

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
long as you're pretty careful not to

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:12.500 
long as you're pretty careful not to
score<00:02:06.840> up<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.530> bar<00:02:11.180> next<00:02:12.180> we're<00:02:12.269> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.450> be

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
score up the bar next we're going to be

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.330 
score up the bar next we're going to be
installing<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.019> bearing<00:02:13.380> into<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.010> knuckle

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
installing the bearing into the knuckle

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.250 
installing the bearing into the knuckle
but<00:02:14.489> before<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.330> we<00:02:15.810> need<00:02:15.840> to<00:02:15.959> find

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
but before we do that we need to find

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
but before we do that we need to find
out<00:02:16.470> which<00:02:16.709> direction<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.459> bearing<00:02:17.849> goes<00:02:18.030> in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
out which direction this bearing goes in

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.110 
out which direction this bearing goes in
and<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:19.110> lot<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.380> applications<00:02:20.069> these<00:02:20.670> bearings

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and a lot of applications these bearings

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.110 
and a lot of applications these bearings
have<00:02:21.299> integrated<00:02:21.840> tone<00:02:22.470> rings<00:02:22.769> on<00:02:23.120> inside

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
have integrated tone rings on inside

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.420 
have integrated tone rings on inside
these<00:02:24.269> bearings<00:02:24.690> on<00:02:24.810> one<00:02:25.019> side<00:02:25.290> holy<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.250> what

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
these bearings on one side holy so what

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.280 
these bearings on one side holy so what
we<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.910> find<00:02:26.940> out<00:02:27.209> which<00:02:27.510> side<00:02:27.810> has<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
we do is to find out which side has the

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
we do is to find out which side has the
ABS<00:02:28.680> tone<00:02:29.010> ring<00:02:29.250> out<00:02:29.400> here<00:02:29.430> we<00:02:29.790> take<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.209> simple

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
ABS tone ring out here we take a simple

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.599 
ABS tone ring out here we take a simple
paper<00:02:30.840> clip<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:31.709> we<00:02:31.890> take<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.190> up<00:02:32.250> against<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
paper clip and we take it up against the

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.069 
paper clip and we take it up against the
side<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> bearing<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.570> you'll<00:02:33.900> notice

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
side of the bearing and you'll notice

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.199 
side of the bearing and you'll notice
that<00:02:34.200> tolerate<00:02:34.739> is<00:02:34.859> magnetic<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.670> that<00:02:35.910> paper

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that tolerate is magnetic so that paper

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.150 
that tolerate is magnetic so that paper
clip<00:02:36.329> is<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.690> stick<00:02:36.959> now<00:02:37.590> if<00:02:37.739> we<00:02:37.859> spin<00:02:38.070> it

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
clip is going to stick now if we spin it

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.770 
clip is going to stick now if we spin it
around<00:02:38.220> we<00:02:38.489> go<00:02:38.609> on<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> other<00:02:38.910> side<00:02:39.030> you're

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
around we go on the other side you're

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.050 
around we go on the other side you're
going<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.959> notice<00:02:40.250> paper<00:02:41.250> clip<00:02:41.489> doesn't<00:02:41.850> stay

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
going to notice paper clip doesn't stay

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.349 
going to notice paper clip doesn't stay
now<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.859> side<00:02:44.069> with<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.310> tolerant<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.910> always

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
now the side with the tolerant is always

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.750 
now the side with the tolerant is always
going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.540> be<00:02:45.630> facing<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.290> ABS<00:02:46.890> speed<00:02:47.250> sensor

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
going to be facing the ABS speed sensor

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.390 
going to be facing the ABS speed sensor
that<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.569> through<00:02:48.870> that<00:02:49.200> knuckle<00:02:49.739> so

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
that is going through that knuckle so

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.030 

now<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.510> we<00:03:19.600> have<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.810> bearing<00:03:20.110> Preston<00:03:20.620> we

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
now that we have the bearing Preston we

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.699 
now that we have the bearing Preston we
went<00:03:21.250> ahead<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.580> installed<00:03:21.790> the<00:03:22.569> circlip<00:03:23.020> now

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
went ahead and installed the circlip now

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.890 
went ahead and installed the circlip now
always<00:03:24.310> remember<00:03:24.580> on<00:03:25.150> many<00:03:25.630> many

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
always remember on many many

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.420 
always remember on many many
applications<00:03:26.740> out<00:03:26.950> there

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
applications out there

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.090 
applications out there
these<00:03:27.880> circlips<00:03:28.600> are<00:03:28.720> do<00:03:29.500> have<00:03:29.709> a<00:03:29.739> specific

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100 
these circlips are do have a specific

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.270 
these circlips are do have a specific
clock<00:03:31.090> position<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:31.930> them<00:03:32.290> so<00:03:32.890> if<00:03:32.980> you<00:03:33.040> look

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
clock position on them so if you look

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.790 
clock position on them so if you look
you<00:03:33.310> look<00:03:33.700> at<00:03:33.819> our<00:03:34.030> sitar<00:03:34.450> so<00:03:34.660> clip<00:03:34.930> there<00:03:35.140> it

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
you look at our sitar so clip there it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.590 
you look at our sitar so clip there it
is<00:03:35.950> it's<00:03:36.190> at<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.400> 12<00:03:36.670> o'clock<00:03:36.880> position<00:03:37.000> and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
is it's at the 12 o'clock position and

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.880 
is it's at the 12 o'clock position and
the<00:03:37.660> reason<00:03:37.840> why<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:38.350> at<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.560> 12<00:03:38.800> o'clock

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
the reason why it's at the 12 o'clock

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.650 
the reason why it's at the 12 o'clock
position<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:40.200> because<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.500> the<00:03:41.739> ABS<00:03:42.250> sensor

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
position is because of the ABS sensor

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.199 
position is because of the ABS sensor
when<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.720> ABS<00:03:44.020> sensor<00:03:44.170> goes<00:03:44.560> in<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:45.820> needs<00:03:46.060> to

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
when the ABS sensor goes in it needs to

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.750 
when the ABS sensor goes in it needs to
clear<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.540> circlip<00:03:47.019> so<00:03:47.920> I<00:03:47.950> can<00:03:48.160> actually<00:03:48.430> pick

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760
