00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.410
 and greet everyone this is the kind 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.679
 how are you me it's going very very 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 well 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.400
 so today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.730
 fashion presentation so we attack 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.560
 right now with the massey ferguson 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.699
 8140 so version 3 as you can 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.189
 see him so 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 so I started with this picture 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.060
 so by that page because 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 henceforth I will attack first the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.699
 characteristics so I think it's 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.590
 still important 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.950
 then we can see that he has a speed 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.559
 maximum of 40 km hour so book 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.980
 capacity 7800 kg has so I do not know 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.899
 not 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.809
 without it's height so I'm 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.260
 a real quiche in English so have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.340
 so the height of m 91 lows then the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 length so 5 m 47 so that so we have 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.280
 a capacity of 270 liters of gasoline 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:06.770
 power on and 145 hp is 108.1 no on 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.680
 is 145 horses or 120 108 kg 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.280
 machouette model so we do not care 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.939
 so matt of 55 thank you to you for this 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.380
 tractor and that's it now 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 feature done we'll watch it 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.409
 in real life then at first sight like that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 already it's pretty pretty so I do not know 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.770
 what you think of it so we can already 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.040
 see the interior cabin which is very 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.479
 very pretty from the outside in 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 the whole frankly I like it 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.930
 so aesthetic level for me it is 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.820
 rather than joly he is rather nice 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.240
 see me personally I like it 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.860
 so we can see also my 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.790
 growers that I put in the back 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.450
 so it's a 50-meter farmer 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:56.840
 yes yes 50 m 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.119
 so you'll see that in a in 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.579
 another episode I will also have 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.079
 a 50-meter seed drill and you go 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.520
 see that I will even have more 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.219
 that big so you can see that 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.369
 games there is a time here it is a 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.959
 sacred monster 1 that's at the level of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.180
 farmer so I would not have more 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.400
 of things to show you 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.069
 so we go right back into this 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.870
 tractor so here you go see he 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.410
 there are a lot of options go on attack 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 right now 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.160
 hop and the police is that that's me 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.620
 remember the 2011 so you press 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.060
 space you have all the options that 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.660
 so defy then there left up left 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.480
 what we have 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:38.660
 so we have the headlights before the lighthouse 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.500
 back then the road lighthouse as well 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.660
 that the strong downwind again 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.150
 then we open the door 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.140
 right on when opening the door 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.720
 left on the roof opening here we have 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.290
 the window at the back 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.829
 it's not all and pato then we 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:04.940
 attack here so here we lowered the tool 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:07.430
 back see is here we went down 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.660
 the tool before that so I do not know 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.660
 where do you want it works 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:19.770
 apparently for now it does not matter 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:21.300
 nothing if it works so see that 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.240
 works very very well so we are 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.950
 to press the go key besides 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.910
 when you press v it does not matter 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.600
 you have to be careful 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.600
 so when you use this key the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.550
 So that goes up and it goes down 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.780
 see it saves you from using the key 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:44.150
 b it's still a lot more 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:47.070
 real and here we have the tool before 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.430
 So here we have the mirrors 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.610
 to send mirrors so that are 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.880
 functional then at the level of the 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.130
 touch to so you see in them 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.630
 just reset that so we have the 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.410
 thing that gets between the axles so 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.190
 a counterweight then we have the axles 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.480
 just one side here here here and then 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.860
 here so here we can put it in 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.080
 two axle leak 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.670
 so you see this tractor here I 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.320
 really wanted you do not introduce this 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.080
 who has a lot of options 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.270
 this is to make it simple it has enormously 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.320
 options so against I would like 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:25.770
 just immediately tried 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.740
 if it works to grow so that's so 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:33.090
 I go down here and then I go and we go 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.710
 see what it gives will send so 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.910
 it works very well you just have 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.470
 to put you inside 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.930
 so here is a little look 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.470
 with this farmer if we remove so 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.770
 it's quite impressive 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.270
 it's pretty impressive so here I 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.660
 let's shave both fields right away 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.640
 here huh 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.130
 so that's really allowing people 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.310
 who want to go fast ball and a lot 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.129
 much much faster 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.020
 frankly 50 m in engineering 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.619
 we have a seed drill what are we going to say 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.369
 this m a farmer excuse me 

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:10.069
 about 7 meters 

00:05:07.369 --> 00:05:15.339
 so here to tell you do the math 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:21.169
 if it is 50 m 7 14 21 and 35 42 49 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:24.879
 what makes us is this time more 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:27.169
 fast we are seven times faster 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.830
 here I can even go for a walk 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:35.330
 back one is cultivating go so I know 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:38.689
 not if you calculated but the ways 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.019
 it's a round trip and the round is 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.969
 play 

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:45.589
 so it's ultra ultra ultra fast so 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.879
 there of course I dropped off so it was 

00:05:45.589 --> 00:05:48.349
 for fun no I laugh 

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.699
 so I just wanted to see if 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.259
 run in speed 2 but 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:55.279
 apparently no but frankly that's 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:57.169
 really something that I you 

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:58.550
 advise so I think I did a 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.329
 little bit around all I 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.969
 wanted to show you 

00:05:59.329 --> 00:06:05.749
 so this is a farmer of so 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:07.159
 landwirtschaft at slide hennechart is 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.749
 so this tractor me I you the 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.219
 advise what I have what I have you 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.119
 not say again is that look at the 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:15.110
 counter works 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:16.999
 so we have the right speed and 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.889
 left the minute rounds is what we 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:21.319
 can also do is pass the 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:24.709
 tractor in automatic so look in 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:27.769
 bottom right we have the auto function and we 

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:30.019
 disables it on w finally we activate and we 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:31.069
 has assets on w good go friends 

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:33.169
 so I hope this little 

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:35.300
 presentation will have pleased you me I you 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:35.629
 say to the next ciao ciao all the 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.849
 world 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:41.259
 do not forget the little one I love and the 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:41.259
 little comment that makes pleasure
