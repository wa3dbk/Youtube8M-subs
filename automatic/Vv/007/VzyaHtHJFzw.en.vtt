00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
started there really I took like two

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830 
started there really I took like two
lessons<00:00:42.899> when<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.410> was<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.570> primary<00:00:45.570> school

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
lessons when I was in primary school

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.920 
lessons when I was in primary school
when<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.530> was<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.890> 10<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:48.270> hated<00:00:48.629> them<00:00:48.809> I

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
when I was like 10 but hated them I

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020 
when I was like 10 but hated them I
didn't<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> idea<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.680> being<00:00:50.280> sort<00:00:50.910> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
didn't like the idea of being sort of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.229 
didn't like the idea of being sort of
taught<00:00:51.980> it's<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.070> an<00:00:53.160> expression<00:00:53.730> isn't<00:00:54.149> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
taught it's like an expression isn't it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.450 
taught it's like an expression isn't it
rather<00:00:54.390> than<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.100> how<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> should

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
rather than like this is how it should

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.250 
rather than like this is how it should
be<00:00:56.730> done<00:00:56.760> if<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.329> mean<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.840> me<00:00:57.930> anyway

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
be done if you know I mean for me anyway

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.139 
be done if you know I mean for me anyway
not<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.590> everyone<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.100> me<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.879> it's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
not for everyone but for me I think it's

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
not for everyone but for me I think it's
a<00:01:00.210> big<00:01:00.390> thing<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.870> trial<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.289> error<00:01:01.440> just

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
sort of got it I guess my first proper
guitar<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.790> was<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.030> Mexican

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
guitar that I got was a Mexican

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
guitar that I got was a Mexican
Telecaster<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.439> think<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> perfect

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
Telecaster I think it's like the perfect

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.490 
Telecaster I think it's like the perfect
sort<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> start<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.570> instructive<00:01:31.200> obviously

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sort of start and instructive obviously

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
sort of start and instructive obviously
the<00:01:31.650> built<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.100> well<00:01:32.220> reasonable<00:01:33.210> value

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the built really well reasonable value

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:34.789 
the built really well reasonable value
