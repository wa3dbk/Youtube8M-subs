00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
walking Jake part 1 I don't think it's

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
walking Jake part 1 I don't think it's
really<00:01:01.530> necessary<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.100> make<00:01:02.340> two<00:01:02.699> movies<00:01:03.359> out

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
really necessary to make two movies out

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.539 
really necessary to make two movies out
of<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.840> book<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.220> think<00:01:05.430> there's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
of this book now which I think there's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.539 
of this book now which I think there's
enough<00:01:05.790> content<00:01:06.270> in<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.510> probably<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.250> just

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
enough content in it probably but I just

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.789 
enough content in it probably but I just
think<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> know<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.450> doesn't<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.110> want<00:01:10.439> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
think you know it doesn't really want to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.679 
think you know it doesn't really want to
movies<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> thought<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> movie<00:01:12.270> was<00:01:12.420> great

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
I just really feel like it could have

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.850

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
there I honestly thought they were going

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.439 
there I honestly thought they were going
to<00:04:45.099> end<00:04:45.280> it<00:04:45.460> right<00:04:45.490> when<00:04:45.909> Peter<00:04:46.210> started

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
to end it right when Peter started

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.149 
to end it right when Peter started
showing<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:47.020> Katniss<00:04:47.440> because<00:04:47.770> I<00:04:47.919> was<00:04:48.009> like

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
showing like Katniss because I was like

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.640 
showing like Katniss because I was like
if<00:04:48.580> they<00:04:48.789> ended<00:04:49.090> their<00:04:49.330> that<00:04:49.900> would<00:04:50.050> be<00:04:50.229> it

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
if they ended their that would be it

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.260 
if they ended their that would be it
would<00:04:50.710> be<00:04:50.949> like<00:04:51.159> I<00:04:51.400> said<00:04:51.909> it<00:04:52.000> would<00:04:52.090> be<00:04:52.180> the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
would be like I said it would be the

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.700 
would be like I said it would be the
perfect<00:04:52.300> ending<00:04:52.690> because<00:04:52.990> if<00:04:53.229> you<00:04:53.319> ever<00:04:53.470> the

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
perfect ending because if you ever the

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.110 
perfect ending because if you ever the
book<00:04:53.889> they<00:04:54.099> are<00:04:54.129> gonna<00:04:54.340> be<00:04:54.550> really<00:04:54.909> pissed

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
book they are gonna be really pissed

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.999 
book they are gonna be really pissed
because<00:04:55.900> they<00:04:56.229> really<00:04:56.530> think<00:04:56.650> that<00:04:56.830> PETA

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
because they really think that PETA

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.070 
because they really think that PETA
hates<00:04:57.220> Katniss<00:04:57.699> but<00:04:57.940> they<00:04:58.449> let<00:04:58.659> him<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:59.020> know

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
hates Katniss but they let him you know

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800 
hates Katniss but they let him you know
that<00:04:59.380> Peter<00:04:59.759> was<00:05:00.759> brainwashed<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.599> stuff

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
that Peter was brainwashed and stuff

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.360 
that Peter was brainwashed and stuff
like<00:05:01.900> that<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.380> I'm<00:05:02.500> glad<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.919> left<00:05:03.099> in<00:05:03.220> him

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
like that so I'm glad the left in him

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.589 
like that so I'm glad the left in him
because<00:05:03.520> they<00:05:03.610> really<00:05:04.120> would<00:05:04.240> have<00:05:04.300> gotten<00:05:04.509> a

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
because they really would have gotten a

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.839 
because they really would have gotten a
lot<00:05:04.720> of<00:05:04.780> flack<00:05:05.050> for<00:05:05.080> it<00:05:05.409> but<00:05:06.159> I<00:05:06.460> thought<00:05:06.759> it

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
lot of flack for it but I thought it

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:08.370 
lot of flack for it but I thought it
would<00:05:06.970> be<00:05:07.060> cool<00:05:07.300> if<00:05:07.360> they<00:05:07.750> would<00:05:07.900> end<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.199> their

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
would be cool if they would end to their

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.990 
would be cool if they would end to their
because<00:05:08.770> it<00:05:08.979> would<00:05:09.069> just<00:05:09.190> bid<00:05:09.400> elect<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.699> huge

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
because it would just bid elect a huge

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.770 
because it would just bid elect a huge
what<00:05:10.870> like<00:05:11.349> that<00:05:11.889> is<00:05:12.130> insane<00:05:12.610> so<00:05:13.479> that<00:05:13.630> was

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
what like that is insane so that was

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020 
what like that is insane so that was
cool<00:05:13.840> um<00:05:14.349> what<00:05:14.680> else<00:05:14.860> was<00:05:15.009> there<00:05:15.039> on<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.880> whole

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
cool um what else was there on the whole

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.640 
cool um what else was there on the whole
propos<00:05:16.479> that's<00:05:16.900> how<00:05:16.990> you're<00:05:17.110> saying<00:05:17.229> right<00:05:17.469> I

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
propos that's how you're saying right I

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.439 
propos that's how you're saying right I
felt<00:05:18.159> like<00:05:18.280> they<00:05:18.400> kind<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.699> took<00:05:18.880> a<00:05:19.150> lot<00:05:19.419> of

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
felt like they kind of took a lot of

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.480 
felt like they kind of took a lot of
time<00:05:19.569> on<00:05:19.990> them<00:05:20.139> and<00:05:20.319> I<00:05:20.380> do<00:05:20.440> know<00:05:21.009> it<00:05:21.130> was<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.280> lot

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
time on them and I do know it was a lot

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:22.800 
time on them and I do know it was a lot
in<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.610> book<00:05:21.819> but<00:05:22.060> I<00:05:22.120> think<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.539> could<00:05:22.719> have

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
in the book but I think it could have

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.300 
in the book but I think it could have
been<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.020> little<00:05:23.289> bit<00:05:23.500> shorter<00:05:23.740> in<00:05:23.979> the<00:05:24.069> movie

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
been a little bit shorter in the movie

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.850 
been a little bit shorter in the movie
honestly<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:24.909> do<00:05:25.360> think<00:05:25.719> it<00:05:25.840> was<00:05:25.870> important<00:05:26.650> to

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
honestly I do think it was important to

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.620 
honestly I do think it was important to
the<00:05:27.009> story<00:05:27.250> line<00:05:27.520> but<00:05:27.759> like<00:05:27.879> I<00:05:28.030> said<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.300> really

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the story line but like I said I really

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.450 
the story line but like I said I really
think<00:05:28.960> this<00:05:29.139> could<00:05:29.349> have<00:05:29.440> been<00:05:29.469> one<00:05:29.770> movie<00:05:30.219> and

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
think this could have been one movie and

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.159 
think this could have been one movie and
they<00:05:31.090> would<00:05:31.210> have<00:05:31.330> shortened<00:05:31.690> that<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.840> little

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
they would have shortened that a little

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:33.620 
they would have shortened that a little
bit<00:05:32.289> I<00:05:32.349> thought<00:05:32.650> that<00:05:32.830> would<00:05:32.979> have<00:05:33.099> been

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
bit I thought that would have been

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.260 
bit I thought that would have been
though<00:05:34.630> I've<00:05:34.780> been<00:05:34.870> really<00:05:35.110> good<00:05:35.289> um<00:05:36.270> what

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
though I've been really good um what

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.520 
though I've been really good um what
else<00:05:37.419> you're<00:05:37.539> sure<00:05:37.659> I<00:05:37.750> thought<00:05:37.960> Finnick<00:05:38.319> was<00:05:38.500> a

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
else you're sure I thought Finnick was a

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.559 
else you're sure I thought Finnick was a
little<00:05:38.889> bit<00:05:39.069> wasn't<00:05:39.460> involved<00:05:39.729> as<00:05:39.969> much<00:05:40.060> as<00:05:40.389> in

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569 
little bit wasn't involved as much as in

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:42.839 
little bit wasn't involved as much as in
the<00:05:40.719> movie<00:05:41.349> is<00:05:41.560> he<00:05:41.740> her<00:05:42.039> in<00:05:42.279> the<00:05:42.370> book<00:05:42.550> cuz<00:05:42.729> it

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
the movie is he her in the book cuz it

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.430 
the movie is he her in the book cuz it
wasn't<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.120> movie<00:05:43.449> I'm<00:05:43.569> not<00:05:43.719> too<00:05:43.870> sure<00:05:44.169> um

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:44.440 
wasn't the movie I'm not too sure um

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.800 
wasn't the movie I'm not too sure um
there<00:05:45.310> was<00:05:45.460> Effie<00:05:45.849> Trinket<00:05:45.880> was<00:05:46.389> in<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.569> movie

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
there was Effie Trinket was in the movie

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.029 
there was Effie Trinket was in the movie
a<00:05:46.840> lot<00:05:46.990> which<00:05:47.229> I<00:05:47.289> don't<00:05:47.349> think<00:05:47.500> she<00:05:47.740> was<00:05:47.860> in<00:05:47.979> the

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
a lot which I don't think she was in the

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:49.379 
a lot which I don't think she was in the
book<00:05:48.190> barely<00:05:48.550> at<00:05:48.639> all<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.819> don't<00:05:49.000> think<00:05:49.210> she<00:05:49.330> was

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
book barely at all I don't think she was

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.779 
book barely at all I don't think she was
even<00:05:49.630> part<00:05:49.840> of<00:05:49.930> like<00:05:50.139> the<00:05:50.469> revolution<00:05:51.130> or<00:05:51.310> you
