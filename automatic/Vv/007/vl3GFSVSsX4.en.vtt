maintain the paint well to where when

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.340 
maintain the paint well to where when
you<00:01:54.280> use<00:01:54.310> them<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.450> paint<00:01:55.750> will<00:01:55.960> come<00:01:56.170> off

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
you use them the paint will come off

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.840 
you use them the paint will come off
super<00:01:56.710> easily<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.579> keep

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
super easily and you have to keep

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.580 
super easily and you have to keep
dipping<00:01:58.299> it<00:01:58.420> back<00:01:58.600> in<00:01:58.810> just<00:01:59.049> to<00:01:59.170> get<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> fine

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
dipping it back in just to get a fine

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.560 
dipping it back in just to get a fine
line<00:01:59.829> they<00:02:00.399> do<00:02:00.460> work<00:02:00.759> well<00:02:00.969> sometimes<00:02:01.420> though

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
line they do work well sometimes though

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.510 
line they do work well sometimes though
especially<00:02:02.049> when<00:02:02.170> making<00:02:02.320> small<00:02:02.799> dots<00:02:03.070> and

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
especially when making small dots and

especially when making small dots and
finally<00:02:04.329> the<00:02:04.450> last<00:02:04.659> thing<00:02:04.810> that<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.079> use

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
finally the last thing that I use

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.160 
finally the last thing that I use
sometimes<00:02:05.530> is<00:02:05.979> an<00:02:06.280> exacto<00:02:07.090> knife<00:02:07.329> now<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.049> is

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
sometimes is an exacto knife now this is

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.630 
sometimes is an exacto knife now this is
the<00:02:08.320> one<00:02:08.470> thing<00:02:08.679> that<00:02:08.739> even<00:02:09.130> more<00:02:09.429> than

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
the one thing that even more than

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.420 
the one thing that even more than
toothpicks<00:02:10.299> can<00:02:10.720> harm<00:02:11.079> your<00:02:11.260> leg<00:02:11.500> oh<00:02:11.530> but<00:02:12.220> if

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
toothpicks can harm your leg oh but if

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.130 
toothpicks can harm your leg oh but if
you<00:02:12.549> use<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.030> right<00:02:13.209> way<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.630> can<00:02:13.900> totally

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
you use it the right way it can totally

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.009 
you use it the right way it can totally
work<00:02:14.530> well<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.190> does<00:02:15.489> have<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.940> same

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
work well it does have the same

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.120 
work well it does have the same
disadvantages<00:02:17.019> as<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.440> toothpicks<00:02:17.920> though

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
disadvantages as the toothpicks though

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.520 
disadvantages as the toothpicks though
in<00:02:18.370> that<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.880> can't<00:02:19.120> hold<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.510> paint<00:02:19.750> in<00:02:20.019> like

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
in that it can't hold the paint in like

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.340 
in that it can't hold the paint in like
a<00:02:20.560> toothbrush<00:02:21.340> or<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:22.450> know<00:02:22.600> a<00:02:22.840> paintbrush

could and one thing about the paints

could and one thing about the paints
though<00:02:25.419> I<00:02:25.449> often<00:02:25.989> use<00:02:26.139> Apple<00:02:26.560> vert<00:02:26.709> or<00:02:26.829> glossy

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
good it's hard to mold I will say and

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.800 
good it's hard to mold I will say and
you<00:03:37.580> just<00:03:37.820> kind<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.030> have<00:03:38.150> to<00:03:38.270> work<00:03:38.390> with<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.720> a

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
you just kind of have to work with it a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.690 
you just kind of have to work with it a
lot<00:03:38.960> now<00:03:39.170> what<00:03:39.500> I'm<00:03:39.620> planning<00:03:39.860> on<00:03:40.130> using<00:03:40.340> from

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
lot now what I'm planning on using from

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.190 
lot now what I'm planning on using from
this<00:03:40.850> point<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.240> is<00:03:41.450> something<00:03:41.810> I've<00:03:41.900> heard

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
this point on is something I've heard

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.560 
this point on is something I've heard
many<00:03:42.410> people<00:03:42.530> use<00:03:43.100> called<00:03:43.520> green<00:03:43.970> stuff<00:03:44.360> and

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
many people use called green stuff and

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.850 
many people use called green stuff and
apparently<00:03:44.750> you<00:03:45.170> can<00:03:45.290> buy<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.500> in<00:03:45.590> a<00:03:45.650> Walmart

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
apparently you can buy it in a Walmart

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.860 
apparently you can buy it in a Walmart
or<00:03:46.190> something<00:03:46.520> but<00:03:47.030> instead<00:03:47.270> of<00:03:47.360> having<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.780> be

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
or something but instead of having to be

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.200 
or something but instead of having to be
oven-baked<00:03:48.560> like<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.400> hardens<00:03:49.880> on<00:03:50.030> its

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
oven-baked like this it hardens on its

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.480 
oven-baked like this it hardens on its
own<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.690> apparently<00:03:51.200> it<00:03:51.290> hardens<00:03:51.620> very<00:03:52.070> very

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
own and apparently it hardens very very

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.790 
own and apparently it hardens very very
well<00:03:53.120> so<00:03:53.540> you<00:03:53.900> know<00:03:54.020> I'm<00:03:54.230> probably<00:03:54.440> going<00:03:54.740> to

well so you know I'm probably going to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.740 
well so you know I'm probably going to
be<00:03:54.890> using<00:03:55.040> that<00:03:55.250> after<00:03:55.640> this<00:03:55.850> another<00:03:56.510> thing

involves<00:05:49.370> sculpting<00:05:49.790> as<00:05:49.910> I<00:05:50.030> said<00:05:50.240> Rockets

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
involves sculpting as I said Rockets

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.410 
involves sculpting as I said Rockets
face<00:05:51.260> was<00:05:51.470> used<00:05:51.830> using<00:05:52.520> the<00:05:52.730> skull<00:05:53.030> pea<00:05:53.210> and

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
face was used using the skull pea and

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.420 
face was used using the skull pea and
that<00:05:53.660> took<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.080> long<00:05:54.290> time<00:05:54.320> to<00:05:54.620> do<00:05:54.860> but<00:05:55.220> I<00:05:55.280> would

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
that took a long time to do but I would

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.310 
that took a long time to do but I would
still<00:05:55.640> recommend<00:05:55.850> sculpting<00:05:56.540> if<00:05:56.690> you<00:05:56.900> cannot

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320
