00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
patting a feeling that's not good so he

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.460 
patting a feeling that's not good so he
doesn't<00:01:43.520> be<00:01:43.729> shown<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.090> on<00:01:44.210> tape<00:01:44.390> too<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:45.020> he

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
doesn't be shown that on tape too and he

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.779 
doesn't be shown that on tape too and he
will<00:01:45.619> bid<00:01:45.770> it<00:01:45.799> and<00:01:46.039> that's<00:01:46.189> that's<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.640> key

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
every year I think there's always things

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.380 
every year I think there's always things
that<00:01:57.950> we<00:01:58.310> look<00:01:58.429> at<00:01:58.549> his<00:01:58.700> coaching<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.119> we<00:01:59.240> can

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
that we look at his coaching that we can

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.240

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
coach better transfer our players and

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.910 
coach better transfer our players and
