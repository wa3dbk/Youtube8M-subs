removable<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.490> actually<00:01:47.880> remove<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
removable so you can actually remove the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.539 
removable so you can actually remove the
battery<00:01:49.020> if<00:01:49.140> you'd<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> use<00:01:49.770> your<00:01:50.040> camera

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
battery if you'd like to use your camera

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.219 
battery if you'd like to use your camera
just<00:01:50.939> snaps<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.420> with<00:01:51.659> those<00:01:51.780> little<00:01:51.930> holes

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
just snaps on with those little holes

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.530 
just snaps on with those little holes
right<00:01:52.470> there<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> case<00:01:53.549> itself<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
right there but the case itself is you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.910 
right there but the case itself is you
know<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> pretty<00:01:55.049> functional<00:01:55.350> case<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
know it's a pretty functional case it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.950 
know it's a pretty functional case it
just<00:01:56.040> works<00:01:56.310> great<00:01:56.490> by<00:01:56.969> itself<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.780> we're<00:01:57.930> just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
just works great by itself so we're just

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.679 
just works great by itself so we're just
gonna<00:01:58.110> go<00:01:58.320> ahead<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.560> snap<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.729> case<00:02:00.149> on<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
gonna go ahead and snap the case on the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.740 
gonna go ahead and snap the case on the
iPhone<00:02:00.719> here<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> it's<00:02:02.579> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.969> snug<00:02:03.210> fit

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
definitely a snug fit but you don't want

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.270 
definitely a snug fit but you don't want
the<00:02:06.240> battery<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.229> come<00:02:07.409> loose<00:02:07.649> on<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.160> as

any protection on the top here but

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.949 
any protection on the top here but
overall<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.580> does<00:02:26.730> cover<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.299> iPhone<00:02:27.750> 5

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
pretty well so let's go ahead and put on

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.720 
pretty well so let's go ahead and put on
the<00:02:30.780> battery<00:02:31.260> pack<00:02:31.349> here<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.099> this<00:02:32.220> just<00:02:32.549> kind

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
the battery pack here and this just kind

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.479 
the battery pack here and this just kind
of<00:02:32.849> snaps<00:02:33.150> on<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.959> this<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.470> pops<00:02:35.040> up<00:02:35.280> like

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
of snaps on like this and pops up like

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.400 
of snaps on like this and pops up like
that<00:02:35.700> so<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.239> does<00:02:36.420> leave<00:02:36.629> a<00:02:36.810> little<00:02:36.989> bit<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
that so it does leave a little bit of a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.800 
that so it does leave a little bit of a
gap<00:02:37.650> there<00:02:37.680> as<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.400> can<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.580> not<00:02:39.299> that<00:02:39.540> big<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
gap there as you can see not that big of

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.020 
gap there as you can see not that big of
a<00:02:39.989> deal<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.980> may<00:02:41.099> be<00:02:41.129> wondering<00:02:41.280> well<00:02:41.790> how

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
a deal but you may be wondering well how

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.410 
a deal but you may be wondering well how
does<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.750> charge<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.370> iPhone<00:02:44.519> well<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.239> do

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
does this charge the iPhone well you do

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.630 
does this charge the iPhone well you do
have<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.900> use<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.470> lightning<00:02:46.950> cable<00:02:47.129> it's<00:02:47.430> kind

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
have to use a lightning cable it's kind

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.699 
have to use a lightning cable it's kind
of<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.819> bring<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.120> own<00:02:48.360> cable<00:02:48.660> solution<00:02:49.200> and

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
of a bring your own cable solution and

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.770 
of a bring your own cable solution and
that<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:50.010> only<00:02:50.250> because<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:51.209> knew<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.450> waiting

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
that is only because you knew is waiting

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.410 
that is only because you knew is waiting
for<00:02:52.019> official<00:02:52.109> certification<00:02:53.010> from<00:02:53.730> Apple<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
for official certification from Apple to

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.940 
for official certification from Apple to
be<00:02:54.540> able<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> use<00:02:54.930> a<00:02:54.959> lightning<00:02:55.349> connector<00:02:55.440> for

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
be able to use a lightning connector for

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.710 
be able to use a lightning connector for
other<00:02:56.250> battery<00:02:56.700> packs<00:02:56.940> in<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> future<00:02:57.480> but

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
other battery packs in the future but

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.809 
other battery packs in the future but
this<00:02:57.930> is<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.200> pretty<00:02:58.890> good<00:02:59.160> solution<00:02:59.340> though

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
this is a pretty good solution though

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.420 
this is a pretty good solution though
especially<00:03:00.349> because<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.470> does<00:03:01.709> charge<00:03:02.129> other

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
especially because it does charge other

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.170 
especially because it does charge other
USB<00:03:02.940> devices<00:03:03.200> not<00:03:04.200> only<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.799> iPhone<00:03:05.160> 5<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.730> if

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
USB devices not only the iPhone 5 and if

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.119 
USB devices not only the iPhone 5 and if
you'd<00:03:06.329> like<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.780> charge<00:03:07.049> up<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.349> iPhone<00:03:07.620> 5<00:03:07.859> all

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 
you'd like to charge up the iPhone 5 all

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.789 
you'd like to charge up the iPhone 5 all
you<00:03:08.280> do<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.640> plug<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.480> USB<00:03:09.540> cable<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.470> here

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
you do is plug your USB cable in here

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.009 
you do is plug your USB cable in here
and<00:03:11.010> your<00:03:11.489> lightning<00:03:11.730> cable<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.450> right<00:03:12.720> there

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
and your lightning cable in right there

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.500 
and your lightning cable in right there
and<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.859> got<00:03:14.010> charged<00:03:14.340> going<00:03:14.730> on<00:03:14.849> so<00:03:15.180> that's

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
and you got charged going on so that's

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.420 
and you got charged going on so that's
kind<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:15.989> how<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.170> works<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.859> it<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.069> kind<00:03:17.370> of

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
kind of how that works and it is kind of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.220 
kind of how that works and it is kind of
a<00:03:17.519> bring<00:03:17.730> your<00:03:17.760> own<00:03:17.970> cable<00:03:18.389> solution<00:03:18.690> but

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
a bring your own cable solution but

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.860 
a bring your own cable solution but
that's<00:03:19.560> not<00:03:19.739> a<00:03:19.769> huge<00:03:19.950> downfall<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.630> case

but<00:05:18.180> overall<00:05:18.419> I<00:05:18.750> think<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.290> is<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.470> cool<00:05:19.680> case

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
but overall I think this is a cool case

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:21.710 
but overall I think this is a cool case
it<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.310> kind<00:05:20.730> of<00:05:20.790> an<00:05:20.910> inconvenience<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.600> the

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
it is kind of an inconvenience that the

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.659 
it is kind of an inconvenience that the
camera<00:05:22.140> does<00:05:22.169> not<00:05:22.470> show<00:05:22.710> through<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:23.040> you<00:05:23.550> can

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
camera does not show through but you can

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.610 
camera does not show through but you can
always<00:05:23.790> just<00:05:23.970> pop<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.510> off<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.140> be<00:05:25.530> able

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
always just pop that off and and be able

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.409 
always just pop that off and and be able
to<00:05:25.830> use<00:05:25.980> your<00:05:26.070> camera<00:05:26.430> just<00:05:26.610> like<00:05:26.790> that<00:05:27.060> other

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190
