00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 
difference what I did I tried to see the

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:43.839 
difference what I did I tried to see the
gap<00:06:41.179> in<00:06:41.569> between<00:06:41.809> the<00:06:42.259> pattern<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.949> tried<00:06:43.699> to

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
gap in between the pattern I tried to

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:46.540 
gap in between the pattern I tried to
keep<00:06:44.059> those<00:06:44.330> roughly<00:06:44.990> the<00:06:45.199> same<00:06:45.469> so<00:06:46.099> this<00:06:46.339> is

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 
keep those roughly the same so this is

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.129 
keep those roughly the same so this is
you<00:06:46.669> could<00:06:46.879> have<00:06:46.969> drawn<00:06:47.209> up<00:06:47.509> here<00:06:47.809> but<00:06:47.990> will
