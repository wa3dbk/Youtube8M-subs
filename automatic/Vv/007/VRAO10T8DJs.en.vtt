00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
showing you how to have curved ramps and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.760 
showing you how to have curved ramps and
loops<00:00:14.610> in<00:00:14.969> your<00:00:15.150> created<00:00:15.660> jobs<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
loops in your created jobs but it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.310 
loops in your created jobs but it
created<00:00:17.250> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.609> creative<00:00:18.060> beta<00:00:18.420> so<00:00:19.020> yes<00:00:19.170> this

is a super awesome glitch super easy and
guys<00:00:22.529> let's<00:00:22.830> get<00:00:23.039> started<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.820> you'll<00:00:24.029> need

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
guys let's get started so you'll need

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.599 
guys let's get started so you'll need
the<00:00:24.390> Creator<00:00:24.779> once<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.740> enter<00:00:26.460> it

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the Creator once you have that enter it

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.390 
the Creator once you have that enter it
put<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.119> large<00:00:27.630> ramp<00:00:28.080> down<00:00:28.289> as<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.890> see<00:00:29.070> i<00:00:29.099> will

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
put a large ramp down as you see i will

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.460 
put a large ramp down as you see i will
be<00:00:29.490> doing<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.849> same<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.390> put<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.230> large

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
be doing the same just put the large

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.799 
be doing the same just put the large
ramp<00:00:31.859> down<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.399> then<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.270> want<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.660> do

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
ramp down and then what you want to do

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.290 
ramp down and then what you want to do
is<00:00:34.020> navigate<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.770> small<00:00:35.160> rim<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.880> want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.149> put

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is navigate to small rim you want to put

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.420 
is navigate to small rim you want to put
the<00:00:36.420> small<00:00:36.809> rim<00:00:37.140> at<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.590> end<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.190> large

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
the small rim at the end of the large

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.760 
the small rim at the end of the large
ramp<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.690> see<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.050> won't<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.469> able<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
ramp so as you see you won't be able to

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.130 
ramp so as you see you won't be able to
place<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.790> then<00:00:42.030> what<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.930> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
place it but then what you have to do is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.889 
place it but then what you have to do is
scroll<00:00:43.890> over<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.430> signs<00:00:44.940> once<00:00:45.600> you're<00:00:45.780> at

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
scroll over to signs once you're at

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350 
scroll over to signs once you're at
signed<00:00:46.260> press<00:00:46.950> down<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.579> d-pad<00:00:47.760> where<00:00:48.270> you

could change the different types of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.119 
could change the different types of
signs<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> press<00:00:50.910> left<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> d-pad<00:00:52.260> once

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
heading is where you could change it to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
heading is where you could change it to
ramp<00:01:01.230> signs<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:02.010> everything<00:01:02.309> once<00:01:03.210> you're

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
ramp signs and everything once you're

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.429 
ramp signs and everything once you're
there<00:01:03.660> just<00:01:03.899> go<00:01:04.439> up<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.920> press<00:01:05.610> left<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.990> or

X at the same time at the exact same
time<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.220> you'll<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.330> places<00:01:12.890> but

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
time and you'll see that it places but

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.640 
time and you'll see that it places but
guys<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.820> all<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.080> see<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.500> do

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
guys that is all and as you see to do

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.740 
guys that is all and as you see to do
loops<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.729> just<00:01:17.759> follow<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.450> same

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
loops you have to just follow the same

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.230 
loops you have to just follow the same
criteria<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> do<00:01:20.670> instead<00:01:21.030> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
criteria all you have to do instead of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.749 
criteria all you have to do instead of
placing<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:22.110> maximum<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.830> six<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.490> see

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
placing the maximum of six as you see

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.749 
placing the maximum of six as you see
you<00:01:23.880> can<00:01:24.030> only<00:01:24.210> play<00:01:24.450> six<00:01:24.930> curves<00:01:25.400> place<00:01:26.400> five

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
you can only play six curves place five

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.080 
you can only play six curves place five
and<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.439> place<00:01:28.799> another<00:01:29.090> small

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
and you will want to place another small

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.080 
and you will want to place another small
ramp<00:01:30.420> vertically<00:01:31.350> directly<00:01:32.220> vertically<00:01:32.850> up

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
ramp vertically directly vertically up

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.230 
ramp vertically directly vertically up
and<00:01:33.360> down<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.900> instead<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.040> putting<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> curve

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
and down on instead of putting it curve

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.359 
and down on instead of putting it curve
once<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.560> keep<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> building

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
once you do that just keep on building

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.520 
once you do that just keep on building
off<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.700> their<00:01:39.030> curve<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.320> get<00:01:40.470> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
off of their curve and you will get a

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
off of their curve and you will get a
loop<00:01:40.860> so<00:01:41.400> guys<00:01:41.549> that's<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.090> thank<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.450> for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
loop so guys that's it thank you for

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.060 
loop so guys that's it thank you for
