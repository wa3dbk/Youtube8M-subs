captured

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.780 
captured
so<00:04:13.640> minifig<00:04:14.269> just<00:04:14.540> fits<00:04:14.810> right<00:04:14.930> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.350> inside

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.130 

we'll<00:04:19.790> take<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:19.970> look<00:04:20.209> at<00:04:20.269> the<00:04:20.359> vehicle<00:04:20.570> which

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
we'll take a look at the vehicle which

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.830 
we'll take a look at the vehicle which
if<00:04:22.100> this<00:04:22.370> just<00:04:22.610> came<00:04:22.790> all<00:04:23.030> by<00:04:23.210> itself<00:04:23.570> even

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
if this just came all by itself even

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.390 
if this just came all by itself even
with<00:04:24.080> these<00:04:24.200> two<00:04:24.410> figs<00:04:24.740> I<00:04:24.919> think<00:04:25.160> would<00:04:25.250> be<00:04:25.280> a

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
with these two figs I think would be a

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.969 
with these two figs I think would be a
cool<00:04:25.669> set<00:04:25.970> so<00:04:26.240> I<00:04:26.270> really<00:04:26.750> think<00:04:27.020> it<00:04:27.229> adds<00:04:27.560> even

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
cool set so I really think it adds even

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.200 
cool set so I really think it adds even
though<00:04:28.669> in<00:04:29.360> my<00:04:29.570> opinion<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.110> dragon<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.890> uh

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
though in my opinion the dragon is uh

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.520 
though in my opinion the dragon is uh
well<00:04:32.210> you<00:04:32.720> really<00:04:32.870> wouldn't<00:04:33.169> have<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.290> fair

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
well you really wouldn't have a fair

well you really wouldn't have a fair
shot<00:04:33.560> this<00:04:34.160> is<00:04:34.310> what<00:04:34.460> you<00:04:34.580> had<00:04:34.729> me<00:04:34.880> were

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.640 
of show you how they move let's see
that<00:05:00.449> flail<00:05:00.780> that<00:05:01.020> actually<00:05:01.289> just<00:05:01.439> flew

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
that flail that actually just flew

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.469 
that flail that actually just flew
backwards<00:05:01.979> so<00:05:02.550> that<00:05:02.789> is<00:05:03.000> not<00:05:03.150> gonna<00:05:03.360> be

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
backwards so that is not gonna be

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.249 
backwards so that is not gonna be
effective<00:05:04.909> so<00:05:05.909> the<00:05:06.120> quicker<00:05:06.509> you<00:05:06.870> shoot<00:05:07.139> it

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:07.259 
effective so the quicker you shoot it

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.629 
effective so the quicker you shoot it
