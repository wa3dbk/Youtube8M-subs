 Moscow region have been tested new 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.529
 airborne combat vehicle abbreviated bmd-4 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.990
 able to reach speeds of up to 70 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.420
 kilometers per hour and hit all kinds 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.219
 modern tanks but the troops will begin 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.850
 come next year 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.660
 reporting to the patina victims on the motto of the new 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.340
 airborne combat vehicle 1 field is also a warrior 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.680
 shoot bmd-4 can practically with 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.560
 any position in motion being behind 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.750
 shelter and even forcing the built in ford 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.790
 gun stabilization system will not allow 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.950
 sight to stray a wind force sensor 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.960
 help build a flight path 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.430
 projectile using 100 meters 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.640
 high-explosive fragmentation projectiles 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.789
 cherry she can work at a distance to 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 seven kilometers to hit fire targets and 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.469
 enemy manpower 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 she has 34 of such powerful 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.260
 projectile besides her bundled 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.449
 inside was placed arranged four 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.149
 driven shot lasso which 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.489
 affects all modern tanks on the base 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.339
 BMD-4 specifically for paratroopers created 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.830
 new armored personnel carrier shell expected 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.189
 that will release it in 4 versions 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.070
 depending on the intended tasks 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:16.530
 currently 5 armored personnel carriers 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 shell arrived in 51 floor city Tula 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 for conducting troop testing three 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.850
 armored vehicle left at the factory 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.400
 my decision they will be narrow 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.970
 specialization plus Air Force plans 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.869
 equip your btr-82a connections 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 armament complex on these 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.400
 armored personnel carriers is similar to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.320
 standing on assault vehicles, which means 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.310
 and relearn new soldiers 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.259
 for them the technique 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.649
 besides developers 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 presented and upgraded version 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.210
 bmd-2 main machine air traffic today 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.680
 day chassis and body she has 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.500
 remained the same however the system 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.060
 fire control almost completely 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.159
 changed now she is capable 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.049
 independently in automatic mode 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.299
 accompany targets and fire 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.119
 in almost any weather conditions 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.950
 appeared in bmd-2 m and additional 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.259
 armament using twin installations 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.150
 ptur korn 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.400
 she can even hit helicopters 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:20.420
 enemy guided missiles on 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:22.220
 distance up to six kilometers test 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.470
 upgraded cars will pass 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.959
 in the Tula division airborne to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.629
 get acquainted with bmd 2 m from the first crew 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.970
 it was only a couple of hours after which they were already 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.019
 easily drove around the landfill immediately 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:38.000
 hitting targets 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:41.239
 Makhina also think better than the previous one 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.319
 bmd-2 modernized control system 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.120
 count fire for 2 hours you can train 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.250
 any and in case of serial deliveries 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.900
 these machines the troops should begin as early as 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.000
 the sixteenth year when completed 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.010
 state tests in the first 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.970
 turn new technique get parts 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.139
 included in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.709
 collective operational forces 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:02.989
 Response of dkb Artem topic denis 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.040
 Kartsev and Alexander Lobachev to lead
