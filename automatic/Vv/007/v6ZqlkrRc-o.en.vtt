00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.270
 our cells of our organism as 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.409
 whole has to be taken seriously 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 The second day is not so

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:00.149

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.820
 what is most logical in your head 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.120
 the most logical thing in our heads is the 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.310
 most normal power supply possible 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.250
 that in our food routine 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.930
 the normality of our house as the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.940
 with me in argentina the causes of 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.130
 Our grandmother from our aunt was the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.090
 beans the chicken with which the small mouth 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.680
 with potatoes only that within this 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.390
 normality 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.120
 we develop the quantity and the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.450
 ideal for people within our proposal 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.800
 of our possibility was 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.340
 talking weekend with a 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 friend and she arrived spoke english 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:49.110
 I gained about twenty kilos 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.980
 I was eliminated and I did start is 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.440
 I need to start over and totally lost 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.270
 So what I told her that I 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.060
 I talked to her and I'll go over to 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.110
 I told you the following, I said look. 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.320
 I think when we get into this 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.050
 lost moment and shoot the first 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:13.850
 who did not enter because we are 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:16.850
 vulnerable and liable to err 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:21.660
 So when are we in that moment? 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.630
 We have to stop everything and lose. 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.120
 to put together a program of ours I said 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.800
 about death a program for you that 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.070
 you make it visible in your 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.650
 with your new proposal with the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.250
 things you want to do with things 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:41.040
 do you think it is appropriate to eat in your case? 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.220

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.220
 eat an orange 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:50.730
 I'm going to eat oatmeal and I'm going out. 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.550

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.800
 olive tree a pity I'll take an apple 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.650
 I'm going to take a bar of cereal to sugar 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.590
 or take a little bit of oilseed 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.069
 then you decide according to your 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.879
 possibility 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.709
 What's best for you is what's best for you. 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.139
 It's cool to have a 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.370
 doctor of a nutrÃ³logo of someone who 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:18.039
 can lift that light for us and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.820
 suddenly this worksheet is not so that the 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:25.210
 people can follow directions to let's know 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.490
 hard at ease a little disappear a 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.250

 my associated brain can taste 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.620
 this food 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.990
 I mean all this I told her 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:50.440

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.380
 make it visible to you and palpable 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.780
 for you so that you can identify 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.910
 Why can you have a north 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.910
 When you lose you fatten everything 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.930
 New, we have to start over, we have to 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:08.409
 have a trail follow a path to 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:10.150
 follow to not get lost if 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:12.130

 changing and regaining the habits that 

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:07.599
 you for a moment of anxiety over a 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.229
 moment of stress for a moment of 

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:13.070
 weakness succumbed 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:18.570
 is perfectly 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:21.410

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:25.139
 we can resume fixing the mistakes 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:31.080
 as many times as necessary 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:34.290
