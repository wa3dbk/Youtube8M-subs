00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
this one-handed so I'm going to put my

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.040 
this one-handed so I'm going to put my
cloth<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:41.260> is<00:01:41.440> the<00:01:41.650> juice<00:01:41.920> wrapped<00:01:42.160> up<00:01:42.310> in<00:01:42.460> it

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
I'm gonna put it in here and then put a

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.960 
I'm gonna put it in here and then put a
jar<00:01:49.900> here<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.680> catch<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.100> but<00:01:51.400> when<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.700> lifts

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
jar here to catch it but when it lifts

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.250 
jar here to catch it but when it lifts
up<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:52.330> jar<00:01:52.630> is<00:01:52.660> not<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.600> tubing<00:01:56.020> is<00:01:56.110> not

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
up this jar is not the the tubing is not

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.510 
up this jar is not the the tubing is not
long<00:01:56.470> enough<00:01:56.680> that's<00:01:56.920> really<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.340> problem

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
long enough that's really the problem

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.610 
long enough that's really the problem
this<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.000> tubing<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.510> came<00:01:58.690> with<00:01:58.900> and<00:01:59.350> I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
this is the tubing it came with and I

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.440 
this is the tubing it came with and I
don't<00:01:59.800> like<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.160> because<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.520> jar<00:02:00.760> this<00:02:01.150> leg

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
don't like it because the jar this leg

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.630 
don't like it because the jar this leg
is<00:02:01.600> in<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.750> way<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.110> jar<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.370> can't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
is in the way of the jar and I can't

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.200 
is in the way of the jar and I can't
really<00:02:03.940> I<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.860> hold<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.850> need<00:02:07.030> I

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
really I have to hold it so I need I

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.840
