technical things that we need on the
race<00:00:11.130> weekend<00:00:12.860> this<00:00:13.860> is<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> night<00:00:14.309> lap<00:00:14.519> in

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
race weekend this is a night lap in

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.140 
race weekend this is a night lap in
sample<00:00:18.170> in<00:00:19.170> across<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.439> line<00:00:19.939> standing<00:00:20.939> on

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
sample in across the line standing on

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.330 
sample in across the line standing on
the<00:00:21.210> lap<00:00:21.529> and<00:00:22.529> then<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.710> breaking<00:00:23.010> point<00:00:23.160> it's

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the lap and then the breaking point it's

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.500 
the lap and then the breaking point it's
very<00:00:23.490> bumpy<00:00:23.730> into<00:00:24.000> turn<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:25.039> psycho<00:00:26.039> bandit

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510

break<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.689> straight<00:00:27.900> line<00:00:28.080> for<00:00:28.349> turn<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.949> 23

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
break your straight line for turn to 23

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.939 
break your straight line for turn to 23
want<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.380> good<00:00:31.410> actor<00:00:31.590> here

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
want to get a really good actor here

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.799 
want to get a really good actor here
it's<00:00:32.250> very<00:00:32.399> bumpy<00:00:32.730> again<00:00:33.710> in<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> three<00:00:35.040> circuit

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
it's very bumpy again in a three circuit

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's very bumpy again in a three circuit
2009<00:00:36.809> one<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> Singapore<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> pretty

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
2009 one in Singapore so was a pretty

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.700 
2009 one in Singapore so was a pretty
special<00:00:39.390> weekend<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.079> trackers<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.590> there

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
special weekend the trackers in there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.110 
special weekend the trackers in there
goes<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> street<00:00:41.280> circuit<00:00:41.610> across<00:00:41.790> street

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
goes the street circuit across street

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600 
goes the street circuit across street
circuits<00:00:42.620> it's<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.680> race<00:00:43.860> also<00:00:44.100> there's<00:00:44.399> quite

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
circuits it's a race also there's quite

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.619 
circuits it's a race also there's quite
difficult<00:00:44.820> because<00:00:45.000> you<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.420> stay<00:00:45.600> on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
difficult because you have to stay on

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
difficult because you have to stay on
european<00:00:46.110> time<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> means<00:00:46.770> you're<00:00:46.920> going

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
european time so it means you're going

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.330 
european time so it means you're going
to<00:00:47.190> bed<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.520> like<00:00:47.730> 6am<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.170> waking<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> 2<00:00:49.980> p.m.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
to bed at like 6am and waking up 2 p.m.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.920 
to bed at like 6am and waking up 2 p.m.
in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.640> daytime<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.390> race<00:00:51.539> starts<00:00:51.870> at

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
in the daytime but the race starts at

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.030 
in the daytime but the race starts at
kind<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.230> 10pm<00:00:52.890> enough<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.460> stream

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
kind of 10pm enough so stream

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.770 
kind of 10pm enough so stream
turn<00:00:56.040> 5<00:00:56.280> really<00:00:57.030> important<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> keep<00:00:57.690> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
turn 5 really important to keep the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
turn 5 really important to keep the
minimum<00:00:58.050> speed<00:00:58.200> up<00:00:58.380> and<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.650> a<00:00:58.680> good<00:00:58.860> exit<00:00:59.750> the

here's<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.820> corner<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.360> being<00:01:21.570> patient

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
here's the corner about being patient

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.890 
here's the corner about being patient
being<00:01:22.890> careful<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:23.940> easy<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.270> have<00:01:24.810> an

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
being careful it's so easy to have an

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
being careful it's so easy to have an
oversteer<00:01:25.260> moment<00:01:25.880> we've<00:01:26.880> come<00:01:27.060> down<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.390> a

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
oversteer moment we've come down to a

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.820 
oversteer moment we've come down to a
really<00:01:27.630> tricky<00:01:27.869> part<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> circuit<00:01:28.619> where<00:01:28.770> he

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
really tricky part the circuit where he

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.499 
really tricky part the circuit where he
used<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.040> be<00:01:29.130> Shekinah<00:01:29.490> they've<00:01:29.759> got<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:29.970> quite

 chicane<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.470> try<00:02:19.709> and<00:02:19.830> use<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> little

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
 chicane you try and use a little

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
bit of the curbs at any moment you have

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
bit of the curbs at any moment you have
an<00:02:23.430> oversteer<00:02:23.790> moment<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.269> hit<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.780> back<00:02:24.930> end

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140

in<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.379> pencil<00:02:26.069> also<00:02:26.489> last<00:02:27.030> fall<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.480> very

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
in the pencil also last fall it is very

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.690 
in the pencil also last fall it is very
very<00:02:27.900> quick<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.180> that's<00:02:30.360> all<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:32.549> our

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
very quick and that's all that so our

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.309 
very quick and that's all that so our
work<00:02:32.819> is<00:02:32.970> done<00:02:33.090> here<00:02:33.150> at<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.480> factory<00:02:33.780> now

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
work is done here at the factory now

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.040 
work is done here at the factory now
let's<00:02:34.470> take<00:02:34.560> is<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.829> trap
