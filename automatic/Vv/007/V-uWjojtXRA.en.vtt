00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.620
 but 

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:09.820
 i am davis and I am cheerleader and 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.769
 I am Chinese but more encouraging and good to me 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.769
 I had to mainly encourage God 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.039
 full of this now vicenta of the 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.770
 very pure conception of the immaculate 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:23.710
 trinidad villavicencio and of my 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.100
 personality alce character so much there 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.100
 straps 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.470
 and then I had to have many references 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.190
 I had to act like she felt the 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 character 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.530
 my part was to make the drawings 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.570
 of going out to nice the movement and now 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.730
 then clean it up a bit and pass it 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.710
 another partner in other processes for 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.200
 to clean it up if I put details and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.380
 maybe but the main part that I 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.480
 touched me was the animation the animation 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.880
 of the character's 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 one of the anecdotes the most complicated 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.830
 that touched me I think that when the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.780
 window and they take many turns they throw the 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.370
 camera was the most 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.490
 complicated because you're there breaking up 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.890
 I did not head until as they are very 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.050
 you all have to go back to the basics and what 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.420
 basic , the complex is already 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.420
 it was like how those scenes 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.250
 well my name is you alexandro 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:37.710
 I'm in charge of the area of ​​what is the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.320
 tino basically what I have to do is 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.840
 receive what are the drawings in rock 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 give it the final finish that would be everything 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 So beautiful as we see it on the screen 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.600
 checking all the details taking care of what 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.850
 what are the proportions 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.909
 especially that we are not going to escape 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.530
 out there some lost line so the 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:02.150
 drawing either the best possible and from here 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.920
 good is going to happen to other hands the 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:08.509
 people that are going to be the interleaved 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.450
 but by this point we have what 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.630
 is the animation almost as it is going to be 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.630
 final 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.890
 Now I'm going to talk to you, I 'm just 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.720
 that did not want to be interspersed in the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.280
 interspersed what we have to from 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.470
 here's an example of the scene like 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.660
 like that is practically already like 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.310
 it stays before it gets color and 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.260
 the interspersed what you have to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.420
 to do is finish the whole movement 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.630
 perfect the movement improve the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.790
 quality of the performance of the line should 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.310
 be in general that you do it by means of 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.270
 guides that you are placing and then you erase 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.170
 to be able to do this turn it into 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.170
 this
