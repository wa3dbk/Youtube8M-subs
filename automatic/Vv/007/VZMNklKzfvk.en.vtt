 visual effects of good quality 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.490

 puzzle in clear the little duck at the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.670
 faculty all with gravity so 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.500
 to avoid the pitfalls and others and to me 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.060
 place in tables in account 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.600
 Moreover 100 levels divided into three 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.670
 environments 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.709
 all with the support of the sacrosanct to 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:22.340
 icloud to continue his part on all 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:23.990
 his apple devices as we like you 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.540
 to discover small nuggets of 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.360
 unmedicated developers here is poker 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.980
 tower it is here a question of a mix between 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.110
 a game of poker and the famous match 3 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.510
 with the goal of achieving the most of 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.040
 possible combinations for example a 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.620
 pair a color a full 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.480
 and this is to add to this several 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.030
 game modes particularly well thought out 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.690
 and obviously a complete tutorial for 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.690
 understand the basics 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.300
 the event of the week is the 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.790
 release of the third part of the series le 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.710
 racing and if the previous opus was 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.960
 paying electronic art that makes a bet 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.880
 crazy to adopt the economic model 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.100
 free to play a system that hide 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.020
 often many micro payment by 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.540
 so let's see if that does not spoil 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.980
 heavy around this flagship license but 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.540
 what strikes the player from his first 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.430
 turns of wheels on risle roots 3 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.680
 its breathtaking achievement 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.030
 it's very simple it's one of the 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.250
 most beautiful games available to date 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.780
 on the app store and the most beautiful game all 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.360
 short in the category of free to games 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.040
 play the 46 cars 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.110
 present are perfectly modeled 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.360
 Ditto for licensed circuits 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.880
 not to mention the 900 competition at 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.410
 various objectives or driving 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.780
 rigorous that are available to you once 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.640
 the helpers remove but the fat 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.700
 particularity roots drills 3 this is 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.570
 his multiplayer timeshift system 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.800
 understand that your competitors on the 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.960
 track are real players having 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.260
 participated in the same for what you and 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.520
 even if he does not play at the same time 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.720
 and well know that these works at 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.460
 wonder and as a bonus 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.740
 no reason to scream at a difficulty 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.850
 poorly calibrated since no car in 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.230
 is fully controlled by 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.470
 artificial intelligence 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.630
 a treat go we get to the point on 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.170
 the economic model as evidenced by 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.270
 these images 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.640
 these are not the ways to get out the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.560
 missing blue card except that here's 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.120
 you do not have to spend the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.340
 every penny to take full advantage 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.109
 of this title there are many times when 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.549
 we have to wait especially after 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.980
 repairs or pending delivery 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.600
 of your new car but then again 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.880
 those who do not want paid can 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.990
 use the game currency 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.480
 of course you have to use it with 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.250
 moderation but I guarantee it in 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.490
 always using it last resort 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.290
 you will never dry quickly there 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.700
 must also know that rinne racing 3 is 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.170
 transforms into a management game 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.750
 since you have bought several 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:42.550
 cars indeed it is possible to 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.200
 make repairs and improvements on 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.000
 a racing car while the other is 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.520
 functional weight like and times 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.920
 of expectations and once again do not get 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.720
 serve as the game currency 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.510
 in the end the risl note 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.940
 racing 3 7 to 8 of 10 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.680
 a breathtaking achievement in addition 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.270
 of a formidable system that allows 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.590
 exactly transcribe the tones and 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.320
 trajectories of other players 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.920
 in short we urge you to 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.630
 Download 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.220
 although it is obvious that the model 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:15.610
 economic slow down the most impatient 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:17.950
 of you we are leaving today 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:20.350
