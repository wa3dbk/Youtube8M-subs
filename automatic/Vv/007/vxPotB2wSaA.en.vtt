to<00:00:07.060> divide<00:00:07.420> the<00:00:07.630> oven<00:00:07.930> into<00:00:08.140> a<00:00:08.170> cooking<00:00:08.590> space

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
to divide the oven into a cooking space

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.580 
to divide the oven into a cooking space
and<00:00:09.160> a<00:00:09.460> fire<00:00:09.760> space<00:00:10.120> what<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:10.570> like<00:00:10.840> to<00:00:10.990> use<00:00:11.230> is<00:00:11.559> a

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
and a fire space what I like to use is a

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.619 
and a fire space what I like to use is a
two<00:00:12.219> bricks<00:00:12.520> I<00:00:12.730> haven't<00:00:13.180> seen<00:00:13.330> this<00:00:13.450> done

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
two bricks I haven't seen this done

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.150 
two bricks I haven't seen this done
anywhere<00:00:14.020> else<00:00:14.080> but<00:00:14.440> it<00:00:14.559> works<00:00:14.770> really<00:00:14.889> really

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
anywhere else but it works really really

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.720 
anywhere else but it works really really
well

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
well

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.310 
well
these<00:00:16.000> are<00:00:16.119> just<00:00:16.330> normal<00:00:16.570> bricks<00:00:17.020> that<00:00:17.140> you'll

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
these are just normal bricks that you'll

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.859 
these are just normal bricks that you'll
get<00:00:17.440> from<00:00:17.650> any<00:00:17.800> builders<00:00:18.190> merchants<00:00:18.640> or<00:00:18.820> B&amp;Q<00:00:19.690> I

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:19.869 
get from any builders merchants or B&amp;Q I

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.530 
get from any builders merchants or B&amp;Q I
quite<00:00:20.500> like<00:00:20.949> bricks<00:00:21.730> with<00:00:21.940> a<00:00:21.970> hole<00:00:22.270> in<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
quite like bricks with a hole in the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.450 
quite like bricks with a hole in the
middle<00:00:22.840> because<00:00:23.170> it<00:00:23.410> allows<00:00:23.650> the<00:00:23.860> air<00:00:24.010> to<00:00:24.040> draw

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
middle because it allows the air to draw

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.460 
middle because it allows the air to draw
through<00:00:24.850> the<00:00:25.000> brick<00:00:25.240> and<00:00:25.390> still<00:00:25.930> allows<00:00:26.170> heat

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
through the brick and still allows heat

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.900 
through the brick and still allows heat
to<00:00:26.500> come<00:00:26.830> back<00:00:27.010> through<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.370> as<00:00:27.490> well<00:00:27.700> and

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
to come back through it as well and

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.180 
to come back through it as well and
these<00:00:28.420> to<00:00:29.050> start<00:00:29.290> off<00:00:29.470> with<00:00:29.650> you<00:00:29.800> just<00:00:30.010> going

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
these to start off with you just going

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.580 
these to start off with you just going
to<00:00:30.310> put<00:00:30.550> into<00:00:30.730> the<00:00:31.000> oven<00:00:31.420> at<00:00:32.020> the<00:00:32.050> back<00:00:32.320> like

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
to put into the oven at the back like

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.560 
to put into the oven at the back like
this<00:00:32.800> right<00:00:33.520> at<00:00:33.670> the<00:00:33.760> back<00:00:33.910> of<00:00:34.059> the<00:00:34.149> oven<00:00:34.300> and

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
this right at the back of the oven and

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.299 
this right at the back of the oven and
then<00:00:34.930> when<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.230> fire<00:00:35.440> is<00:00:35.469> established<00:00:36.160> you're

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
then when the fire is established you're

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.399 
then when the fire is established you're
going<00:00:36.489> to<00:00:36.610> close<00:00:36.850> this<00:00:37.210> around<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.809> fire<00:00:38.079> to

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.409 
going to close this around the fire to

00:00:38.409 --> 00:00:40.739 
going to close this around the fire to
can<00:00:38.829> stain<00:00:39.190> contain<00:00:39.760> the<00:00:39.879> fire<00:00:40.120> at<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.600> back

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:40.749 
can stain contain the fire at the back

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:42.540 
can stain contain the fire at the back
of<00:00:40.929> the<00:00:41.019> other<00:00:41.170> one<00:00:41.409> so<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:41.980> we<00:00:42.070> just<00:00:42.249> put<00:00:42.309> those

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
of the other one so if we just put those

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.329 
of the other one so if we just put those
in<00:00:43.019> then<00:00:44.019> we'll<00:00:44.230> move<00:00:44.440> them<00:00:44.649> around<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:45.100> fire

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
in then we'll move them around the fire

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.809 
in then we'll move them around the fire
at<00:00:45.519> a<00:00:45.640> later<00:00:45.819> date<00:00:46.089> okay<00:00:46.899> then<00:00:47.859> we<00:00:48.069> make<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
at a later date okay then we make the

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:52.139 
at a later date okay then we make the
kindling<00:00:49.239> fire<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:50.579> again<00:00:51.579> if<00:00:51.699> I<00:00:51.789> just<00:00:51.969> show

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
kindling fire and again if I just show

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.399 
kindling fire and again if I just show
you<00:00:52.179> what<00:00:52.420> I'm<00:00:52.510> going<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.749> do<00:00:52.899> at<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.109> front

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
you what I'm going to do at the front

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:54.750 
you what I'm going to do at the front
then<00:00:53.589> I'll<00:00:53.710> set<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:53.949> up<00:00:54.129> all<00:00:54.339> at<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.550> back

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
then I'll set it up all at the back

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.369 
then I'll set it up all at the back
that's<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.809> fire<00:00:56.379> lighter<00:00:56.679> at<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.460> front<00:00:58.379> and

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
that's a fire lighter at the front and

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.419 
that's a fire lighter at the front and
if<00:00:59.440> you're<00:00:59.589> going<00:00:59.710> to<00:00:59.800> use<00:01:00.129> these<00:01:02.429> petroleum

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
if you're going to use these petroleum

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.219 
if you're going to use these petroleum
fire<00:01:03.639> lighters<00:01:03.999> just<00:01:04.449> use<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.659> small<00:01:05.019> piece

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
fire lighters just use a small piece

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.899 
fire lighters just use a small piece
because<00:01:05.470> otherwise<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:06.040> sits<00:01:06.340> up<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.640> oven

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
because otherwise it sits up the oven

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.820 
because otherwise it sits up the oven
and<00:01:07.060> it<00:01:07.180> smells<00:01:07.210> and<00:01:07.930> it's<00:01:08.049> really<00:01:08.380> not<00:01:08.560> alive

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
and it smells and it's really not alive

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.950 
and it smells and it's really not alive
you<00:01:09.310> can<00:01:09.520> use<00:01:09.730> newspaper<00:01:10.240> paper<00:01:10.450> but<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.720> find

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
you can use newspaper paper but I find

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.420 
you can use newspaper paper but I find
these<00:01:11.110> burn<00:01:11.290> a<00:01:11.320> little<00:01:11.530> bit<00:01:11.710> longer<00:01:11.920> the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
these burn a little bit longer the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.580 
these burn a little bit longer the
alcohol<00:01:13.030> based<00:01:13.270> fire<00:01:13.660> lighters<00:01:14.050> are<00:01:14.140> a<00:01:14.200> lot

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
alcohol based fire lighters are a lot

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.190 
alcohol based fire lighters are a lot
better<00:01:15.180> where<00:01:16.180> they<00:01:16.300> have<00:01:16.480> a<00:01:16.510> very<00:01:16.750> good<00:01:16.870> brand

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
better where they have a very good brand

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200 
better where they have a very good brand
of<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.770> they<00:01:17.860> work<00:01:18.040> superbly<00:01:18.550> so<00:01:19.000> you're

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
of that and they work superbly so you're

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.680 
of that and they work superbly so you're
going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.420> set<00:01:19.660> this<00:01:19.810> up<00:01:19.990> camp<00:01:20.710> boy<00:01:20.890> style<00:01:24.690> and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
going to set this up camp boy style and

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.940 
going to set this up camp boy style and
this<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:25.930> what<00:01:26.080> you're<00:01:26.230> doing<00:01:26.380> at<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.620> back<00:01:26.770> of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
this is what you're doing at the back of

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.840 
this is what you're doing at the back of
the<00:01:27.040> oven<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.190> you're<00:01:30.340> going<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.580> cover

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
the oven and then you're going to cover

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.680 
the oven and then you're going to cover
this<00:01:31.090> with<00:01:31.150> smaller<00:01:31.750> pieces<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.350> wood<00:01:32.560> and

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
this with smaller pieces of wood and

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.780 
this with smaller pieces of wood and
realistically<00:01:34.690> for<00:01:35.020> your<00:01:35.410> first<00:01:35.740> fire<00:01:36.190> you'll

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
realistically for your first fire you'll

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.700 
realistically for your first fire you'll
probably<00:01:37.000> put<00:01:37.270> five<00:01:37.600> or<00:01:37.810> six<00:01:38.050> of<00:01:38.200> these<00:01:38.380> onto

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
probably put five or six of these onto

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.000 
probably put five or six of these onto
it

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
it

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.950 
it
no<00:01:39.490> pieces<00:01:39.850> of<00:01:40.000> wood<00:01:40.150> bigger<00:01:40.480> than<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:40.750> and

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
no pieces of wood bigger than that and

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.870 
no pieces of wood bigger than that and
you'll<00:01:41.140> let<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.410> fire<00:01:41.650> burn<00:01:41.680> out<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.490> then

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
you'll let that fire burn out and then

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.000 
you'll let that fire burn out and then
you'll<00:01:43.030> light<00:01:43.210> your<00:01:43.420> next<00:01:43.660> fire<00:01:43.870> right<00:01:44.770> so

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
you'll light your next fire right so

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.410 
you'll light your next fire right so
I'll<00:01:45.160> do<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.340> now<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.700> back<00:01:46.000> of<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.240> oven

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
I'll do that now the back of the oven
