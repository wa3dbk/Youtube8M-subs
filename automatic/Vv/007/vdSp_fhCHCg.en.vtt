00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:15.520
 a new way a way that 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.520
 work 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.040
 China has happened to him 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.890
 who failed in a criminal because he did not 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.570
 They feel safe when throwing 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.570
 doormen guess 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.160
 good afternoon 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.510
 the new form I think criminal so that 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.390
 can deceive the goalkeeper and so be a 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.710
 little easier to put it and that 's the way 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.149
 true this is not very common so 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.750
 try new organizations and 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.750
 expressive 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.750
 heart 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.010
 Y 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.010
 good 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.450
 good as they left I realize this 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.670
 play is like a way of cheating the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.399
 goalkeeper so he is not prepared to 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.409
 the end or the person who is 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.179
 doing everything right does not knock down the 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.310
 final but at the time of throwing it then he 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.079
 he does not throw a goal if he does not 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.060
 side so that the person who is behind 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.729
 waiting here in the prison or waiting 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.500
 an auction or waiting for the failure to 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.690
 the goal 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.960
 gets into the area of just what 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:59.730
 touches and he takes to finish or get to that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.490
 is a Chilean to put goal 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.800
 then it is a simpler way 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 and more effective to shoot penal or 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.149
 because it 's something that the goalie nor 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.960
 it has even been expected 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.740
 God is fine do not try 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.740
 and there is the origin 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 well this is a play that I put 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.830
 because it was not expected is not good 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.000
 try it do not have I will try 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.000
 you can talk about it before a game has been 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 put in contact 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 and it is that everything is like a normal criminal 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.129
 already legally speaking an art 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.129
 yes this is 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.959
 and so 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.290
 because nothing happens or is the only thing 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.319
 could do is have to repeat in 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.840
 have again because in the regulation 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.450
 says that now they triumph and the ball 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.450
 to polls and to nation versus this 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.910
 do not make the pass back do not pass them to a 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.740
 side or anything like it go towards 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.480
 opposite and always face a 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.240
 side to compare it to the profile of its 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.240
 partner make profile on the other side of 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.010
 in front 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.200
 I told you then can not spend another 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.200
 thing like that 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.489
 ah 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.570
 well obviously if you can 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.300
 apply this play can not be performed 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:07.830
 in a penalty shootout explained why 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.830
 they kill the penalty and only the goalkeeper 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.160
 two 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:23.900
 then because they are all around 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.900
 of the area waiting for an auction or 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.960
 waiting for anything like that 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.020
 then as I hope they work and 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.180
 I recommend them a lot, it's something we have 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.979
 I hope that it will happen and I assure you that 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.979
 makes the goal we have that teammates 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.720
 Y 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.720
 he ensures that the function 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.330
 what 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.330
 this channel 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.040
 and I hope 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:10.940
 they are created but I hope you have understood 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.940
 and have you liked please friends 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.729
