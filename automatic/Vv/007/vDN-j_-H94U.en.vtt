00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.330 
go to sources and you're going to scroll
down<00:01:46.890> you're<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> find<00:01:47.430> e<00:01:47.640> dot<00:01:48.390> CFG<00:01:49.340> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
down you're going to find e dot CFG and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.389 
down you're going to find e dot CFG and
you're<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.270> delete<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:52.340> go<00:01:53.340> to
