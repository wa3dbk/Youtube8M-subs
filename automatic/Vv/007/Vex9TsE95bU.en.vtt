00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.390
 Y 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.510
 very good guys here I am with the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.440
 first part of the how-to tutorial 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:19.590
 maximize the quality of youtube 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.869
 of the hd pvr in my case I have the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 have mean that in capturing people h 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.190
 for video quality but not 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.460
 I have a camera right now and I'm 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.160
 recording with the blackberry shit and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 well here you can see a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.899
 poquillo in the front of this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.610
 capturing capture piece for 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.790
 me the best in the market because it costs 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.970
 only 120 euros, he's just a piquillo 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.010
 but compared to the hd pvr for example 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.010
 It costs 200 euros and it's much worse 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.780
 chair because for example we need 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.870
 computer with this one for example 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.510
 we connect the usb directly here and you 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.500
 we give the button to capture here 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.049
 to the king and he will record everything directly to you 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.570
 hard drive without any problems 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.399
 you do not need a computer is one of the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.960
 biggest advantages that this has 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.600
 capturing 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.060
 and that I decided to buy it for that because I 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.260
 I have a mediocre computer here in a 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:22.040
 little is a mediocre doing of all 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.800
 and well, nothing kids today I teach you 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.160
 a little bit a little set up there with 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.850
 all my health and the sniper elite my 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.090
 Son and bluetooth helmets and little more 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.170
 I do not have much else 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.509
 and nothing folks because the first part we're going 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.049
 to start the ballet what we have to 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:48.130
 to do is to put the television first very 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:52.810
 important to 720p but very important 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.899
 it is also mark both 576 p and 720 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.060
 It's not worth just dialing 720p and good 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.420
 this captor captures up to a maximum 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.719
 of 1080 and what happens that in 1080 and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.939
 nobody captures because the and means 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:12.700
 interline is valid and who understands a little 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:14.860
 of renders and of screen because it knows 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 that the inter legend is worse than the pp 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.849
 what is progressive good the inter law what 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.799
 that what happens that you get interlaced 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.569
 that means the lines that you see 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.000
 many times on youtube in the videos 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.200
 the lines of those ugly that comes out black 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.250
 black in 3 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 the video good because that's the internet 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.209
 that's why you have to use filters 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.970
 interface 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.480
 well explained this a little bit 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.849
 we give you here we accept to finalize 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.349
 Once this is done, the only thing 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.670
 What we will have to do is give 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.670
 turn on the capture 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:58.800
 we put the usb before to go 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.800
 recognizing takes a little bit 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.189
 OK 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.030
 and now he will put us here that welcome 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.030
 to see half 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.740
 and well I'll explain it while 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.160
 ok here we have it right because to see 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.620
 media capture box and good the only thing 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.100
 we will have to do is give the menu 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.620
 configuration and we put quality in 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.050
 optimal video quality is worth that what 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.810
 you will have safe place 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.970
 and well I'm not going to stop here to stop 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.770
 teach them and simply what 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.020
 we will have to do after is to give 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.150
 this button here from the corner that what 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.730
 what it does to us is that it changes and the light 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.860
 in blue and what it does to us is to record 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.570
 Real time is valid for those who have 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.450
 problems with this capturing they say 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.670
 that captures a little bit with delay is 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.620
 because they do not give that final button and 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.080
 that button serves to capture on time 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.490
 real without any delay or anything 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:00.510
 it's perfect 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.160
 and good as you see here is perfect and what 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.920
 only thing that we would have to do is 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.660
 give the network when we would like to record 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.670
 and stop when we want to logically 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.710
 and well this is the first part so a 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.070
 little what is wanted to do in three stages 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:21.270
 and tutorial I hope you liked it 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.760
 It's worth a setup when I get two 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.760
 thousand subscribers out there when I get to 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.630
 enough subscribers then to the 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.230
 buseta will publish and all 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.610
 and well I hope you liked it and 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.849
 will be the second part that is with the 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.159
 vegas pro 11 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:42.309
 and nothing we worry about that will take 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:44.009
 in a matter of a day or two as much 

00:04:42.309 --> 00:04:46.139
 will be hung 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.229
 and I hope you liked to subscribe 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:51.529
 like favorites and comments kids up
