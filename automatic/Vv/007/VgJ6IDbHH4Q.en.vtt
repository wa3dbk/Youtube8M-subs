the<00:01:24.320> challenge<00:01:25.010> because<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:27.619> know<00:01:27.740> people

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
the challenge because you know people

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.210 
the challenge because you know people
are<00:01:28.490> used<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.760> plant<00:01:29.030> bluegrass<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:30.010> within<00:01:31.010> a

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
are used to plant bluegrass and within a

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.100 
are used to plant bluegrass and within a
few<00:01:31.430> months<00:01:31.670> you<00:01:31.970> have<00:01:32.150> a<00:01:32.180> pretty<00:01:32.510> good<00:01:32.570> stand

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
few months you have a pretty good stand

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.969 
few months you have a pretty good stand
and<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.470> Buffalo<00:01:33.950> takes<00:01:34.250> longer<00:01:35.890> ideally<00:01:36.890> if

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
and the Buffalo takes longer ideally if

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.969 
and the Buffalo takes longer ideally if
we<00:01:37.100> can<00:01:37.220> get<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.940> first<00:01:38.180> part<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.570> June

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
we can get it in the first part of June

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.710 
we can get it in the first part of June
and<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.280> do<00:01:40.460> still<00:01:40.760> put<00:01:40.970> an<00:01:41.090> irrigation<00:01:41.479> system

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
and we do still put an irrigation system

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.330 
and we do still put an irrigation system
in<00:01:42.400> to<00:01:43.400> help<00:01:44.240> get<00:01:44.450> it<00:01:44.570> up<00:01:44.750> and<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.860> also<00:01:46.250> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
in to help get it up and and also to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.280 
in to help get it up and and also to
keep<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.700> green<00:01:46.939> in<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.210> summer<00:01:47.510> even<00:01:47.990> though

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
keep it green in the summer even though

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.310 
keep it green in the summer even though
it<00:01:48.380> takes<00:01:48.560> about<00:01:48.890> half<00:01:49.340> or<00:01:50.210> less<00:01:50.270> water<00:01:51.170> than

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
it takes about half or less water than

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.039 
it takes about half or less water than
the<00:01:51.560> bluegrass<00:01:52.090> but<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> big<00:01:53.450> problem<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.869> you

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
the bluegrass but the big problem is you

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.890 
the bluegrass but the big problem is you
see<00:01:54.229> a<00:01:54.259> lot<00:01:54.500> of<00:01:54.530> weeds<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.040> first<00:01:55.250> year<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.000> so

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 
see a lot of weeds the first year and so

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.410 
see a lot of weeds the first year and so
people<00:01:57.259> think<00:01:57.530> well<00:01:57.830> that's<00:01:58.220> not<00:01:58.729> a<00:01:58.790> good<00:01:59.060> deal

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
people think well that's not a good deal

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.070 
people think well that's not a good deal
so<00:02:00.430> usually<00:02:01.430> late<00:02:01.700> after<00:02:02.180> it<00:02:02.270> goes<00:02:02.360> dormant<00:02:02.780> in

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
so usually late after it goes dormant in

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.399 
so usually late after it goes dormant in
the<00:02:03.200> fall<00:02:03.439> October<00:02:04.400> maybe<00:02:05.270> even<00:02:05.600> early

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
the fall October maybe even early

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.679 
the fall October maybe even early
November<00:02:07.009> will<00:02:07.520> come<00:02:07.700> in<00:02:07.880> usually<00:02:08.119> spray<00:02:08.599> it

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:08.689 
November will come in usually spray it

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.020 
November will come in usually spray it
with<00:02:08.750> Roundup<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.500> first<00:02:09.739> year<00:02:10.129> that<00:02:10.310> wipes

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
with Roundup the first year that wipes

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.990 
with Roundup the first year that wipes
out<00:02:11.269> most<00:02:11.329> of<00:02:11.689> the<00:02:11.750> weeds<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.439> by<00:02:13.340> mid-summer

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

about half the maintenance we found out
half<00:03:03.020> the<00:03:03.200> water<00:03:03.410> use<00:03:04.750> like<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.900> golf<00:03:06.140> course

half the water use like the golf course
we<00:03:06.830> used<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.930> everywhere<00:03:08.930> from<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.560> water

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800

bluegrass<00:03:10.610> rough<00:03:11.000> which<00:03:11.390> is<00:03:11.570> like<00:03:11.840> 40<00:03:12.290> feet

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470

off<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.680> fairway<00:03:13.600> from<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.810> point<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.410> our

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
off the fairway from that point to our

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.770 
off the fairway from that point to our
boundary<00:03:16.070> lines<00:03:16.370> is<00:03:16.640> all<00:03:16.820> buffalo<00:03:17.239> grass<00:03:17.450> and

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
boundary lines is all buffalo grass and

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.410 
boundary lines is all buffalo grass and
there's<00:03:18.110> no<00:03:18.320> way<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.680> have<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:18.950> water<00:03:19.190> to<00:03:19.850> even

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
there's no way we have the water to even

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.140 
there's no way we have the water to even
try<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.720> water<00:03:21.050> it<00:03:21.520> so<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.610> works<00:03:22.790> very<00:03:23.030> well

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
try to water it so it works very well

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.590 
try to water it so it works very well
they're<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.870> only<00:03:24.050> problem<00:03:24.620> there<00:03:24.830> is<00:03:25.600> with

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
they're the only problem there is with

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.650 
they're the only problem there is with
with<00:03:27.080> all<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.470> golf<00:03:27.680> cart<00:03:27.980> traffic<00:03:28.580> it<00:03:29.420> beats

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
with all the golf cart traffic it beats

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.380 
with all the golf cart traffic it beats
it<00:03:29.870> down<00:03:30.220> so<00:03:31.220> actually<00:03:31.549> if<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:31.970> hit<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.209> ball

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
it down so actually if you hit the ball

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.360 
it down so actually if you hit the ball
in<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.630> buffalo<00:03:33.019> grass<00:03:33.260> it's<00:03:33.890> an<00:03:34.010> easier<00:03:34.310> shot

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
in the buffalo grass it's an easier shot

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.640 
in the buffalo grass it's an easier shot
and<00:03:34.970> if<00:03:35.060> you<00:03:35.180> just<00:03:35.390> miss<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.720> fairway<00:03:35.989> by<00:03:36.350> 10

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
and if you just miss the fairway by 10

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.410 
and if you just miss the fairway by 10
or<00:03:36.799> 20<00:03:37.070> feet<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.549> get<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.030> thick<00:03:38.209> blue
