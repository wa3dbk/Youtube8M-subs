 for the height the magnitude of this tower 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.410
 from the place of this incredible viewpoint the 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.410
 good years city 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.189
 well I say a mystery of started there 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.810
 by the dawn of the 80s 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.579
 what that tower meant to extract 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.879
 the tower that has an incredible view 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.680

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.100
 this ghost park the park of the 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:48.839
 city ​​is in intensive care that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.450
 You can recover it in minutes 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:53.310
 we have all the details 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.880
 they never put it back to be able to expose 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.880
 fiction friends 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.810
 because fundamentally with a mystery 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.820
 the mystery of that tower that wanted to be 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 the highest point of the capital and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.630
 it ended up in nothingness and that maybe a lot 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.100
 people do not know at this first sight 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.900
 we are going to begin to explore new 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.370
 postcards of this park of what we 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.370
 we found when we went there 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149
 Y 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.770
 It would be an incredible dream to be in 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.460
 this place that is for you want 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.610
 an idea as if there were 65 floors by 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.229
 the height the magnitude of this tower 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.040
 this incredible exterminator place the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.040
 Buenos aires city 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.969
 confinements 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.299
 meters from where are the benefits of 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.299
 Park 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.870
 in this place it never worked never 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.500
 they put back power to put in 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.500
 functioning 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:32.320
 I want to place these woods 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:36.150
 so that the wood is not abandoned 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.150
 a halo that covers 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.239
 this beautiful place 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.650
 but there was a construction of 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.810
 pretended magnificence that was going to be 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.170
 the tower that everyone wanted to visit from 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.810
 there in 360 degrees he would be able to see 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.030
 absolutely all the city however 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.700
 that happened many can not access it 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.380
 about six months ago they end up 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.540
 of watering the elevators no longer work 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.850
 they spent two million pesos beyond 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.050
 of this this show that is seen from 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.510
 all the points of the city good 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.880
 aires is today a place worth visiting 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.280
 they will know every corner of that tower 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.900
 but also the mystery that holds its 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.170
 construction and of course also its 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.209
 structure 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.069
 see god our superhero tell the 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:39.569
 city 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.569
 apart from the safe Galician city 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.300
 and facilities a month was for a game 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.180
 this some system a cable that was 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.250
 placed later to give light to 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.590
 some of the sectors nor spider web 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.470
 the passage of time of the park of the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.860
 city ​​that dies dies in sight 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.860
 of all 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.990
 s 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.480
 old bathroom 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:15.069
 they were eating us 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.069
 the time the wood 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.150
 so we continue at every step finding 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.060
 elements that lead us to think that 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.860
 someone did not make things right before 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.600
 reach one of the highest points of 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.000
 the space tower we came across more 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.790
 games that were looted some 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.560
 other ones that time does not 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.560
 it prevents them from working again 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.490
 they left the games 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.830
 to the cars 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.880
 this place that could be a center for 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.870
 that many guys 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.870
 I'm going to have a good time 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.090
 one has the feeling that time 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.090
 stopped 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.639
 as sierra not the passage of the years 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.790
 with this 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.139
 are maybe and following the possibility 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.139
 many guys who depend on the payment 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.560
 from the highest point of the city ​​the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:18.400
 208-meter -high space tower and 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.470
 equals a 72- story building but 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.639
 very few people could get to this that 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.169
 we are going to show you 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:29.090
 going up here would be an incredible dream to be able to 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.960
 be in this place that is for you 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:35.210
 give an idea as if there were 65 floors 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.729
 for the height the magnitude of this tower 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.680
 from this place incredible determiner the 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:42.110
 City of Buenos Aires 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.139
 defenders did not work anymore it 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:47.169
 they re -enabled and functioned 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.169
 new 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.180
 the high-speed access will arrive 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.180
 four meters per second 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.990
 what they are going to see now is a show 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.150
 Only that way you can see Buenos Aires from the 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.150
 air from inside the tower 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.590
 this may be one of the few 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:18.110
 images that are preserved that way is why 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.110
 Inside the view is amazing 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.260
 but also with the passing of the years 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.800
 they were adopting these elements so 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.360
 interesting several radial antennas that 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:33.290
 they use the electricity that we pay 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.290
 all to transmit 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:39.430
 what they were going to do at some point 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:45.280
 because they do not have to feed the 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:46.889
 large number of antennas up in the 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.310
 city 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:53.440
 I did shovel rental 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.440
 and it's going to be distributed to miners 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:07:00.370
 the park continues like this in intensive therapy 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:02.500
 nobody seems to take care of this true 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.230
 treasure 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:08.610
 what was once thought of as the 

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.610
 disneyworld by soldati 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:18.450
 in this unstoppable tour of the 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.550
 city ​​park buenos aires morning 

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:24.060
 they will know the mystery exclusively 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:26.700
 of the warehouse 708 a treasure is saved 

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:28.440
 there they will go inside all the 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:30.660
 items that are saved are not what 

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.220
 lose good awesome task 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.670
 Diego Garcia is discovering these 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.670
 places
