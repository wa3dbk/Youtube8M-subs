00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
and daylight was going away so I figured

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.090 
and daylight was going away so I figured
you<00:03:03.810> know<00:03:03.900> what<00:03:04.170> let<00:03:04.290> me<00:03:04.320> just<00:03:04.410> go<00:03:04.860> ahead<00:03:04.950> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
you know what let me just go ahead and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.370 
you know what let me just go ahead and
put<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.430> attachment<00:03:05.940> on<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.720> first<00:03:06.989> sight<00:03:07.200> use

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
put the attachment on at first sight use

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.870 
put the attachment on at first sight use
the<00:03:07.560> whole<00:03:07.769> pack<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.280> then<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.489> had<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.700> come

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
the whole pack but then I had to come

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.360 
the whole pack but then I had to come
back<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.390> use<00:03:09.690> only<00:03:10.110> half<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> because<00:03:11.250> I

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
back and use only half of it because I

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.520 
back and use only half of it because I
just<00:03:11.430> couldn't<00:03:11.580> get<00:03:12.000> the<00:03:12.150> bunt<00:03:12.360> down<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:13.049> I

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
just couldn't get the bunt down and I

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.020 
just couldn't get the bunt down and I
think<00:03:13.769> next<00:03:13.950> time<00:03:14.220> i'll<00:03:14.370> make<00:03:14.549> it<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.760> little

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
think next time i'll make it a little

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.360 
think next time i'll make it a little
higher<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.780> i<00:03:16.230> think<00:03:16.530> it<00:03:16.650> turned<00:03:16.890> out<00:03:17.040> pretty

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
higher but i think it turned out pretty

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.840 
higher but i think it turned out pretty

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.560 
a little bit over here that keeps poking
out<00:03:39.530> which<00:03:39.800> since<00:03:40.760> i'm<00:03:40.940> not<00:03:41.090> really<00:03:41.270> going

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
out which since i'm not really going

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.720 
out which since i'm not really going
anywhere<00:03:41.810> i<00:03:42.140> didn't<00:03:42.710> even<00:03:42.860> bother<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.220> put<00:03:43.520> a

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
anywhere i didn't even bother to put a

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.630 
anywhere i didn't even bother to put a
bobby<00:03:43.970> pin<00:03:44.090> on<00:03:44.420> but<00:03:45.170> um<00:03:45.440> I<00:03:45.650> struggled<00:03:46.250> a<00:03:46.430> little

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
bobby pin on but um I struggled a little

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.700 
bobby pin on but um I struggled a little
bit<00:03:46.880> because<00:03:47.180> this<00:03:47.660> was<00:03:47.870> a<00:03:47.900> little<00:03:48.260> too<00:03:48.500> much

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
bit because this was a little too much

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.730 
bit because this was a little too much
for<00:03:48.950> me<00:03:49.130> an<00:03:49.310> entire<00:03:49.640> pack<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.990> think<00:03:51.230> most

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
for me an entire pack and I think most

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.250 
for me an entire pack and I think most
of<00:03:51.950> it<00:03:52.100> is<00:03:52.220> just<00:03:52.490> because<00:03:53.060> of<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.450> color<00:03:53.570> I

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
of it is just because of the color I

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.410 
of it is just because of the color I
know<00:03:54.770> it<00:03:55.010> doesn't<00:03:55.190> perfectly<00:03:55.880> match<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:56.360> I

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
know it doesn't perfectly match so I

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.100 
know it doesn't perfectly match so I
guess<00:03:56.630> it'll<00:03:56.930> be<00:03:57.140> my<00:03:57.850> thing<00:03:58.850> now<00:03:58.910> to<00:03:59.180> go<00:03:59.630> around

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
guess it'll be my thing now to go around

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.840 
guess it'll be my thing now to go around
to<00:04:00.320> beauty<00:04:00.590> supply<00:04:00.860> stores<00:04:01.220> and<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:01.490> if<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.670> can

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
to beauty supply stores and see if I can

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.350 
to beauty supply stores and see if I can
match<00:04:02.650> something<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:03.890> my<00:04:04.070> hair<00:04:04.100> color<00:04:04.520> so<00:04:05.180> yeah

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
match something to my hair color so yeah

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.670 
match something to my hair color so yeah
I<00:04:05.420> think<00:04:05.510> that's<00:04:05.900> what<00:04:06.080> I'm<00:04:06.170> working<00:04:06.350> on<00:04:06.620> now

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
I think that's what I'm working on now

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.120 
I think that's what I'm working on now
but<00:04:07.100> I<00:04:07.340> think<00:04:08.030> it<00:04:08.120> came<00:04:08.240> out<00:04:08.420> pretty<00:04:08.480> well<00:04:09.130> and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
but I think it came out pretty well and

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.070 
but I think it came out pretty well and
I'm<00:04:10.610> actually<00:04:10.820> really<00:04:11.209> happy<00:04:11.360> about<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:11.900> I

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
I'm actually really happy about this I

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.470 
I'm actually really happy about this I
feel<00:04:12.230> like<00:04:12.350> I<00:04:12.500> succeeded<00:04:12.950> at<00:04:13.250> something<00:04:13.480> so

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480
