I'm<00:00:29.429> primarily<00:00:29.640> gonna<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.150> weighing<00:00:30.359> myself

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:40.220 
I'm primarily gonna be weighing myself
was<00:00:31.619> 296<00:00:33.559> and<00:00:34.730> today<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:36.149> was<00:00:37.460> 278<00:00:38.460> point<00:00:39.000> 6<00:00:39.270> so

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
was 296 and today it was 278 point 6 so

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.950 
was 296 and today it was 278 point 6 so
that's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.860> loss<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:42.290> around<00:00:43.290> 18<00:00:44.040> pounds<00:00:44.640> in

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
that's a loss of around 18 pounds in

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:52.040 
that's a loss of around 18 pounds in
like<00:00:46.250> 8<00:00:47.250> days<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> that's<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.420> considering

like 8 days so that's good considering

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.990 
like 8 days so that's good considering
that<00:00:52.250> the<00:00:53.390> day<00:00:54.680> after<00:00:55.680> surgery<00:00:55.890> now<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> day<00:00:56.969> I

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that the day after surgery now the day I

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
that the day after surgery now the day I
got<00:00:57.239> home<00:00:57.449> Friday<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.140> weighed<00:00:58.469> myself<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
got home Friday I weighed myself and I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.330 
got home Friday I weighed myself and I
was<00:00:59.309> like<00:00:59.340> 303<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.539> I'd<00:01:00.660> gained<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.289> bunch<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
was like 303 so I'd gained a bunch of

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.270 
was like 303 so I'd gained a bunch of
weight<00:01:02.399> from<00:01:02.879> all<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.059> fluids<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.870> had

the<00:01:37.430> jello<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.210> been<00:01:39.680> and<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
the jello have really not been and I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
the jello have really not been and I
haven't<00:01:40.950> been<00:01:41.070> too<00:01:41.189> interested<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.790> so

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
haven't been too interested in those so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
haven't been too interested in those so
but<00:01:42.869> I've<00:01:42.990> been<00:01:43.110> doing<00:01:43.320> some<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.649> too

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
but I've been doing some of that too

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.880 
but I've been doing some of that too
just<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.759> trying<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.020> in<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.439> fluids

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
just really trying to get in the fluids

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.960 
just really trying to get in the fluids
has<00:01:47.399> been<00:01:47.579> difficult<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:49.700> still<00:01:50.700> don't<00:01:50.939> think

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
has been difficult I still don't think

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.370 
has been difficult I still don't think
I've<00:01:51.240> gotten<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> everything<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:52.110> should<00:01:52.170> get

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
I've gotten in everything I should get

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.240 
I've gotten in everything I should get
in<00:01:52.909> any<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.119> these<00:01:54.240> days<00:01:54.509> but<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:56.009> more

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
in any of these days but I do get more

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.590 
in any of these days but I do get more
every<00:01:57.119> day<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:58.219> I<00:01:59.219> guess<00:01:59.670> that's<00:01:59.820> that's<00:02:00.329> good

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
every day so I guess that's that's good

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.450 
every day so I guess that's that's good
they<00:02:00.780> mainly<00:02:01.320> want<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.680> focus<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.070> liquids

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
they mainly want me to focus on liquids

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.920 
they mainly want me to focus on liquids
so<00:02:03.180> that's<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:03.990> doing<00:02:04.909> I<00:02:05.909> feel<00:02:06.509> pretty

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
so that's what I'm doing I feel pretty

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.869 
so that's what I'm doing I feel pretty
good<00:02:07.170> I've<00:02:07.380> got<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.560> little<00:02:07.770> bit<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.069> pain<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.610> my

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879

left side under my kind
rim<00:02:11.790> area<00:02:12.320> it's<00:02:13.320> really<00:02:13.800> minor<00:02:14.070> though<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
rim area it's really minor though and

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.320 
rim area it's really minor though and
it's<00:02:15.150> gotten<00:02:15.450> better<00:02:15.570> every<00:02:15.780> day<00:02:20.240> starting<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
it's gotten better every day starting to

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000 
it's gotten better every day starting to
find<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.660> hard<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> sit<00:02:22.230> still<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.680> not<00:02:22.800> do

protein<00:03:25.110> I've<00:03:25.260> been<00:03:25.410> using<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:26.510> under<00:03:27.510> II

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
protein I've been using the under II

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.080 
protein I've been using the under II
unflavored<00:03:28.410> protein<00:03:28.860> powder<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.400> foods<00:03:29.670> like

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
unflavored protein powder in foods like

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.850 
unflavored protein powder in foods like
the<00:03:30.570> chicken<00:03:30.900> broth<00:03:31.020> and<00:03:31.200> stuff<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.650> I'm<00:03:31.770> just

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
the chicken broth and stuff so I'm just

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.910 
the chicken broth and stuff so I'm just
gonna<00:03:32.070> put<00:03:32.280> that<00:03:32.400> in<00:03:32.550> whatever<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:34.560> try<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:34.770> get

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
gonna put that in whatever to try to get

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.390 
gonna put that in whatever to try to get
him<00:03:35.040> protein<00:03:35.880> more<00:03:37.760> um<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:40.130> guess<00:03:41.130> that's<00:03:41.310> about

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
him protein more um I guess that's about

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.449 
him protein more um I guess that's about
it<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.209> don't<00:03:42.300> have<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.480> lot<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> update

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
it I really don't have a lot to update

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.770 
it I really don't have a lot to update
the<00:03:44.459> weight<00:03:44.610> loss<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:44.970> good<00:03:45.239> I'm<00:03:45.540> feeling

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the weight loss is good I'm feeling

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.220 
the weight loss is good I'm feeling
better

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
better

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.640 
better
so<00:03:47.100> my<00:03:47.910> followup<00:03:48.390> with<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.840> surgeon<00:03:49.230> is<00:03:49.350> next
