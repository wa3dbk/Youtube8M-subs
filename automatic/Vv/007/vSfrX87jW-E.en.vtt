00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
different way that they did the loadout

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.350 
different way that they did the loadout
system<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.930> black<00:01:46.140> ops<00:01:46.350> 2<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.210> actually<00:01:48.210> liked

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
than previous Call of Duty games did

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.300 
than previous Call of Duty games did
with<00:01:51.329> your<00:01:51.479> loadout<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.009> do<00:01:53.100> certain

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
with your loadout and you can do certain

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.679 
with your loadout and you can do certain
things<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.700> adding<00:01:54.090> all<00:01:54.270> your<00:01:54.450> attachments

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
things like adding all your attachments

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.209 
things like adding all your attachments
to<00:01:54.990> your<00:01:55.110> main<00:01:55.259> gun<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.560> not<00:01:55.680> even<00:01:55.860> having<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
to your main gun and not even having a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.380 
to your main gun and not even having a
secondary<00:01:56.549> like<00:01:56.820> what<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.180> right<00:01:57.360> here

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
secondary like what I have right here

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
secondary like what I have right here
and<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.590> don't<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.189> think<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.460> have<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and I don't even think I have the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.289 
and I don't even think I have the
reloading<00:02:00.090> faster<00:02:00.479> at<00:02:01.259> all<00:02:02.090> which<00:02:03.090> is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
reloading faster at all which is

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.380 
reloading faster at all which is
something<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.770> probably<00:02:04.770> would<00:02:05.189> be

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
something that probably would be

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.969 
something that probably would be
actually<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.990> very<00:02:07.200> helpful<00:02:07.469> at<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> mp7

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
actually very very helpful at the mp7

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.919 
actually very very helpful at the mp7
the<00:02:08.280> reload<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.789> little<00:02:09.360> bit<00:02:09.479> slow<00:02:09.720> not

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
the reload is a little bit slow not

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.180 
the reload is a little bit slow not
horribly<00:02:10.500> so<00:02:10.800> but<00:02:11.489> just<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:12.030> little<00:02:12.360> slow

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
horribly so but just a little slow

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.500 
horribly so but just a little slow
say<00:02:14.610> if<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:14.849> thinking<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.150> adding<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
say if you're thinking of adding a

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.059 
say if you're thinking of adding a
different<00:02:15.599> attachment<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:16.379> say<00:02:16.560> you're<00:02:16.800> fine

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
different attachment and say you're fine

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.970 
different attachment and say you're fine
with<00:02:17.450> having<00:02:18.450> not<00:02:19.019> having<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.440> laser<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.830> it

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
with having not having the laser on it

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
with having not having the laser on it
maybe<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.700> want<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.879> add<00:02:21.090> in<00:02:21.360> add<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:22.230> in<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
maybe you want to add in add that in the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.559 
maybe you want to add in add that in the
step<00:02:22.800> or<00:02:23.640> maybe<00:02:23.849> you<00:02:23.970> want<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.150> add<00:02:24.269> in<00:02:24.480> a

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
step or maybe you want to add in a

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.089 
step or maybe you want to add in a
reflex<00:02:24.930> I'd<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.230> personally<00:02:25.650> think<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> sights

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
reflex I'd I personally think the sights

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.369 
reflex I'd I personally think the sights
are<00:02:26.250> fine<00:02:26.489> but<00:02:26.910> they<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.239> little<00:02:27.780> difficult

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
are fine but they are a little difficult

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.350 
are fine but they are a little difficult
to<00:02:28.410> use<00:02:28.530> because<00:02:28.860> they're<00:02:29.099> so<00:02:29.459> wide<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> don't

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
to use because they're so wide I don't

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.430 
to use because they're so wide I don't
know<00:02:30.420> why<00:02:30.540> they're<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.690> wide<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.080> on<00:02:31.170> top<00:02:31.319> of

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
know why they're so wide and on top of

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.620 
know why they're so wide and on top of
that<00:02:31.530> this<00:02:32.099> gun<00:02:32.400> has<00:02:32.610> rifle<00:02:33.090> sights<00:02:33.330> why

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
that this gun has rifle sights why

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.479

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
hate that that's always bothered me

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.699 
hate that that's always bothered me
about<00:02:37.950> games<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.640> am<00:02:38.940> really<00:02:39.510> glad<00:02:39.720> Vegas<00:02:40.260> uses

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
about games I am really glad Vegas uses

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.380 
about games I am really glad Vegas uses
the<00:02:40.860> rifle<00:02:41.160> sights<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.459> the<00:02:41.519> mp7<00:02:41.760> because<00:02:42.239> the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the rifle sights on the mp7 because the

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.059 
the rifle sights on the mp7 because the
mp7<00:02:42.569> has<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.170> pistol<00:02:43.500> sights<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.890> see

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
mp7 has the pistol sights that you see

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.520 
mp7 has the pistol sights that you see
here<00:02:44.340> but<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.760> flip<00:02:45.060> those<00:02:45.299> up<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.900> then

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
here but you can flip those up and then

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.410 
here but you can flip those up and then
you'll<00:02:46.650> have<00:02:46.739> rifle<00:02:47.130> sights<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.610> be<00:02:47.760> more

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
you'll have rifle sights to be more

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.920 
you'll have rifle sights to be more
accurate<00:02:49.069> or<00:02:50.069> just<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.120> have<00:02:51.299> better<00:02:51.599> sights

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
accurate or just to have better sights

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.020 
accurate or just to have better sights
the<00:02:52.530> rival<00:02:52.829> sites<00:02:53.010> simply<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.489> better<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the rival sites simply are better and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.270 
the rival sites simply are better and
more<00:02:54.450> well<00:02:54.989> they're<00:02:55.530> a<00:02:55.560> little<00:02:55.709> more<00:02:55.860> precise

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280

so<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:52.139> prefer<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.739> try<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.010> use<00:03:53.160> SMGs<00:03:53.639> on<00:03:53.760> this

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
so I prefer to try to use SMGs on this

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.210 
so I prefer to try to use SMGs on this
map<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.930> seems<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.350> me<00:03:55.500> what<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.829> want<00:03:56.130> to

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
map that just seems to me what I want to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.800 
map that just seems to me what I want to
use<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.519> don't<00:03:56.670> actually<00:03:56.910> want<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.630> use<00:03:57.780> a

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
use I don't actually want to use a

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.020 
use I don't actually want to use a
shotgun<00:03:58.079> although<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.739> did<00:03:59.310> this<00:03:59.430> unlock<00:03:59.819> B

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
shotgun although I did this unlock B

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.089 
shotgun although I did this unlock B
1216<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.049> might<00:04:01.260> as<00:04:01.349> well<00:04:01.380> go<00:04:01.620> ahead<00:04:01.799> and<00:04:01.950> use

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
1216 so I might as well go ahead and use

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.259 
1216 so I might as well go ahead and use
that<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.310> little<00:04:02.579> bit<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:02.819> get<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> good<00:04:03.120> video

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
that a little bit and get a good video

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.699 
that a little bit and get a good video
out<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.569> that<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.900> then<00:04:03.989> probably<00:04:04.200> never<00:04:04.530> use

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
out of that and then probably never use

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.930 
out of that and then probably never use
it<00:04:04.829> again<00:04:04.920> which<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.280> basically<00:04:05.609> what<00:04:05.849> I've

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940

not<00:05:18.210> gonna<00:05:18.330> happen<00:05:18.450> in<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.720> game<00:05:18.870> unless

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
not gonna happen in the game unless

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.190 
not gonna happen in the game unless
you're<00:05:19.200> playing<00:05:19.320> Far<00:05:19.560> Cry<00:05:19.650> 2<00:05:19.850> so<00:05:20.900> yeah<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.050> does

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
you're playing Far Cry 2 so yeah it does

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.720 
you're playing Far Cry 2 so yeah it does
have<00:05:22.350> some<00:05:22.500> miss<00:05:22.890> feeding<00:05:23.220> issues<00:05:23.460> that<00:05:23.640> they

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
have some miss feeding issues that they

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.100 
have some miss feeding issues that they
had<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:23.970> work<00:05:24.150> out<00:05:24.330> but<00:05:24.510> after<00:05:24.630> they<00:05:24.840> get<00:05:24.930> that

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
had to work out but after they get that

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.320 
had to work out but after they get that
worked<00:05:25.320> out<00:05:25.500> I<00:05:25.530> think<00:05:25.710> it's<00:05:26.040> gonna<00:05:26.880> be<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.090> good

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
worked out I think it's gonna be a good

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.890 
worked out I think it's gonna be a good
cool<00:05:27.750> reliable<00:05:28.410> shotgun<00:05:29.420> on<00:05:30.420> top<00:05:30.690> of<00:05:30.780> that

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
cool reliable shotgun on top of that

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.510 
cool reliable shotgun on top of that
there<00:05:31.169> is<00:05:31.320> a<00:05:31.350> another<00:05:31.800> shotgun<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.400> is

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
there is a another shotgun that is

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.909 
there is a another shotgun that is
rivaling<00:05:33.000> the<00:05:33.180> KSG<00:05:33.690> it's<00:05:34.440> a<00:05:34.470> little<00:05:34.680> bit<00:05:34.800> more

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
rivaling the KSG it's a little bit more

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.740 
rivaling the KSG it's a little bit more
expensive<00:05:35.220> I<00:05:35.490> believe<00:05:35.760> but<00:05:36.150> at<00:05:36.360> least<00:05:36.510> it's

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
expensive I believe but at least it's

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.050 
expensive I believe but at least it's
actually<00:05:37.080> you<00:05:37.980> can<00:05:38.100> actually<00:05:38.220> get<00:05:38.550> it<00:05:38.700> that's

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
actually you can actually get it that's

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.340 
actually you can actually get it that's
