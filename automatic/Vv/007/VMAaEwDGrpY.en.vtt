 normal disturbing people 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.920
 so we are developing actions 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:12.130
 addressed to this situation this 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:15.000
 type of occurrence in order to prevent and 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.980
 reason for the ostensive presence of

 we are still now this time the day 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.010
 of today that with an event in square 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:30.160
 in front of the city hall with the 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:32.020
 The event usually takes place in 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.800
 reason of the apparatus that we were able to assemble 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:38.020
 with our police officers and at the same time 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:41.580
 we also prevent any kind of 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.380
 criminal practice by carrying out actions of 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.190
 approaches around the event venue 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.290
 in the square to anyone who can 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.570
 be suspicious 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:54.520
 so much so that even now recently 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:58.120
 we have a prison for trafficking in 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.720
 drug and had a drug with a boy 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.480
 unfortunately accompanied by his two 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.110
 little children who were together with 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.890
 he 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:11.050
 So it 's a problem for us when 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:13.300
 we find these situations but here 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.230
 we are to fulfill what we 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.230
 provides for our legislation
