our<00:00:43.870> aim<00:00:44.170> because<00:00:44.740> these<00:00:45.070> machines<00:00:45.670> are<00:00:46.150> so

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
our aim because these machines are so

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.720 
our aim because these machines are so
amazing<00:00:49.180> you<00:00:50.180> want<00:00:50.330> to<00:00:50.420> capture<00:00:50.630> that<00:00:50.840> beauty
