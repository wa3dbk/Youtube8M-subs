00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
it's just it's just really fast this is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
it's just it's just really fast this is
the<00:00:56.250> best<00:00:56.489> gun<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> game<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.480> reason

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the best gun in the game and the reason

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260 
the best gun in the game and the reason
it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.410> every<00:00:58.800> shotgun<00:00:59.699> shell<00:01:00.030> that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
it is because every shotgun shell that

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.720 
it is because every shotgun shell that
you<00:01:00.420> shoot<00:01:00.780> does<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.620> additional<00:01:02.219> amp<00:01:02.460> damage

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
you shoot does the additional amp damage

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.540 
you shoot does the additional amp damage
shield<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.470> you're<00:01:05.620> just<00:01:05.950> getting<00:01:06.280> tons

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
shield and so you're just getting tons

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.640 
shield and so you're just getting tons
of<00:01:06.790> time<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.480> drop<00:01:07.690> this<00:01:07.900> thing<00:01:07.960> it's<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.530> the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
of time to drop this thing it's just the

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.830 
of time to drop this thing it's just the
total<00:01:08.800> beast<00:01:09.190> so<00:01:09.910> I<00:01:09.940> go<00:01:10.150> ahead<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.450> kill<00:01:10.600> them

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
total beast so I go ahead and kill them

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.530 
total beast so I go ahead and kill them
and<00:01:10.870> then<00:01:11.110> of<00:01:11.230> course<00:01:11.470> my<00:01:11.710> employer<00:01:12.300> next<00:01:13.300> stop

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
and then of course my employer next stop

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.140 
and then of course my employer next stop
after<00:01:13.810> here<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.380> to<00:01:15.190> go<00:01:15.340> see<00:01:15.580> if<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:15.790> can<00:01:15.820> tilt

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
after here is to go see if I can tilt

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.510 
after here is to go see if I can tilt
air<00:01:16.390> amorphous<00:01:16.840> or<00:01:16.930> not<00:01:17.140> because<00:01:18.130> that<00:01:18.160> guy<00:01:18.460> is

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
air amorphous or not because that guy is

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.450 
air amorphous or not because that guy is
ridiculously<00:01:19.210> hard<00:01:19.780> and<00:01:20.530> we<00:01:21.070> tried<00:01:21.340> it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
ridiculously hard and we tried it

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.770 
ridiculously hard and we tried it
without<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.850> beam<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.390> don't<00:01:22.450> even<00:01:22.630> know

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
without the beam and I don't even know

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.110 
without the beam and I don't even know
if<00:01:22.870> it's<00:01:23.020> possible<00:01:23.580> it's<00:01:24.580> really<00:01:24.850> tough<00:01:25.090> you

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
if it's possible it's really tough you

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.360 
if it's possible it's really tough you
got<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.450> be<00:01:25.510> at<00:01:25.600> least<00:01:25.720> level<00:01:25.960> 50<00:01:26.500> and<00:01:26.710> you<00:01:27.190> have

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
got to be at least level 50 and you have

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.400 
got to be at least level 50 and you have

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
to have some decent gear to even have a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.650 
to have some decent gear to even have a
chance<00:01:29.680> without<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.340> combo<00:01:30.790> but

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
chance without this combo but

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.840 
chance without this combo but

the map and he almost does here now the
best<00:01:49.990> way<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.200> do<00:01:50.470> this<00:01:50.710> is<00:01:50.950> right<00:01:51.700> where<00:01:51.910> I'm

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
best way to do this is right where I'm

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.359 
best way to do this is right where I'm
aiming<00:01:52.509> towards<00:01:52.869> the<00:01:52.990> hill<00:01:53.170> if<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.979> go<00:01:54.160> over

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
aiming towards the hill if you go over

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:55.650 
aiming towards the hill if you go over
there<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.729> you<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:54.910> a<00:01:54.940> decent<00:01:55.270> enough

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
there and you have a decent enough

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.389 
there and you have a decent enough
shield<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.259> health<00:01:56.470> you<00:01:56.649> can<00:01:56.890> take<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.100> couple

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
shield and health you can take a couple

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.370 
shield and health you can take a couple
hits<00:01:57.670> from<00:01:57.880> them<00:01:58.030> so<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.240> say<00:01:58.509> back<00:01:58.780> up<00:01:59.020> against

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
hits from them so I say back up against

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.070 
hits from them so I say back up against
the<00:01:59.440> wall<00:01:59.530> over<00:01:59.890> there<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:01.270> two<00:02:01.540> Clips<00:02:01.840> you

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
the wall over there and in two Clips you

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.290 
the wall over there and in two Clips you
should<00:02:02.350> be<00:02:02.500> able<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.770> take<00:02:02.950> them<00:02:03.100> out<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.520> you

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
should be able to take them out and you

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.700 
should be able to take them out and you
also<00:02:04.450> have<00:02:04.660> enough<00:02:04.869> time<00:02:05.050> for<00:02:05.080> your<00:02:05.320> shield<00:02:05.619> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
also have enough time for your shield to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.320 
also have enough time for your shield to
recharge<00:02:06.190> long<00:02:06.399> as<00:02:06.520> you<00:02:06.610> have<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.729> decent<00:02:06.910> be
