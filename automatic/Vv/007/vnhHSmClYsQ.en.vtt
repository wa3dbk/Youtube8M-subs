00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.460
 yes hello my dear 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.400
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.880
 since I'm just in the brownie fever 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.100
 brownie blondies and so on allowed 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.820
 of course , brownies even uses 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.160
 not missing 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.070
 and if you because you also relish it 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.290
 Then let's start with it 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.629
 First, let your oven at 180 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.440
 degrees above heat preheat 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:52.989
 and then we start, and so do we 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.480
 We 150 grams did bitter couverture in 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:01.000
 pieces and we need 250 g of butter 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.980
 So a whole packet in pieces 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 I have already divided so 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:24.369
 which is melting here now and a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.439
 26 minutes 50 degrees level mature 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.689
 Pieces of the number of the couverture 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.490
 not completely melted yet 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.650
 I must again now jiff 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.509
 readjust then you will have a look 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.360
 if you are such a big greber 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.549
 Tafel had it in such big ribs 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.159
 was divided 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.250
 can be with you as well if we have them 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.020
 but had chopped then the can 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.759
 six minutes have passed so how 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.650
 said you have an eye on it 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.240
 have just if not all 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.049
 melted is the card was a 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 need a little bit like that right now 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.500
 We 180 grams of brown sugar 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.760
 so and we can now also one 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:17.460
 dissolve a bit and that is what we do 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.460
 two minutes on level 4 1 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.350
 We should cover the lid a bit here 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:28.180
 drain because our chocolate 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:33.940
 Butter sugar mixes a bit 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:38.320
 splashed the lid now goes 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.020
 Add a pinch of salt and 4 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.290
 I've already opened the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:49.270
 come in here now and will too 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.100
 Let's go back and let it go 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.860
 which now also just a minute on 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.940
 Level four is still 170 grams 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.940
 flour in addition 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:13.950
 Cover it again and you have me 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:18.780
 very short so just 30 seconds on 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.060
 the dough knead under respect here 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:29.400
 gone away from the chocolate 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:32.610
 then we can scratch and 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.240
 that was a bit on the edge of de 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:39.990
 mail I never touch even just another 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.490
 a bit short spatula and also 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.690
 here again the chocolate still on 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:53.640
 rand hangs down a bit and 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:57.210
 stir it under drugs so if we can 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:59.490
 could have stirred up a bit 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.530
 you again your rectangular baking mold and 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.130
 I use my casserole again 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:10.220
 I have already done baking paper 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:10.220
 and 35 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.950
 so it wants our dough in the 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:21.870
 baking dish or baking dish 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.540
 we still need 200 grams 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:28.540
 Mixed must therefore rather everything could 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.419
 possible mists lawn so mandl 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.310
 it should be all over me today 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.200
 have such a mixed packet at moderate 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.570
 supposedly found I have now 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.120
 here just more under gram whole has 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.780
 these and 100 grams of whole almonds 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.060
 bent and they should just like her 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.060
 distribute nicely on the dough 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.950
 and if the nuts are all well distributed 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.370
 are 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:00.520
 then we can cake at 180 degrees 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.710
 top bottom heat for about 30 to 35 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.190
 minutes in the middle of the battery from Sun. 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:11.340
 my love the brownies nut brownies 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:14.010
 I have finished it here 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.360
 So cut in the recipe 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.340
 actually you should go after that 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.229
 still cool for at least two 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.789
 put in the fridge for hours 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:24.300
 or you can also do it overnight 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.410
 let it run in the fridge but 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:36.460
 I can not wait that long now 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:41.950
 must now try the same time great 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:44.830
 Juicy remind so easily 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.840
 a little bit of roasted almonds 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.380
 in that I was in trade with in it 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:55.690
 So really great in the mix must 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:58.450

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.270
 Delighted to taste delicious 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.240
