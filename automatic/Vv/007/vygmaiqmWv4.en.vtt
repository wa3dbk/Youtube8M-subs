00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
for him just because it would really be

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.610 
for him just because it would really be

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
box all right the box on the inside is

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.469 
box all right the box on the inside is
just<00:01:41.189> cardboard<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.470> see<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> flaws

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
just cardboard and you can see the flaws

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.289 
just cardboard and you can see the flaws
originally<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.899> box<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.259> only<00:01:46.380> from<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:47.369> to

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
originally the box is only from here to

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.789 
originally the box is only from here to
here<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.840> it<00:01:48.930> wasn't<00:01:49.200> big<00:01:49.350> enough<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.649> fit

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
here but it wasn't big enough to fit

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.690 
here but it wasn't big enough to fit
over<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> base<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:51.509> i<00:01:52.070> take<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.520> with<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
over the base so i take that with a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030 
over the base so i take that with a
piece<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> cardboard<00:01:54.119> glue<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.780> on<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> then

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
piece of cardboard glue that on and then

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
piece of cardboard glue that on and then
make<00:01:56.399> another<00:01:56.610> ending<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
make another ending for it and then it

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.569 
make another ending for it and then it
didn't<00:01:58.409> really<00:01:58.530> work<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.009> glue<00:01:59.219> anymore

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
didn't really work with the glue anymore

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.569 
didn't really work with the glue anymore
so<00:01:59.729> i<00:01:59.759> had<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> use<00:02:00.060> clear<00:02:00.810> packing<00:02:00.930> tape<00:02:01.579> and

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
so i had to use clear packing tape and

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.139 
so i had to use clear packing tape and
then<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> use<00:02:03.210> these<00:02:03.570> little<00:02:05.149> cardboard

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
then I had to use these little cardboard

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.880 
then I had to use these little cardboard
pieces<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:07.229> make<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> fit<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.110> little<00:02:10.110> mishap

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
pieces to make it fit so little mishap

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.250 
pieces to make it fit so little mishap
but<00:02:11.190> next<00:02:11.370> time<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.640> do<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.910> which<00:02:12.150> are

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
but next time I do it which are

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.550 
but next time I do it which are
probably<00:02:13.560> gonna<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:14.400> another<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:15.379> not<00:02:16.379> now

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
probably gonna do another one not now

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.899 
probably gonna do another one not now
not<00:02:16.980> soon<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.510> I<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:19.439> make<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.189> better<00:02:20.670> than

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
not soon but I will make it better than

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.920 
not soon but I will make it better than
last<00:02:21.030> time<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> that's<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.950> top<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.750> is

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
last time so that's the top and this is

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.179 
last time so that's the top and this is
the<00:02:25.049> base<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.470> have<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> say<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.829> base<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.159> a

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
the base and I have to say the base is a

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.890 
the base and I have to say the base is a
lot<00:02:26.370> better<00:02:26.579> and<00:02:27.980> bottom<00:02:28.980> is<00:02:29.069> white<00:02:29.900> around

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
lot better and bottom is white around

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.360 
lot better and bottom is white around
the<00:02:31.049> sides<00:02:31.290> is<00:02:31.590> red<00:02:32.310> red<00:02:33.239> tissue<00:02:33.420> paper<00:02:33.750> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
the sides is red red tissue paper and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.789 
the sides is red red tissue paper and
glued<00:02:35.370> on<00:02:35.549> there<00:02:35.579> and<00:02:35.989> it's<00:02:36.989> not<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.319> I<00:02:37.560> thought

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
glued on there and it's not it I thought

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.770 
glued on there and it's not it I thought
it<00:02:37.860> would<00:02:38.010> kind<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.549> rip<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.329> it's<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.569> it's<00:02:39.750> a

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
it would kind of rip but it's not it's a

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.390 
it would kind of rip but it's not it's a
few<00:02:39.900> pretty<00:02:40.049> sturdy<00:02:40.260> on<00:02:40.470> there<00:02:40.940> so<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.269> then

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
few pretty sturdy on there so and then

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.559 
few pretty sturdy on there so and then
for<00:02:44.400> instead<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.939> curtains<00:02:45.329> on<00:02:45.540> the

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
for instead of the curtains on the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.619 
for instead of the curtains on the
Ollivanders<00:02:46.260> box<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:47.670> white<00:02:48.299> tissue<00:02:48.480> paper

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
Ollivanders box it's white tissue paper

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.750 
Ollivanders box it's white tissue paper
and<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:50.040> these<00:02:50.159> a<00:02:50.220> lot<00:02:50.310> better<00:02:50.609> because

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and I like these a lot better because

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.099 
and I like these a lot better because
they<00:02:50.970> don't<00:02:51.180> have<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.389> little<00:02:51.569> tassels<00:02:52.049> that

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
they don't have the little tassels that

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.140 
they don't have the little tassels that
fray<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.310> that's<00:02:53.579> why<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.730> did<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:53.879> like<00:02:54.000> that

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
fray so that's why I did it like that

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.640 
fray so that's why I did it like that
instead<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.569> like<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.750> ribbon<00:02:55.049> or<00:02:55.109> something<00:02:55.260> i

gettin<00:04:20.000> off<00:04:20.120> my<00:04:20.270> display<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:22.520> so<00:04:23.350> we've

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
gettin off my display and so we've

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.820 
gettin off my display and so we've
crumbs<00:04:24.710> wandered<00:04:25.160> away<00:04:26.350> using<00:04:27.350> Draco's

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
crumbs wandered away using Draco's

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:33.030 
crumbs wandered away using Draco's
because<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:28.940> a<00:04:29.150> nice<00:04:29.300> color<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:31.010> my<00:04:31.730> box<00:04:32.030> is<00:04:32.300> a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
because it's a nice color so my box is a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:39.880 
because it's a nice color so my box is a
little<00:04:34.040> bit<00:04:34.160> longer<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:36.430> wider<00:04:37.870> by<00:04:38.870> about<00:04:39.440> an

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
little bit longer and wider by about an

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.090 
little bit longer and wider by about an
inch<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:44.000> about<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.210> same<00:04:44.360> it's

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
inch and it's about the same it's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.910 
inch and it's about the same it's
brighter<00:04:46.100> doesn't<00:04:47.030> look<00:04:47.120> as<00:04:47.420> much<00:04:47.540> like<00:04:47.920> pee

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
brighter doesn't look as much like pee

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.380 
brighter doesn't look as much like pee
or<00:04:49.160> mustard<00:04:50.260> it's<00:04:51.260> more<00:04:51.440> of<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.530> vibrant<00:04:51.920> and

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
or mustard it's more of a vibrant and

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.760 
or mustard it's more of a vibrant and
nice<00:04:53.390> yellow<00:04:53.600> kind<00:04:54.200> of<00:04:54.260> like<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.410> school<00:04:54.620> bus

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
nice yellow kind of like a school bus

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.870 
nice yellow kind of like a school bus
yellow<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:57.040> so<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.190> real<00:04:58.310> reason<00:04:58.670> i<00:04:58.730> made

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
yellow and so the real reason i made

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.400 
yellow and so the real reason i made
this<00:04:59.030> ron<00:04:59.270> was<00:04:59.570> because<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> wanted<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.260> see<00:05:00.320> a

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
this ron was because I wanted to see a

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.800 
this ron was because I wanted to see a
Gregorovitch<00:05:00.950> one<00:05:01.130> box<00:05:01.370> but<00:05:01.790> that's<00:05:02.450> not<00:05:02.570> the

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
Gregorovitch one box but that's not the

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.320 
Gregorovitch one box but that's not the
only<00:05:02.840> reason<00:05:03.020> I<00:05:03.470> am<00:05:04.370> actually<00:05:04.550> going<00:05:04.970> to<00:05:05.240> be

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
only reason I am actually going to be

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.790 
only reason I am actually going to be
making<00:05:05.510> my<00:05:05.810> own<00:05:05.840> wand<00:05:06.200> I<00:05:07.960> was<00:05:08.960> not<00:05:09.440> gonna

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
making my own wand I was not gonna

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.740 
making my own wand I was not gonna
originally<00:05:10.520> do<00:05:10.640> this<00:05:10.820> but<00:05:11.330> I've<00:05:11.630> been

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
originally do this but I've been

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.270 
originally do this but I've been
inspired<00:05:12.080> by<00:05:12.380> some<00:05:12.650> of<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:12.800> people<00:05:13.160> who've

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
inspired by some of the people who've

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.440 
inspired by some of the people who've
done<00:05:13.430> made<00:05:13.940> their<00:05:14.120> own<00:05:14.150> ones<00:05:14.390> and<00:05:16.450> originally

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
done made their own ones and originally

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:18.790 
done made their own ones and originally
when<00:05:17.570> I<00:05:17.600> started<00:05:17.840> collecting<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.290> wands<00:05:18.650> my

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
when I started collecting the wands my

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.330 
when I started collecting the wands my
dad<00:05:18.950> wanted<00:05:19.280> me<00:05:19.400> to<00:05:19.460> make<00:05:19.640> my<00:05:19.760> own<00:05:19.790> instead<00:05:20.330> of

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
dad wanted me to make my own instead of

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.310 
dad wanted me to make my own instead of
buy<00:05:22.340> them<00:05:22.580> but<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:22.880> told<00:05:23.120> him<00:05:23.180> I'd<00:05:23.360> rather<00:05:23.690> get

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
buy them but I told him I'd rather get

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.400 
buy them but I told him I'd rather get
the<00:05:24.440> official<00:05:24.800> wands<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.510> he<00:05:27.050> was<00:05:27.170> cool<00:05:27.380> with

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
the official wands so he was cool with

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.290 
the official wands so he was cool with
that<00:05:27.590> but<00:05:28.520> then<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.860> kind<00:05:31.640> of<00:05:31.670> decided<00:05:31.790> on<00:05:32.180> my

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
that but then I kind of decided on my

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.990 
that but then I kind of decided on my
own<00:05:32.450> and<00:05:32.780> I<00:05:33.230> have<00:05:33.410> a<00:05:33.550> rough<00:05:34.550> idea<00:05:34.640> of<00:05:34.850> what<00:05:34.940> I

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
own and I have a rough idea of what I

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.610 
own and I have a rough idea of what I
want<00:05:35.090> it<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.330> look<00:05:35.480> like<00:05:35.540> so<00:05:35.960> maybe<00:05:36.380> I'll<00:05:36.530> make

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
want it to look like so maybe I'll make

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.720 
want it to look like so maybe I'll make
a<00:05:36.680> sketch<00:05:36.920> of<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.160> and<00:05:37.280> show<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.520> you<00:05:37.610> guys

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
a sketch of that and show it to you guys

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.700 
a sketch of that and show it to you guys
before<00:05:37.880> actually<00:05:38.330> make<00:05:38.480> it<00:05:38.650> probably<00:05:39.650> not

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
before actually make it probably not

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.560 
before actually make it probably not
going<00:05:39.830> to<00:05:39.890> be<00:05:39.950> for<00:05:40.130> a<00:05:40.190> while<00:05:41.140> so<00:05:43.300> that's<00:05:44.300> that

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
going to be for a while so that's that

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:51.450 
going to be for a while so that's that
and<00:05:44.920> oh<00:05:47.800> one<00:05:48.800> more<00:05:48.920> thing<00:05:48.980> before<00:05:49.460> I<00:05:49.700> go<00:05:49.760> so<00:05:50.600> uh

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
and oh one more thing before I go so uh

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.720 
and oh one more thing before I go so uh
I<00:05:52.460> guess<00:05:53.350> if<00:05:54.350> somebody<00:05:54.830> wants<00:05:55.130> me<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.340> make<00:05:55.520> one

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
I guess if somebody wants me to make one

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.130 
I guess if somebody wants me to make one
of<00:05:55.760> these<00:05:55.940> for<00:05:56.000> them<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.480> will<00:05:56.600> look<00:05:56.960> better

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
of these for them it will look better

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.190 
of these for them it will look better
than<00:05:57.320> mine<00:05:57.500> if<00:05:58.160> somebody<00:05:59.120> wants<00:05:59.480> big<00:05:59.900> reward

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
than mine if somebody wants big reward

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.940 
than mine if somebody wants big reward
each<00:06:00.350> one<00:06:00.530> box<00:06:00.740> like<00:06:00.920> I<00:06:00.980> mean<00:06:01.160> I<00:06:02.950> would

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
each one box like I mean I would

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:05.710 
each one box like I mean I would
probably<00:06:04.400> be<00:06:04.730> willing<00:06:05.120> to<00:06:05.210> do<00:06:05.330> that<00:06:05.450> for<00:06:05.510> them

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
probably be willing to do that for them

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.040 
probably be willing to do that for them
and<00:06:05.920> give<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:07.070> them<00:06:07.220> and<00:06:07.720> send<00:06:08.720> it<00:06:08.810> to<00:06:08.930> them

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
and give to them and send it to them

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.360 
and give to them and send it to them
most<00:06:09.800> likely<00:06:10.040> so<00:06:10.970> if<00:06:11.330> you<00:06:11.810> do<00:06:12.770> we<00:06:12.950> want<00:06:13.160> one

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
most likely so if you do we want one

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.200 
most likely so if you do we want one
then<00:06:13.670> message<00:06:14.330> me<00:06:14.510> or<00:06:14.990> it<00:06:15.290> comment<00:06:15.710> and<00:06:16.210> I'll

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
then message me or it comment and I'll

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.060 
then message me or it comment and I'll
see<00:06:17.270> if<00:06:17.660> I'll<00:06:17.840> do<00:06:18.140> it<00:06:18.290> I'm<00:06:18.410> not<00:06:18.590> positive<00:06:18.800> yet

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
see if I'll do it I'm not positive yet

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.190 
see if I'll do it I'm not positive yet
so<00:06:19.400> don't<00:06:19.790> hold<00:06:19.910> me<00:06:20.060> to<00:06:20.090> it<00:06:20.240> but<00:06:20.960> if<00:06:21.050> you'd<00:06:21.170> like

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200
