00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.760
 written to fael lima beauty 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.470
 he made a request here on the channel and 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.880
 Hey, how's it going? 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.050
 make a video showing how to activate the 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.780
 regime entered 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.940
 Stay with God so I decided to ask 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.280
 meeting his request because the writing and 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.180
 A little while is always commenting. 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.520
 in the videos 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.920
 so that's why I decided I was answering 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.280
 This request for it is okay, I'll leave it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.620

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 program do good and I'll be right back 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 hage recalled a tool created to 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.430
 correct errors and delete entries 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.469
 invalidated the windows registry to 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.360
 over our use of the computer 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.100
 installing and removing programs 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.780
 creation of user accounts in the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.390
 system among many other activities 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.920
 end up breaking files leaving a 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.810
 lot of waste database 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.220

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.509
 operational system 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.160
 so the operating system can 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.410
 fail and slow down 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.810
 due to the need to read content 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.360
 which are already completely useless doing 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.220
 a cleaning this session the redd that 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.710
