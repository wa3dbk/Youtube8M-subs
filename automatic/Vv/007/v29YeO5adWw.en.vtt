move you can also put your guy in the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
move you can also put your guy in the
front<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.020> surveillance<00:00:49.350> unit<00:00:49.829> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
front to have the surveillance unit and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.689 
front to have the surveillance unit and
the<00:00:50.730> top<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> jet<00:00:51.449> flips<00:00:51.780> off<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the top of the jet flips off so this is

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.880 
the top of the jet flips off so this is
the<00:00:53.789> outer<00:00:53.940> box<00:00:54.270> let's<00:00:54.690> get<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.260> inner<00:00:55.530> box

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the outer box let's get to the inner box

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.779 
the outer box let's get to the inner box
and<00:00:56.699> actually<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:58.020> inner<00:00:58.320> box<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> puzzle

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and actually this inner box is a puzzle

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
and actually this inner box is a puzzle
on<00:00:59.910> itself<00:01:00.359> because<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.050> by<00:01:01.410> far<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> most

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
on itself because it's by far the most

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.039 
on itself because it's by far the most
complex<00:01:02.370> inner<00:01:02.670> box<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> mosque<00:01:03.629> item<00:01:03.930> I've

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
seen for some extra stuff that is given

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.500 
seen for some extra stuff that is given
with<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.290> item<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.760> an<00:01:08.850> instruction<00:01:09.390> on

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
with the item this is an instruction on

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.750 
with the item this is an instruction on
how<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:10.110> off<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> sides<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> car<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
how to take off the sides of the car if

how to take off the sides of the car if
you<00:01:11.880> can't<00:01:12.119> close<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.470> problem

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you can't close it because the problem

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.070 
you can't close it because the problem
with<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.040> one<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.310> if<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.299> play<00:01:15.509> too<00:01:15.570> rough

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
if you deform the plastic it just won't

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.899 
if you deform the plastic it just won't
close<00:01:20.640> again<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> dysfunctional

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
close again and you have a dysfunctional

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.249 
close again and you have a dysfunctional
vehicle<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.560> one<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.280> sticker<00:01:26.880> leaf

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
brand-spanking-new white and this is

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.379 
brand-spanking-new white and this is
actually<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.359> fifth<00:02:21.959> or<00:02:22.200> sixth<00:02:23.269> version<00:02:24.269> of

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.740 
slingshot I have and only the first to
be<00:02:26.489> really<00:02:27.359> really<00:02:27.989> white<00:02:28.379> instead<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.920> brown

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
be really really white instead of brown

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.640 
be really really white instead of brown
so<00:02:30.750> it's<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.650> van<00:02:32.299> that's<00:02:33.299> pretty<00:02:33.569> much<00:02:33.689> it<00:02:33.870> it

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so it's a van that's pretty much it it

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.020 
so it's a van that's pretty much it it
doesn't<00:02:34.920> look<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.219> like<00:02:35.609> much<00:02:35.819> on<00:02:35.969> the

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.619 
and it's really a flat bomb quite it
kind<00:03:59.009> of<00:03:59.040> strange<00:03:59.370> football<00:03:59.819> doesn't<00:04:00.359> look

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
kind of strange football doesn't look

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.709

like<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> bomb<00:04:01.259> to<00:04:01.290> me<00:04:01.969> so<00:04:02.969> we<00:04:03.090> click<00:04:03.299> that<00:04:03.449> back

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719 
like a bomb to me so we click that back

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:07.640 
like a bomb to me so we click that back
on<00:04:03.900> there<00:04:05.540> I'm<00:04:06.540> putting<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.169> on<00:04:07.259> the<00:04:07.469> wrong

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.759 
on there I'm putting it on the wrong
side<00:04:08.040> probably<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.109> to<00:04:10.229> put<00:04:10.469> the<00:04:10.620> little

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
side probably you have to put the little

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.119 
side probably you have to put the little
anchors<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.579> the<00:04:11.699> back<00:04:11.879> in<00:04:12.030> there<00:04:12.799> so<00:04:13.799> this<00:04:14.009> is

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
anchors on the back in there so this is

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:17.120 
anchors on the back in there so this is
the<00:04:14.189> jet<00:04:14.430> fighter<00:04:14.669> plane<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.959> when<00:04:16.709> we<00:04:16.799> open
