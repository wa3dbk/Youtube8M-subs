00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.930
Hi, I'm Claudia, from "Ideas para Regalos", the hazregalos.com's blog.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.500
Here we are, on holidays,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.300
in the first 2012 video,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.300
with an idea to a gift,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.100
a gift for a friend.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.350
I'm going to show you what it is.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.500
The last year, some friends gave me this soap,

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.950
look, it seems that it has letters floating on it.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.100
It seemed pretty creative

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.500
and I made one,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.700
with foam bath, in this case, with a phrase so you can give somebody.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.200
The original thing is, precisely, the phrase you put inside it,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.350
that our friends will read while they're using this soap or shampoo.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.050
We can even take an old container (not a new one, I mean)

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.550
of any liquid,

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.100
one that, even is colored, may let us see through it.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.900
So, let's see the materials.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.900
We'll see that it's very easy and fast to do.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.300
We need, first, the container that we've chosen,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.400
I've bought those ones.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.900
You can get it everywhere,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.990
very cheap and on different sizes,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.390
with its cap, etc.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.100
That what we want to fill it,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.400
as I said, this is foam bath.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.900
I looked for a pink color because I'll give it to a friend.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.800
Then we need something to decorate jar,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.690
it can be raffia,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.800
some ribbon, satin ribbon,

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.600
whatever we want to use.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.850
We have to print the phrase

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.100
with transparency.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.300
I let you those ones on the blog so you can donwload.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.200
Obviously, you can use your own ideas.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.300
You must measure the jar

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.200
and take off 1cm so it can fit.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.950
This transparencies can be printed in almost everywhere where there is a photocopier,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.050
if you don't want to print it, you can get this sheet,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.200
that is transparent and it's sold on A4,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.050
then you write the phrase with a permanent marker.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.850
We also need scissors.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.700
I'll show you how it's made.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.600
First we have to cut the phrase on the transparency,

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.600
as I said, I've measured it

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.050
and I've cutted it 0,5cm smaller, width and lenght,

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.850
so it is smaller than the jar,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.100
this way it doesn't folds and fits.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.000
So, we cut.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.800
Take care of cut every edge

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.700
so the floating effect looks good.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.700
Now we fill the jar.

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.500
I'm using a napkin to avoid staining.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.700
If there's a bubble,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:12.900
don't worry, every bubble goes away.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.900
I'm filling it to the top.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.700
As we see, the last bubble goes away.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.700
We can remove a little bit of it.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.700
That's it.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.100
Now, we take the transparency,

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:50.850
we coil it,

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.800
carefully, avoiding a fold.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.200
Like this. We put it in.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.300
I use this sticks to uncoil the transparency,

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.200
paying attention to it fits.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.500
Let's put it in the center.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.800
As you see, the phrase can be read,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.090
better like this.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.050
Now we cover it,

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.850
and decore it.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.000
I'm going to use only the raffia.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.050
I've looked for phrases about friendship,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.050
may be one that just you and your friend understands.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.950
The mine one is: "To make you look so beautiful in the outside as you are inside".

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.850
As this is for her grooming, the quote is good.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.050
It's over,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.850
look how fast it is.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.850
We have this two, and this one they gave me.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:22.950
Also is a good idea to buy a container, remove the mark and use it.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.950
Hope you liked it and see you!

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.950
