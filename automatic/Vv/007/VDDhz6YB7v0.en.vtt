Basil's hard to find if it's not August
so<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> could<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.160> baby<00:00:44.460> spinach<00:00:44.850> or<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.690> you

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
so you could use baby spinach or if you

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.440 
so you could use baby spinach or if you
live<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:45.960> Asia<00:00:46.200> like<00:00:46.440> me<00:00:46.620> some<00:00:46.980> octroi<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:48.000> just

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
live in Asia like me some octroi I just

00:00:48.450 --> 00:01:14.130 
live in Asia like me some octroi I just
want<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> leafy<00:00:49.170> part<00:00:49.440> okay<00:00:49.980> let's<00:00:50.430> go

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.990 

you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.320 

you

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.780 

so<00:01:24.870> here's<00:01:25.410> where<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:26.070> vary<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.550> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so here's where I really vary from the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.450 
so here's where I really vary from the
norm<00:01:27.110> pesto<00:01:28.110> traditionally<00:01:28.740> has<00:01:28.920> Parmesan

norm pesto traditionally has Parmesan

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
norm pesto traditionally has Parmesan
cheese<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.720> eliminate<00:01:31.410> the<00:01:31.440> cheese<00:01:31.830> just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
cheese if you eliminate the cheese just

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520

to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.550> vegan<00:01:32.760> it<00:01:33.210> loses<00:01:33.690> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:34.080> extra

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to be vegan it loses a little extra

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.290 
to be vegan it loses a little extra
punch<00:01:34.740> there's<00:01:35.130> definitely<00:01:35.610> something<00:01:36.060> still

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
punch there's definitely something still

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.110 
punch there's definitely something still
missing<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.020> seen<00:01:37.920> other<00:01:38.130> vegan<00:01:38.490> recipes

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
now I realized that no two cheeses are
created<00:01:48.330> equally<00:01:48.690> parmesan<00:01:49.410> is<00:01:49.740> not<00:01:50.070> ricotta

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
created equally parmesan is not ricotta

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.520 
created equally parmesan is not ricotta
cheese<00:01:50.760> but<00:01:51.480> if<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.930> put<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> ricotta

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
cheese but if you put a ricotta
