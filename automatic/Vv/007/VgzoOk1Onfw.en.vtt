succeed he's got the edge box on here

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.100 
succeed he's got the edge box on here
so<00:00:32.820> what<00:00:33.000> guys<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.390> do<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.600> they'll<00:00:33.750> put<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
so what guys will do is they'll put that

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.000 
so what guys will do is they'll put that
on<00:00:34.260> they're<00:00:34.440> looking<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:34.890> additional

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
on they're looking for additional

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.670 
on they're looking for additional
horsepower<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.510> what<00:00:37.020> happens<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.559> they

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
horsepower and for what happens is they

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.920 
horsepower and for what happens is they
put<00:00:37.890> more<00:00:38.040> fueling<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.610> there<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.180> egt<00:00:39.660> is<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
put more fueling in there the egt is the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.660 
put more fueling in there the egt is the
way<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.530> gets<00:00:40.680> dangerous<00:00:40.890> for<00:00:41.340> operating

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
way up it gets dangerous for operating

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.490 
way up it gets dangerous for operating
the<00:00:41.790> rona<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.660> water<00:00:42.840> methanol<00:00:43.260> does

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the rona but the water methanol does

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
the rona but the water methanol does
it's<00:00:43.739> gonna<00:00:43.920> cool<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.460> Inlet<00:00:44.789> air<00:00:45.000> charge

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
it's gonna cool that Inlet air charge

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
it's gonna cool that Inlet air charge
down<00:00:45.600> significantly<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.129> been<00:00:47.250> results

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
down significantly and it's been results

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
down significantly and it's been results
in<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> more<00:00:48.000> complete<00:00:48.420> fuel<00:00:48.719> burn<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
in a more complete fuel burn so it

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.100 
in a more complete fuel burn so it
translates<00:00:50.219> into<00:00:50.399> cooler<00:00:51.120> temperatures<00:00:51.660> drop

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
translates into cooler temperatures drop

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.279 
translates into cooler temperatures drop
down<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.440> GT<00:00:52.980> an<00:00:53.280> additional<00:00:54.210> horsepower<00:00:54.660> so

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
down a GT an additional horsepower so

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.510 
down a GT an additional horsepower so
additional<00:00:55.710> horse<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.039> argue<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.340> better

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
additional horse I argue is better

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
additional horse I argue is better
mileage<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> track<00:00:57.629> Wow

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
mileage that is track Wow

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.010 
mileage that is track Wow
now<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.829> said<00:00:59.280> water<00:00:59.969> ethanol<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
now you said water ethanol so it's a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
now you said water ethanol so it's a
mixture<00:01:01.379> yeah<00:01:02.010> most<00:01:02.309> guys<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:02.789> run<00:01:03.000> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
mixture yeah most guys will run a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.170 
mixture yeah most guys will run a
mixture<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> 50:50<00:01:04.920> water<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.369> methanol<00:01:05.760> and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
mixture of 50:50 water and methanol and

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
mixture of 50:50 water and methanol and
that<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.479> good<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.840> about<00:01:06.960> 50<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.500> 70<00:01:07.890> horses

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that is good for about 50 to 70 horses

we'll<00:01:36.270> probably<00:01:36.299> start<00:01:36.720> out<00:01:36.930> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.259> tank

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
we'll probably start out with the tank

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
we'll probably start out with the tank
install<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.960> what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
install in the in the back that's what

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.050 
install in the in the back that's what
we've<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> 6<00:01:40.920> gallon<00:01:41.100> ethanol<00:01:41.670> tank<00:01:41.939> -

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
we've got as a 6 gallon ethanol tank -

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.719 
we've got as a 6 gallon ethanol tank -
the<00:01:42.180> diesel<00:01:42.509> system<00:01:43.189> that<00:01:44.189> gives<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.610> some

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the diesel system that gives just some

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.920 
the diesel system that gives just some
good<00:01:44.909> range<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.360> good<00:01:45.540> pulling<00:01:45.810> capacity

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
good range and good pulling capacity

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.030 
good range and good pulling capacity
all<00:01:48.930> right<00:01:49.050> what's<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.350> first<00:01:49.530> thing<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.800> do

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
all right what's the first thing we do

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.580 
all right what's the first thing we do
we're<00:01:50.190> gonna<00:01:50.250> drill<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> hole<00:01:51.000> let's<00:01:51.240> enter<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
we're gonna drill a hole let's enter the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
we're gonna drill a hole let's enter the
hole<00:01:52.770> enough<00:01:53.160> in<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> bed<00:01:53.820> for<00:01:54.360> a<00:01:54.660> while<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
hole enough in the bed for a while the

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.800 
hole enough in the bed for a while the
fuel<00:01:55.200> line<00:01:55.670> access<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.940> tank<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:57.450> run<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.720> up

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
fuel line access the tank and run it up

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.620 
fuel line access the tank and run it up
and<00:01:57.840> rolled<00:01:58.620> it<00:01:58.740> again<00:01:58.980> okay<00:01:59.610> then<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.000> drill<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and rolled it again okay then we drill a

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.710 
and rolled it again okay then we drill a
7/8<00:02:01.200> hole<00:02:01.470> in<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.800> tank<00:02:02.040> itself<00:02:02.690> that<00:02:03.690> allows

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
7/8 hole in the tank itself that allows

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.500 
7/8 hole in the tank itself that allows
us<00:02:03.960> we<00:02:04.290> got<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> slick<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.950> tap<00:02:05.310> there

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
us we got a slick little tap there

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.120 
us we got a slick little tap there
love<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> guy<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.680> wherever<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.100> want

love the guy to put it wherever you want
silicate<00:02:09.000> install<00:02:09.480> it<00:02:10.230> is<00:02:10.350> Titan<00:02:10.740> or<00:02:10.800> not<00:02:11.010> once

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
silicate install it is Titan or not once

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.830 
silicate install it is Titan or not once
you<00:02:11.370> put<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.670> fitting<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.240> hole<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> then

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
you put the fitting in the hole and then

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.700 
you put the fitting in the hole and then
good<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.320> go

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
good to go

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.710 
good to go
okay<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:14.130> we've<00:02:14.400> installed<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.210> tank<00:02:15.480> right

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
okay so we've installed the tank right

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.690 
okay so we've installed the tank right
there<00:02:15.750> we've<00:02:16.410> run<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:16.860> fuel<00:02:17.010> line<00:02:17.280> up<00:02:17.490> through

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
there we've run the fuel line up through

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.100 
there we've run the fuel line up through
the<00:02:17.790> hole<00:02:17.970> that<00:02:18.150> we<00:02:18.270> pre-drilled<00:02:18.780> now<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
the hole that we pre-drilled now it's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.750 
the hole that we pre-drilled now it's
going<00:02:19.320> into<00:02:19.530> a<00:02:19.560> pump<00:02:19.860> yeah<00:02:20.370> that's<00:02:20.580> correct

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
going into a pump yeah that's correct

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.700 
going into a pump yeah that's correct
this<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.630> fuel<00:02:21.930> pump<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.290> used<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
this is the fuel pump we used in the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.160 
this is the fuel pump we used in the
system<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.340> capable<00:02:23.520> of<00:02:23.820> making<00:02:24.000> up<00:02:24.270> 250

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
system so it's capable of making up 250

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.410 
system so it's capable of making up 250
psi<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.370> higher<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.760> pressure<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.150> better

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
psi so higher the pressure the better

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210 
psi so higher the pressure the better
atomization<00:02:27.870> is<00:02:28.260> gonna<00:02:28.440> get<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.920> we're<00:02:29.070> we're

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
atomization is gonna get and we're we're

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.560 
atomization is gonna get and we're we're
gonna<00:02:29.310> mount<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.240> gonna<00:02:30.390> mount

track<00:03:10.970> from<00:03:11.970> there<00:03:12.209> once<00:03:12.989> we<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.200> those<00:03:13.320> guys

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
track from there once we get those guys

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.110 
track from there once we get those guys
installed<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.190> just<00:03:14.310> connect<00:03:14.610> off<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.910> brain

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
installed and just connect off the brain

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.590 
installed and just connect off the brain
box<00:03:15.390> then<00:03:15.720> you're<00:03:16.290> good<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.440> go<00:03:17.360> alright<00:03:18.360> next

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
box then you're good to go alright next

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.270 
box then you're good to go alright next
it<00:03:18.780> looks<00:03:18.930> like<00:03:19.110> you've<00:03:19.620> got<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.830> all<00:03:19.950> drilled

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
it looks like you've got it all drilled

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.520 
it looks like you've got it all drilled
and<00:03:20.430> tapped<00:03:20.489> then<00:03:21.060> you've<00:03:21.270> inserted<00:03:21.780> three

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
and tapped then you've inserted three

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.229 
and tapped then you've inserted three
different<00:03:22.860> things<00:03:23.040> there<00:03:23.220> after<00:03:23.459> tapping<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
different things there after tapping and

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.330 
different things there after tapping and
now<00:03:24.450> we're<00:03:24.660> gonna<00:03:24.810> put<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.650> intake<00:03:25.950> back<00:03:26.130> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
now we're gonna put the intake back on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.090 
now we're gonna put the intake back on
yeah<00:03:26.850> that's<00:03:27.120> correct<00:03:27.330> we've<00:03:27.540> got<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:28.100> an

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
yeah that's correct we've got the an

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.979 
yeah that's correct we've got the an
amazing<00:03:29.640> spray<00:03:29.910> nozzles<00:03:30.360> right<00:03:30.510> on<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.750> back

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
amazing spray nozzles right on the back

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.080 
amazing spray nozzles right on the back
we<00:03:31.800> got<00:03:31.920> an<00:03:32.010> active<00:03:32.310> fitting<00:03:32.610> in<00:03:32.700> there<00:03:32.910> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
we got an active fitting in there so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.300 
we got an active fitting in there so
it's<00:03:33.209> big<00:03:33.420> boost<00:03:33.660> pressure<00:03:33.959> off<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.830> manifold

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
it's big boost pressure off the manifold

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's big boost pressure off the manifold
we're<00:03:35.850> gonna<00:03:35.970> get<00:03:36.120> this<00:03:36.330> bolted<00:03:36.780> down<00:03:36.959> and

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
we're gonna get this bolted down and

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.580 
we're gonna get this bolted down and
then<00:03:37.680> next<00:03:37.860> we'll<00:03:38.070> connect<00:03:38.340> up<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:38.610> solenoid

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
then next we'll connect up the solenoid

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.930 
then next we'll connect up the solenoid
fluid<00:03:40.590> control<00:03:40.980> wire<00:03:41.610> them<00:03:41.850> up<00:03:41.910> to<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
fluid control wire them up to the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.600 
fluid control wire them up to the
both<00:03:43.660> signals<00:03:44.080> of<00:03:44.230> our<00:03:44.620> brain<00:03:44.890> box<00:03:45.130> right<00:03:45.400> here

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
both signals of our brain box right here

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.730 
both signals of our brain box right here
now<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.450> next<00:03:46.750> thing<00:03:46.870> we<00:03:46.990> have<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.260> do<00:03:47.410> is

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
now the next thing we have to do is

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:49.680 
now the next thing we have to do is
bring<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.460> fuel<00:03:48.700> into<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.030> solenoid<00:03:49.450> right

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
bring the fuel into the solenoid right

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.330 
bring the fuel into the solenoid right
yeah<00:03:50.140> that's<00:03:50.380> correct<00:03:50.560> we<00:03:50.830> got<00:03:50.950> this<00:03:51.100> line

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
yeah that's correct we got this line

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.220 
yeah that's correct we got this line
right<00:03:51.550> here<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:52.030> mean<00:03:52.360> use<00:03:52.480> all<00:03:52.600> these<00:03:52.720> push<00:03:53.020> to

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
right here I mean use all these push to

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.500 
right here I mean use all these push to
lock<00:03:53.410> fittings<00:03:53.880> makes<00:03:54.880> it<00:03:55.000> real<00:03:55.120> quick<00:03:55.360> and

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
lock fittings makes it real quick and

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.390 
lock fittings makes it real quick and
easy<00:03:55.600> so<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.170> pores<00:03:56.470> are<00:03:56.800> labeled<00:03:57.070> in<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.310> out

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
easy so the pores are labeled in and out

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.880 
easy so the pores are labeled in and out
is<00:03:57.640> your<00:03:57.790> flow<00:03:57.970> direction<00:03:58.480> you<00:03:59.350> just<00:03:59.380> push<00:03:59.740> it

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
is your flow direction you just push it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.090 
is your flow direction you just push it
in<00:04:00.010> and<00:04:00.520> it's<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:00.940> there<00:04:01.120> so<00:04:02.080> nice<00:04:02.320> quick<00:04:02.680> easy
