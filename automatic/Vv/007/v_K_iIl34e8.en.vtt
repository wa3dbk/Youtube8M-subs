00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.810
 in the ecosystem of crops there are pathogenic and beneficial microorganisms 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.539
 the indiscriminate use of chemicals causes an imbalance of the conditions of the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:19.180
 soil thus digital speed and to an advantage the pathogens the gene Ã¡lava 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.170
 thus they have novel ways of combating the foliar pathogens that 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.210
 face the resistance because they eat with conventional chemicals also we 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.660
 cause so says it means good toxicity 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.830
 help correct the pH of the floors 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.720
 it is true that black caused by the fungus mycosphaerella fijiensis is the main 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.650
 plague of banana cultivation 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.890
 two families easily spread different surfaces attacking the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.270
 plant once the spores of the pathogen land on the leaf in account 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.100
 the conditions to germinate 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.470
 and enter through the were more to infect the plant 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.400
 Infected leaves begin henestrus, weakening the plant 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.180
 reducing the productivity of it and acting as a factor of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.820
 multiplication of the beach 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.130
 This can be prevented by custom script of five 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.510
 custom bike opel 5 12 ago or genre bacillus which is proven to be 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.800
 a multifunctional tool in phytosanitary programs can be 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.450
 mix the spores with extremist fungicides to be applied in 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.700
 rotation for organic crops to increase application coverage 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.240
 prevent the creation of resistances and improve the effectiveness of custom control 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.580
 saw parade with whom five strains of genus bacillus 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.940
 deciles use basile but sports 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.810
 I gave up Californias 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.230
 the actions of apple 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.560
 went without studies so it is negative can prevent infections through the 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.260
 competitive exhibition which means that they occupy space the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.210
 surface of the leaves 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.850
 Hallways used in metabolites that are toxic to pathogenic friends 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.340
 and produce antimicrobial theatines which help protect plants 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 in the case of encountering pathogenic bacteria 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.140
 so that the bulls induce the plant to protect itself which 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.470
 Potentiates fumigation by preventing spores of the pathogen from 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.019
 minimize is the systemic input enters destroy the infection already established 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.319
 some frosts produced by inaccuracies so the pupils who 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.609
 neighbors and that we have mainly the Japanese takeo casal group and its 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.469
 cellular that is the rupture of the membrane of the daughter of the comedian 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.059
 pathogen 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:39.189
 produce medicines that destabilize the growth of the transition the 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.429
 natural protection of the crop 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:47.589
 just one day before 5 conventional crops are mixed volcanic in 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:48.679
