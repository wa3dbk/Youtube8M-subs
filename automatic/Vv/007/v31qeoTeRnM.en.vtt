following the installation of the new

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.810 
following the installation of the new
part<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.110> try<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> keep<00:01:04.530> them<00:01:04.680> intact<00:01:04.979> if

part so try to keep them intact if

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
part so try to keep them intact if
necessary<00:01:06.510> however<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.229> fine<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> use

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
necessary however it's fine to use

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.340 
necessary however it's fine to use
standard<00:01:08.190> electrical<00:01:08.670> tape<00:01:09.170> here's<00:01:10.170> where

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
standard electrical tape here's where

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
standard electrical tape here's where
the<00:01:10.440> part<00:01:10.710> unplugs<00:01:11.300> however<00:01:12.300> we<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> piece

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the part unplugs however we have a piece

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.859 
the part unplugs however we have a piece
of<00:01:12.810> tape<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.410> wraps<00:01:13.680> around<00:01:13.860> this<00:01:14.280> port<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
of tape that wraps around this port and

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.790 
of tape that wraps around this port and
prevents<00:01:15.869> us<00:01:15.960> from<00:01:15.990> unplugging<00:01:16.470> at<00:01:16.650> this

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
prevents us from unplugging at this

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.490 
prevents us from unplugging at this
point<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> we'll<00:01:18.300> need<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.450> splice<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.050> tape

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
point so we'll need to splice the tape

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.490 
point so we'll need to splice the tape
on<00:01:19.560> both<00:01:20.310> sides<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.910> shown<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.300> video<00:01:21.540> in

on both sides as shown in the video in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.550 
on both sides as shown in the video in
order<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.860> allow<00:01:23.070> us<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.310> unplug<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.219 

after<00:01:33.310> having<00:01:33.430> splice<00:01:33.820> a<00:01:33.850> tape<00:01:34.210> we'll<00:01:35.049> be<00:01:35.140> able

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
after having splice a tape we'll be able

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.930 
after having splice a tape we'll be able
to<00:01:35.320> unplug<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.830> cable<00:01:36.280> from<00:01:36.369> the<00:01:36.490> port<00:01:36.760> as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
to unplug the cable from the port as

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:50.359 
to unplug the cable from the port as
shown<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.510> the<00:01:37.659> video
