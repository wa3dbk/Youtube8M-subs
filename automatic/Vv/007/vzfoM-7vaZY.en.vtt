00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.649
 I understand that I'll be waiting in the future 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.080
 Dry sale 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.749
 broadcast 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.159
 US newspaper coverage 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.159
 Released 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:24.019
 I will Toyota 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.830
 US Hawaii 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.270
 Really beautiful 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.379
 It seems to be a traditional vegetable like a bit different 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.350
 The hit is easy to see in Hachiman City. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.440
 After taking light and water costs 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.700
 Men are you 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.940
 Here is an interesting point 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.000
 It is a trick, though 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.690
 Close 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 The entertainment world debut so it is three Bali 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.390
 In the meantime, African Madagascar 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.400
 It is under development like 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.140
 Moe factory 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.490
 The raft is not too far in the water depth and there are too many good flows 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.050
 Because there is not 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.340
 It's okay if it's a kaminishi 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.910
 355 large ball from the predecessor school 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.220
 I am using a team today 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.490
 It's closed but it's because today it is this 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.040
 Okuyama was good, but good place 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.040
 Though there are various from last month 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.290
 First of all, let's finish under the umbrella of 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.430
 This is the most basic and third generation 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.090
 Go to the karaoke shop alone 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.450
 The city is not delicious 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.980
 Even though I miss it most 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.480
 Depending on the location, there is a building. 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.490
 so 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 I think it is better to use different 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 First of all 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.139
 Lower it to Mr. Wakao to make it easy to see the thread 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.909
 You will hear it unexpectedly early 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.329
 As we enter river and are near the bottom 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.419
 Mr. there 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:18.779
 To be central 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.329
 I'm going to take food for Akamine 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.069
 I think there will be seven days 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.979
 Within the same agency 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.979
 Because it is a signboard of the recent employee dormitory 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.369
 Even small turbines fit 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.859
 There is another big Atari, but it is small outside 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.859
 Because it was 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.539
 It had a long-awaited effect 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 It feels like the parade also caught food 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.439
 I told you when I took up a little bit 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.999
 It may be isolated, so it is a good idea to raise it a bit 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:02:59.999
 Two ways 

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.509
 However, because default was taken 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.749
 I was protected 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.299
 I'm free 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.139
 This observation is 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.209
 That is as you see 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.209
 The key is whether it is spread and can be done inside 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:41.449
 Mother turns to service 2ks 

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:44.449
 The other one uses Krill 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:07.729
 Do it 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.089
 The chief director is Inter Milan 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.089
 It is natural for 199 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.000
 I wanted something a little different but it was similar 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.919
 There 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.919
 2 days maintained 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.139
 Clam 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:30.880
 It was tight
