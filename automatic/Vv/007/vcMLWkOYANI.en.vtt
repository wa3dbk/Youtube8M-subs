the best style so I said okay what am I
to<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:51.000> I'm<00:02:51.150> gonna<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.420> take<00:02:52.380> this

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
to do I think I'm gonna just take this

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.050 
to do I think I'm gonna just take this
hair<00:02:53.040> right<00:02:53.070> here<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:55.709> majority<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
hair right here the majority of it and

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.100 
hair right here the majority of it and
I'm<00:02:57.180> probably<00:02:57.420> gonna<00:02:58.340> swoop<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.700> to<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> side

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
I'm probably gonna swoop it to the side

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.170 
I'm probably gonna swoop it to the side
so<00:03:01.880> like<00:03:02.880> that<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:04.100> probably<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.760> know<00:03:05.880> I'm<00:03:06.150> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
so like that and probably you know I'm a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.630 
so like that and probably you know I'm a
behind<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.840> ear<00:03:06.930> kind<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.650> chick<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.220> don't

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
behind the ear kind of chick I don't

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.520 
behind the ear kind of chick I don't
have<00:03:08.730> no<00:03:08.880> earrings<00:03:09.270> right<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:09.959> no<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:10.140> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
have no earrings right now no but I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.410 
have no earrings right now no but I
pretty<00:03:11.040> much<00:03:11.160> like<00:03:11.580> things<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:12.030> little<00:03:12.150> bit

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
pretty much like things a little bit

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.850 
pretty much like things a little bit
behind<00:03:12.630> the<00:03:12.990> ear<00:03:14.480> so<00:03:15.480> yes<00:03:15.780> I'll<00:03:16.110> probably<00:03:16.320> do

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
behind the ear so yes I'll probably do

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.460 
behind the ear so yes I'll probably do
something<00:03:17.190> like<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.300> think<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.080> gives<00:03:19.230> it

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
something like that I think it gives it

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.479 
something like that I think it gives it
a<00:03:19.560> different<00:03:19.769> look<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.370> like<00:03:20.880> it<00:03:21.120> better<00:03:22.070> yeah<00:03:23.070> I

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
a different look I like it better yeah I

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.430 
a different look I like it better yeah I
think<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.880> like<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.090> better<00:03:24.239> like<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.930> or<00:03:25.260> you

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
think I like it better like this or you

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.830 
think I like it better like this or you
know<00:03:25.560> maybe<00:03:25.769> Aliyah<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:27.269> first
