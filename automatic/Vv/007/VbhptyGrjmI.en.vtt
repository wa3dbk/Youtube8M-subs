00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
of the structure but little did I know

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.010 
of the structure but little did I know
that<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.650> fire<00:01:02.890> had<00:01:03.220> weakened<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.210> main

of the building were unaware of the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.000 
of the building were unaware of the

growing danger facing the men inside the

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.630 
growing danger facing the men inside the
structure<00:01:13.650> once<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:14.800> knew<00:01:14.950> that<00:01:14.979> the<00:01:15.220> roof<00:01:15.400> was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640

structure once I knew that the roof was
starting<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.030> collapse<00:01:16.270> I<00:01:16.570> knew<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.020> was

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
starting to collapse I knew it was

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.020 
starting to collapse I knew it was
inevitable<00:01:17.680> that<00:01:18.130> we<00:01:18.280> had<00:01:18.490> to<00:01:18.610> get<00:01:18.729> off<00:01:18.850> the

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
inevitable that we had to get off the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.460 
inevitable that we had to get off the
roof<00:01:19.150> as<00:01:19.360> quickly<00:01:19.600> as<00:01:19.780> possible

roof as quickly as possible

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.130 
roof as quickly as possible
we<00:01:20.830> made<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> scream<00:01:21.790> to<00:01:22.090> get<00:01:22.300> off<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.660> roof<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
we made a scream to get off the roof and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.180 
we made a scream to get off the roof and
at<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.650> we<00:01:24.130> all<00:01:24.280> turned<00:01:24.760> and<00:01:25.270> made<00:01:26.110> haste<00:01:26.470> to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
at that we all turned and made haste to

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.609 
at that we all turned and made haste to
our<00:01:27.700> parapet<00:01:28.420> wall<00:01:28.630> which<00:01:28.840> was<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.110> closest

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
our parapet wall which was the closest

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:30.749 
our parapet wall which was the closest
exit<00:01:30.100> for<00:01:30.369> us

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
exit for us

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.940 
exit for us
I<00:01:30.790> literally<00:01:31.509> leapt<00:01:31.900> for<00:01:32.470> work<00:01:32.650> through<00:01:32.860> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
I literally leapt for work through the

I literally leapt for work through the
smoke<00:01:33.250> to<00:01:33.430> where<00:01:33.580> I<00:01:33.610> hopefully<00:01:34.150> thought<00:01:34.660> the

smoke to where I hopefully thought the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.410 
smoke to where I hopefully thought the
parapet<00:01:35.259> was<00:01:35.470> as<00:01:36.340> we<00:01:36.550> came<00:01:36.759> down<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.090> ladder<00:01:37.300> I

will of the combustible gases carbon
monoxide<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.570> was<00:02:03.869> built<00:02:04.140> up<00:02:04.290> inside<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
monoxide that was built up inside the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.660 
monoxide that was built up inside the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
building and it flashed over causing

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.330

maybe<00:02:09.000> some<00:02:09.300> structural<00:02:09.899> failure<00:02:10.259> inside<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
maybe some structural failure inside and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.640 
maybe some structural failure inside and
I<00:02:11.430> believe<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.120> drove<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.630> ceiling<00:02:13.050> down<00:02:13.260> on
