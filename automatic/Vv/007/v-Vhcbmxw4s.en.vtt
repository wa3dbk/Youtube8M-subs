00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.810 
of the patio will happen to mention it
has<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.959> have<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.739> has<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.070> happen<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.489> I<00:02:22.550> think

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
has to have it has to happen and I think

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.720 
has to have it has to happen and I think
it<00:02:22.940> won't<00:02:23.030> happen<00:02:23.239> eventually

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.730 

it's<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.420> big<00:02:27.600> enough<00:02:27.810> fight<00:02:28.110> for<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's a it's a big enough fight for the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.860 
it's a it's a big enough fight for the
public<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.160> demand<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.960> demanded<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.720> has

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
public to demand it demanded that it has

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.290 
public to demand it demanded that it has
to<00:02:34.050> happen<00:02:34.230> there's<00:02:34.560> no

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
to happen there's no

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.120 
to happen there's no
we<00:02:37.300> just<00:02:37.540> we<00:02:37.960> just<00:02:37.990> have<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.380> cross<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.860> hurdle

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
we just we just have to cross one hurdle

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.440 
we just we just have to cross one hurdle
that's<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.030> just<00:02:40.210> one<00:02:40.540> hurt<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.310> that<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.670> that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
that's it just one hurt and that is that

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.490

is<00:02:43.600> taking<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.140> test<00:02:44.850> 15<00:02:45.850> days<00:02:46.120> before<00:02:46.570> quite

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
is taking the test 15 days before quite

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.300 
is taking the test 15 days before quite
so<00:02:47.680> let<00:02:48.250> me<00:02:48.340> change<00:02:48.640> between<00:02:49.090> now

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
so let me change between now

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.050 
so let me change between now
the<00:02:50.849> end<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> year<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:53.280> said<00:02:53.610> you<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:53.849> want

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
the end of the year I said you just want

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.940 
the end of the year I said you just want
to<00:02:54.120> be<00:02:54.209> taking<00:02:55.020> blood<00:02:55.200> tests<00:02:55.470> were<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> heavy

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
to be taking blood tests were a heavy

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.110 
to be taking blood tests were a heavy
trainer<00:02:56.340> I'm<00:02:57.239> sure<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.599> public<00:02:57.780> will

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
trainer I'm sure the public will

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.960 
trainer I'm sure the public will
hopefully<00:03:00.120> make<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.599> change<00:03:00.870> tonight<00:03:01.080> because

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
hopefully make up change tonight because

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.750 
hopefully make up change tonight because
why<00:03:02.970> would<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.380> why<00:03:04.380> would<00:03:04.410> you<00:03:04.590> not<00:03:05.310> want<00:03:05.640> to

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760

earn<00:03:06.330> 40<00:03:06.870> million<00:03:07.050> dollars<00:03:07.580> why<00:03:08.580> would<00:03:08.849> you

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
earn 40 million dollars why would you

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.479 
earn 40 million dollars why would you
not<00:03:09.120> want<00:03:09.480> to

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
not want to

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:19.240 
not want to
