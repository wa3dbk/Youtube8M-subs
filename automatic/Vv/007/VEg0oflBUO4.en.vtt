you<00:01:11.500> think<00:01:11.680> of<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.799> course<00:01:12.150> pretty<00:01:13.150> awesome

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
you think of a course pretty awesome

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.920 
you think of a course pretty awesome
actually<00:01:14.640> really<00:01:15.640> great<00:01:15.820> so<00:01:16.600> you<00:01:16.660> think<00:01:16.690> it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
actually really great so you think it's

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.540 
actually really great so you think it's
improved<00:01:17.440> by<00:01:17.650> having<00:01:17.980> all<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.190> snow<00:01:18.400> and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
improved by having all the snow and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.280 
improved by having all the snow and
slush<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:18.850> everything<00:01:19.330> on<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.480> otherwise

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
slush and everything on it otherwise

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.260 
slush and everything on it otherwise
would<00:01:20.380> just<00:01:20.650> be<00:01:20.740> kind<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:20.920> a<00:01:21.010> bumpy<00:01:21.310> field<00:01:21.580> yeah

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
would just be kind of a bumpy field yeah

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.630 
would just be kind of a bumpy field yeah
but<00:01:22.870> now<00:01:23.020> it's<00:01:23.170> a<00:01:23.320> deal<00:01:23.800> with<00:01:23.980> a<00:01:24.040> bunch<00:01:24.220> of<00:01:24.340> snow

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
but now it's a deal with a bunch of snow

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.390 
but now it's a deal with a bunch of snow
and<00:01:24.760> slush<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.030> mud<00:01:25.210> ice<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.440> whatnot<00:01:26.770> it's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
and slush and mud ice and whatnot it's

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.040 
and slush and mud ice and whatnot it's
awesome<00:01:27.550> snow<00:01:27.850> banks<00:01:28.270> are<00:01:28.390> good<00:01:28.540> snow<00:01:28.840> banks

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
awesome snow banks are good snow banks

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.200 
awesome snow banks are good snow banks
are<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.260> play<00:01:29.470> for<00:01:29.530> sure<00:01:29.950> you<00:01:30.580> can<00:01:30.730> use<00:01:30.880> them<00:01:31.060> in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
are in play for sure you can use them in

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.510 
are in play for sure you can use them in
some<00:01:31.420> turns<00:01:31.660> and<00:01:32.080> there's<00:01:32.680> much<00:01:32.830> clean<00:01:33.340> lines

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
some turns and there's much clean lines

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.780 
some turns and there's much clean lines
and<00:01:33.730> it'll<00:01:34.000> change<00:01:34.210> sure<00:01:35.040> acta<00:01:36.040> sometimes

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
and it'll change sure acta sometimes

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.360 
and it'll change sure acta sometimes
over<00:01:37.120> between<00:01:37.300> now<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.780> Sunday<00:01:38.080> but<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:39.159> a

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
over between now and Sunday but it's a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
for you'd actually like get an idea of

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.450 
for you'd actually like get an idea of
what<00:01:43.840> racing<00:01:44.170> was<00:01:44.320> gonna<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:44.620> like<00:01:44.650> icicle<00:01:45.250> I

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
what racing was gonna be like icicle I

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.670 
what racing was gonna be like icicle I
kind<00:01:45.760> of<00:01:45.880> motor<00:01:46.090> racing<00:01:46.480> single<00:01:47.380> speeds<00:01:47.560> is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
kind of motor racing single speeds is

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.920 
kind of motor racing single speeds is
fun<00:01:47.860> but<00:01:48.010> it's<00:01:48.159> also<00:01:48.220> pretty<00:01:48.640> invaluable<00:01:49.180> reki

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
fun but it's also pretty invaluable reki

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.469 
fun but it's also pretty invaluable reki
for<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.530> proper<00:01:51.010> race<00:01:51.159> on<00:01:51.400> sunday<00:01:51.730> so<00:01:51.790> yeah

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
for the proper race on sunday so yeah

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.690 
for the proper race on sunday so yeah
actually<00:01:53.110> it's<00:01:53.260> hard<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.620> simulate<00:01:53.860> what

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
actually it's hard to simulate what

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240 
actually it's hard to simulate what
turns<00:01:55.420> and<00:01:55.840> climbs<00:01:56.050> feel<00:01:56.440> like<00:01:56.680> when<00:01:57.070> you're

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
turns and climbs feel like when you're

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.680 
turns and climbs feel like when you're
actually<00:01:57.370> racing<00:01:57.670> without<00:01:57.970> actually<00:01:58.390> racing

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
actually racing without actually racing

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.860 
actually racing without actually racing
on<00:01:58.780> it<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.080> yeah<00:01:59.350> after<00:01:59.740> that<00:01:59.860> gives<00:02:00.070> me<00:02:00.220> an

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
on it so yeah after that gives me an

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.420 
on it so yeah after that gives me an
ever-so-slight<00:02:01.870> leg<00:02:02.140> up<00:02:02.350> on<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.890> other<00:02:03.190> folks

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
ever-so-slight leg up on the other folks

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.789 
ever-so-slight leg up on the other folks
yeah<00:02:03.850> so<00:02:04.450> what<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.659> what<00:02:04.990> gear<00:02:05.170> ratio<00:02:05.470> did<00:02:05.680> you
