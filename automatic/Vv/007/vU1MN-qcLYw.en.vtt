is<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.939> chuck<00:01:30.150> them<00:01:30.299> into<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> furnace

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
is is if you chuck them into a furnace

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.080 
is is if you chuck them into a furnace
you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.740> they<00:01:31.799> actually<00:01:31.829> work<00:01:32.520> the

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
you can see that they actually work the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.310 
you can see that they actually work the
problem<00:01:33.390> is<00:01:33.509> they're<00:01:33.780> not<00:01:33.930> particularly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
problem is they're not particularly

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.840 
problem is they're not particularly
efficient<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.070> obviously<00:01:35.460> because<00:01:35.700> it's

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
efficient but obviously because it's

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.429 
efficient but obviously because it's
your<00:01:35.970> first<00:01:36.180> few<00:01:36.390> days<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.079> might<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.380> well

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
your first few days you might as well

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.090 
your first few days you might as well
get<00:01:37.799> all<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.220> resources<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> can<00:01:39.060> if

get all of the resources that you can if

two<00:02:01.259> lava<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:01.740> at<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.950> bottom<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.460> then

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
two lava down at the bottom and then

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
two lava down at the bottom and then
chuck<00:02:03.299> some<00:02:03.450> water<00:02:03.659> on<00:02:03.869> top<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.619> will

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
chuck some water on top and that will

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.219 
chuck some water on top and that will
convert<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.130> lava<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.939> obsidian<00:02:06.570> then<00:02:07.079> you

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
convert that lava into obsidian then you

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.779 
convert that lava into obsidian then you
want<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.469> create<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.099> sort<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.520> framework

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
want to create this sort of framework

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.600 
want to create this sort of framework
here<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.810> three<00:02:10.259> blocks<00:02:10.560> up<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.069> then

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
here going three blocks up and then

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.160 
here going three blocks up and then
download<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.120> bomb<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.720> place<00:02:12.900> a

download the bomb you want to place a

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.850 
download the bomb you want to place a
source<00:02:13.530> or

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
source or

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.340 
source or
lover<00:02:14.130> and<00:02:14.460> then<00:02:15.000> choke<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.540> water<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:16.020> top

lover and then choke some water on top

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.870 
lover and then choke some water on top
and<00:02:16.560> that<00:02:16.590> will<00:02:16.980> convert<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> lover<00:02:17.580> into

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and that will convert the lover into

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.610 
and that will convert the lover into
obsidian<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:18.750> you<00:02:18.870> just<00:02:19.020> have<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.260> rinse<00:02:19.470> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
obsidian then you just have to rinse and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.280 
obsidian then you just have to rinse and
repeat<00:02:19.980> and<00:02:20.190> do<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.330> more<00:02:21.360> time<00:02:21.540> lover

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
repeat and do it one more time lover

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.950 
repeat and do it one more time lover
then<00:02:22.890> water<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.580> repeat<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.840> other

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
then water and repeat that on the other

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.030 
then water and repeat that on the other
side<00:02:25.260> then<00:02:25.800> take<00:02:26.070> out<00:02:26.280> your<00:02:26.460> entire<00:02:26.790> framework

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
side then take out your entire framework

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.170 
side then take out your entire framework
once<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.190> have<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.550> sort<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.850> shape<00:02:29.940> you

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
once you have this sort of shape you

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.910 
once you have this sort of shape you
want<00:02:30.330> to<00:02:30.360> place<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.660> block<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.080> either<00:02:31.350> side<00:02:31.740> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
want to place a block on either side and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490 
want to place a block on either side and
then<00:02:32.430> two<00:02:32.730> blocks<00:02:32.970> along<00:02:33.210> like<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.630> two

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
then two blocks along like this and two

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.170 
then two blocks along like this and two
blocks<00:02:34.740> along<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> other<00:02:35.430> side<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:36.030> then

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
blocks along on the other side and then

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.880 
blocks along on the other side and then
place<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.690> little<00:02:36.930> bottom<00:02:37.200> part<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.680> and

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
place a little bottom part there and

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.280 
place a little bottom part there and
then<00:02:38.190> chunk<00:02:38.460> down<00:02:38.610> some<00:02:38.850> lava<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.420> once<00:02:40.110> again

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
then chunk down some lava and once again

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.440 
then chunk down some lava and once again
some<00:02:40.680> more<00:02:40.740> water<00:02:41.100> that<00:02:41.700> will<00:02:41.790> convert<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.300> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
some more water that will convert all of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.360 
some more water that will convert all of
that<00:02:42.630> into<00:02:42.959> obsidian<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.530> then<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.190> will<00:02:44.280> be

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
that into obsidian and then you will be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.220 
that into obsidian and then you will be
able<00:02:44.490> to<00:02:44.700> light<00:02:44.910> your<00:02:45.060> nether<00:02:45.330> portal<00:02:47.870> ice<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
able to light your nether portal ice is

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
able to light your nether portal ice is
essentially<00:02:49.830> stackable<00:02:50.430> water<00:02:50.670> when<00:02:51.270> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
essentially stackable water when you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.820 
essentially stackable water when you
have<00:02:51.480> a<00:02:51.510> water<00:02:51.780> bucket<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.290> can<00:02:52.440> only<00:02:52.560> have

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
have a water bucket you can only have

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.170 
have a water bucket you can only have
one<00:02:52.860> unless<00:02:53.459> you<00:02:53.700> want<00:02:53.850> to<00:02:53.880> fill<00:02:54.060> up<00:02:54.150> your

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
one unless you want to fill up your

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.220 
one unless you want to fill up your
entire<00:02:54.600> inventory

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
entire inventory

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
entire inventory
whereas<00:02:55.950> ice<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.550> can<00:02:56.700> carry<00:02:56.910> about<00:02:57.030> in<00:02:57.300> a

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
whereas ice you can carry about in a

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.030 
whereas ice you can carry about in a
full<00:02:57.540> stack<00:02:57.840> then<00:02:58.260> when<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.500> want<00:02:58.680> some<00:02:58.860> water

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
full stack then when you want some water

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.590 
full stack then when you want some water
you<00:02:59.430> just<00:02:59.459> break<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.000> when<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.209> on<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.330> floor

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
you just break it when it's on the floor

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.510 
you just break it when it's on the floor
and<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:01.290> be<00:03:01.410> able<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.709> get<00:03:01.860> some<00:03:02.130> meaning

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
and you will be able to get some meaning

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.040 
and you will be able to get some meaning
that<00:03:02.640> if<00:03:02.760> you<00:03:02.850> are<00:03:03.000> going<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.270> be<00:03:03.390> using<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.840> lot

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
that if you are going to be using a lot

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.540 
that if you are going to be using a lot
of<00:03:04.080> water<00:03:04.380> then<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:05.040> would<00:03:05.220> highly<00:03:05.520> suggest

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
of water then I would highly suggest

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.380 
of water then I would highly suggest
using<00:03:06.030> ice<00:03:06.390> instead<00:03:06.810> of<00:03:07.020> water<00:03:07.200> buckets<00:03:08.390> when

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
using ice instead of water buckets when

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.360 
using ice instead of water buckets when
going<00:03:09.660> deep-sea<00:03:10.080> diving<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.620> always<00:03:10.950> good<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
going deep-sea diving is always good to

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.430 
going deep-sea diving is always good to
carry<00:03:11.520> about<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.850> few<00:03:12.209> items<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.959> help<00:03:13.140> you<00:03:13.260> stay

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
carry about a few items to help you stay

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.830 
carry about a few items to help you stay
under<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.770> waves<00:03:13.950> longer<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.910> example<00:03:15.360> using

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
under the waves longer for example using

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.930 
under the waves longer for example using
torches<00:03:16.200> allows<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.160> replenish<00:03:17.610> your<00:03:17.760> air

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
torches allows you to replenish your air

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.210 
torches allows you to replenish your air
supply<00:03:18.120> quite<00:03:18.600> quickly<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.200> also<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:20.040> water

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
supply quite quickly and also the water

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.460 
supply quite quickly and also the water
automatically<00:03:21.180> breaks<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.570> torch<00:03:21.810> mean<00:03:22.320> then

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
automatically breaks the torch mean then

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.690 
automatically breaks the torch mean then
you<00:03:22.650> don't<00:03:22.830> have<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.100> worry<00:03:23.250> about<00:03:23.459> carrying

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you don't have to worry about carrying

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.330 
you don't have to worry about carrying
any<00:03:23.970> tools<00:03:24.299> using<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:25.140> fencepost<00:03:25.470> gives<00:03:26.130> you<00:03:26.310> a

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
any tools using a fencepost gives you a

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.460 
any tools using a fencepost gives you a
constant<00:03:27.090> source<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.510> air<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:28.019> we<00:03:28.140> can<00:03:28.290> stand

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
constant source of air so we can stand

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.170 
constant source of air so we can stand
in<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:28.739> air<00:03:28.920> pocket<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.670> are<00:03:29.790> not<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.120> to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
in this air pocket we are not going to

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.030 
in this air pocket we are not going to
drown<00:03:30.450> and<00:03:30.660> then<00:03:31.019> as<00:03:31.140> soon<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.380> we're<00:03:31.560> done<00:03:31.590> you

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
drown and then as soon as we're done you

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.650 
drown and then as soon as we're done you
just<00:03:32.220> break<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.580> fencepost<00:03:32.850> with<00:03:33.150> an<00:03:33.269> axe<00:03:33.480> and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
just break the fencepost with an axe and

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.039 
just break the fencepost with an axe and
you<00:03:33.750> can<00:03:34.200> move<00:03:34.320> on<00:03:34.500> somewhere<00:03:34.950> else

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
you can move on somewhere else

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.660 
you can move on somewhere else
setting<00:03:37.049> a<00:03:37.230> mob<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.680> fire<00:03:37.950> instead<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.489> just

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
setting a mob on fire instead of just

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.890 
setting a mob on fire instead of just
killing<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.030> will<00:03:39.180> allow<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.630> get<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
killing it will allow you to get the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.170 
killing it will allow you to get the
cooked<00:03:40.170> item<00:03:40.590> drop<00:03:40.799> instead<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> raw<00:03:41.970> one

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
cooked item drop instead of the raw one

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.150 
cooked item drop instead of the raw one
so<00:03:42.360> that<00:03:42.480> chicken<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:42.930> on<00:03:43.049> fire<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.500> as<00:03:43.950> you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
so that chicken was on fire and as you

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.220 
so that chicken was on fire and as you
can<00:03:44.310> see<00:03:44.519> we<00:03:44.670> got<00:03:44.850> ourselves<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.450> nice<00:03:45.660> piece<00:03:45.959> of

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
can see we got ourselves a nice piece of

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.789 
can see we got ourselves a nice piece of
roast<00:03:46.500> chicken<00:03:46.980> lovely<00:03:48.080> this<00:03:49.080> technique<00:03:49.530> also

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
roast chicken lovely this technique also

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.130 
roast chicken lovely this technique also
works<00:03:50.010> with<00:03:50.370> lava<00:03:50.670> but<00:03:51.450> it's<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.810> little<00:03:52.019> bit

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
works with lava but it's a little bit

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.990 
works with lava but it's a little bit
more<00:03:52.290> risky<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.860> have<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.160> tendency<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.730> set

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
more risky I have a tendency to set

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.800 
more risky I have a tendency to set
myself<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.510> fire

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
myself on fire

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.990 
myself on fire
so<00:03:55.200> another<00:03:55.530> life<00:03:55.739> hack<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.220> don't<00:03:56.790> set

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
so another life hack is don't set

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.370 
so another life hack is don't set
yourself<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.420> fire<00:03:57.480> that's<00:03:57.930> never<00:03:58.170> going<00:03:58.350> to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
yourself on fire that's never going to

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.729 
yourself on fire that's never going to
end<00:03:58.530> well<00:03:58.739> a<00:03:59.750> really<00:04:00.750> good<00:04:00.989> way<00:04:01.140> to<00:04:01.200> do<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.470> water

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
end well a really good way to do a water

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.680 
end well a really good way to do a water
stream<00:04:02.100> that<00:04:02.280> covers<00:04:02.580> an<00:04:02.670> entire<00:04:02.760> room<00:04:03.299> for

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
stream that covers an entire room for

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.140 
stream that covers an entire room for
example<00:04:03.870> in<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.470> mob<00:04:04.709> spawner<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.760> use<00:04:06.000> the

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
example in a mob spawner is to use the

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.090 
example in a mob spawner is to use the
infinite<00:04:06.660> water<00:04:06.810> sources<00:04:07.350> that<00:04:07.500> are<00:04:07.620> created

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
infinite water sources that are created

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.220 
infinite water sources that are created
as<00:04:08.340> you<00:04:08.549> place<00:04:08.790> down<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.180> source<00:04:09.390> blocks<00:04:09.690> so

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
as you place down the source blocks so

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.780 
as you place down the source blocks so
if<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.560> just<00:04:10.709> chuck<00:04:10.950> one<00:04:11.160> down<00:04:11.340> here<00:04:11.610> and

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
if we just chuck one down here and

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.699 
if we just chuck one down here and
another<00:04:12.510> one<00:04:12.690> over<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:12.989> then<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.530> see

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
another one over here then you can see

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.680 
another one over here then you can see
the<00:04:13.920> one<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.370> middle<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.760> actually<00:04:15.269> an

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
the one in the middle is actually an

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.449 
the one in the middle is actually an
infinite<00:04:15.930> water<00:04:16.320> source<00:04:16.560> so<00:04:16.890> if<00:04:17.160> we<00:04:17.280> go<00:04:17.430> a

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
infinite water source so if we go a

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.520 
infinite water source so if we go a
couple<00:04:17.790> blocks<00:04:18.000> along<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.479> repeat<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.350> same

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
couple blocks along and repeat the same

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.319 
couple blocks along and repeat the same
process<00:04:19.739> taking<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.669> one<00:04:20.820> from<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.120> middle

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
process taking the one from the middle

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.360 
process taking the one from the middle
go<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> couple<00:04:21.959> blocks<00:04:22.169> along<00:04:22.470> place<00:04:23.070> it<00:04:23.220> down

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
go a couple blocks along place it down

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.400 
go a couple blocks along place it down
and<00:04:23.430> then<00:04:23.789> take<00:04:24.000> one<00:04:24.180> from<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.450> middle<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:24.810> we

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and then take one from the middle and we

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.200 
and then take one from the middle and we
do<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.650> again<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.190> as<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.520> can<00:04:26.669> see<00:04:26.729> we<00:04:27.090> have

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
do it again and as you can see we have

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.530 
do it again and as you can see we have
got

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
got

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.440

corridor the best way to do it is to run

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.310 
corridor the best way to do it is to run
and<00:04:35.490> jump<00:04:35.700> at<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.910> same<00:04:36.060> time<00:04:36.360> allow<00:04:37.050> you<00:04:37.110> to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
and jump at the same time allow you to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.320 
and jump at the same time allow you to
move<00:04:37.470> much<00:04:37.860> much<00:04:38.130> quicker<00:04:38.370> and<00:04:38.730> get<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.240> the

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
move much much quicker and get to the

places that you want to go far faster an

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.920 
places that you want to go far faster an
even<00:04:41.670> better<00:04:41.880> way<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.090> doing<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.660> place

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
even better way of doing it is to place

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.780 
even better way of doing it is to place
ice<00:04:43.170> underneath<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.830> do<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.370> same<00:04:44.520> technique

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
ice underneath and do the same technique

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.960 
ice underneath and do the same technique
you<00:04:45.300> will<00:04:45.450> absolutely<00:04:45.660> fly<00:04:46.490> when<00:04:47.490> using<00:04:47.880> a

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
you will absolutely fly when using a

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.700 
you will absolutely fly when using a
sword<00:04:48.270> you<00:04:48.450> can<00:04:48.600> block<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.080> swing<00:04:49.410> at<00:04:49.590> the

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
sword you can block and swing at the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.860 
sword you can block and swing at the
same<00:04:49.920> time<00:04:50.220> not<00:04:50.820> only<00:04:51.090> does<00:04:51.240> this<00:04:51.360> look<00:04:51.420> really

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
same time not only does this look really

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.960 
same time not only does this look really
cool<00:04:52.170> but<00:04:52.530> it's<00:04:52.680> also<00:04:52.860> functional<00:04:53.340> it<00:04:53.700> allows

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
cool but it's also functional it allows

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.610 
cool but it's also functional it allows
you<00:04:54.120> to<00:04:54.210> be<00:04:54.300> on<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.510> attack<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.260> defense

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
you to be on the attack and the defense

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.890 
you to be on the attack and the defense
at<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:56.400> same<00:04:56.580> time<00:04:56.850> pretty<00:04:57.420> useful<00:04:57.870> for

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
at the same time pretty useful for

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.080 
at the same time pretty useful for
things<00:04:58.170> like<00:04:58.230> PvP<00:04:58.800> as<00:04:58.980> well<00:04:59.460> as<00:04:59.580> fighting<00:04:59.820> off

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
things like PvP as well as fighting off

any mops digging straight down is

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.330 
any mops digging straight down is
actually<00:05:04.140> the<00:05:04.230> most<00:05:04.410> efficient<00:05:04.860> way<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.040> mine

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
actually the most efficient way to mine

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.160 
actually the most efficient way to mine
the<00:05:05.820> people<00:05:06.060> who<00:05:06.150> tell<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:06.510> otherwise<00:05:06.750> are

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:07.170 
the people who tell you otherwise are

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.420 
the people who tell you otherwise are
just<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.410> ones<00:05:07.530> that<00:05:07.800> don't<00:05:07.920> want<00:05:08.190> you<00:05:08.280> to

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
just the ones that don't want you to

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.250 
just the ones that don't want you to
succeed<00:05:08.640> they<00:05:09.000> don't<00:05:09.210> want<00:05:09.360> to<00:05:09.450> see<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.810> with

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
all those diamonds and they tell you

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.150 
all those diamonds and they tell you
that<00:05:12.180> actually<00:05:12.450> is<00:05:12.870> silly<00:05:13.140> when<00:05:13.350> really<00:05:13.950> it's

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
that actually is silly when really it's

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.620 
that actually is silly when really it's
the<00:05:14.250> smartest<00:05:14.670> way<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.820> do<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.150> if<00:05:15.300> you<00:05:15.450> fall

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
the smartest way to do it if you fall

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.300 
the smartest way to do it if you fall
into<00:05:15.810> a<00:05:15.930> ravine<00:05:16.140> that<00:05:16.710> just<00:05:16.920> means<00:05:17.070> you'll<00:05:17.220> get

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
into a ravine that just means you'll get

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.160 
into a ravine that just means you'll get
into<00:05:17.520> that<00:05:17.640> diamond<00:05:18.030> layer<00:05:18.180> faster<00:05:18.690> if<00:05:18.840> you

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
into that diamond layer faster if you

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.050 
into that diamond layer faster if you
fall<00:05:19.350> into<00:05:19.590> lava<00:05:19.740> well<00:05:20.460> then<00:05:20.670> you<00:05:20.760> just<00:05:20.940> have

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
fall into lava well then you just have

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.430 
fall into lava well then you just have
to<00:05:21.180> accept<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.690> because<00:05:21.810> these<00:05:22.140> sorts<00:05:22.380> of

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
to accept it because these sorts of

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.760 
to accept it because these sorts of
things<00:05:22.500> happen<00:05:22.680> don't<00:05:23.130> they<00:05:24.260> another<00:05:25.260> top<00:05:25.530> tip

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
things happen don't they another top tip

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.530 
things happen don't they another top tip
is<00:05:25.980> that<00:05:26.160> if<00:05:26.310> you<00:05:26.460> carry<00:05:26.730> along<00:05:27.030> all<00:05:27.270> of<00:05:27.300> your

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540 
is that if you carry along all of your

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.290 
is that if you carry along all of your
diamonds<00:05:27.990> valuables<00:05:28.860> nether<00:05:29.520> stars<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.210> all

diamonds valuables nether stars and all

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.450 
diamonds valuables nether stars and all
that<00:05:30.570> in<00:05:30.870> your<00:05:30.900> inventory<00:05:31.500> as<00:05:31.680> you<00:05:31.890> go<00:05:32.040> mining

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
that in your inventory as you go mining

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.520 
that in your inventory as you go mining
it<00:05:32.640> actually<00:05:33.180> increases<00:05:33.750> your<00:05:33.780> chances<00:05:34.380> of

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
it actually increases your chances of

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.380 
it actually increases your chances of
finding<00:05:35.100> diamonds<00:05:35.760> so<00:05:35.910> what<00:05:36.060> I<00:05:36.090> would<00:05:36.180> suggest

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
dig straight down with all of that stuff

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.520 
dig straight down with all of that stuff
on<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.090> and<00:05:39.300> you'll<00:05:39.930> just<00:05:40.050> be<00:05:40.140> onto<00:05:40.410> a<00:05:40.440> winner

on you and you'll just be onto a winner
you'll<00:05:40.980> be<00:05:41.160> rolling<00:05:41.460> in<00:05:41.790> diamonds<00:05:42.270> before<00:05:42.420> you

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
you'll be rolling in diamonds before you

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.210
