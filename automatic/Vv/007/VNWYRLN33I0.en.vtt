00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 We are talking about the 17th of this month. 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.740
 international aviation that takes place in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.200
 Maringá Airport and the Isabela Reporter 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.809
 lourenço has more interviews here in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.870
 show at the international fair of 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.270
 aviation has even a flight simulator and its 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.430
 co pilot commercial milestones that will 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.820
 simulate a flight together with us all 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 well how's everything working? 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.539
 in fact we have here we have a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.310
 cyclic command right 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.430
 this is a helicopter is a simulator of the 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.590
 Robson 22 then cyclical he will do the 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.149
 movements of the aircraft to 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.989
 forward to the right for 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.239
 left 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.250
 we have a command here between the banks 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.170
 collective flame this command is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.059
 responsible for the rise and fall of the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.730
 helicopter vertically we have the pedals 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.760
 also like the steering wheel of the car 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.379
 I'm going to affect the right pedal to 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.640
 helicopter cabin will turn to the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.270
 right and left to the 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000
 left 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.250
 the helicopter it is a right pendulum is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.649
 unstable then it has pending the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 All the time we make three more 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.350
 commands is to kill trend and print the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.950
 type of flights and wants to do to where you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.780
 want to go 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.549
 if you want to go up or down the right 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.240
 the helicopter is already connected at the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.950
 track 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.439
 we leave all generated commands 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.610
 and starts pulling the collective time that 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.650
 have a tendency for people to 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.090
 collective that neither now nor access to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.729
 trend is going to the right then 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.610
 left pedal right to reassess the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.500
 track is exactly like a helicopter 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.840
 exactly how the helicopter works 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.800
 in a simulator just for this 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.440
 the beginning of training as 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.980
 bruno he has a greater security to know 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.650
 how does each command work right? 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.930
 working with prevention is not less risk of 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.460
 machine economy accident 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.190
 there is no break and copy in the case of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.280
 accident continue pulling there he goes 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.380
 have a tendency to go right 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.660
 with the left I have is killing to 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.210
 make that first step of the flight that 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.260
 It is the hovering flight whether it is standing still in the 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.230
 place right 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.420
 From there I'll take off I'll put 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.530
 this group ahead it will start to 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.540
 gain speed 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.130
 I'll wait until 55 us that 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.910
 instrument that has a green bow there 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.650
 she points out she's already moving to 55 9 a 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.470
 ideal speed it has to climb the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.660
 it starts to inflate and it will rise 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.730
 I'll still have to gain an attitude. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.290
 safety but always keeping the 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.540
 alignment with the track here that our 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.300
 security area throughout the airport 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.130
 even being a helicopter to people 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.320
 keep this here when it will take off 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.990
 floors and was declared the heliponto the 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.790
 helipad and almost twice the 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.010
 size of the helicopter then soon if already 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.810
 will release on top of the building 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.080
 from there we were already flying 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:47.090
 what time is a 70 us here in case it is 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.100
 the marginal tietê in the state of são paulo 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.110
 and then then make a shot from 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.120
 Suddenly, it's good that we get into the 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.560
 circuit we begin to decrease the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.660
 Speed we'll enter the circuit 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.360
 with 60 knots landing procedure of the 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.160
 helicopter is as if you had 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.800
 parking your car so you go 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.900
 slow him down to have you 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.600
 a greater confidence a stability 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.640
 always smaller movements will 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.060
 to appear the clue is the field of mars here 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.370
 we are still at the head 12 right that 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.530
 120 degrees at the moment how many 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.420
 kilometers per hour you are 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.520
 we are at 60 knots that speed 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.720
 indicating mine is speedy being a 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.030
 instrument right 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.370
 It will reduce to 50 start 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.550
 stage of landing here right now this is a moment 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.580
 critical 11 of flight 11 to ever takeoff 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.470
 is that an error here by you can break 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.090
 the ship gets hurt right? 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:44.720
 so I speed here at the very end 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:48.560
 I vote and if I want I play or the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.020
 I say that continuing the flight is the 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.470
 training calls sent right touch 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.510
 You touch and take off again, thanks. 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.420
 so by speaking with 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.850
 the commercial pilot audax frames that 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.670
 you also want to do a simulation 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.280
 flight just come here at the fair 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.200
 international aviation to an already made 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.390
 director we will have much more to 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.180
 show here at the ball show and we 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.630
 see the next edition of the ball sun 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.630
 until then
