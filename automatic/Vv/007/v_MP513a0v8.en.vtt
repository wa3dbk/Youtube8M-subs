the<00:02:26.340> epic<00:02:26.640> air<00:02:26.790> facial<00:02:27.180> system<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.630> that<00:02:27.780> it's

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
the epic air facial system is that it's

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.720 
the epic air facial system is that it's
removing<00:02:28.500> my<00:02:28.620> hair<00:02:28.859> from<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.250> root<00:02:29.519> as

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
removing my hair from the root as

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
removing my hair from the root as
opposed<00:02:30.209> to<00:02:30.359> shaving<00:02:30.750> where<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.590> just<00:02:31.799> removes

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
opposed to shaving where it just removes

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.490 
opposed to shaving where it just removes
hair<00:02:32.519> from<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> surface<00:02:33.359> in<00:02:33.600> addition<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
hair from the surface in addition to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.030 
hair from the surface in addition to
that<00:02:34.680> waxing<00:02:35.720> removes<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:37.019> thin<00:02:37.470> layer<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.709> our

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040

skin it

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.920 
skin it

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.080 
and I noticed that with my facial epic
hair<00:02:46.260> system<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.890> doesn't<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:47.640> also

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
hair system it doesn't do the and also

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.210 
hair system it doesn't do the and also
the<00:02:48.240> pill<00:02:48.420> Tori<00:02:48.720> creams<00:02:49.050> are<00:02:49.410> really<00:02:50.010> harsh

the pill Tori creams are really harsh

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.030 
the pill Tori creams are really harsh
chemicals<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:51.120> are<00:02:51.360> not<00:02:52.110> really<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.800> great

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
chemicals that are not really that great

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.460

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.590 
to put on your skin and I also noticed
that<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.770> burns<00:02:56.040> skin<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.240> depilatory

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
that it burns skin and the depilatory

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.280 
that it burns skin and the depilatory
creams<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.380> leaking<00:02:58.950> both<00:02:59.580> cause

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
creams and leaking both cause

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.950 
creams and leaking both cause
pigmentation<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.820> is<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.030> very<00:03:03.360> great
