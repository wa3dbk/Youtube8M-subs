just<00:00:49.630> to<00:00:49.720> see<00:00:49.930> how<00:00:50.110> it<00:00:50.230> goes<00:00:50.410> on<00:00:50.560> the<00:00:50.680> road

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
just to see how it goes on the road

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.180 
just to see how it goes on the road
tying<00:00:51.490> it<00:00:51.700> to<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.910> weight<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:53.410> it's<00:00:54.040> got

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
tying it to the weight so it's got

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.480 
tying it to the weight so it's got
plenty<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.610> talk<00:00:55.290> about<00:00:56.290> 230<00:00:56.860> horsepower<00:00:57.190> so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
plenty of talk about 230 horsepower so

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.710 
plenty of talk about 230 horsepower so
there's<00:00:57.640> not<00:00:57.700> a<00:00:57.760> problem<00:00:58.000> there<00:00:58.210> either

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
there's not a problem there either

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.040 
there's not a problem there either
and<00:00:59.790> it's<00:01:00.790> ticking<00:01:01.000> along<00:01:01.330> nicely<00:01:01.600> I'm<00:01:01.840> itchy

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
and it's ticking along nicely I'm itchy

only doing 1,500 ribs at 70 kilometers
an<00:01:08.410> hour<00:01:08.590> so<00:01:09.100> I<00:01:09.130> think<00:01:09.280> that's<00:01:09.580> pretty<00:01:09.730> good

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
an hour so I think that's pretty good

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.010 
an hour so I think that's pretty good
for<00:01:10.090> time<00:01:10.270> three<00:01:10.570> tonnes

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
for time three tonnes

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.770 
for time three tonnes
now<00:01:11.950> we're<00:01:12.100> going<00:01:12.250> downhill<00:01:12.490> I'm<00:01:12.790> gonna<00:01:13.030> chop

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
now we're going downhill I'm gonna chop

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.760 
now we're going downhill I'm gonna chop
down<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.050> bit<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.770> see<00:01:15.010> what<00:01:15.160> happens<00:01:15.460> then<00:01:16.770> go

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
down a bit and see what happens then go

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:18.600 
down a bit and see what happens then go
down<00:01:17.950> one<00:01:18.160> more

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
down one more

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.190 
down one more
it's<00:01:19.420> an<00:01:19.510> 8-speed<00:01:20.020> gearbox<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.570> it's

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
it's an 8-speed gearbox this and it's

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200 
it's an 8-speed gearbox this and it's
very<00:01:23.410> the<00:01:23.590> gears<00:01:24.070> changed<00:01:24.520> from<00:01:24.610> first<00:01:24.880> second

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
very the gears changed from first second

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.330 
very the gears changed from first second
to<00:01:25.300> third<00:01:25.540> very<00:01:25.810> quickly<00:01:26.080> once<00:01:26.950> it<00:01:27.130> once

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
to third very quickly once it once

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.580 
to third very quickly once it once
you're<00:01:27.520> in<00:01:27.640> normal<00:01:28.030> Drive<00:01:28.300> mode<00:01:28.570> if<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.260> flick

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
you're in normal Drive mode if you flick

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.380 
you're in normal Drive mode if you flick
it<00:01:29.740> backwards<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.340> goes<00:01:30.490> into<00:01:30.820> sports<00:01:31.090> mode

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
it backwards it goes into sports mode

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.060 
it backwards it goes into sports mode
which<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:32.050> changes<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.590> engine<00:01:32.890> management

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
which just changes the engine management

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
which just changes the engine management
and<00:01:33.729> gives<00:01:33.910> you<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> bit<00:01:34.240> more<00:01:34.270> low<00:01:34.990> down<00:01:35.229> talk

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and gives you a bit more low down talk

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.620 
and gives you a bit more low down talk
it<00:01:37.090> cuts<00:01:37.450> down<00:01:37.660> your<00:01:37.900> gears<00:01:38.110> quite<00:01:38.500> quickly

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
it cuts down your gears quite quickly

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.570 
it cuts down your gears quite quickly
and<00:01:40.630> I<00:01:40.810> like<00:01:40.900> to<00:01:40.990> put<00:01:41.110> it<00:01:41.200> up<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.860> can<00:01:42.130> just<00:01:42.160> flick

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:42.580 
and I like to put it up I can just flick

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.150 
and I like to put it up I can just flick
it<00:01:42.700> down<00:01:43.119> one<00:01:43.390> more<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.650> goes<00:01:44.770> back<00:01:45.009> into

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
it down one more and it goes back into

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.040 
it down one more and it goes back into
normal<00:01:45.490> Drive<00:01:45.700> again<00:01:48.330> I've<00:01:49.330> only<00:01:49.509> driven<00:01:49.840> a

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
normal Drive again I've only driven a

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.640 
normal Drive again I've only driven a
v10<00:01:50.470> 5<00:01:51.250> litre<00:01:51.520> v10<00:01:51.970> version<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.650> before

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
v10 5 litre v10 version of this before

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.500 
v10 5 litre v10 version of this before
they<00:01:53.920> don't<00:01:54.070> make<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:54.250> anymore<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:55.150> so<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:55.390> was

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
they don't make it anymore and so I was

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.370 
they don't make it anymore and so I was
wondering<00:01:55.690> what<00:01:55.930> they're<00:01:56.020> going<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.200> replace

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
wondering what they're going to replace

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.920 
wondering what they're going to replace
it<00:01:56.650> with<00:01:56.680> ever<00:01:56.950> replaced<00:01:57.250> it<00:01:57.400> with<00:01:57.430> a<00:01:57.520> v8

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
it with ever replaced it with a v8

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.590 
it with ever replaced it with a v8
diesel<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.320> thus<00:01:59.590> v6<00:02:00.220> so<00:02:01.180> I<00:02:01.210> was<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.390> bit

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
diesel and thus v6 so I was a bit

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.930 
diesel and thus v6 so I was a bit
hesitant<00:02:01.960> at<00:02:02.350> first<00:02:02.380> about<00:02:02.890> how<00:02:02.950> a<00:02:03.220> v6<00:02:03.790> would

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
hesitant at first about how a v6 would

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.020 
hesitant at first about how a v6 would
go<00:02:04.150> with<00:02:04.360> was<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.050> row<00:02:05.200> glass<00:02:05.440> on<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.800> back

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
go with was the row glass on the back

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.389 
go with was the row glass on the back
but<00:02:07.030> I<00:02:07.420> tell<00:02:07.720> you<00:02:07.780> what<00:02:07.960> as<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.619> family<00:02:09.100> car<00:02:09.369> with

six<00:02:09.850> we<00:02:10.179> have<00:02:10.300> a<00:02:10.330> v6<00:02:10.660> are<00:02:11.080> not<00:02:11.230> using

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
six we have a v6 are not using

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.880 
six we have a v6 are not using
ridiculous<00:02:12.220> fuel<00:02:12.600> she<00:02:13.600> still<00:02:13.989> actually<00:02:14.440> got

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
ridiculous fuel she still actually got

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.580 
ridiculous fuel she still actually got
the<00:02:15.010> power<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> need

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
the power you need

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.110 
the power you need
so<00:02:17.590> in<00:02:17.739> 7th<00:02:18.070> gear<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.400> moment<00:02:18.790> we're<00:02:18.910> doing

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
so in 7th gear at the moment we're doing

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.380 
so in 7th gear at the moment we're doing
1500<00:02:19.750> revs<00:02:19.989> 80<00:02:20.500> case<00:02:20.860> so<00:02:21.730> we're<00:02:21.850> hardly<00:02:22.060> using

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
1500 revs 80 case so we're hardly using

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.860
