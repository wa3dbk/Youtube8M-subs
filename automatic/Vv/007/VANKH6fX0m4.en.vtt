 he is off to the lower abdomen waiting for mass before the game in American 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:05.879
 Football Regional League Center 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.179
 against the Mainz Golden Eagles and with two old acquaintances back in the team 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.619
 with the 87 Receiver Cloud Haase 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:14.889
 who gives his comeback after a year off 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.439
 and also Ronny Becker Masterbatch with the 20 again jersey of the Greens 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.810
 16 players currently unavailable for their current injured-misers 

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:27.259
 The return was a real blessing for the struggling farmers with two 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.489
 Defeats in the season are started 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.489
 not that which one imagined 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.909
 it should arrive in the rheinland-pfalz derby particularly 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:37.910
 one suspected before the game 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.840
 Farmers vs. Eagles have always been a hot box of Naber and we can 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 beforehand already betrayed it was an absolutely fair dirty game 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.260
 with the better start for Montabaur a few short passes a few short ones 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.100
 Runs like here at Christian Günther 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.800
 the Westerwald came in four groups of secession 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.500
 and kicker Matthias Dreser completed 47 yards outside 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.520
 respectable start 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.460
 Mainz, however, was not particularly impressed by the very first of Dance 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.549
 Player's turn quarterback Florian Mayer leaves him 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.740
 with the long pass on John must 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.210
 a 53 yards was amazed at the Farmers did not look good 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.640
 Sam extra point this seven to three for the climber 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.830
 a Mertes welcome gift 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.580
 At Montabaur, the short passes arrived at Minister's will over the ten-year period 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.990
 Dance they went here at the passport that Cairo was there is all the rooms including the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.300
 on the fears of shoots 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.870
 the fan must have engine ran even at the beginning of season three not yet around 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.420
 The hosts had to Panten which actually changes the right of attack 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.620
 but not because the tenant of a like every Mainz player the ball again 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.910
 loses 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.440
 Green and the Greens are happy to take this chance » 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.110
 It was time to start the first own day 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.190
 short pass on Christian Günther and then it goes in the rush to the direction 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.520
 Catering with intermediate stations Endzone there was fresh Berger he wants is 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 Günter resent 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.950
 The game is now quite to the liking of around 450 spectators Mans but stadium 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.470
 The first use of cookies I have to say as my way 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.350
 he makes a solid play for a few decades and will certainly be 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.199
 become important for the team over the course of the season 

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:17.909
 It was also important to drink a lot to the 30 degrees in Montabaur 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.559
 the players got a good sweat 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:24.529
 and on the field FIF it is now following Plan Occean's turn over Kemmer Zurich's 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.020
 Quarterback might still have the ball 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.650
 but to his neighbor Cichon does it himself 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.400
 The Farmers led with additional point with ten to seven and had a short lead 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.039
 the break luck 

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:37.310
 so deep it went from Kamal to ASCII 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.380
 and a referee shows in the square but there are 5 and another 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.079
 had seen a foul game from Mainz 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.589
 of the gameplay 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.459
 Ten to seven at break for the Fighting Farmers until then no 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.259
 football-solid but a solid performance in half two Mainz with new 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:54.129
 quarterback 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.090
 the us-boy live AG and also the was 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.090
 First of all warmly welcomed by the Farmers Defense 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.769
 Blake played unconventionally another type of player that is possible 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.799
 moving fast on the legs 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 It also makes a few decades of player shapes good as in this scene 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:16.039
 he did not run it in the ground and the press is in this phase 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.930
 a bit hectic 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.640
 Plaques would hardly have thrown then the leather and then there is already one 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.029
 Interception out this time caught by Michael Krick 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.149
 otherwise the third quarter balanced on with good approaches 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:29.069
 both sides but on points 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.099
 it should not be enough at this stage 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.229
 to alert the defense actors on both sides 

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.930
 The farmers too need the jump to the last quarter 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.310
 and scoring again 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
 but then they made the crucial points 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:45.649
 short distance his job either for torture hunger or for a change 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:46.370
 Approval 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.010
 and that makes the decisive courage in the end zone Sam extra point 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.209
 led Montabaur with 24 to victories 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.139
 that means actually after a loose victory against the jackdaws 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.139
 Eagles but their wings were not fallen for a long time 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:02.870
 Volatil laughs a deep pass every now and then 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.749
 the many cities on this 

00:04:04.749 --> 00:04:07.400
 Mainz was always in recession 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.099
 and then did such a fall as that of Leitgeb 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.189
 which just runs through the middle 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.069
 another example, they have a finger in the farmers wound on it 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.840
 Lachey looks for his receiver then whistle a ball on Malden 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.280
 Thommes is hijacked by four men 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.370
 and catch the ball 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.510
 Slow enough the gifts should be thought but the guests brought more 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.940
 Points on the scoreboard 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.169
 Lahti on Thomas and you can not let that out of sight 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.389
 Lucky only that the good idea is now awarded their extra points 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.430
 like this one superbly repelled by pharmaceutical heavyweight Mark axis 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.770
 which we fly through the air here is really only to guess 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.229
 but it's sensationally done well 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.029
 before this use 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:51.449
 that would be 20 to 19 on the scoreboard is then the final score 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:54.400
 Additional points and the field goal of Kicker Matthias Dreser 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.870
 make the difference in the end the Greens are allowed to cheer but happy 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:59.050
 also increase 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.400
 Herrmann did not want to play cover which was good in the beginning 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.559
 we made it bad in the back 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.759
 it is always around we were today 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.500
 more focused than usual but in the back I'm always at percent of 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.029
 Situations that need to be gotten out 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:18.169
 in the shortcomings of meaningless penalties the race start sees 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.229
 and courting 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:23.559
 The blazers keep on balling and keep working on the two party 

00:05:23.559 --> 00:05:24.919
 continue 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.810
 Respect for the Mainz Golden Eagles the newcomer has sold here dearly 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.620
 and boys he is presented 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.250
 That's how football is fun
