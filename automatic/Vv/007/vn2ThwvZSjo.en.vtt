 rosone pt every day and so it turns 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.160
 and so that sounds when an honest man 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.160
 finds out he was wrong 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.860
 to be honest i chose 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.860

 changing life now would be an account 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.140
 I think 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.140
 the objectives 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.950
 I do not believe it 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.120
 I don't think about it anymore 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.120
 I don't think about it anymore 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.010
 tired work every day with vase 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.500
 with the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.260
 it only depends on the shifts standing each 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.530
 morning with the night before in the head every 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.320
 Monday morning life makes me shit more 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.899
 but where life is not your friend is not 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.839
 fast where the day is kidnapped by cc 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.699
 robbing fatigue where you fail where 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.530
 you can't go where you do n't go where you don't 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.590

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.770
 more than four brisk nesti fucking you 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.220

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.560
 lucky you are not unemployed words a 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.229
 empty of the servants visa system which a 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.790
 force to touch the shit to make a 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.090
 travel 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.890
 give a medium to average that average 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.180
 spends a slut prize just like the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.760
 old premier 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.310
 the average Italian with the average increasingly in 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.270
 tall is a plug for the ass he won the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.740
 manager with both when 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.120

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.760

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.820

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.430
 in conclusion 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.430
 own goals 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.450

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.409

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.409
 I don't think about it anymore 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.499
 and if the maximum extreme record sheets 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.700
 family sheets and we will always continue 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.599
