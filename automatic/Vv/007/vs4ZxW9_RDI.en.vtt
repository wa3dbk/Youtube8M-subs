all<00:00:41.129> defensive<00:00:41.790> killstreaks<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.570> let<00:00:42.750> think

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
all defensive killstreaks and let think

all defensive killstreaks and let think
i<00:00:43.260> actually<00:00:43.410> get<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.680> cruise<00:00:44.010> missile<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
i actually get the cruise missile as the

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.920 
i actually get the cruise missile as the
game<00:00:44.910> ends<00:00:45.739> and<00:00:46.739> i<00:00:46.800> wanted<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.129> say<00:00:47.930> the

defensive<00:00:49.410> kill<00:00:49.590> streaks<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.070> probably<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
defensive kill streaks are probably the

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.080 
defensive kill streaks are probably the
preferred<00:00:51.000> option<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.690> little<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.559> flashy

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
preferred option a little not as flashy

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.970 
preferred option a little not as flashy

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
defensive kill six is essentially a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.060
