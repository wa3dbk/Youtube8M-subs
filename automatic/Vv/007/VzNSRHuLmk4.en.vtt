00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that great technically but the way I

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.990

silver strike a 71 and shiny and that
shininess<00:02:10.350> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> silver<00:02:10.950> play<00:02:11.130> seems<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
shininess on the silver play seems to

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.510 
shininess on the silver play seems to
attract<00:02:12.270> quite<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> few<00:02:12.720> people<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.260> him<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.590> so

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
attract quite a few people to him and so

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.949 
attract quite a few people to him and so
I<00:02:14.550> don't<00:02:14.790> think<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.060> wise<00:02:15.270> price<00:02:15.600> gone<00:02:15.840> up

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
it's absolutely brilliant for a striker

it's absolutely brilliant for a striker
Emmys<00:03:46.799> he's<00:03:47.100> really<00:03:47.340> underrated<00:03:47.820> and<00:03:48.359> that's

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
Emmys he's really underrated and that's

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.060 
Emmys he's really underrated and that's
really<00:03:49.019> good<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.230> well<00:03:49.260> because<00:03:49.650> it's<00:03:49.769> cheap

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
really good as well because it's cheap

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.580 
really good as well because it's cheap
and<00:03:50.310> by<00:03:50.910> what<00:03:51.510> i<00:03:51.540> mean<00:03:51.690> by<00:03:51.810> underrated<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.410> his

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
and by what i mean by underrated is his

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.259 
and by what i mean by underrated is his
stats<00:03:52.859> are<00:03:53.510> like<00:03:54.510> not<00:03:55.200> as<00:03:55.320> good<00:03:55.470> as<00:03:55.590> I<00:03:55.709> feel<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
stats are like not as good as I feel and

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.090 
stats are like not as good as I feel and
he<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.450> quite<00:03:57.810> cheap<00:03:58.230> as<00:03:58.440> well<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.829> without

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
he is quite cheap as well so without

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.490 
he is quite cheap as well so without
making<00:03:59.489> some<00:03:59.519> underrated<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.600> also<00:04:01.140> because

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
making some underrated and also because

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.470 
making some underrated and also because
of<00:04:01.650> his<00:04:01.799> good<00:04:02.280> mix<00:04:02.549> like<00:04:02.820> dribbling<00:04:03.090> and

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
of his good mix like dribbling and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.930 
of his good mix like dribbling and
strength<00:04:03.900> and<00:04:04.170> he<00:04:04.829> can<00:04:05.070> keep<00:04:05.250> a<00:04:05.370> ball<00:04:05.519> quite

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
strength and he can keep a ball quite

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.670 
strength and he can keep a ball quite
well<00:04:06.000> he's<00:04:06.390> got<00:04:06.510> good<00:04:06.660> ball<00:04:06.900> control<00:04:07.079> as<00:04:07.500> well

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
well he's got good ball control as well

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.850 
well he's got good ball control as well
so<00:04:07.829> it's<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.130> good<00:04:08.370> as<00:04:08.489> well

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
so it's really good as well

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.710 
so it's really good as well
but<00:04:09.520> one<00:04:09.790> thing<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.150> does<00:04:10.420> lay<00:04:10.570> them<00:04:10.600> down

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
but one thing which does lay them down

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.170 
but one thing which does lay them down
and<00:04:11.110> which<00:04:11.380> does<00:04:11.710> drop<00:04:12.310> a<00:04:12.340> couple<00:04:12.550> of<00:04:12.730> marks<00:04:12.970> on

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
and which does drop a couple of marks on

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.450 
and which does drop a couple of marks on
him<00:04:13.300> as<00:04:13.540> his<00:04:13.990> work-rate<00:04:14.260> it<00:04:14.710> can<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.190> bit

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
him as his work-rate it can be a bit

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.069 
him as his work-rate it can be a bit
annoying<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.820> play<00:04:15.970> with<00:04:16.120> him<00:04:16.239> when<00:04:16.720> his<00:04:16.810> work

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
annoying to play with him when his work

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.990 
annoying to play with him when his work
rate<00:04:17.590> is<00:04:17.769> quite<00:04:17.950> low<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.220> you<00:04:18.430> really<00:04:18.700> wanted

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
rate is quite low and you really wanted

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.539 
rate is quite low and you really wanted
to<00:04:19.030> make<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.450> run<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:20.410> he<00:04:20.590> just<00:04:20.769> doesn't<00:04:21.160> seem

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
to make a run but he just doesn't seem

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.820 
to make a run but he just doesn't seem
to<00:04:21.700> want<00:04:21.820> to<00:04:22.000> but<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.020> another<00:04:23.260> thing<00:04:23.440> is<00:04:23.650> is

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
to want to but and another thing is is
