video they were having their black
friday<00:00:30.599> sale<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:31.859> through<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
friday sale I think like through the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.889 
friday sale I think like through the
weekend<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.000> might<00:00:33.180> still<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.690> on

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
weekend it might still be going on

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
weekend it might still be going on
because<00:00:34.170> today's<00:00:34.530> Monday<00:00:34.950> but<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.489> went<00:00:36.059> on

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
because today's Monday but I went on

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.540 
because today's Monday but I went on
Saturday<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.690> actually<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.530> ten<00:00:38.250> dollars

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
Saturday and actually a to ten dollars

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
Saturday and actually a to ten dollars
off<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> purchase<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> thirty<00:00:39.390> dollar<00:00:39.600> coupons

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
off a purchase of thirty dollar coupons

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.650 
off a purchase of thirty dollar coupons
so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.739> figured<00:00:41.430> if<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.579> spent<00:00:41.879> sixty<00:00:42.329> dollars

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
so I figured if I spent sixty dollars

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.389 
so I figured if I spent sixty dollars
and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> saved<00:00:43.200> twenty<00:00:43.500> dollars<00:00:43.770> forty<00:00:44.160> dollars

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399

like their freshly baked cookies i'm

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
like their freshly baked cookies i'm
pretty<00:01:11.430> sure<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.790> almost<00:01:12.090> exactly<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.659> same

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
pretty sure it's almost exactly the same

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.160 
pretty sure it's almost exactly the same
but<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.340> cookie<00:01:15.150> dough<00:01:15.360> pure

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
but this one is cookie dough pure

but this one is cookie dough pure
vanilla<00:01:16.290> butter<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> sugar<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:18.119> really

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
vanilla butter and sugar so it really

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.630 
vanilla butter and sugar so it really
does<00:01:18.570> smell<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.170> like<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.439> cookie<00:01:19.740> or<00:01:20.130> cookie

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
does smell just like a cookie or cookie

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.940 
does smell just like a cookie or cookie
dough<00:01:20.790> except<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.380> smells<00:01:22.680> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
dough except better and it smells so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.310 
dough except better and it smells so
good<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> freshly<00:01:24.509> baked<00:01:24.720> cookie<00:01:25.140> one

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
good I have a freshly baked cookie one

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289 
good I have a freshly baked cookie one
left<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.430> burning<00:01:26.909> through<00:01:27.119> right<00:01:27.270> now

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
left that I'm burning through right now

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.569 
left that I'm burning through right now
and<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.049> really<00:01:28.829> think<00:01:28.979> maybe<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.400> were<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
and I I really think maybe they were the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.219 
and I I really think maybe they were the
same<00:01:29.729> thing<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.030> repackage<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.110> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
same thing just repackage but this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.140 
same thing just repackage but this
packaging<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.890> even<00:01:32.189> cuter<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:32.939> one

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150
