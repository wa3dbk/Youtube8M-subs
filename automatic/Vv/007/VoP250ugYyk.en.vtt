 make this final video i don't 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 began to combine one video he and so 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.410
 it turned out great and so I had to 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.470
 run the second part by 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 lorries of this model I want to say 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.460
 understand bought my summer wife wanted that 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.309
 drew a machine for dioramas well and chose 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.420
 here is gsm and I didn’t want to take 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.129
 cheap knife myself 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.229
 and the stars at first everything seemed to go 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.809
 OK, that is, the video looked there 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:58.920
 all collected for later there was put such 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.420
 shoals italy here I thought something was not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.659
 so do it really 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.750
 model of such a life there are several 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:12.990
 here's one and a half trucks here is my 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.880
 model is 35 74 43 years on sprues there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.720
 there were still a bunch of other some details 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.330
 What does it mean how much I did not look 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.190
 But in the Internet and as the rollers 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.300
 feeling that this is one of a set 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.020
 hit the cabin as I said it there 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.560
 this roof 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.370
 and at the limit should cover the frame 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.770
 here and close it 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.300
 but no way is not leaving I do not understand 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.220
 what was to do she came on here alone 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.660
 Sasha could make it saw off her and 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:48.590
 beginning lay at an angle there huge still 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.870
 you could doubt it 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.380
 second joint here is this part of the hood on this 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.050
 generally how does radiator mean 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.810
 lattice done here we are eyebrows here these 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.000
 side but under the cover they do not fall then 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.720
 have i tried like there u year not included 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.929
 rather than the fact that most of all I have a problem I 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.550
 spent there roughly speaking there in the evening 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.390
 understand what is this here 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.160
 radiator screen 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.360
 here you see it here sawed off here 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.599
 in steps 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 she will have to go down here then 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.970
 have it have to start here from this 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.459
 frame parts 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.190
 go up here it is if it is and 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.989
 make a huge here 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 just much millimeter 2 is obtained 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.130
 here send acts as such 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.870
 should not be 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.780
 that is, and the panty is another part 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.250
 cars up to the gram she herself in general she 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.350
 I broke down here right here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.040
 broke here everything after here 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.010
 weakness yesterday super glue with glue here 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:00.360
 simplified here to no where are you here at all 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:06.380
 It is not clear how the scheme is cunning I am funny 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.790
 then compared it with miniart gas 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.130
 there is a perfect model where to put 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.380
 the wheel was incomprehensible too found 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 you need wheels 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.780
 it's their company how they live here 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.739
 he is both 10 what are they here on these disks 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.049
 does not fit at all 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.890
 barely puts on the tires here all 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.410
 his peak was crooked or a department on a disk of them 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.530
 that's all here 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:41.489
 almost super glue bad job 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.510
 of course cars then began to paint her but I 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.120
 then just started 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.889
 you started like all the brushes here this bitch 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.380
 it will be okay 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:54.150
 that bond began to do and crawled 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:57.540
 paint here and here and here crawled here 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.609
 I varnished her ears but then I realized that 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.579
 all his eyes the soul of the book does not work 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.829
 runs , but I have the only one 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:09.090
 the model was thought up last which will go away 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:14.639
 husband he will indicate these are left I wanted her 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:16.590
 I could not put it off to the top 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:21.120
 to force myself to take it I remember was 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.170
 cant and when will buy 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:26.800
 decide to watch carefully 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:35.830
 This number is 3570 and I would not recommend 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:39.520
 you need the spirit and what else 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.200
 pad there also mentioned brush 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.970
 really well, how was it possible and 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.520
 instruction to give if they like glue 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:51.210
 there it will generally be performed here and was 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.210
 at an angle like this, nothing is clear 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:00.520
 well here so do this grove seen for 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.940
 order to close this project and not 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.060
 fooling more on his account 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:10.060
 either not to train 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.950
 training will drive as much as possible 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.470
 I want him to lighten want your brush 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:20.020
 try varnish it flooded be well well 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.470
 and then I'll throw it to the eyes not 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.470
 callus 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:34.440
 This tent of course, too, we masterpiece 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.940
 thank you all for your attention 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.410
 I want to finish this a bit 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.920
 give your seriously nothing 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:46.990
 sleep here means not the mother of a 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:54.550
 understand the gas that throw such 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:56.800
 left up but longer 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.010
 Now word has become general, to paint it 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.920
 watercolors of some kind then I selected 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:06.130
 back I decided to try it means just 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:11.740
 on it paint tempera there surely god 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:13.930
 After all, he came out so here the video has become shoulder 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.350
 like to say so what happened 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.680
 walk it here and here is the lacquer technique up 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:25.120
 I tried to put snow like that 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:29.110
 painted the paper and decided to tear off here 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:32.330
 the paint over here too 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:38.370
 the roof is in place 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:46.470
 tried the pigments fixed 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:50.599
 when the machine is interesting to see well, take off 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.599
 it’s not like trying to just 

00:06:52.669 --> 00:07:07.919
 decided to call it and importation that should 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.349
 say i'm right there and channel everything 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:14.430
 Equally did not help here a cloak from 

00:07:10.349 --> 00:07:19.199
 that which places here 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:23.340
 the ball is broken again as the beam flew off 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:25.590
 marked here a little toned 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:32.030
 holding here and that is again flew off 

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:44.750
 the wheel is not really dump the car though 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:50.060
 I can still say one thing from me 

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:50.060
 almost all over bye
