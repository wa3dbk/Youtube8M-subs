but I'm just going to talk for a little

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.610 
but I'm just going to talk for a little
bit<00:00:08.250> more<00:00:08.460> explainable<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.630> Sanchez<00:00:10.080> it<00:00:10.440> just

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
bit more explainable so Sanchez it just

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.290 
bit more explainable so Sanchez it just
came<00:00:10.740> out<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.920> picks<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> first<00:00:11.580> up<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.030> came<00:00:12.210> on

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300

the<00:00:12.389> market<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.750> 1<00:00:12.990> million<00:00:13.139> coins<00:00:13.620> so<00:00:14.130> this

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
the market for 1 million coins so this

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.799 
the market for 1 million coins so this
is<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> only<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.940> time<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.599> month

1.6 mil and they're none up on the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:19.250 
1.6 mil and they're none up on the
markets<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.510> could<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:18.900> though<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
markets you could see just though and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.929 
markets you could see just though and
search<00:00:19.439> in<00:00:19.710> side<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.220> only<00:00:20.460> one<00:00:20.609> up<00:00:20.760> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
search in side the only one up and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.689 
search in side the only one up and
eventually<00:00:21.750> he<00:00:21.990> did<00:00:22.289> self<00:00:22.529> 1.6<00:00:23.189> mil<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.550> i<00:00:23.580> made

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
eventually he did self 1.6 mil so i made

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.210 
eventually he did self 1.6 mil so i made
over<00:00:23.730> 500k<00:00:24.420> prof<00:00:24.750> da<00:00:25.140> tax<00:00:25.560> which<00:00:26.099> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
over 500k prof da tax which is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.099 
over 500k prof da tax which is
absolutely<00:00:26.400> insane<00:00:26.730> i<00:00:27.180> took<00:00:27.689> about<00:00:27.840> 2-3

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
absolutely insane i took about 2-3

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
absolutely insane i took about 2-3
minutes<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.740> himself<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.789> yeah<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.510> was<00:00:30.599> just

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
minutes for himself so yeah it was just

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.600 
minutes for himself so yeah it was just
some<00:00:30.869> amazing<00:00:31.289> profits<00:00:31.679> making<00:00:32.040> them<00:00:32.160> but

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
some amazing profits making them but

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.420 
some amazing profits making them but
also<00:00:32.820> with<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.270> right<00:00:33.660> tip<00:00:34.350> well<00:00:34.710> trick<00:00:35.010> I'd

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
also with this right tip well trick I'd

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.340 
also with this right tip well trick I'd
say<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.059> risky<00:00:36.270> in<00:00:36.570> my<00:00:36.660> opinion<00:00:36.899> because

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
say is very risky in my opinion because

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
say is very risky in my opinion because
a<00:00:37.500> lot<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> time<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.219> no<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.550> pops<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.969> this

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a lot of time if no one pops up this

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.240 
a lot of time if no one pops up this
slightly<00:00:39.420> cheaper<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.410> could<00:00:40.620> end<00:00:40.739> up<00:00:40.860> losing

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
slightly cheaper you could end up losing

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.430 
slightly cheaper you could end up losing
the<00:00:41.280> love<00:00:41.460> coins<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.930> downside<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the love coins so that's the downside to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
the love coins so that's the downside to
this<00:00:43.530> trick<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.070> very<00:00:44.190> risky<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.120> for<00:00:45.360> me

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
this trick so it's very risky but for me

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.779 
this trick so it's very risky but for me
I'd<00:00:45.690> never<00:00:45.840> recommend<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.500> as<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:47.610> just

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I'd never recommend it as it's just

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.250 
I'd never recommend it as it's just
worth<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.149> risk<00:00:48.360> if<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.690> works<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.110> make<00:00:49.230> a

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
worth the risk if it works you make a

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
worth the risk if it works you make a
ton<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.530> profit<00:00:50.039> if<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.610> doesn't<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.120> can<00:00:51.270> make

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
ton of profit if it doesn't you can make

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
ton of profit if it doesn't you can make
a<00:00:51.420> slight<00:00:51.780> loss<00:00:51.930> sometimes<00:00:52.230> sometimes<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> can

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
a slight loss sometimes sometimes it can

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.970 
a slight loss sometimes sometimes it can
be<00:00:53.489> big<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.000> can<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> nine<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.590> yeah

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
be big which can be a nine so I'm yeah

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.590

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
when I was seven high okay so fly at

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.820 
when I was seven high okay so fly at
least<00:01:21.360> up<00:01:21.479> with<00:01:21.630> 500<00:01:22.140> k<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.350> he<00:01:22.439> makes<00:01:22.590> himself

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
least up with 500 k and he makes himself

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.730 
least up with 500 k and he makes himself
an<00:01:23.189> about<00:01:23.430> 45<00:01:23.880> minutes<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.840> yeah<00:01:25.350> it's<00:01:25.530> an<00:01:25.590> easy

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
an about 45 minutes so yeah it's an easy

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.620 
an about 45 minutes so yeah it's an easy
to<00:01:25.979> okay<00:01:26.280> profits<00:01:26.700> once<00:01:26.880> get<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> little<00:01:27.479> bit<00:01:27.570> of

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
to okay profits once get a little bit of

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
to okay profits once get a little bit of
a<00:01:27.689> risky<00:01:28.049> mefferd<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.430> when<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
a risky mefferd so with this when you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670 
a risky mefferd so with this when you
actually<00:01:29.939> buy<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> players<00:01:30.630> save<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.439> Chiefs

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
actually buy the players save the Chiefs

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.100 
actually buy the players save the Chiefs
ones<00:01:31.920> toric<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> next<00:01:32.700> 1<00:01:32.850> 600<00:01:33.360> k<00:01:33.509> you

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
ones toric a in the next 1 600 k you

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230 
ones toric a in the next 1 600 k you
want<00:01:34.259> probably<00:01:34.470> looks<00:01:34.860> less<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.220> about<00:01:35.520> 400<00:01:36.119> k

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
want probably looks less up about 400 k

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.749 
want probably looks less up about 400 k
cuz<00:01:36.659> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.810> list<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.409> 1k<00:01:37.829> 5k<00:01:38.130> cheaper

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
cuz if you list it like 1k 5k cheaper

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.520 
cuz if you list it like 1k 5k cheaper
than<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.880> next<00:01:39.210> cheapest<00:01:39.540> one<00:01:39.720> it's<00:01:40.290> going<00:01:40.500> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
than the next cheapest one it's going to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.630 
than the next cheapest one it's going to
be<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> little<00:01:40.799> bit<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.100> riskier<00:01:41.549> because

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
be a little bit more riskier because

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.969 
be a little bit more riskier because
people<00:01:42.119> less<00:01:42.329> likely<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.810> buy<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.439> cheaper<00:01:43.829> is

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
people less likely to buy the cheaper is

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.649 
people less likely to buy the cheaper is
the<00:01:44.189> bigger<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> gap<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:45.149> more<00:01:45.329> likely

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the bigger the gap the more likely

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:46.880 
the bigger the gap the more likely
they're<00:01:45.810> gonna<00:01:45.899> think<00:01:46.110> oh<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> bargain

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
they're gonna think oh this is a bargain

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.100 
they're gonna think oh this is a bargain
and<00:01:47.130> pick<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.750> where<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.990> want

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
and pick it up so that's where you want

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.350 
and pick it up so that's where you want
a<00:01:49.140> decent<00:01:49.320> gap<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.790> lot<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.180> time

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
a decent gap there and a lot of the time

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.330 
a decent gap there and a lot of the time
this<00:01:51.540> method<00:01:51.899> does<00:01:51.930> work<00:01:52.259> is<00:01:52.500> small<00:01:52.770> like<00:01:53.040> the

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
this method does work is small like the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.010 
this method does work is small like the
percent<00:01:53.670> rate<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.270> working<00:01:54.630> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
percent rate of this one working it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.270 
percent rate of this one working it's
definitely<00:01:55.200> higher<00:01:55.530> than<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> first<00:01:56.040> method

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
definitely higher than the first method

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.819 
definitely higher than the first method
so<00:01:57.149> am<00:01:57.360> yeah<00:01:57.750> def<00:01:57.960> recommend<00:01:58.170> taking<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.799> look

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so am yeah def recommend taking a look

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.380 
so am yeah def recommend taking a look
at<00:01:59.040> both<00:01:59.159> these<00:01:59.310> methods<00:01:59.759> try<00:01:59.969> now<00:02:00.030> if<00:02:00.240> you

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
at both these methods try now if you

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.209 
at both these methods try now if you
want<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> now<00:02:02.070> for

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
want to so that is going to be a now for
