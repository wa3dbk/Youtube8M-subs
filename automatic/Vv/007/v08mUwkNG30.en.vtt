00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
village because you know they're in

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
produce that much which was kind of like

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
produce that much which was kind of like
all<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:17.680> was<00:02:18.040> reasonable<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.819> reasonable<00:02:19.330> price

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
all it was reasonable a reasonable price

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.780 
all it was reasonable a reasonable price
but<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:19.959> mean<00:02:20.310> actually<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:21.370> was<00:02:21.490> kind<00:02:21.610> of<00:02:21.700> a

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
but I mean actually it was kind of a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.520 
but I mean actually it was kind of a
stretch<00:02:22.060> because<00:02:22.240> they<00:02:22.420> wanted<00:02:22.660> another<00:02:23.050> biju

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
stretch because they wanted another biju

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.190 
stretch because they wanted another biju
and<00:02:23.740> thirty<00:02:24.520> percent<00:02:24.880> from<00:02:25.060> every<00:02:25.510> village<00:02:25.540> so

and thirty percent from every village so

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.380 
and thirty percent from every village so
that<00:02:26.800> was<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> lot<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.640> probably<00:02:28.030> a<00:02:28.060> little<00:02:28.209> bit
