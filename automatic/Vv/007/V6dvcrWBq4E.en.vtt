00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.680 

I<00:03:22.030> think<00:03:22.630> spread<00:03:22.810> along<00:03:22.870> there

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.350 

he<00:03:28.530> can't<00:03:28.800> see<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.130> but<00:03:29.370> basically<00:03:30.120> there's

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
he can't see it but basically there's

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:51.729 
he can't see it but basically there's
just<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.600> blob<00:03:30.840> on<00:03:31.050> there<00:03:31.580> and<00:03:32.580> then

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.290 

so<00:03:52.739> I'm<00:03:53.459> going<00:03:53.520> to<00:03:53.730> let<00:03:53.819> it<00:03:53.880> dry<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.510> while

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
so I'm going to let it dry for a while

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.780 
so I'm going to let it dry for a while
at<00:03:57.300> least<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.630> couple<00:03:57.750> hours

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:12.740 

so<00:04:02.239> basically<00:04:02.599> what<00:04:02.810> i<00:04:02.840> do<00:04:02.930> i<00:04:05.319> take<00:04:06.319> my<00:04:06.560> stick

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.569 

and<00:04:13.400> click<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.700> blue<00:04:15.600> one

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
and click the blue one

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.830 
and click the blue one
and<00:04:18.150> then<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.479> place

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
and then just place

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.950 
and then just place
just<00:04:21.470> like<00:04:21.590> that

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.770
