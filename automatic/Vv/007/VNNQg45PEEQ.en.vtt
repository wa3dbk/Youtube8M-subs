00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.700 
i had already put together the board
normally<00:02:01.550> I'll<00:02:01.670> put<00:02:01.880> them<00:02:01.970> down<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.479> then<00:02:03.410> cut

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
normally I'll put them down and then cut

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.590 
normally I'll put them down and then cut
them<00:02:03.830> around<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.460> then<00:02:04.610> drop<00:02:04.970> my<00:02:05.119> trucks<00:02:05.420> on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
