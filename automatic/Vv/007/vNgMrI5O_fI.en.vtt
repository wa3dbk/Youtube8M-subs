actually<00:01:07.290> made<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> metal<00:01:07.830> mount<00:01:08.189> lexan<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
actually made out of metal mount lexan I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.300 
actually made out of metal mount lexan I
decided<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.260> do<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.530> metal<00:01:11.010> because<00:01:11.280> I

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
decided to do this metal because I

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.179 
decided to do this metal because I
didn't<00:01:11.610> like<00:01:11.700> said<00:01:12.030> didn't<00:01:12.420> everything<00:01:13.189> flip

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
didn't like said didn't everything flip

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
didn't like said didn't everything flip
over<00:01:14.479> I'm<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:15.659> for<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.140> antenna<00:01:16.680> mount

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
over I'm also for the antenna mount

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.679 
over I'm also for the antenna mount
Simon<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.340> make<00:01:17.490> sure<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> was<00:01:17.939> had<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> solid

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
Simon to make sure it was had a solid

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.609 
Simon to make sure it was had a solid
hole<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.830> mount<00:01:20.189> those<00:01:20.400> on<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.350> these<00:01:22.350> are

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
hole to mount those on so these are

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.030 
hole to mount those on so these are
actually<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.040> zip<00:01:23.250> ties<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.420> um<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.040> had

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
actually just zip ties but um I had

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.910 
actually just zip ties but um I had
these<00:01:26.220> other<00:01:26.490> ones<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.000> made<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:28.080> as<00:01:28.740> soon

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
these other ones that I made and as soon

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.620 
these other ones that I made and as soon
as<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.159> drove<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> truck<00:01:29.670> I<00:01:30.090> rolled<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.420> once

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
as I drove the truck I rolled at once

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.100 
as I drove the truck I rolled at once
and<00:01:30.930> they<00:01:31.079> just<00:01:31.460> they<00:01:32.460> crumbled<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.930> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
and they just they crumbled so this is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.499 
and they just they crumbled so this is
just<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.650> thin<00:01:35.090> metal<00:01:36.090> wire<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.479> I

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
just some like thin metal wire that I

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.219 
just some like thin metal wire that I
found<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> hobby<00:01:37.259> store<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.869> bends

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
found it the hobby store but it it bends

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.510 
found it the hobby store but it it bends
so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.770> can't<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> next<00:01:43.020> thing<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.530> you

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
so I can't use that so next thing is you

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
so I can't use that so next thing is you
probably<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.060> there's<00:01:45.270> nice<00:01:45.450> thing

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.880 
of this thing is it's so bright it would
be<00:02:02.939> light<00:02:03.180> up<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.540> solid<00:02:03.899> dark<00:02:04.200> room<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.710> it's

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
be light up a solid dark room like it's

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.990 
be light up a solid dark room like it's
got<00:02:05.070> lights<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.909> so<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.450> thing<00:02:07.380> is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
got lights on in there so that thing is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.219 
got lights on in there so that thing is
amazing<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.209> think<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> about<00:02:09.690> 50<00:02:10.080> bucks

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
amazing and I think it's about 50 bucks

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.540 
amazing and I think it's about 50 bucks
and<00:02:11.099> fifty<00:02:11.430> five<00:02:11.610> maybe

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
and fifty five maybe

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.310 
and fifty five maybe
but<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.210> definitely<00:02:13.450> worth<00:02:13.780> it<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
but it's definitely worth it and it

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
test my techno that's pretty much how it

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.290 
test my techno that's pretty much how it
feels<00:04:07.420> like<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:09.580> makes<00:04:09.760> it<00:04:09.880> handle<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> whole

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
feels like it makes it handle a whole

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.660 
feels like it makes it handle a whole
lot<00:04:10.510> better<00:04:10.660> it's<00:04:10.900> not<00:04:11.080> as<00:04:11.260> leaning<00:04:12.190> over<00:04:12.310> all

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
lot better it's not as leaning over all

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.160 
lot better it's not as leaning over all
the<00:04:12.760> time<00:04:12.940> I<00:04:13.300> mean<00:04:13.480> it's<00:04:13.660> still<00:04:13.780> got<00:04:14.020> a<00:04:14.050> little

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
the time I mean it's still got a little

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.199 
the time I mean it's still got a little
bit<00:04:14.380> of<00:04:14.500> body<00:04:14.620> roll<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.070> corners<00:04:15.100> but<00:04:16.090> it

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
bit of body roll in the corners but it

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.640 
bit of body roll in the corners but it
feels<00:04:16.419> more<00:04:16.600> planted<00:04:17.080> because<00:04:17.260> it's<00:04:17.410> not

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
feels more planted because it's not

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.070 
feels more planted because it's not
losing<00:04:18.430> traction<00:04:18.850> from<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.419> tired<00:04:19.660> lifting

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.080 
losing traction from the tired lifting

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.690 
losing traction from the tired lifting
up<00:04:20.230> slightly<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:22.530> yeah<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.770> can't<00:04:24.010> drive<00:04:24.190> faster

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
up slightly so yeah I can't drive faster

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.030 
up slightly so yeah I can't drive faster
with<00:04:24.850> the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
with the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.130 
with the
hanging<00:04:25.280> on<00:04:25.400> and<00:04:26.390> feels<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.810> little<00:04:26.900> bit<00:04:27.080> more

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
hanging on and feels a little bit more

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.650 
hanging on and feels a little bit more
hideout<00:04:27.680> so<00:04:27.860> that<00:04:28.100> was<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.280> great<00:04:28.520> upgrade<00:04:29.420> I
