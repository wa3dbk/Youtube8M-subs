00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 the craft the economic power of 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.000
 next door 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.719
 We all know the steering wheel from the car 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.010
 but until it is time must be such 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.240
 model to be designed 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.220
 and that happens in the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.490
 production halls of the company model and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 Forming of reus in black roof one of the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.119
 nationwide best technical 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.380
 modellbauer is bernd richter im 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 performance competition of the German 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.090
 he has the handicraft this year 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 Germany won victory 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.930
 Mister judge what fascinates you so much 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 at the profession of the technical modeller as 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.840
 First of all what all craftsmen 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.070
 fascinated and that at the end of the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.290
 week or at the end of the day 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.670
 finished in the finished article in hand 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.210
 stops and on which one is actually 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.440
 always second, the accuracy 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.140
 in model making in any case 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.420
 and third, the different ones 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.600
 materials what we use here wood 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.160
 Metal plastic for example enough 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.289
 So technical model makers need 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 fingertip craftsmanship 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.989
 skill and above all else 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.869
 work in detail 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.640
 I am now driving a wheel off the 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.720
 eyes before that with an ass over 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.049
 touched so I know where this ends 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.820
 And so I stop the erratic 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.409
 we can become bigger 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.990
 then I am with the file 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.509
 We have gone and we have already 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.640
 rounded and then with a bit 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.789
 sleep sandpaper and after that will 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.010
 measured whether the advice is right 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.090
 fit 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.290
 that bernd judge in the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.090
 performance competition of the German 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.400
 craft so successful this year 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.320
 was, of course, his 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.030
 training company 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.950
 Mr. Lamprecht sure the 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.110
 training master what they lay completely 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.690
 especially big value we put big 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.040
 value on spatial imagination 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.140
 Accuracy of work and fun at the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.380
 work what draws now the job 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.090
 of the technical modellers what 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.950
 especially it makes us many 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.360
 different materials and constantly 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.360
 changing employment policy areas 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.280
 Frau Engelhardt how to wait successfully 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.920
 the performance competition this year 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.709
 he was very successful again 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.910
 116 appointed at federal level winner 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.770
 been found 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.690
 and we were able to undertake new ones 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.800
 invoke a placement at the federal level 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.540
 take 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.810
 among others here in the profession of technical 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.490
 modellers yes and with these 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.180
 I give interesting information 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.180
 back to the studio 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.450
 the craft the economic power of 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.450
 next door
