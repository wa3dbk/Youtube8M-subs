00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello I want a tough one today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.610
 make a cup with you and that one 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.400
 very simple big there at the back of the head 

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.300
 year should be lured for as 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 Mine are already a bit 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.609
 kept out is already two days in there 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.439
 they should have been chosen that way 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.539
 luck I have to be extreme 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.060
 that's about as little less 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.590
 also okay we need two rubber bands 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 and then we need open or 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.370
 closed hanna and jan so i have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.640
 I made such a zigzag side that 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 You can vary the one you want and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.730
 you can also do everything backwards 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.260
 but we are going to start here now 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:49.789
 in the back so a small pad so with 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.789
 this one is just off the back 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.720
 You always have to be a bit funny 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:06.430
 if you are curious we do not have it 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:14.590
 enough I can do this around smooth and 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:16.840
 then I just do it just like that 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.000
 a bit already 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.110
 has volume and kim the above again 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.630
 smooth as it is not missing so that 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.670
 even backwards everything gives and 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.300
 Then I just came in style 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 or that can do with his fingers 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.750
 Just turn it on behind because you're in 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.140
 back down we make us two 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.140
 counter 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.000
 and it was still up here 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.220
 little luck and we just have it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 a pretty high 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.890
 We have to have a really high ponytail 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.890
 would do 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.280
 and here we can have a 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.280
 little luck 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.530
 so 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.370
 like the little kids we did 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.150
 earlier, no girl and here 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.150
 we do the same 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.540
 and should be the same height at about 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.010
 so now we go after 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.720
 behind and I'll show you the back 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.239
 turned like back and relate is as 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:36.420
 Once again a bit hard and then 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:36.420
 we turn that was like that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:46.260
 Turning and turning is all right 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:51.920
 happy and in the last tip 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.920
 and pull so long 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.970
 develop it around the move around 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.030
 under firm is with color 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.590
 and the two rubber bands too 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 you have to move the hall to hide 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.720
 I have to pull the head around and 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.720
 Here we do the same 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.669
 and just wrapped it here as a 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.669
 little 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.140
 and now you go to the mirror and look 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.750
 That's how it goes on 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.750
 you had imagined that 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.319
 that's how the whole country looks like 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:55.259
 I still have a small deco needle 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:07:04.000
 reingemacht 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:06.870
 so really big bushido yes 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.460
 that's him from the beginning now 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.229
 So I think with the zick side made 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.550
 it's a bit more 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:18.750
 It's pretty tight up here 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:21.639
 You just have to stretch this 

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.020
 hairstyles without really much volume so 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.569
 only up here is it just like that 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:29.590
 the volume goes down smoothly 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:30.699
 upholstery that was the hairstyle and I hope 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.039
 you liked it if it was you 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.229
 then please give me another car 

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:37.870
 or write me comments below 

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:38.849

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:42.280
 Not 

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:44.650
 Anything else and then take a look 

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.289

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:58.440
