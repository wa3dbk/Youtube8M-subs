computer today there's no battery on
this<00:01:42.170> thing<00:01:42.380> obviously<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.940> would<00:01:44.030> take<00:01:44.180> a<00:01:44.210> lot

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
this thing obviously it would take a lot

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.890 
this thing obviously it would take a lot
of<00:01:44.510> power<00:01:44.780> and<00:01:45.050> battery<00:01:45.260> to<00:01:46.240> transport<00:01:47.240> or<00:01:47.570> to

got<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> good<00:02:31.400> deal<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.790> thing<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.120> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
got a good deal on this thing so I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.720 
got a good deal on this thing so I
decided<00:02:32.450> by<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:33.100> maybe<00:02:34.100> I'll<00:02:34.250> even<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:34.520> able<00:02:34.610> to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
decided by it maybe I'll even be able to

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.660 
decided by it maybe I'll even be able to
test<00:02:34.940> something<00:02:35.120> on<00:02:35.330> it<00:02:35.420> one<00:02:35.540> day
