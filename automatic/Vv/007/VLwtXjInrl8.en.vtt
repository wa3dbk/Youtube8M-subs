it and you strain it meaning you know
just<00:00:48.809> soak<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> pots<00:00:50.370> over<00:00:50.610> like<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> strainer

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
so that the actual sea moss which is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.189 
so that the actual sea moss which is
this<00:00:54.480> stuff<00:00:54.780> does<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.770> come<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.300> out

for up to two weeks and just have it as
what<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:07.979> will<00:01:08.250> grow<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> do

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
what I will grow and so what you can do

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.719 
what I will grow and so what you can do
is<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.170> take<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.159> as<00:01:11.580> you

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
is just take a little bit of it as you

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.330 
is just take a little bit of it as you
can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.360> put<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.290> your<00:01:13.530> blender<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
can see and put it in your blender and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
can see and put it in your blender and
it<00:01:14.880> goes<00:01:15.119> great<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.869> would<00:01:16.049> definitely

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it goes great I would definitely

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.760 
it goes great I would definitely
recommend<00:01:16.790> putting<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.090> or<00:01:18.390> having<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.140> scoop

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
recommend putting this or having a scoop

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.240 
recommend putting this or having a scoop
of<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:21.299> juice<00:01:21.630> type<00:01:21.990> form<00:01:22.439> every<00:01:23.100> day

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
of that in a juice type form every day

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.149 
of that in a juice type form every day
because<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> all<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.720> nutrients<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.409> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
because of all of the nutrients in it so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.440 
because of all of the nutrients in it so
how<00:01:26.340> about<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.759> ahead<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.060> get<00:01:27.240> started

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
how about we go ahead and get started

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.330 
how about we go ahead and get started
now<00:01:27.780> I'm<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.350> ahead<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.740> grab<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
hip milk so you're going to see me off

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:39.160 
hip milk so you're going to see me off
camera<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.700> just

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so we're back with our video hmmm now

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.880 
so we're back with our video hmmm now
head<00:01:44.130> milk<00:01:44.429> is<00:01:45.140> definitely<00:01:46.140> my<00:01:46.469> preferred

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
head milk is definitely my preferred

out<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.530> well<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:57.020> we<00:01:58.020> had<00:01:58.200> tried

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
out of well I know and we had tried

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:00.859 
out of well I know and we had tried
right<00:01:59.009> swings<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> while<00:01:59.819> it<00:02:00.689> was

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
right swings for a while it was

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.469 
right swings for a while it was
mucus-forming<00:02:01.289> we<00:02:01.829> found<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.280> we<00:02:02.429> were

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479
