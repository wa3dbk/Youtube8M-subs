 and welcome to 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.500
 a new time 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.420
 stainless steel so this one is all 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.800
 last in the range 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:27.540
 this is the victorinox hunter xt so here 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.540
 I present you immediately 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.380
 so let's go for the presentation of 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.010
 this knife so the hunter xt2 at 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.350
 victorinox 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.820
 so here is a knife oriented for the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.390
 hunting is a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.630
 a knife that was planned for this 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.440
 departure then I'm not saying who will serve 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.950
 only to hunters 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.460
 I'm not a hunter at all and I 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.379
 know he serve me and not a problem 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.900
 well here it is very very very very 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.550
 basic in his duties there are four 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.710
 functions on you have not go 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.970
 look far with that but it's the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 four most useful functions I 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.340
 so find here you have the big 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.160
 Germany hand market devoid of these 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.180
 rations this one has the opposite of the blades of the 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.470
 risk youtube and Swiss soldier that 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.000
 I introduced you in other videos 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.009
 I will put you the links in the 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 description if you want it here 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:28.280
 you always have the leader the very ock 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:31.220
 effective frankly this is razor for 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.210
 this lady so really no worries her 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:41.600
 cut on the other side and the curvaceous blade 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.399
 with her rations so here she is 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.189
 to really steer for the hunt 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.869
 according to them it would be to eviscerate the 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.780
 game so you can dump your 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.740
 game directly on site 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.420
 there is no worry its cut 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.680
 royally you can cut rope 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.180
 clothes a seatbelt 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 with that you can find what you 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:09.500
 do you want to have a better look too 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.200
 on this lan here it is in the middle of 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.350
 you've got a big one so always 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.250
 as effective 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.950
 if you want to see how she 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.700
 works I still refer you to the 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.049
 video of the Swiss soldiers knife 2008 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.140
 it's exactly the same as the one 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:31.459
 so you'll see that it's very 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.079
 effective this problem dough is the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.160
 last function you have a screwdriver 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.610
 cruciform to you russia form a pull 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.980
 plug 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.470
 it is on the Swiss soldier that you have 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.980
 a reform program 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.510
 this is because the soldiers have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 not allowed to drink his land 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.209
 conquered places that a screwdriver 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.750
 so here is very simple the little ring 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.340
 same with a little strap that 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.860
 I will rush to change because 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.060
 it does not help much 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.420
 it's too short still nothing to do with 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.010
 that I'm going to pass his hand so here is 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.910
 so it's a knife that are trying 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.640
 part of the range of 111 mm it makes 34 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.670
 5 wide because of the openings a 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.750
 hand it is 2 cm thick for a 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.910
 weight of 147 g really not heavy to 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.260
 put in a case of course that you 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.670
 can not see her in your pocket is 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.470
 Too heavy Too heavy too heavy 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.820
 it's too big especially too big 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:33.350
 so it will have to provide you in a 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.000
 small case to wear it at the waist 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.890
 or you slip into a bag 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.380
 that's really not a concern by 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.020
 against but to put in the pocket 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.260
 it is part of the biggest range 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:51.410
 victorinox knives in swiss army knife 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:54.530
 of course so it's better to buy a 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.040
 holster with mine should happen the 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.140
 ordered 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.220
 so I will show you also in a 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.870
 next video the sleeve with the little 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.110
 and victorinox cooking wanted to 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:10.060
 the interior is exactly the same 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.950
 more urgent flu of Swiss soldiers 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.140
 on this one 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:19.850
 the grip is exactly the same it 's 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:21.859
 bi matter so it's not slipping 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.360
 you take it well in hand no problem 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.970
 to remake the lips 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.860
 it's a problem blake could 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.840
 to work on it without problem 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.520
 really at the top this game very very well 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.270
 so here is a little knife to have very 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.580
 nice yet not many functions 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.200
 but really for me the essentials 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.190
 which I advise you 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.260
 I found them me 35 euros on 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.810
 internet in general it is no longer around 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.370
 40 42 euros so here it is necessary 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:58.800
 look for a little bit of a site I think 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.780
 that on the cutlery Touraine and 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.340
 not too expensive I think he likes 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.860
 quarantine euros otherwise you have to look 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.010
 on amazon but good amazon it's 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:12.860
 always the same it also depends on 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.790
 two where they provide themselves so here 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.260
 I advise you anyway this little 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.070
 really nice knife 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.280
 I think long but enough 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:28.830
 regularly with me out 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:30.330
 so still a very good knife of theirs 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.000
 share this is the last model that is 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.870
 out I'm very happy yet 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.130
 coupons I will see this sesame 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.440
 I will still make you a little 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.030
 demonstration at the blade level for 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.500
 show you that women the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.360
 victorinox design is still at 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:50.450
 top so the pan of the mli this slobbering of 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.450
 the foam 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.280
 expected to miss it intersects ago 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.260
 no worries on the cutting edge 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.650
 razor as usual and the little one 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.650
 maceration 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:25.120
 so here is still very very 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.710
 satisfied with this knife the quality is 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.200
 still at the rendezvous as usual 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.510
 at victor innovates so if you are looking for 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.340
 a little knife not a lot of 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.170
 lightweight functions still had a 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.000
 good grip because I have 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:38.050
 still big hands and that's 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.710
 true that times on the knives 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:42.100
 classical 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:44.230
 the models in 91 mm is a little short 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.940
 for me so for small jobs of 

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.620
 every day and it's really serene 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.140
 in one at death or even me I have them 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.940
 always in my pocket 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:54.010
 that's fine but if you have to be 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.090
 against bigger work ben deal 

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.860
 I advise you this one which is 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.330
 really not bad 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:01.260
 after as I showed you there is 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:04.169
 no of his Swiss army knife you have 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:10.120
 a Swiss soldier you still have 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:11.820
 all that is down the products of them 

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:14.890
 parts of usually so the can opener 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.520
 and the flat screwdriver of the capsules of 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.910
 reference 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.620
 there they did not really put they are 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.740
 really went to the basics for the 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:27.340
 hunter the hunter is supposed to provide 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:30.910
 all you need to drink a shot there 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:33.340
 is really very simple in his 

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:36.100
 design is really pretty where I 

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.660
 find beautiful the color more great if we 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.770
 dropped into the grass in the green 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:41.710
 etc to find it 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.930
 it's great so really a great knife 

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.750
 I'm still very satisfied here 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:49.360
 completes my collection 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:50.650
 and so listen, that's all that 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.320
 I had to tell you about this little knife 

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.700
 if you have more questions like 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.190
