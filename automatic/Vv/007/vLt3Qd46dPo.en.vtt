 Economics of good university 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.730
 air a race with a clear 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.580
 training in mathematics and models 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.650
 predictive without neglecting the strong 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900

 finances 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.510
 looking for applications that generate value

 Actuary's career is well recognized 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.070
 nationally and internationally and it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.320
 characterized by the flexibility to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 address problems that affect various 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.989
 disciplines going through finance the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.329
 logistics and planning from a

 strongly analytical perspective 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.549
 and an actuary can perform in a 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.090
 multiplicity of public organizations 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:11.479

 quantitative 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.320
 it's about looking for patterns of 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.600
 behavior that allow applications 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 that generate greater efficiency in the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.180
 management 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.790
 in a financial institution will be dealt with 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.090
 frauds and conformation of portfolios of 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.040
 investment in an insurer will seek

 people and companies ending then 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:51.740
 the cost of them according to the

 established benefits will drive well 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.870
 an integral approach that guarantees the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.300
 profitability and solvency in the long 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.460
 term 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.710
 in the public sector among others 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.900
 activities will deal with the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.720
 projections related to the forecast 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.570
