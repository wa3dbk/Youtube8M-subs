00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.390 
link down below of my review of the Zen
wig<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.569> color<00:02:17.810> if<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.590> Zen<00:02:18.860> wake<00:02:19.129> was

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
wig in this color if the Zen wake was

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.670 
wig in this color if the Zen wake was
not<00:02:19.610> thick<00:02:19.939> enough<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:20.239> you<00:02:20.720> then<00:02:21.200> this<00:02:21.470> is

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
not thick enough for you then this is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.649 
not thick enough for you then this is
definitely<00:02:21.890> an<00:02:22.250> alternate<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.389> Zen

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
definitely an alternate because the Zen

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:24.090 
definitely an alternate because the Zen
way

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
way

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.000 
way
um<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:25.510> doesn't<00:02:25.780> come<00:02:26.050> with<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> lot<00:02:26.320> of<00:02:26.500> parting

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
um it doesn't come with a lot of parting

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.680 
um it doesn't come with a lot of parting

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
this review I am thinking about cutting

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.229 
this review I am thinking about cutting
this<00:03:48.989> hair<00:03:49.379> I'm<00:03:50.069> thinking<00:03:50.459> about<00:03:50.549> cutting<00:03:51.060> it

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
this hair I'm thinking about cutting it

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.759 
this hair I'm thinking about cutting it
maybe<00:03:51.959> two<00:03:52.670> armpit<00:03:53.670> links<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.530> then<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.590> was

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
maybe two armpit links and then I was

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.740 
maybe two armpit links and then I was
also<00:03:56.069> thinking<00:03:56.250> about<00:03:56.459> using<00:03:56.970> some<00:03:57.239> heat<00:03:57.540> on

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
also thinking about using some heat on

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.539 
also thinking about using some heat on
this<00:03:57.959> hair<00:03:58.170> because<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.470> think<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.859> could<00:03:59.069> use<00:03:59.099> a

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
this hair because I think it could use a

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.240 
this hair because I think it could use a
little<00:04:00.150> bit<00:04:00.420> of<00:04:00.629> styling<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.590> little<00:04:01.829> bit<00:04:01.980> of

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
little bit of styling a little bit of

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.879 
little bit of styling a little bit of

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
body even though I love it I think it

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.580 
body even though I love it I think it
could<00:04:05.159> use<00:04:05.189> just<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.879> little<00:04:05.909> bit<00:04:06.389> of<00:04:06.629> my<00:04:07.379> own

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
could use just a little bit of my own

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.250 
could use just a little bit of my own
