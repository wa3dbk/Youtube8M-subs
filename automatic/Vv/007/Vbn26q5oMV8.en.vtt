the tongue cooker is actually creating

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.320 
the tongue cooker is actually creating
that<00:02:10.879> sound<00:02:11.590> and<00:02:12.590> then<00:02:13.310> if<00:02:13.550> you<00:02:13.670> stop<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.180> air

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
that sound and then if you stop the air

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.570 
that sound and then if you stop the air
there<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:14.840> same<00:02:15.080> manner<00:02:15.380> as<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.400> did

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
there in the same manner as I just did

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:17.320 
there in the same manner as I just did
with<00:02:16.730> the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
with the tote if we go koala okay there

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.000 
with the tote if we go koala okay there
the<00:02:24.320> airs<00:02:24.500> caught<00:02:26.020> behind<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:28.160> tongue<00:02:29.200> at<00:02:30.200> the

the mouth the the back of the tongue is

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.130 
the mouth the the back of the tongue is
basically<00:02:38.060> hitting<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.480> roof<00:02:38.660> of<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.960> mouth

that's the sound that makes hence the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.720 
that's the sound that makes hence the
idea<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.730> we<00:02:52.940> took<00:02:53.300> Tucker<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.320> there's<00:02:54.950> we

idea that we took Tucker and there's we

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.190 
idea that we took Tucker and there's we
could<00:02:55.910> talk<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.360> hours<00:02:56.390> and<00:02:56.810> read<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.959> lot<00:02:57.110> of

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
I don't want to get into that if we've

I don't want to get into that if we've
got<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:05.990> release<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.709> air<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.990> happening

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
got the release of the air the happening

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.280 
got the release of the air the happening
and<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.010> lips<00:03:10.220> are<00:03:10.400> relaxed<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:12.110> airs

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
and the lips are relaxed the the airs

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.100 
and the lips are relaxed the the airs
got<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.680> strike<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.160> lips<00:03:14.140> and<00:03:16.540> okay<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.930> same

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
got to strike the lips and okay the same

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.810 
got to strike the lips and okay the same
thing<00:03:18.320> is<00:03:18.410> happening<00:03:18.440> now<00:03:19.130> clearly<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.640> back

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
thing is happening now clearly the back

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.520 
thing is happening now clearly the back
of<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.180> tongue<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.780> further<00:03:21.260> back<00:03:21.470> from

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
of the tongue is further back from

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.840 
of the tongue is further back from
further<00:03:22.310> away<00:03:22.459> from<00:03:22.640> the<00:03:23.450> lips<00:03:24.280> then<00:03:25.280> the<00:03:25.640> four

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
further away from the lips then the four

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:27.610 
further away from the lips then the four
parties<00:03:26.330> so<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.660> air<00:03:26.780> has<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:27.050> travel<00:03:27.320> further

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
parties so the air has to travel further

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.040 
parties so the air has to travel further
after<00:03:28.220> release<00:03:28.580> that's<00:03:29.360> why<00:03:29.630> there's<00:03:29.870> that

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
after release that's why there's that

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.280 
after release that's why there's that
little<00:03:30.380> gap<00:03:30.830> in<00:03:31.100> time<00:03:32.090> from<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.600> release<00:03:33.050> so

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
little gap in time from the release so

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.370 
little gap in time from the release so
the<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:34.130> sound<00:03:34.459> quality<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.239> often<00:03:36.050> not<00:03:36.230> as

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
the the sound quality is often not as

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.340 
the the sound quality is often not as
good<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:39.220> on<00:03:40.220> the<00:03:40.850> k<00:03:41.150> part<00:03:41.480> of<00:03:41.630> the<00:03:41.840> the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
good on the on the k part of the the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.340 
good on the on the k part of the the
double<00:03:42.830> tongue<00:03:43.040> then<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.550> the<00:03:44.450> top<00:03:44.750> part<00:03:45.110> so

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
double tongue then the the top part so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.160 
double tongue then the the top part so
we<00:03:46.190> need<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.430> practice<00:03:46.550> that<00:03:46.910> more<00:03:47.090> because<00:03:47.750> in

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
we need to practice that more because in

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.800 
we need to practice that more because in
the<00:03:48.620> body<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.010> can<00:03:49.040> try<00:03:49.370> it<00:03:49.430> now<00:03:49.810> yeah

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
the body you can try it now yeah

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.290 
the body you can try it now yeah
co-co-co<00:03:51.440> co-co-co<00:03:51.890> co-co-co<00:03:52.340> then

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
co-co-co co-co-co co-co-co then

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.010 
co-co-co co-co-co co-co-co then
disengage<00:03:53.900> the<00:03:54.290> vocal<00:03:54.590> cords

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:06.140 

start<00:04:01.020> off<00:04:01.140> slowly<00:04:04.970> okay

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
start off slowly okay

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.610 
start off slowly okay
we're<00:04:06.390> training<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> body<00:04:06.960> remember<00:04:07.470> we're

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
we're training the body remember we're

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.520 
we're training the body remember we're
reprogramming<00:04:08.040> what<00:04:08.550> our<00:04:09.210> machine<00:04:09.720> does<00:04:09.960> then

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
reprogramming what our machine does then

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.810 
reprogramming what our machine does then
we<00:04:10.650> can<00:04:10.800> add<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.070> instrument<00:04:11.520> and<00:04:11.610> this<00:04:11.670> is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
we can add the instrument and this is

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.390 
we can add the instrument and this is
where<00:04:11.970> people<00:04:12.300> find<00:04:12.600> it<00:04:13.200> quite<00:04:13.590> difficult<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
where people find it quite difficult to

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.610 
where people find it quite difficult to
to<00:04:15.270> do<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.510> on<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.690> instrument<00:04:16.140> because<00:04:16.470> all

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
to do it on the instrument because all

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.170 
to do it on the instrument because all
of<00:04:16.680> a<00:04:16.829> sudden<00:04:17.100> you'll<00:04:17.220> find<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:17.850> choke

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
of a sudden you'll find that you choke

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.050 
of a sudden you'll find that you choke
up<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:18.600> start<00:04:18.870> over<00:04:18.989> blowing<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:20.250> get<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.670> cut

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
up and start over blowing to get the cut

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.080 
up and start over blowing to get the cut
happening<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.140> then<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.350> get<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.880> kind<00:04:23.880> of

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
happening you and then you get a kind of

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.420 
happening you and then you get a kind of
thing<00:04:24.390> going<00:04:24.600> on<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:26.210> how<00:04:27.210> do<00:04:27.270> we<00:04:27.420> approach

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
thing going on so how do we approach

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.260 
thing going on so how do we approach
adding<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> instrument<00:04:31.610> visualizer<00:04:32.610> the

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
adding the instrument visualizer the

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.830 
adding the instrument visualizer the
best<00:04:34.140> tool<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.620> can<00:04:34.740> use<00:04:35.840> we're

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
best tool that you can use we're

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.750 
best tool that you can use we're
training<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.650> body<00:04:37.770> to<00:04:38.460> learn<00:04:38.640> a<00:04:38.669> new

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.610 
technique so let's understand it then
we'll<00:04:42.000> add<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.120> instrument<00:04:42.690> so<00:04:43.169> we<00:04:43.290> find<00:04:43.500> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
we'll add the instrument so we find the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.750 
we'll add the instrument so we find the
airstream<00:04:44.040> backswing<00:04:44.669> release<00:04:49.370> just<00:04:50.370> change

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
airstream backswing release just change

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.420 
airstream backswing release just change
become<00:04:51.360> aware<00:04:51.840> of<00:04:51.900> the<00:04:52.169> feeling<00:04:52.560> of<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.800> then

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
become aware of the feeling of it then

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.250 
become aware of the feeling of it then
add<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.120> visualizer<00:04:54.570> your<00:04:54.840> air<00:04:54.960> streams

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
add the visualizer your air streams

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.590 
add the visualizer your air streams
coming<00:04:55.650> out<00:04:55.800> you've<00:04:56.040> watched<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.520> the

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
coming out you've watched the the

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.720 
coming out you've watched the the
backswing<00:04:57.600> and<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.800> slingshot<00:04:59.370> videos

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
backswing and the the slingshot videos

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:10.600 
backswing and the the slingshot videos
so<00:05:00.450> we've<00:05:00.630> worked<00:05:00.840> on<00:05:01.110> getting<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.530> air<00:05:01.680> out

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.580 

now<00:05:11.610> the<00:05:12.030> great<00:05:12.330> thing<00:05:12.360> about<00:05:12.690> doing<00:05:13.050> double

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
now the great thing about doing double

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.140 
now the great thing about doing double
tonguing<00:05:13.830> when<00:05:14.130> it<00:05:14.250> comes<00:05:14.490> to<00:05:14.669> all<00:05:14.850> of<00:05:15.030> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
tonguing when it comes to all of the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.000 
tonguing when it comes to all of the
exercises<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:15.810> you're<00:05:16.020> doing<00:05:16.320> is<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.860> you

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
exercises that you're doing is that you

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.219 
exercises that you're doing is that you
really<00:05:17.520> can't<00:05:17.850> force<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.479> air<00:05:18.660> because

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
really can't force the air because

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.080 
really can't force the air because
you'll<00:05:19.410> find<00:05:19.650> that<00:05:19.979> you'll<00:05:20.160> choke<00:05:20.460> up<00:05:20.729> if<00:05:20.940> you

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
you'll find that you'll choke up if you

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.909 
you'll find that you'll choke up if you
push<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.660> air<00:05:21.840> on<00:05:22.110> your<00:05:22.800> cook<00:05:23.340> tongue<00:05:23.700> so

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
push the air on your cook tongue so

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.710 
push the air on your cook tongue so
really<00:05:25.919> focus<00:05:26.400> on<00:05:26.610> a<00:05:26.850> mop<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.240> body<00:05:27.419> is<00:05:27.540> doing

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
really focus on a mop the body is doing

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.790 
really focus on a mop the body is doing
support<00:05:28.470> don't<00:05:28.860> force<00:05:29.310> and<00:05:29.960> then<00:05:30.960> once<00:05:31.470> you've

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
support don't force and then once you've

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.940 
support don't force and then once you've
used<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.610> visualizer<00:05:33.320> they<00:05:34.320> forget<00:05:34.650> down<00:05:34.800> at

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
used the visualizer they forget down at

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.800 
used the visualizer they forget down at
the<00:05:35.070> top<00:05:35.280> chops<00:05:35.729> tighten<00:05:36.120> up<00:05:36.180> keep<00:05:36.570> the<00:05:36.690> air
