00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:07.770
 welcome back to the hobbit 8 video channel 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.599
 dot com this is a very short guide 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.080
 that goes to conclude that already 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:16.369
 started on the site precisely on 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:21.240
 my site hobbit 8 point com concerning 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.580
 reinstalling the overwrite one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.730
 of your own imei code on a 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.750
 device that deleted the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:34.070
 folder and fs for those who have al 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:40.430
 moment a samsung galaxy s2 device 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 without the imei code I invite you to follow 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 the guides you find online pro porto 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.420
 concerns the restoration of a possible 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.370
 backup or if you have not done any 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.250
 backup and you have no backup file 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.340
 of the fs folder to go to the site 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.280
 hobbit 8 com point where it will be released soon 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.309
 the guide on how to solve this 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.830
 problem of which this video is second 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.960
 passage if instead the i mei you have is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.799
 changed is different from your imei 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.369
 original and starts with 000 49 not me 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.430
 I remember how many zeros there are before 49 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.619
 then you can also simply 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.360
 just follow this video 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.220
 obviously as I have already written in the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.850
 guide assumes that at this point 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.860
 you have a folder and fse a 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 device already rooted 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.770
 for those coming from the guide in this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:46.940
 moment you have on the android device 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:50.900
 to version 2.3.4 or 2.4.4 anyway 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:56.180
 a version in giving 2.0 onwards no 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 from 246 go then google because 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.670
 at this point we have to download 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.460
 the last program we need for 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.670
 complete the guide and it is the only expense 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.750
 which you will have to perform we search on 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.380
 google srs samsung which stands for samsung 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.560
 remote server and the first result that 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.130
 we find is what we need 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:25.790
 select the samsung i9100 from above 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.670
 which is none other than samsung galaxy s2 e 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 we choose the second product that is the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.170
 samsung ripe by cable we can use 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.270
 of the 10 percent discount 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.910
 simply by sharing the page on 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.120
 facebook twitter or other social networks 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.010
 once done this we will get the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.650
 mail with the code 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.530
 no maybe an on-screen notification with the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.770
 discount code we insert and do 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.320
 apply at this point we can buy 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.330
 the license we will insert our e-mail e 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.209
 we will email on our non 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.760
 user with our password and we can 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.500
 download the samsung and remote unlock 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.030
 line 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.880
 the samsung rim server installer 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.160
 once downloaded the installer is 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.790
 installed the program we will find ourselves 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:21.459
 in front of this software that I am now 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.459
 throwing it here 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.409
 at this point it will be necessary to insert 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.549
 the username and password with 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.870
 the account we purchased in 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.340
 I can't do this right now 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.349
 see why I already performed 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.610
 the operation on my samsung therefore not 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.470
 I have more credits because what 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.400
 buy a credit that you need for 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.349
 do this only once 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.340
 username I'm going to use 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:50.440
 simply the test one that there is 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.909
 gives the possibility to operate but 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.290
 at least it gives us the chance to 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:58.090
 see how the software works 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.329
 at this point we must select 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:07.019
 from the list our phone then 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:09.519
 even here i9100 and clicking on re scan 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:13.480
 will appear where you now see cars e 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:16.720
 auto the doors of the computer ports 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.930
 to which we attacked the galaxy not 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.940
 will be 55 66 independently 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.010
 the important thing here then is a number in 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.020
 so that you know he found the 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.090
 phone here obviously gives me an error 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.760
 saying he found no door 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.610
 com on my pc this because at the moment 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.099
 the gala came off once 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:44.620
 done this you will have to click on 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:46.419
 advanced options and click on ok and vi 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.699
 it will open now me not doing it because 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.830
 obviously with the test with the account of 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:53.289
 head you can't do it always was me 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.320
 a small window below where 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:05:00.370
 you can insert the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:03.039
 imei code on the right the serial 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.760
 number and with a button more or less at 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.280
 center from which you can go to 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.340
 launch the repair operation of the 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.830
 imei code what you need to do visa 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.490
 that if you don't have the code imei not 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.979
 you don't even have the serial number is 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.830
 first recover this data from the 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.169
 battery compartment of your device o 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.990
 on the box 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.930
 both you and the serial number enter 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.680
 both data and launch the 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.349
 repair 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.279
 with this first step he will repair you 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:41.680
 just repeat the serial number 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:43.060
 a second time after the phone 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.340
 has rebooted 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.509
 this time though without entering the 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.389
 serial number enter only the meime 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:55.779
 relaunch the operation at this point 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.900
 repaired the mei you can take the 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:06:01.680
 phone and check always always 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.289
 by pressing the keypad 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.710
 asterisk number 06 the small gate 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:11.529
 and you can check if your email 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.870
 actually what is returned 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.819
 you had initially at this point 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.939
 you can safely enter the 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:22.240
 your sim card what I recommend 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:25.800
 I am immediately making a backup of the 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.210
 folder and fs so as to have it 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.490
 working the next time 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.439
 we hope not to happen to you a 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:38.379
 inconvenience of this kind 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:41.009
 you can use or the program for 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.009
 do the 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:47.840
 I don't get the name anyway it's not 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:51.189
 other than a file manager for 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.879
 android or I have downloaded this 

00:06:51.189 --> 00:06:59.120
 program that is called and fs however that 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:07:03.530
 you need to back up the 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:05.840
 folder and fs from pc the software that 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:10.939
 I meant before I am nothing but ruth 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:14.539
 explorer ruth explorer is an application 

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:17.750
 for a fee it costs 3 euros 59 vi 

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:19.219
 but I advise you to spend it because so much 

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.169
 if you change mobile with android 

00:07:19.219 --> 00:07:23.599
 through your account you can 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.940
 quietly recover it but it is a lot 

00:07:23.599 --> 00:07:28.129
 useful because through mourning explorer 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.300
 for example you can copy paste 

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:34.879
 of the folder and fs on the sd card without 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.909
 going to lose the permits of the 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:39.199
 folder because you used them 

00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:42.620
 any one any other method 

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:45.080
 you would go to copy the folder and fs but 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.940
 without the correct permissions so not 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.159
 you will then be able to go to 

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.199
 restore if the original one 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:53.000
 be canceled 

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:55.759
 at this point your phone and 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.400
 working you have backed up the 

00:07:55.759 --> 00:08:01.069
 folder and fs you can proceed to 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:04.789
 install an original firmware or not 

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.919
 more recent than the 2.4 point 3 I hope that 

00:08:04.789 --> 00:08:08.839
 the guide will be served to you if you need 

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:11.330
 to contact me you can do it through 

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:13.520
 the video or through my site 

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.550
 I greet you and hope to find you 

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:18.550
 back to the next guide or 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.550
