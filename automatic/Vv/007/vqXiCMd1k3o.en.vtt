00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
maybe if I think about it I think it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.800 
maybe if I think about it I think it
always<00:02:13.520> comes<00:02:13.880> back<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.180> opening<00:02:14.630> our<00:02:14.780> hearts

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
always comes back to opening our hearts

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.900 
always comes back to opening our hearts
yeah<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.710> always<00:02:15.920> comes<00:02:16.250> back<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.490> them<00:02:16.730> I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
yeah it always comes back to them I

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.670 
yeah it always comes back to them I
don't<00:02:17.570> think<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.900> do<00:02:17.960> a<00:02:17.990> backbend<00:02:18.230> without

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
don't think I can do a backbend without

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.100 
don't think I can do a backbend without
talking<00:02:19.010> about<00:02:19.040> opening<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.520> heart

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110
