 [Music] 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.840
 or half today we are going to make a vase 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:25.570
 with a plastic bottle you will see what 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.570
 fast that is done 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.310
 because it 's avenue right 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.310
 to be making an ashtray and I think so 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 let's cut the bottle where it is 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 the filter this 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.050
 and we are going to remove that bit 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.620
 sloth 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.440
 and know that we do not need anything either 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.980
 it needs a little bit of pasting 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.980
 let's do 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.300
 let's make some band-aids 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.100
 to avoid mistakes let's cut see 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.900
 that the bottle marks here one and the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.060
 other then let's make those strips and 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.630
 then the game in half we're going to 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.630
 get to this one 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.790
 this cleavage 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.330
 as it has already happened 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.599
 here 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.860
 and look 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.030
 Now this 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.030
 the other part 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.319
 and doing that 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.319
 the whole bottle when you have it 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.170
 and now what I'm doing is that we're going 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.459
 opening up so we go squeezing 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.459
 and we are folding 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:12.410
 we have everything open already cleaned with 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.410
 a piece of paper 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.420
 cleansed 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.170
 and now what we're going to do is catch 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.440
 a 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.920
 and we're going to double it and we're going to pass 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:32.540
 is the first one now we take this 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.830
 we left this and the tip we passed through 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.830
 below the security 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:44.720
 You see what's left and now we're going to 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.720
 cover 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.090
 and we are left like this, now we will pass it on 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.360
 above this but below 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.420
 is 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.790
 A) Yes 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.890
 and so we will be doing with all 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.239
 let's go looking for more or more 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.239
 less at the same height 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.379
 other 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.379
 [Music] 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.070
 A) Yes 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.350
 above the boot and below the 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.460
 2a 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.460
 and so we are going to do 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.410
 the last and the last what you are going to do 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:48.490
 double what we have here 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.240
 and well, well 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.099
 we have our vase if you want you 

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:12.740
 It's scary that you can escape, you can 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.740
 put a drop of glue 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.249
 but no 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.119
 that's how it is 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.119
 the canon 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.960
 if it looks better here 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:40.889
 I hope you liked the level that 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:45.090
 you today or you can use it as both 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:46.409
 put candy candies or as we have 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.270
 saying 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:51.970
 where our little flowers here 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.330
 and we will have a nice vase that looks 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.759
 of crisis 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.849
 I hope you liked the video that 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:01.310
 nice like you tell 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:03.340
 your comments and even the song 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.620
 goodbye 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:11.559
 ah 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:11.559
