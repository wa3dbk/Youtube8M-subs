 so we do not speak with any residue 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.940
 I've done hydration other times alone. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.770

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.770

 Look at him, he's good at the tips. 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.820
 because the part of the hair that is more 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.410
 old that suddenly you 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.140

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.600
 so look at it so he can pass the hand 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.450
 all this affection is part of the hair 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.170

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.879
 1 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.450
 when to rinse 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.060
 I did not want to spend shampoo I already had 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.170
 washed the shampoo before I had tried 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.840
 take every opening and then I passed 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.730
 with the senator, I have this oil of 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.880
 almonds I do not know if I'm going to use 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.740
 to produce very soft hair I think 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.140
 I will not pass almond oil all over the 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.110
 if anything less I spend 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.530
 I'll be right back to show you. 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.430
 After and after it's dry, it's okay. 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.020
 and also finalize which silk co-creations 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:04:01.460
 defined beached curls that I 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:04:05.480
 I'm still testing my hair back already 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:07.610
 it's super super soft, it 's okay I know 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.490
 that I had to stay with the girl 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.920
 diffuser had given me some time more 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.250
 I have to sleep so I want to say 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.920
 for you now in that moment that is the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:22.820
 my own favorite homemade when the 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:26.030
 my hair had left my hair 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:30.010
 very tasty very different even me 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:33.260
 I loved, I loved the touch so it's not coming out. 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.700
 Look at those things so our know 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.010
 type off 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.880
 there's nothing like that coming out of my 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.430
 hand I want to do it maybe once 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.560
 per month or every 15 days 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:49.070
 my hair is dry I want to repeat 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.890
 often only looks at this non-treatment 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.050
 only for people have the 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.390
 hair that curled in certain quarries 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.640
 your straight hair is also you not 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.580
 you need to make all the ingredients you 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.270
 I did if you want to make only the banana. 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:08.360
 and the avocado is also a good taco I 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.210
 I added coconut milk and honey 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.620
 to potentiate even if the hair is 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:17.810
 very oily already in the root does not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.409
 need to pass the root of the hair already 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:23.189
 have root well 

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:25.529
 is model oil does not need natural 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:27.899
 does not have this stage and there are many 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.269
 many benefits even and I 'm 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:34.649
 feeling this in my hair super happy 

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:36.419
 I even hope that you really dress 

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:39.479
 I already received a lot of people talking looks 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.929
 How is it to dry a bastard that she does 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.219
 and if I'm sure you're going to 

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:46.949
 doubling is really good 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:48.899
 If you liked I like kisses to 

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:51.379

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.379
