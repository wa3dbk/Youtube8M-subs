layer<00:02:01.439> 2<00:02:01.710> under<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:03.329> gradient<00:02:04.130> map<00:02:05.130> layer

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
layer 2 under this gradient map layer

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.210 
layer 2 under this gradient map layer
and<00:02:06.000> I<00:02:06.479> will<00:02:06.659> press<00:02:07.259> ctrl<00:02:07.799> J<00:02:09.410> to<00:02:10.410> make<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> copy

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and I will press ctrl J to make a copy

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.960 
and I will press ctrl J to make a copy
of<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:12.239> on<00:02:12.540> this<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:13.080> will<00:02:13.260> make

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
of this then on this I will make

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.120 
of this then on this I will make
layer<00:02:15.970> mask<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.660> remove<00:02:17.349> some<00:02:17.380> portion<00:02:17.980> from

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
layer mask to remove some portion from

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:38.270 
layer mask to remove some portion from
the<00:02:19.200> face

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.509 

so<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:40.150> got<00:02:40.420> final<00:02:41.379> result<00:02:42.040> from<00:02:42.220> all

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
so I have got final result from all

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.680 
so I have got final result from all
these<00:02:43.150> layers<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.959> is<00:02:44.170> me<00:02:45.160> for<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.540> is
