00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.660
 Welcome to the second part of the 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.360
 programming in the command line 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.070
 sometimes it can be useful entered 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.559
 to read in the keyboard 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.879
 There are tools we can do that first 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.340
 need to download 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:24.449
 We open our internet again 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.449
 browser and navigate to the page 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.930
 www.bahn.de or software we can the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 tools download here as a zip file 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.200
 brock 1 tools points after the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.239
 is completed we open our 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.450
 find windows explorer at downloads 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.520
 We download our file this 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.940
 we can copy with right-click 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 We copy them to a fixed location eg 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.190
 in our cover installation and the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.810
 is located under c program 86 java 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:15.119
 Here we create a new folder 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:18.630
 Insert with the name right click paste 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.940
 we here our folder a bizarre 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.920
 also we also need the prog 1 tools 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.750
 first announce our system 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.140
 open it again with right-click 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:34.229
 our system control and change ours 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:40.890
 environment variables we introduce a new one 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.539
 variable with the name glass and the value 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 the variable there we give first 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.740
 a point 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.110
 then a semicolon and then the place 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:58.220
 our castle 1 are stored 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:58.220
 in our case, percent program 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:27.140
 686 4 1 percent backslash java backslash 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:27.140
 away / rock 1.10 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.570
 the whole 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.400
 against us by clicking ok now 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.960
 we can go to control panel again 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.210
 finish testing to see if our bruck 1 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.940
 we are properly involved 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.690
 a small program eg under again 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.330
 open documents mainzer with right-click 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:58.280
 we have a new text document and call it 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:59.959
 this time around for the top 10 too 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.970
 we have to use this first 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.130
 We write ours before that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:17.600
 in front of our normal program code 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:19.540
 Import to Wise import printing 10.1 and 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.910
 confirm the whole with a semicolon 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.910
 Now follows our normal program code 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:39.040
 public clouds entering our method 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.040
 publicly active 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:11.700
 ramco tools offer you a number 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:28.949
 and our well-known system on print 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:39.180
 line statement with the text 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:39.180
 the incoming number is 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:49.900
 then we close ours again 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:58.000
 hover around and save ours 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:05:00.870
 program again with the ending after 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.280
 the tenants could close again 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 Now we call the command line again 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:19.420
 on with the command cmd and compile 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:23.230
 our program is 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:29.470
 we have to use composed music 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:32.080
 the command java input now we can 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.670
 from the in the console of the keyboard 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:40.620
 enter a number 5 and this number 5 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:40.620
 will be spent again in the console 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.410
 Now there are different possibilities 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.950
 but a little less complicated program 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.920
 to be able to 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.210
 so-called 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:55.000
 development environments as newcomers 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.260
 Variant is the ig to recommend for 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.540
 more professional users is the most suitable 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.340
 development environment eclipse at the 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.900
 using a normal editor like us 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.050
 you have done so far 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.890
 no additional functions 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.900
 Development environments help one 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.970
 the programming so that it clearly 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.280
 it will be easier to program java 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.380
 In the following we will do it immediately 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.930
 see 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:22.630
 in addition to ebay and eclipse there are 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:24.460
 also a tutorial for the cover editor he 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:27.340
 especially for programs with graphic 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.160
 Surfaces suitable is a change from 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.940
 one to the other detour 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.770
 development environment is always 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.570
 possible 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.520
 please choose which variant you like 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.520
 want to install and try
