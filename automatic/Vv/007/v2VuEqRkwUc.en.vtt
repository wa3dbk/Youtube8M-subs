00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.960 
all four legs and then not noticed it
that<00:01:22.350> would<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.680> been<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> problem<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.520> still

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that would have been a problem I still

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340

would<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.150> been<00:01:24.360> able<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.600> fix<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.259> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
would have been able to fix it but it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
would have been able to fix it but it
would<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.530> been<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> bigger<00:01:26.040> problem<00:01:26.460> so

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
would have been a bigger problem so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.330
