00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
all right so I hear we got about eight

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.769 
all right so I hear we got about eight
inputs<00:00:04.160> where<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.850> can<00:00:06.029> either<00:00:06.180> get<00:00:06.390> just<00:00:06.660> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
inputs where you can either get just a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.480 
inputs where you can either get just a
normal<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.379> guitar<00:00:08.309> cable<00:00:08.700> or<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> mic<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.650> I

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
normal like guitar cable or a mic and I

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.339 
normal like guitar cable or a mic and I
think<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.000> can<00:00:12.090> only<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.420> one<00:00:12.599> at<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.780> time

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
think you can only do one at a time

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.900 
think you can only do one at a time
I'm<00:00:13.920> really<00:00:14.040> sure<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.400> happens<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.759> but

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
I'm really sure what happens to be but

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.130 
I'm really sure what happens to be but
two<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.299> same<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:17.310> got<00:00:17.460> eight<00:00:17.640> here

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
two in the same but we got eight here

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.420 
two in the same but we got eight here
doesn't<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.260> matter<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:19.740> goes<00:00:19.980> where

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
doesn't really matter what goes where

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
doesn't really matter what goes where
I<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:21.270> it's<00:00:21.390> preferred<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.779> vocals<00:00:22.380> stay

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560

I think it's preferred that vocals stay
number<00:00:22.769> two<00:00:23.039> guitar<00:00:23.970> bass<00:00:24.269> stays<00:00:24.600> number<00:00:24.960> one

you got a piano plugged in so I'll go
over

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
over

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
over
play<00:02:02.010> something<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.670> look<00:02:03.150> at<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.360> same<00:02:03.540> time

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
play something and look at the same time

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.930 
play something and look at the same time
and<00:02:04.229> you<00:02:04.320> want<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.650> if<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:05.060> red<00:02:06.060> light

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
and you want to see if this red light

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.059 
and you want to see if this red light
goes<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.149> if<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.569> does<00:02:09.780> you're<00:02:10.709> gonna<00:02:10.860> turn

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
goes on if it does you're gonna turn

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.800 
goes on if it does you're gonna turn
down<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.310> little<00:02:11.520> bit<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.360> don't<00:02:12.450> want<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
down a little bit you don't want it to

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.440 
down a little bit you don't want it to
stay<00:02:13.020> red<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.580> preferred<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.300> it

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
stay red I think is preferred that if it

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.790 
stay red I think is preferred that if it
just<00:02:15.600> like<00:02:15.750> barely<00:02:15.959> gets<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.410> red<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.680> you're

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
just like barely gets to red when you're

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400 
just like barely gets to red when you're
hitting<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.790> higher<00:02:17.970> notes<00:02:18.410> like

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hitting it and the higher notes like

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.860 
hitting it and the higher notes like
when<00:02:19.560> you're<00:02:19.739> hitting<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.750> velocity<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
when you're hitting with the velocity on

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.380 
when you're hitting with the velocity on
the<00:02:21.989> keys<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.280> normally<00:02:23.640> keep<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> down<00:02:24.120> so

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the keys but I normally keep it down so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420 
the keys but I normally keep it down so
it<00:02:24.540> doesn't<00:02:24.630> really<00:02:24.930> flash<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.470> what's

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
it doesn't really flash because what's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.580 
it doesn't really flash because what's
this<00:02:26.580> indicator<00:02:27.060> once<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> play<00:02:28.110> noise<00:02:28.380> will

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
this indicator once you play noise will

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.949 
this indicator once you play noise will
go<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.860> once<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:29.910> get<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.180> like<00:02:30.569> say<00:02:30.780> gets

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
go up once you get to like say gets

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.260 
go up once you get to like say gets
distorted<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:32.100> it's<00:02:32.340> hard<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.580> record<00:02:32.940> stuff

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
distorted and it's hard to record stuff

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.720 
distorted and it's hard to record stuff
because<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.750> just<00:02:34.100> well<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.459> just<00:02:35.489> doesn't

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
because it's just well it just doesn't

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.500 
because it's just well it just doesn't
sound<00:02:36.030> good<00:02:36.300> high<00:02:36.480> quality<00:02:36.510> so<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:41.510> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
sound good high quality so and that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.470 
sound good high quality so and that
should<00:02:42.840> be<00:02:42.959> it<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.290> video
