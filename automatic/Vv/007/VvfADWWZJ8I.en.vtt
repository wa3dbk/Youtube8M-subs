in<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> heatproof<00:00:33.300> dish<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> microwave<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
in a heatproof dish in a microwave in

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.459 
in a heatproof dish in a microwave in
ten<00:00:35.790> seconds<00:00:36.329> intervals<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:37.110> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> make

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
ten seconds intervals you want to make

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
ten seconds intervals you want to make
sure<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.100> agitate<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.790> chocolate

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
sure that you agitate the chocolate

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.630 
sure that you agitate the chocolate
after<00:00:39.629> each<00:00:40.290> interval<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.399> can

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
after each interval because it can

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.240 
after each interval because it can
really<00:00:41.850> easily<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:43.170> overheated<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> end

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
really easily get overheated and you end

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.029 
really easily get overheated and you end
up<00:00:44.399> with<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> mess<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:45.960> agitate<00:00:46.500> after

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
up with a mess so just agitate after

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
up with a mess so just agitate after
each<00:00:47.480> interval<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.379> heat<00:00:49.590> from<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
each interval and also the heat from the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.700 
each interval and also the heat from the
from<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.239> dish<00:00:51.449> will<00:00:51.690> help<00:00:51.989> with<00:00:52.260> melting

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
from the dish will help with melting

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.760 
from the dish will help with melting
process<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.489> once<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.390> looks<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:55.050> it's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
process so once it looks like it's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
process so once it looks like it's
almost<00:00:56.039> melted<00:00:56.760> but<00:00:57.030> there<00:00:57.149> are<00:00:57.239> still<00:00:57.449> pieces

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
almost melted but there are still pieces

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.810 
almost melted but there are still pieces
just<00:00:58.199> steer<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.710> little<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.399> you'll

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
just steer it a little bit and you'll

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.510 
just steer it a little bit and you'll
see<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.210> heat<00:01:00.420> from<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.899> dish<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:02.190> melt<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
see the heat from the dish will melt the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.899 
see the heat from the dish will melt the
chocolate<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.519> want<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.610> let<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.790> cool

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
chocolate and you want to let it cool

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570 
chocolate and you want to let it cool
for<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.689> few<00:01:06.780> moments<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.680> then<00:01:07.860> while<00:01:08.250> your

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
for a few moments and then while your

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
for a few moments and then while your
chocolate<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.150> cooling<00:01:09.720> just<00:01:10.100> for<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> little

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
chocolate is cooling just for a little

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.960 
chocolate is cooling just for a little
bit<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.970> can<00:01:12.180> also<00:01:12.659> attach<00:01:13.460> pieces<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.640> wax

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
bit you can also attach pieces of wax

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.649 
bit you can also attach pieces of wax
paper<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.570> your<00:01:15.840> templates<00:01:17.150> which<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.299> using<00:01:18.600> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
little tape and then we can start piping

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.140 
little tape and then we can start piping
our<00:01:23.939> Tiaras<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.619> are<00:01:28.740> ready<00:01:29.150> I'm

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
pliable while still wet or melted so you

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.819 
pliable while still wet or melted so you
can<00:02:04.890> fix<00:02:05.369> any<00:02:05.610> mistakes<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.590> see<00:02:07.799> I
