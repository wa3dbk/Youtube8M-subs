00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.809 
going to be exactly the same as a pc

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
between the pc version and a handheld

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.990 
between the pc version and a handheld
version<00:02:24.150> but<00:02:24.390> according<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:25.530> merging<00:02:26.370> memory

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
version but according to merging memory

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.360 
version but according to merging memory
according<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.780> them<00:02:27.959> are<00:02:28.829> the<00:02:29.010> tweaks<00:02:29.250> we

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
according to them are the tweaks we

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.949 
according to them are the tweaks we
pretty<00:02:29.549> minor<00:02:29.819> so<00:02:30.150> it'll<00:02:30.510> be<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.629> the<00:02:30.720> same

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
pretty minor so it'll be like the same

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
what she really use right now the

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.950 
what she really use right now the
fairies<00:05:55.669> I<00:05:55.820> love<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.150> fairies<00:05:56.450> characters

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960

done<00:06:01.700> something<00:06:01.850> there<00:06:02.150> but<00:06:02.360> currently<00:06:03.020> no

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
done something there but currently no
