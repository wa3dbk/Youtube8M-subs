00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
you're supposed to do so I think we're

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.199 
you're supposed to do so I think we're
just<00:02:37.010> gonna<00:02:37.310> hey<00:02:37.819> wanted<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.239> drop<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:40.120> can<00:02:41.120> you

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
just gonna hey wanted to drop it can you

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.550

not keep it in your inventory well yeah
I<00:02:45.590> guess<00:02:45.680> it<00:02:46.190> would<00:02:46.489> seem<00:02:47.300> kind<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.140> funny<00:02:48.350> if

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
I guess it would seem kind of funny if

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.430 
I guess it would seem kind of funny if
you<00:02:48.530> stuck<00:02:48.920> that<00:02:48.950> into<00:02:49.550> your<00:02:49.670> back<00:02:49.940> pocket<00:02:50.480> so

you stuck that into your back pocket so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.509 
you stuck that into your back pocket so
