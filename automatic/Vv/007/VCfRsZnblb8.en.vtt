here as with the purple rings you just
got<00:00:48.760> to<00:00:48.879> find<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.210> first<00:00:49.360> one<00:00:49.540> and<00:00:49.870> then<00:00:50.769> you

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
got to find the first one and then you

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.369 
got to find the first one and then you
got<00:00:51.129> to<00:00:51.250> keep<00:00:51.370> trying<00:00:51.430> until<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.239> know<00:00:53.080> where

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
got to keep trying until you know where

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.009 
got to keep trying until you know where
they<00:00:53.530> all<00:00:53.680> are<00:00:54.119> you<00:00:55.119> don't<00:00:55.269> get<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.540> see<00:00:55.720> any<00:00:55.900> of

rest are until I see the one that I'm

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.950 
rest are until I see the one that I'm
currently<00:01:02.290> going<00:01:02.650> for<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.600> parts<00:01:04.930> tricky

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
currently going for this parts tricky

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.990 
currently going for this parts tricky
you<00:01:05.320> hit<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:05.619> rock<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.159> hit<00:01:06.490> one<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.760> jump

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
you hit the rock and hit one of the jump

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.660 
you hit the rock and hit one of the jump
buttons<00:01:07.299> r1<00:01:07.750> or<00:01:07.990> l1<00:01:08.200> at<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.680> same<00:01:08.890> time<00:01:09.189> as<00:01:09.549> you

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
buttons r1 or l1 at the same time as you

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.520 
buttons r1 or l1 at the same time as you
hit<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:09.939> rock<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.180> then<00:01:10.540> keep<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:10.900> held<00:01:11.140> and

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
hit the rock and then keep it held and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.170 
hit the rock and then keep it held and
you<00:01:11.590> should<00:01:11.799> fly<00:01:12.070> through<00:01:12.400> it<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.700> you<00:01:12.880> can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
you should fly through it and you can

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.649 
you should fly through it and you can
steer<00:01:13.630> in<00:01:13.869> the<00:01:13.900> air<00:01:14.170> if<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.650> need<00:01:14.860> to<00:01:15.659> alright

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
steer in the air if you need to alright

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.840 
steer in the air if you need to alright
so<00:01:16.840> we're<00:01:16.990> going<00:01:17.110> down<00:01:17.380> by<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.650> exit<00:01:18.159> quick

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
so we're going down by the exit quick

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.840 
so we're going down by the exit quick
u-turn<00:01:19.090> go<00:01:19.840> back<00:01:20.020> up<00:01:20.229> no<00:01:20.500> need<00:01:20.740> to<00:01:21.009> jump<00:01:21.490> here

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
u-turn go back up no need to jump here

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.810 
u-turn go back up no need to jump here
although<00:01:22.329> you<00:01:22.390> can<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.520> still<00:01:25.270> make<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:26.219> so<00:01:27.219> I

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
although you can and still make it so I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.029 
although you can and still make it so I
would<00:01:28.299> say<00:01:28.479> in<00:01:28.630> terms<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:28.990> difficulty<00:01:29.530> this

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
would say in terms of difficulty this

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.429 
would say in terms of difficulty this
path<00:01:30.340> is<00:01:30.700> about<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.270> same<00:01:31.600> except<00:01:32.109> for<00:01:32.140> this

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 
path is about the same except for this

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.139 
path is about the same except for this
spot<00:01:32.740> you<00:01:32.920> got<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.159> watch<00:01:33.280> out<00:01:33.460> for<00:01:33.520> all<00:01:33.700> four

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
spot you got to watch out for all four

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.200 
spot you got to watch out for all four
of<00:01:34.390> those<00:01:35.320> exploding<00:01:35.799> boxes<00:01:36.429> and<00:01:36.700> then<00:01:36.880> make

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
of those exploding boxes and then make

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.419 
of those exploding boxes and then make
that<00:01:37.240> jump<00:01:37.659> right<00:01:37.869> there<00:01:38.079> with<00:01:38.259> l1<00:01:38.469> or<00:01:38.829> r1<00:01:39.009> I

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429 
that jump right there with l1 or r1 I

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.399 
that jump right there with l1 or r1 I
think<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.210> difficulty<00:01:40.719> for<00:01:40.899> the<00:01:40.960> blue<00:01:41.140> rings

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
think the difficulty for the blue rings

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.989 
think the difficulty for the blue rings
is<00:01:41.590> about<00:01:41.829> the<00:01:41.979> same<00:01:42.219> as<00:01:42.249> for<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:42.670> purple

00:01:42.989 --> 00:01:42.999 
is about the same as for the purple

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:45.899 
is about the same as for the purple
rings<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.890> took<00:01:45.069> me<00:01:45.219> the<00:01:45.429> same<00:01:45.609> number<00:01:45.880> of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
rings it took me the same number of

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.179 
rings it took me the same number of
tries<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.270> think<00:01:46.719> to<00:01:46.810> do<00:01:46.929> each<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.799> it's<00:01:47.979> hard

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
tries I think to do each but it's hard

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.709 
tries I think to do each but it's hard
to<00:01:48.280> tell<00:01:48.429> since<00:01:48.729> I<00:01:48.880> did<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.149> purple<00:01:49.509> rings

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:49.719 
to tell since I did the purple rings

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.719 
to tell since I did the purple rings
first

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
first

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.609 
first
alright<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:51.969> around<00:01:52.270> these<00:01:52.390> quick<00:01:52.929> turns<00:01:53.200> slow

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
alright so around these quick turns slow

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.349 
alright so around these quick turns slow
down<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:53.859> bit<00:01:54.159> if<00:01:54.249> you<00:01:54.340> have<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.759> you<00:01:54.969> don't<00:01:55.149> want

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:55.359 
down a bit if you have to you don't want

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.029 
down a bit if you have to you don't want
to<00:01:55.450> miss<00:01:55.600> a<00:01:55.630> ring<00:01:55.990> because<00:01:56.319> that<00:01:56.499> will<00:01:56.649> waste

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
to miss a ring because that will waste

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.279 
to miss a ring because that will waste
time<00:01:57.579> you<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.299> short<00:01:58.749> amount<00:01:58.929> of<00:01:59.049> time<00:01:59.109> to

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
time you have a short amount of time to

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.520 
time you have a short amount of time to
get<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.679> each<00:02:00.659> make<00:02:01.659> sure<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.899> time<00:02:02.109> the<00:02:02.259> drums

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
get to each make sure to time the drums

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.679 
get to each make sure to time the drums
properly<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.639> then<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.119> part<00:02:04.420> is<00:02:04.539> the

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
properly and then this part is the

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.569 
properly and then this part is the
trickiest<00:02:05.049> part<00:02:05.109> so<00:02:05.590> slow<00:02:05.859> down<00:02:06.069> if<00:02:06.310> you<00:02:06.399> need
