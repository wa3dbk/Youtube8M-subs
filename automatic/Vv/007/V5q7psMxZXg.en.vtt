 other phones of other brands 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.790
 then let's assume that soon you 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.769
 have that good Chinese phone other 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.470
 language very soon in English that is what 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.790
 have sent to us and a first 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.710
 configuration that the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.010
 phone, obviously it's changing the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.199
 Chinese language to Spanish then what 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.720
 What we do is enter here for that 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.640
 door that says here that is the option of 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.500
 configuration settings if not 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.579
 find that nut among all 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.000
 applications that have 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.500
 they go through the notification they give to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.799
 click here up here on the right 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.009
 in the nut and give it here in the first 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.009
 option 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.759
 and then but obviously they are going to enter 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.740
 the settings options but as is 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.780
 in Chinese or English because the soon 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.180
 they will understand what is the option that 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.890
 Interested in entering to make the change 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.229
 but as you will see here we also have 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.479
 some drawings with some icons that are going 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.869
 to help or they will guide us in this 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.369
 process then what we do is get off 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.710
 we go down we go down to find here 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.470
 until we find this icon on 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.770
 direct that appears one to three 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.450
 I do not know if you can see it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.539
 normally it looks like the one with a slit 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.009
 for work and we enter in that option and 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.110
 that is the option that has to do with 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.240
 the language and then we enter the 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.890
 first option that we have here and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.409
 we also have another option again 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.580
 we slide the first one up here and it's 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.890
 is what allows us to change the language 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.360
 and here we already have all the languages ​​in 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.520
 this case we can see that we have the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.099
 view of Spanish in case you do not 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.620
 let's find then we sail and we look for it 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.110
 and we click here in Spanish and it's the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.160
 first main option to configure in 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.560
 the phone then if we go out 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.740
 let's see that we already have everything in 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.800
 Spanish Explorer set themes 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.880
 camera and everything was in Spanish and 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.770
 we are here in the same mind 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.740
 configuration we are going to enter 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.050
 quickly again to income language 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.270
 of text and another important option is that 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.210
 must do or configure has to do 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.730
 with the vibration or vibration of the keyboard 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.320
 because that removes battery to the phone 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.800
 then they enter here by the method 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.340
 income you click here in this option 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.090
 then here we are going to see several options 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.370
 select the first option 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 login and text settings 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.360
 here we have something important that we can 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:03.790
 activate before click here to activate 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.550
 predict next words activate the 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.410
 automatic correction and also activate 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.980
 the predictive text normally that's 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 off activates it 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.610
 these are important things to configure 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.790
 and there is here for this second option 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.349
 Keyboard configuration is normally 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.959
 it appears like this 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.680
 julián vibrates the expression art clá that 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.690
 does every time we press the keyboard 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.610
 vibrate the phone this usually what 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.500
 we must keep off for 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.610
 save battery suddenly the tone of the 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.310
 keyboard 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.290
 raised a lot of people like it but if 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.970
 will be generating sounds will be 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.030
 spending battery then the ideal is 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.730
 also have it disabled another option 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.459
 is that we must also configure the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 language the income is very possible that 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.910
 this language is the other language 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.950
 remember that we were in china 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.930

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.030
 we just enter here we give you the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.910
 Spanish option other options 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:03.480
 important to configure would say I go 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.540
 to see what else we could configure in 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.319
 this phone basically goes ringing 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.599
 main configuration options 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.150
 of the keyboard that we have to take into account 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:15.150
 at the time of soon receiving our 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.190

 screen we have the size of the font 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.360
 and we can also change the size of 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.770
 the letter that we want in would be like the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.469
 last configuration option 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.490
 important thing that we should do in our 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:43.650
