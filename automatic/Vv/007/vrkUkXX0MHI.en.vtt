00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
way to bring back the Stardust character

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.050 
way to bring back the Stardust character
Stardust<00:01:16.979> was<00:01:17.159> able<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.400> get<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> schoolboy

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Stardust was able to get the schoolboy

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.910 
Stardust was able to get the schoolboy
roll<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.540> for<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> win<00:01:19.080> Neville<00:01:19.560> ended<00:01:19.830> up

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
roll up for a win Neville ended up

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.410 
roll up for a win Neville ended up
looking<00:01:20.040> like<00:01:20.220> he<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.670> really<00:01:21.000> really<00:01:21.270> mad

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
looking like he got really really mad

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.080 
looking like he got really really mad
for<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> baby-faced<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:23.250> care<00:01:23.460> about<00:01:23.549> one<00:01:23.880> match

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
for a baby-faced to care about one match

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.359 
for a baby-faced to care about one match
on<00:01:24.360> Monday<00:01:24.630> Night<00:01:24.810> Raw<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.290> think<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> more

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
on Monday Night Raw I think that more

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
on Monday Night Raw I think that more
than<00:01:26.400> likely<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> match<00:01:27.509> Stardust

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
than likely this is the match Stardust

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.510 
than likely this is the match Stardust
