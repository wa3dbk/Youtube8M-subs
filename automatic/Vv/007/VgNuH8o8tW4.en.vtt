hidden underground Jedi to cave so why

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.320 
hidden underground Jedi to cave so why
would<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.710> Empire<00:01:09.009> want<00:01:09.250> Kyber<00:01:09.490> crystals<00:01:10.000> to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
would the Empire want Kyber crystals to

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.870 
would the Empire want Kyber crystals to
build<00:01:10.660> a<00:01:10.899> giant<00:01:11.200> Death<00:01:11.649> Star<00:01:12.009> this<00:01:12.430> is<00:01:12.580> even

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
build a giant Death Star this is even

monstrosity but don't just take my word
for<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.119> listen<00:01:25.630> to<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:25.929> soundbite<00:01:26.410> from

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
for it listen to this soundbite from

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.010 
for it listen to this soundbite from
Pablo<00:01:26.890> Hidalgo<00:01:27.250> at<00:01:27.880> well<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.240> Kyber<00:01:28.509> crystals

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
Pablo Hidalgo at well so Kyber crystals

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.719 
Pablo Hidalgo at well so Kyber crystals
are<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.410> focuses<00:01:30.009> the<00:01:30.220> energy<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:30.670> the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
are what focuses the energy and the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.639 
are what focuses the energy and the
lightsaber<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.270> create<00:01:31.479> a<00:01:31.509> blade<00:01:31.780> so<00:01:32.349> it's<00:01:32.500> got

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
lightsaber to create a blade so it's got

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.859 
lightsaber to create a blade so it's got
this<00:01:32.800> very<00:01:33.039> potent<00:01:33.640> ability<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.149> focus<00:01:34.330> energy

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
this very potent ability to focus energy

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.139 
this very potent ability to focus energy
in<00:01:34.959> a<00:01:35.020> very<00:01:35.050> powerful<00:01:35.349> way<00:01:35.709> so<00:01:36.280> I<00:01:36.310> imagine<00:01:36.849> if

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
in a very powerful way so I imagine if

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.809 
in a very powerful way so I imagine if
you<00:01:37.270> had<00:01:37.450> eight<00:01:37.690> giant<00:01:38.470> Kyber<00:01:39.069> crystals<00:01:39.640> and

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
you had eight giant Kyber crystals and

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:41.730 
you had eight giant Kyber crystals and
perhaps<00:01:39.970> arrange<00:01:40.599> them<00:01:40.840> in<00:01:40.959> a<00:01:41.050> ring<00:01:41.259> and<00:01:41.530> put

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
perhaps arrange them in a ring and put

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.580 
perhaps arrange them in a ring and put
them<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.009> a<00:01:42.039> gigantic<00:01:42.640> space<00:01:42.940> station<00:01:43.590> that

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
them on a gigantic space station that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.719 
them on a gigantic space station that
could<00:01:44.709> probably<00:01:45.039> have<00:01:45.190> some<00:01:45.340> very<00:01:45.520> powerful

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
could probably have some very powerful

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.699 
could probably have some very powerful
effects<00:01:46.330> so<00:01:46.509> it's<00:01:46.690> clear<00:01:46.990> that<00:01:47.020> the<00:01:47.259> Empire<00:01:47.590> is

00:01:47.699 --> 00:01:47.709 
effects so it's clear that the Empire is

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:50.309 
effects so it's clear that the Empire is
experimenting<00:01:48.429> with<00:01:48.459> something<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:50.229> can

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
experimenting with something and you can

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:52.080 
experimenting with something and you can
probably<00:01:50.470> guess<00:01:50.679> what<00:01:50.860> that<00:01:50.979> is<00:01:51.190> so<00:01:51.759> what<00:01:51.970> does

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
probably guess what that is so what does

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.999 
probably guess what that is so what does
this<00:01:52.239> mean<00:01:52.569> for<00:01:52.780> our<00:01:53.050> little<00:01:53.349> band<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.679> rebels

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
this mean for our little band of rebels

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.040 
this mean for our little band of rebels
well<00:01:54.310> currently<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:55.149> building<00:01:55.509> of<00:01:55.660> a<00:01:55.840> Death

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
well currently the building of a Death

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.109 
well currently the building of a Death
Star<00:01:56.080> is<00:01:56.500> a<00:01:56.530> subplot<00:01:57.099> would<00:01:57.610> we<00:01:57.729> see<00:01:57.940> more

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
Star is a subplot would we see more

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.150 
Star is a subplot would we see more
direct<00:01:58.420> episodes<00:01:58.959> about<00:01:59.289> mining<00:01:59.709> or<00:01:59.830> Kyber

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
direct episodes about mining or Kyber

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.490 
direct episodes about mining or Kyber
crystals<00:02:00.610> then<00:02:01.330> the<00:02:01.509> Death<00:02:01.690> Star<00:02:01.929> will<00:02:02.140> be<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
crystals then the Death Star will be the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.559 
crystals then the Death Star will be the
main<00:02:02.679> focus<00:02:02.890> but<00:02:03.789> think<00:02:04.060> for<00:02:04.239> a<00:02:04.270> moment<00:02:04.360> how

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
main focus but think for a moment how

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.960 
main focus but think for a moment how
awesome<00:02:05.200> would<00:02:05.289> be<00:02:05.470> if<00:02:05.649> our<00:02:05.950> rebels<00:02:06.340> fulcrum

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
awesome would be if our rebels fulcrum

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.729 
awesome would be if our rebels fulcrum
and<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.450> Bothan<00:02:07.630> spies<00:02:07.810> are<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.440> ones<00:02:08.619> that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
and the Bothan spies are the ones that

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.680 
and the Bothan spies are the ones that
steal<00:02:09.099> the<00:02:09.310> plans<00:02:09.489> for<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:09.940> Death<00:02:10.149> Star

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
steal the plans for the Death Star

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.050 
steal the plans for the Death Star
what<00:02:10.989> if<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.440> one<00:02:11.709> theory<00:02:12.130> ties<00:02:12.370> all<00:02:12.670> other

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
what if this one theory ties all other

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.290 
what if this one theory ties all other
parts<00:02:13.420> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.569> story<00:02:13.870> together<00:02:14.819> but<00:02:15.819> that<00:02:15.849> is

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
parts of the story together but that is

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.660 
parts of the story together but that is

let me know what you think about the

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.260 
let me know what you think about the
role<00:02:19.719> of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
role of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.910

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
remember the ability to destroy an

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.670 
remember the ability to destroy an
entire<00:02:25.580> planet<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.480> insignificant<00:02:27.020> next<00:02:27.500> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
entire planet is insignificant next to

the power of the force so may the force
