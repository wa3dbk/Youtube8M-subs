00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.699
 yes it's kinda stupid now I've ever met such a great EU 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:20.699
 stand 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.769
 and it rains 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.689
 but that's just the weather you can not choose one time you lose 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.819
 mean the others 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:28.609
 but today I've considered today we win 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:30.220
 but then please BEV 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.340
 the rain out 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.470
 Thank you very much 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.240
 And just as fast as the weather changes, that too changes 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.270
 must look like from 9 3 kg in July namely closed 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.770
 the three-ply soft top with beautiful white in the sky disappears scarce 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.690
 20 seconds over the trunk in the rear 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.530
 and then that means just getting in 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.470
 and in the open air 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.860
 Blow the wind around your nose and be right there 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.500
 Let's just try it out now 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.460
 with the new tool from 9 3 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.460
 Capelli 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.190
 The exterior design has changed especially in the front, new bumpers 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.039
 new grille new lamp 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.559
 new label headlights facing the whole weekend ran for 

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:35.719
 more uniform occurrence of all saab models because now pulls the new 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.319
 3er also a bit more after his big brother the Saab 9 5 out 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.970
 The engines we drive just 8 liters with the best three meters 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.160
 a v6 with turbocharged and demanded and 50 hp 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.409
 brand new is now a single man 9 liters TTC Green Day to Go this value 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.320
 or 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.290
 but instead of as previously one has the turbo lag a bit 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.250
 turn off what you normally do with the diesel at low speeds 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.250
 still feels 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.749
 and what better not to do at least not if you open the roof 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:41.279
 Kind of and the windows down to expel the mosquitoes from the windshield 

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:45.439
 in the middle to 10 the tracks with epidemics because unfortunately everything is in the interior 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.439
 Stocks huge mess 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.899
 but Iran had to be revised in three last year there was 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:04.380
 including new scandal 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.400
 for the air conditioning a new navigation system with touch screen 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.419
 new instruments and waffles with tachometer and per meter and that 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.860
 Display was also in the creek goes down what previously above 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.720
 was on the dashboard 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.069
 which is very nice here in the interior is too 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 the bright in the sky the fabric top 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.379
 Do not give the impression that you yourself in a closed card 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.619
 Reader but rather 

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:32.619
 conveys that you are sitting in a coupe 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.030
 so i would say the lab is showing rejected 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.590
 There is quite a car suitable for everyday use you can drive it in the rain 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.860
 not only in sunshine 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.800
 downstairs the best thing I have not mentioned is the trunk 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.750
 that is incredibly huge for Caprio ratios 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.400
 and since you just do not want to do it makes it so impossible and one 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.000
 makes the power
