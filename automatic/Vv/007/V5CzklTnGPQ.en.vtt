00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.259
 hello in this tutorial I want to tell you 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.290
 how can we make these pretty 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.780
 pending the materials that we are going to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.369
 employ are the necessary accessories 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.949
 to hang thin cardboard 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.259
 It is that we recycle we will do 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:24.619
 the drawing on a vegetable paper for 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:29.509
 we will use a thin stick 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.970
 that the academies and painting the first thing 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:34.220
 what we do is in a thin cardboard cut 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.920
 four circles with the size that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.350
 we want them to be our earrings and 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.960
 then we are going to throw glue on the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.199
 area that has the drawings and paste it 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.129
 so that we can stay like this now what 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.489
 let's do it is sanding the entire edge 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:54.019
 so that it stays smooth and that there is no 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.660
 no difference between the two 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.360
 circles that we just pasted 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.800
 with a fine sandpaper of grains 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:06.100
 thin we are leaving little by little this 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.100
 way 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.090
 once we have already sanding and the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.700
 edge has been smooth what we are going to 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.030
 to do is to paint it we have to choose the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.149
 color that we want to give you because it will be the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.579
 background having pendant I 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:30.189
 I'm going to paint in black so that later 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.189
 The tones of the drawing stand out more 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.369
 we are going to give you a first layer 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.009
 and then when it's dry we'll give it a 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.990
 second once the painting is already 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.149
 dry what we are going to do next 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.810
 it's a little hole that's where 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.509
 we will put the hoop that holds then the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.780
 pending on a tracing paper we have 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.329
 drawn the ornament that we want 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.859
 have our pending the only thing that 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.399
 we have to do next is 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:06.020
 place it on top and review the drawing 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.539
 so that it remains traced 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.030
 once we have traced the drawing 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.200
 on both sides of the slope what 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.660
 let's do is paint it I've chosen 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.879
 nail polish because I like the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.340
 tonalities that I have to be able to give it 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.319
 to the slope then the only thing that 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.290
 we have to do is cover the drawing 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.730
 with these tonalities 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.769
 what we like most 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.319
 once we have finished 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.260
 paint it and it has dried it would stay 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:41.409
 so the last step that we have left 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.950
 do is put an accessory so that 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.680
 then we can hang it on the ear or 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 we would introduce the ring by 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 hole 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.970
 we close the ring 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 and we would have it 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.210
 I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.210
 and see you in the next thanks
