00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.579
 Can be done in church 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.199
 Children's rooms to prepare the parties 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.639
 It's a team. 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.110
 I do not have a ball today. 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.650
 I want to love me 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.480
 In the meantime, some preacher's sermons are like starboards. 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.310
 Today, individuals can see their old friends baseball products. 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.609
 I had to worship right today. 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.609
 But I think this 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.310
 I can not go get it. Move your body. 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.060
 It's not that I did not move my body during worship time, 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.750
 Do you twist your body any further? 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.600
 then 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.590
 5 my and 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.990
 You've got a story about Christmas Eve. 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.320
 I was reading the next year's event. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.640
 da 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.680
 Do not 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.640
 If the KOSDAQ market ceased to exist in 2001 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.049
 I arranged for it to be nice, 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.610
 Adrive, which is an ambitious project, 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.040
 It's a shrimp. 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.830
 It's a swap that means I will not let you go. 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.300
 I can make this miso 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.340
 We're dancing. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.080
 Reflections and Rick are great but take a good look 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.640
 I'm helping them. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.039
 Please zoom in. 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.240
 Is it fun to make 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.039
 I'm getting ready for the eve of the school year by earnest. 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.529
 About last year's investigation 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.560
 If they are dancing in a larger scale than their faces 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.340
 Let's get started. 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.149
 But if your sophomores say this is not yours 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.100
 From that point on, I'm starting to get distracted. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.750
 We do not know what it is, but we 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.570
 I think you have to deal with a poor country. 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.700
 But to fight against the teacher, 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.270
 I am in twelfth grade, so I am not in less than 5 minutes. 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.540
 Do not. 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.540
 3 4th graders did a play. 

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.639
 Should I 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:16.119
 I am getting money. 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:18.059
 i am. 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:20.440
 ... 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.909
 It's three or four years longer than that. 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.469
 The situation in KEB keeps on appearing continuously 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.699
 I have a hand with my girlfriend. 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.559
 I will not die without a careless mind 

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:37.919
 I think the boy who is in the meeting in succession is getting two months 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:41.529
 Must be destroyed and viewed from the perspective 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.529
 The day I have to evacuate is in my mind for a moment. 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:47.869
 I think this girlfriend first 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.760
 I'm installing it. 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.879
 afp.par 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
 Go ahead and realize 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.840
 One next year 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.970
 The horse speaks for the throat. 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.970
 Individuals do not like to talk too. 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.220
 I am depressed because I have lost it. 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.869
 2% less to fight 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:13.839
 Squeeze quickly and eventually make a leap and a hand. 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.439
 I should still do it. 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.439
 They are melting. 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.759
 I'm not an actor. I'll take on a new shadow puppet play. 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:34.120
 But the child is not fresh. 

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:38.219
 I do not get out of it. 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.540
 Kim Yeon-jae and her friend 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:46.939
 But I'm sure your mom will. 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:47.810
 Fortunately 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.260
 Grade 5 to practice this exercise with such a thought 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.659
 They're friends. 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:55.189
 It's clearer as a sixth grader. 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.040
 Girls in grade 6 are practicing me only in the age of girls 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.400
 What do you have for your mom today? 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.739
 I wonder if I should buy it. 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.779
 My dad, who can build a country this time, 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.169
 I'm starting to worry about whether I will take the tackle, especially for the construction work. 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:16.379
 It is good to be close to Christmas while I'm practicing like that. 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.909
 Still, Christmas is the easiest way to celebrate Jesus' birthday. 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:21.889
 It's not. 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.009
 Because I am a believer in Jesus 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.399
 It's a child. It's Jesus. Check it out with us. 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.210
 Or more 

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:45.839
 Can be interpreted. 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.530
 lasia 

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:41.119
 It's a box.
