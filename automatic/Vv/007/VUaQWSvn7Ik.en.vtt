and it was great lots of switchbacks and

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.650 
and it was great lots of switchbacks and
you<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.370> gain<00:02:18.610> loads<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.970> elevation<00:02:19.450> but<00:02:19.570> in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
you just gain loads of elevation but in

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
the process of gaining all that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.840 
the process of gaining all that
elevation<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.680> get<00:02:23.680> wicked<00:02:24.040> awesome<00:02:24.370> views

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
decided to work our way up swift current

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.760 
decided to work our way up swift current
to<00:03:06.460> swift<00:03:06.700> current<00:03:06.820> lookout<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.560> from<00:03:08.560> there

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
to swift current lookout and from there

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.000 
to swift current lookout and from there
we<00:03:09.070> ended<00:03:09.100> up<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.990> start<00:03:11.260> out<00:03:11.380> kind<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.860> in

we ended up you start out kind of in
some<00:03:12.250> Alpine<00:03:13.030> trees<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.520> breaks

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
some Alpine trees and then that breaks

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.990 
some Alpine trees and then that breaks
out<00:03:16.090> into<00:03:16.270> these<00:03:17.140> crazy<00:03:17.700> scary-looking<00:03:18.700> and

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
out into these crazy scary-looking and

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.140 
out into these crazy scary-looking and
really<00:03:19.360> cool-looking<00:03:20.130> burnt<00:03:21.130> Alpine<00:03:21.820> trees

really cool-looking burnt Alpine trees

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.050 
really cool-looking burnt Alpine trees
and<00:03:22.450> then<00:03:23.080> finally<00:03:23.530> into<00:03:24.220> some<00:03:24.550> other<00:03:24.730> ones

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
and then finally into some other ones

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.479 
and then finally into some other ones
and<00:03:25.330> then<00:03:25.450> you<00:03:26.320> open<00:03:26.440> up<00:03:26.709> into<00:03:26.920> this<00:03:26.980> just<00:03:27.250> big

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
and then you open up into this just big

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.310 
and then you open up into this just big
rocky<00:03:27.880> slope<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:28.570> you<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:28.930> see

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
rocky slope and you can actually see

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.560 
rocky slope and you can actually see
Swift<00:03:29.980> Current<00:03:30.250> lookout<00:03:30.550> from<00:03:30.730> ways<00:03:31.150> down

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
Swift Current lookout from ways down

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.479 
Swift Current lookout from ways down
which<00:03:32.230> I'm<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.530> exactly<00:03:32.830> sure<00:03:33.010> if<00:03:33.310> that's

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
which I'm not exactly sure if that's

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.850 
which I'm not exactly sure if that's
psychologically<00:03:34.300> good<00:03:34.540> or<00:03:34.690> bad<00:03:34.900> because<00:03:35.590> it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
psychologically good or bad because it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.830 
psychologically good or bad because it
seems<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.670> never<00:03:36.880> gets<00:03:37.120> to<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.450> and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
seems like it never gets to you and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.370 
seems like it never gets to you and
there<00:03:38.770> are<00:03:38.800> a<00:03:38.920> wicked<00:03:39.190> amount<00:03:39.580> of<00:03:40.380> switchbacks

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
there are a wicked amount of switchbacks

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.440 
there are a wicked amount of switchbacks
and<00:03:41.650> then<00:03:41.980> finally<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.910> get<00:03:43.060> up<00:03:43.209> to<00:03:43.300> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
and then finally you get up to the
