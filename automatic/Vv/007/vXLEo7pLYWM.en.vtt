00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.039 
be introducing us to a world of Greek
food<00:03:49.799> we<00:03:50.040> weren't<00:03:50.370> expecting<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.480> question

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
food we weren't expecting the question

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.140 
food we weren't expecting the question
is<00:03:52.260> is<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.860> general<00:03:53.190> public<00:03:53.580> ready<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:53.970> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
is is the general public ready for this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.050 
is is the general public ready for this
type<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.480> Greek<00:03:54.840> gastronomic<00:03:55.470> experience

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
type of Greek gastronomic experience

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.770 
type of Greek gastronomic experience
definitely<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.180> it's<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.420> long<00:03:57.570> time

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
definitely I think it's a long time

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.350 
definitely I think it's a long time
coming<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:58.380> know<00:03:58.500> years<00:03:58.980> ago<00:03:59.100> it<00:03:59.400> was<00:03:59.519> it

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
coming you know years ago it was it

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.910 
coming you know years ago it was it
again<00:04:01.019> I<00:04:01.049> keep<00:04:01.230> on<00:04:01.320> saying<00:04:01.350> was<00:04:01.650> always<00:04:01.830> the

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
again I keep on saying was always the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.470 
again I keep on saying was always the
same<00:04:02.130> kind<00:04:02.459> of<00:04:02.489> thing<00:04:02.670> rice<00:04:02.850> potatoes<00:04:03.269> and

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
same kind of thing rice potatoes and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.050 
same kind of thing rice potatoes and
just<00:04:04.019> routine<00:04:04.290> of<00:04:04.410> wine<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:04.799> I<00:04:05.430> think<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.760> non

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
just routine of wine and I think the non

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.729 
just routine of wine and I think the non
Greek<00:04:06.510> population<00:04:06.720> could<00:04:07.290> think<00:04:07.590> when<00:04:07.709> i

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
Greek population could think when i

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.750 
Greek population could think when i
think<00:04:07.860> of<00:04:07.980> greek<00:04:08.160> one<00:04:08.310> they<00:04:08.400> always<00:04:08.580> take<00:04:08.730> a

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
think of greek one they always take a

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.310 
think of greek one they always take a
bachina<00:04:09.030> but<00:04:09.570> they<00:04:09.660> have<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.840> understand<00:04:10.230> that

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
bachina but they have to understand that

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.110 
bachina but they have to understand that
we<00:04:10.410> do<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.739> lot<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:11.070> high-end<00:04:11.430> greek<00:04:11.850> wines

a<00:05:18.510> plate<00:05:18.920> the<00:05:19.920> interpretation<00:05:20.700> is<00:05:20.820> very

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
a plate the interpretation is very

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.510 
a plate the interpretation is very
modern<00:05:21.480> but<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.900> flavors<00:05:22.530> some<00:05:23.040> are<00:05:23.220> quite

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
modern but the flavors some are quite

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.490 
modern but the flavors some are quite
traditional<00:05:23.850> so<00:05:24.510> it's<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.870> kind<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.200> weaving

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 
traditional so it's that kind of weaving

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.260
