00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.539 
the version or the rx-78 but I went with
what<00:02:34.609> the<00:02:34.819> average<00:02:35.000> katoki<00:02:36.160> came<00:02:37.160> with<00:02:37.370> that

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
what the average katoki came with that

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.580 
what the average katoki came with that
came<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.849> green<00:02:38.120> eyes<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.720> red<00:02:38.959> camera<00:02:39.440> on

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
came with green eyes and a red camera on

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.770 
came with green eyes and a red camera on
the<00:02:39.680> top<00:02:40.329> so<00:02:41.329> I<00:02:41.359> went<00:02:41.599> with<00:02:41.720> that<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:43.630> did<00:02:44.630> not

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
the top so I went with that I did not

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.020 
the top so I went with that I did not
paint<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.109> kit<00:02:45.380> nope<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:46.310> camera<00:02:46.880> in<00:02:46.940> the

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
paint the kit nope the camera in the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.520 
paint the kit nope the camera in the
rear<00:02:47.180> which<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.630> should<00:02:47.930> have<00:02:48.109> would<00:02:48.319> have<00:02:48.380> been

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
rear which I should have would have been

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.750 
rear which I should have would have been
a<00:02:48.560> real<00:02:48.739> challenge<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.609> mask<00:02:50.419> off<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:50.870> little

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
a real challenge to mask off that little

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.099 
a real challenge to mask off that little
section<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:53.090> paint<00:02:53.299> it<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:53.660> out<00:02:53.780> clouds

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
section to paint it with the out clouds

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.580 
section to paint it with the out clouds
and<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.730> match<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.389> same<00:02:56.599> one<00:02:56.810> as<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.260> front

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
and to match the same one as the front

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.620 
and to match the same one as the front
so<00:02:58.160> I<00:02:58.190> decided<00:02:58.609> just<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.780> leave<00:03:00.109> it<00:03:01.389> of<00:03:02.389> all<00:03:02.599> the

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
so I decided just to leave it of all the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.780 
so I decided just to leave it of all the
other<00:03:02.870> details<00:03:03.349> I<00:03:03.560> painted<00:03:03.980> I<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.549> left<00:03:04.669> that

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
other details I painted I just left that

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.509 
other details I painted I just left that
one<00:03:05.090> there<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.739> there<00:03:06.950> were<00:03:07.069> a<00:03:07.130> few<00:03:07.220> other

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
one there and there were a few other

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.479 
one there and there were a few other
details<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:08.090> could<00:03:08.269> have<00:03:08.359> painted<00:03:08.750> like<00:03:08.959> the

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
details I could have painted like the

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.599 
details I could have painted like the

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:13.609 
bars on the shoulder armor here I could

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.970 
bars on the shoulder armor here I could
have<00:03:13.639> gotten<00:03:14.000> with<00:03:14.329> paint<00:03:15.230> brush<00:03:15.440> and<00:03:15.620> painted

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.060 
is the thrusters I think the name will
wash<00:03:32.540> over<00:03:32.959> the<00:03:33.410> alkali<00:03:34.280> came<00:03:35.030> out<00:03:35.150> very<00:03:35.329> well

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
wash over the alkali came out very well

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
the rifle which I think turned out

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:04.569 
here I ended up painting this with

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.619 
here I ended up painting this with
alkali<00:04:05.349> chrome<00:04:05.760> actually<00:04:06.760> note<00:04:07.030> that's<00:04:07.209> Jolin

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
alkali chrome actually note that's Jolin

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:14.190 
alkali chrome actually note that's Jolin
iam<00:04:08.610> I<00:04:09.810> did<00:04:10.810> do<00:04:10.930> chrome<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:12.180> clear<00:04:13.180> orange<00:04:13.810> on

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
iam I did do chrome and clear orange on

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.729 
iam I did do chrome and clear orange on
the<00:04:14.530> camera<00:04:15.459> lenses<00:04:16.889> but<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:19.680> don't<00:04:20.680> know

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
the camera lenses but I don't know

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.710 
the camera lenses but I don't know
doesn't<00:04:21.579> really<00:04:24.240> make<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.389> big<00:04:25.449> of

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
doesn't really make that big of

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.650 
doesn't really make that big of
difference<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.199> me<00:04:26.340> either<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:28.330> painting

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
difference to me either just painting

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.510 
difference to me either just painting
the<00:04:28.810> clear<00:04:29.169> part<00:04:29.410> with<00:04:29.590> clear<00:04:29.919> yellow<00:04:30.220> or

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the clear part with clear yellow or

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.080 
the clear part with clear yellow or
doing<00:04:31.210> this<00:04:31.389> works<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.229> as<00:04:32.410> well

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
doing this works just as well

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:41.159 
doing this works just as well
I'm<00:04:35.020> gonna<00:04:35.760> turn<00:04:36.760> the<00:04:39.150> base<00:04:40.150> off<00:04:40.449> for<00:04:40.690> a<00:04:40.720> second

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
I'm gonna turn the base off for a second

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.820 
I'm gonna turn the base off for a second
and<00:04:41.289> I<00:04:41.949> thought<00:04:42.100> I'd<00:04:42.250> do<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:42.430> quick<00:04:42.520> comparison

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
and I thought I'd do a quick comparison

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:53.960 
and I thought I'd do a quick comparison
with<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:49.289> version<00:04:50.289> come<00:04:52.560> fix<00:04:53.560> figure

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
with the version come fix figure

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.360 
with the version come fix figure
figuration<00:04:54.970> metal<00:04:55.360> composite<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:59.370> spin

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
figuration metal composite and spin

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.120 
figuration metal composite and spin
these<00:05:00.520> guys<00:05:00.700> around<00:05:04.020> so<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.139> colors<00:05:05.530> on<00:05:05.800> the

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
these guys around so the colors on the

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:16.450 
these guys around so the colors on the
metal<00:05:06.789> composite<00:05:07.300> or<00:05:07.389> a<00:05:07.419> bit<00:05:07.630> lighter

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.930 

so<00:05:17.460> this<00:05:17.639> kind<00:05:17.819> of<00:05:18.000> helps<00:05:18.750> me<00:05:18.810> explain<00:05:19.909> why<00:05:20.909> I

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
so this kind of helps me explain why I

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.990 
so this kind of helps me explain why I
