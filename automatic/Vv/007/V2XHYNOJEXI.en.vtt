yeah<00:00:35.160> sure<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.700> mostly<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.510> sitting<00:00:36.899> with<00:00:36.930> my

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
yeah sure and mostly I'm sitting with my

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.310 
yeah sure and mostly I'm sitting with my
disease<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.800> shallow<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:40.050> for

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
disease to shallow and and I think for

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 
disease to shallow and and I think for
like<00:00:40.350> about<00:00:40.739> personalities<00:00:41.520> yes<00:00:42.030> this

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
like about personalities yes this

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 
like about personalities yes this
cameras<00:00:42.840> are<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.200> close<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.649> each<00:00:43.680> other<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
cameras are so close to each other and I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.360 
cameras are so close to each other and I
started<00:00:45.840> with<00:00:46.020> tunnel<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.680> know<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.250> I

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
started with tunnel you know so then I

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.760 
started with tunnel you know so then I
bought<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.420> conferences<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.140> you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
bought one of the conferences and you

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.370 
bought one of the conferences and you
know<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> have

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.190 

but<00:00:53.380> I<00:00:53.410> was<00:00:54.090> shaken<00:00:55.090> excessively<00:00:55.510> good<00:00:55.780> yeah

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
but I was shaken excessively good yeah

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.950 
but I was shaken excessively good yeah
so<00:00:56.590> I<00:00:56.890> think<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.640> more<00:00:58.000> about<00:00:58.300> your<00:00:58.510> personal

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
so I think it's more about your personal

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.850 
so I think it's more about your personal
taste<00:00:59.230> I<00:00:59.410> find<00:00:59.830> kind<00:01:00.129> of<00:01:00.250> much<00:01:00.580> more<00:01:00.820> easier

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
taste I find kind of much more easier

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.700 
taste I find kind of much more easier
exposure<00:01:03.360> however<00:01:04.360> if<00:01:04.750> you<00:01:04.869> are<00:01:04.900> used<00:01:05.229> to<00:01:05.470> work

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
exposure however if you are used to work

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.880 
exposure however if you are used to work
with<00:01:05.740> Luca

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.920 

so<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.760> bottom<00:01:11.090> there<00:01:11.480> is<00:01:11.600> no<00:01:11.720> big<00:01:11.900> difference

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
so the bottom there is no big difference

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.110 
so the bottom there is no big difference
we<00:01:12.380> don't<00:01:12.590> come<00:01:12.860> on<00:01:12.980> week<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.370> there<00:01:13.670> is<00:01:13.760> no<00:01:13.910> big

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
emission current I'd imagine mark toka

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.959 
emission current I'd imagine mark toka
videos<00:01:52.810> yeah<00:01:53.110> for<00:01:53.380> videos<00:01:53.819> because<00:01:54.819> I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.650 

I<00:02:31.660> would<00:02:31.960> say<00:02:32.520> from<00:02:33.520> technical<00:02:34.000> data<00:02:34.210> that<00:02:34.540> we

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
I would say from technical data that we

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.190 
I would say from technical data that we
must<00:02:34.900> take<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.320> consideration<00:02:35.530> before<00:02:36.210> like<00:02:37.210> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
must take in consideration before like I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.490 
must take in consideration before like I
think<00:02:38.740> great<00:02:38.950> video<00:02:39.340> is<00:02:39.730> about<00:02:39.910> how<00:02:40.420> you<00:02:41.020> see

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
think great video is about how you see

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.470 
think great video is about how you see
the<00:02:41.650> world<00:02:41.680> when<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:42.460> perceive<00:02:42.820> it
