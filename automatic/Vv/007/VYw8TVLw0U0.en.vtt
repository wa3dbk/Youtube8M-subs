00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
the Rubik's Cube 3x3 in this step you

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.440 
the Rubik's Cube 3x3 in this step you
will<00:00:10.620> be<00:00:10.889> moving<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> corners<00:00:11.849> around<00:00:12.000> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
will be moving the corners around the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.390 
will be moving the corners around the
cube<00:00:12.719> in<00:00:12.900> order<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> put<00:00:13.740> them<00:00:13.950> in<00:00:14.190> their

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
cube in order to put them in their

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.760 
cube in order to put them in their
correct<00:00:14.730> spot<00:00:15.059> as<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:16.199> can<00:00:16.350> see<00:00:16.590> by<00:00:16.740> my

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
correct spot as you can see by my

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.189 
correct spot as you can see by my
example<00:00:17.279> cube<00:00:17.670> I<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.510> first<00:00:18.750> two<00:00:18.960> layers

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
example cube I have the first two layers

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.519 
example cube I have the first two layers
corrected<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.699> top<00:00:20.970> cross<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.199> edges

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
corrected the top cross and the edges

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.460 
corrected the top cross and the edges
match<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.189> now<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.420> corners<00:00:24.930> are<00:00:25.109> in<00:00:25.289> their

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
match and now the corners are in their

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.589 
match and now the corners are in their
correct<00:00:25.830> spot<00:00:26.279> they<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.910> don't<00:00:27.150> happen<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
correct spot they just don't happen to

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.429 
correct spot they just don't happen to
be<00:00:27.810> turned<00:00:28.140> properly<00:00:29.150> yellow<00:00:30.150> blue<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
be turned properly yellow blue and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.850 
be turned properly yellow blue and
orange<00:00:32.070> sorry<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.270> that

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
orange sorry about that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.880 
orange sorry about that
yellow<00:00:34.860> blue<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.880> orange<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.590> piece

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
yellow blue and orange so this piece

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
yellow blue and orange so this piece
isn't<00:00:38.219> its<00:00:38.460> correct<00:00:38.820> spot<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:39.480> needs<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
isn't its correct spot it just needs to

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.280 
isn't its correct spot it just needs to
be<00:00:40.020> turned<00:00:40.430> same<00:00:41.430> with<00:00:41.610> this<00:00:41.820> one<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.989> one

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
be turned same with this one this one

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.150 
be turned same with this one this one
and<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.399> one<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.710> be<00:00:46.829> teaching<00:00:47.039> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
and this one so I will be teaching you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.670 
and this one so I will be teaching you
one<00:00:47.489> algorithm<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> eight<00:00:48.899> steps<00:00:49.320> and

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
one algorithm that is eight steps and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.779 
one algorithm that is eight steps and
easy<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.789> remember<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.539> use<00:00:51.570> patterns<00:00:52.789> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
easy to remember if you use patterns so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
easy to remember if you use patterns so
what<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.090> want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.270> do<00:00:54.449> is<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.500> have

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
what you want to do is now that you have

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.229 
what you want to do is now that you have
just<00:00:55.860> finished<00:00:56.010> aligning<00:00:56.670> your<00:00:56.760> edge<00:00:56.910> pieces

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
just finished aligning your edge pieces

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
just finished aligning your edge pieces
so<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.649> yellow<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.160> top<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.699> they

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
so that the yellow is on top and they

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
so that the yellow is on top and they
match<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.539> sides<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:01.590> want<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.100> for

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
match on the sides you want to look for

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.250 
match on the sides you want to look for
a<00:01:02.579> piece<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:03.120> corner<00:01:03.539> piece<00:01:03.719> that's<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.140> its

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
a piece a corner piece that's in its

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
a piece a corner piece that's in its
correct<00:01:04.589> spot<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.670> will<00:01:05.880> usually<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.750> one

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
correct spot you will usually have one

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.289 
correct spot you will usually have one
but<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.680> case<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.220> none<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
but in this case I have none so it

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
but in this case I have none so it
doesn't<00:01:09.510> matter<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> hold<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.490> have

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
doesn't matter how I hold it if you have

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
doesn't matter how I hold it if you have
one<00:01:12.000> that's<00:01:12.150> already<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.570> correct<00:01:12.869> spot

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
one that's already in this correct spot

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.350 
one that's already in this correct spot
you'll<00:01:13.439> hold<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> top-left<00:01:14.400> here<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
you'll hold it in the top-left here and

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.810 
you'll hold it in the top-left here and
now<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.110> perform<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.979> following<00:01:17.460> algorithm

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
now you perform the following algorithm

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
now you perform the following algorithm
which<00:01:18.450> will<00:01:18.630> switch<00:01:18.960> these<00:01:19.380> three<00:01:20.040> corner

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
which will switch these three corner

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.170 
which will switch these three corner
pieces<00:01:20.729> keeping<00:01:21.600> everything<00:01:21.900> else<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> same

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
pieces keeping everything else the same

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:34.219 
pieces keeping everything else the same

turn<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> whole<00:01:51.600> cube<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.680> back

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
turn the whole cube so it's in the back

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.850 
turn the whole cube so it's in the back
left<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.630> perform<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> algorithm

now chances are that this will solve

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
now chances are that this will solve

you'll<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.300> need<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.540> perform<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you'll just need to perform the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.720 
you'll just need to perform the
algorithm

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
algorithm

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.330 
algorithm
one<00:02:13.819> more<00:02:14.030> time<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:16.360> in<00:02:17.360> this<00:02:18.290> case<00:02:18.530> it<00:02:18.799> solved

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
one more time so in this case it solved

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.610 
one more time so in this case it solved
it<00:02:19.540> completely<00:02:20.540> this<00:02:20.989> corners<00:02:21.409> in<00:02:21.560> this

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
it completely this corners in this

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.649 
it completely this corners in this
correct<00:02:21.950> spot<00:02:22.250> does<00:02:22.670> not<00:02:22.819> turned<00:02:23.150> properly

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:23.659 
correct spot does not turned properly

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.080 
correct spot does not turned properly
this<00:02:24.440> one<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.830> in<00:02:25.040> its<00:02:25.190> correct<00:02:25.519> spot<00:02:25.790> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
this one is in its correct spot and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.509 
this one is in its correct spot and
turns<00:02:26.390> properly<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.860> one<00:02:28.069> is<00:02:28.220> in<00:02:28.370> its

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
turns properly this one is in its

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.550 
turns properly this one is in its
correct<00:02:28.730> spot<00:02:29.030> but<00:02:29.360> not<00:02:29.569> turned<00:02:29.840> properly<00:02:30.349> and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
correct spot but not turned properly and

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.280 
correct spot but not turned properly and
this<00:02:31.220> one<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.670> in<00:02:31.730> its<00:02:32.060> correct<00:02:32.330> spot<00:02:32.629> button

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
this one is in its correct spot button

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.880 
this one is in its correct spot button
and<00:02:33.590> turned<00:02:34.190> properly<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.900> when<00:02:36.379> you<00:02:36.500> perform

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
and turned properly so when you perform

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.710 
and turned properly so when you perform
this<00:02:37.010> algorithm<00:02:37.340> it'll<00:02:37.910> switch<00:02:38.120> these<00:02:38.360> three

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
this algorithm it'll switch these three

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.979 
this algorithm it'll switch these three
and<00:02:38.930> leave<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:40.010> back<00:02:40.220> left<00:02:40.610> one<00:02:40.849> the<00:02:40.970> same<00:02:41.209> so

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
and leave the back left one the same so

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.350 
and leave the back left one the same so
if<00:02:42.110> you<00:02:42.230> already<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.650> one<00:02:42.920> back<00:02:43.129> here<00:02:43.430> if<00:02:44.329> you

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
if you already have one back here if you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.180 
if you already have one back here if you
already<00:02:44.599> have<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:44.840> solved<00:02:45.349> be<00:02:45.680> sure<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.040> put

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
already have one solved be sure to put

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.100 
already have one solved be sure to put
it<00:02:46.280> back<00:02:46.430> here<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:47.329> don't<00:02:47.510> move<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.900> out<00:02:47.989> of

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
it back here so you don't move it out of

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.580 
it back here so you don't move it out of
its<00:02:48.260> correct<00:02:48.560> spot<00:02:49.750> so<00:02:50.750> please<00:02:51.049> click<00:02:51.349> the

last video in solving the cube which is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.920 
last video in solving the cube which is
just<00:03:01.010> turning<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:01.640> corners<00:03:02.060> so<00:03:02.269> now<00:03:02.720> your

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
just turning the corners so now your

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.709 
just turning the corners so now your
cube<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.319> solved
