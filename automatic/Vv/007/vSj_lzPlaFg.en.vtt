00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi to all I submit 777 welcome in 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.390
 this new video of this series in 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.639
 which I present to him every time 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.349
 economic players that can be 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210
 compared to price players more 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.280
 stronger highs etc. etc. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.190
 this time it's the hazard shift 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.560
 economic but I first tell you who 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.330
 apple and tell you two things the first is of 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.980
 suggest below in the comments a 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 another player to do for the next one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.359
 episode since I chose to do it 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 two a week as I asked in 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.380
 last video so there were twice 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
 week these videos of the players 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 cheap though I saw that so many me 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.780
 they asked us to do air 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 here is for me to remove a little 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 difficult considering that when I register 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 I should record the parades and it's me a little 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.030
 difficult because it's not all based on 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.710
 of me seeing that it also has something to do with it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 the opponent so I can't 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 to know if it is higher than the parades 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.690
 good of disgusting parades 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 or maybe you don't think it was right then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 I can't know it's too difficult 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.550
 make the video 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 if you want air for me I can do it but 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.640
 without video of the game but then so much 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.379
 we will see 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 the second thing instead I wanted to say is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.549
 as always to like this 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.030
 video for other episodes of this 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.880
 series 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.460
 but now who is the economic Sardinian 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.950
 obviously it's schurrle I say obviously 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.540
 because so many people will have come 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.470
 in mind that has schurrle and indeed it is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.930
 just him 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.390
 let's start with the statistics 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.220
 main the hazard speed and 89 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.320
 against 88 to schurrle then one 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.470
 difference in exists almost non-existent 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.990
 of only 1 and out of 181 how to schurrle this 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.020
 88 of speed weighs so much in a good way 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 because we see that the is very fast 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 dribbling instead is 91 against hazard 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.009
 83 of shore 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.180
 here according to me it is not so because not 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.340
 they look 83 ok it's a 83 but it's good at 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.430
 dribble however 83 is not very little 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.189
 it is compared to hazard is little 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.329
 however however 83 together with the 88 of 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.270
 speed is good there is a risk of 82 of 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.810
 shooting instead and schurrle to 83 then more 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.189
 one more this also compensates for the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.350
 dribbling a little bit lower compared 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.090
 to that of hazard then schurrle a 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.080
 a little bit more defensive than hazard 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.900
 with 30 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.060
 defense while hazard at 32 and thirst 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.010
 this thing is not taken rightly 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.500
 as a fundamental thing for a card 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.020
 especially for an exterior though also 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.990
 only here that 5 more can be seen that e 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.330
 schurrle go right back to some times 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:30.450
 becomes invisible in attack eto'o lo 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.630
 find yourself before the good midfield then 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.240
 hazard 84 of passage against 75 of 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.660
 then schurrle a lot less while the 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.700
 physicality is the 64 of hazard against 67 of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.560
 schurrle peuterey then as you have 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.720
 now the statistics are a lot 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.400
 balanced between the two cards is another 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.160
 which gives even more balance 32 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.440
 they are the stars or stability and the stars 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.060
 weak foot because I'm quo 34 schurrle 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.070
 when quo 34 of hazard 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.840
 now, however, after having said most 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.680
 part of the positive things as I said 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.320
 the statistics 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.360
 we pass to the negative things first 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.640
 what we say negative because it is not the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.940
 the bigger the precision shot is 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.480
 it's not so good and it's not so good 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.060
 not even the passage because with a 75 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.790
 there is only to say that the passage sins 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.930
 a bit of power bra accuracy 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.450
 nothing else 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.430
 the biggest counter instead is the price 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.900
 because I'm looking for Sardinian 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.730
 economic so just one player who 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.739
 costs less than hazard 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.540
 and it is at this point of view schurrle va 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.640
 well, however, it is not good we have seen 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.370
 economic in general because it costs 10 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.959
 11 thousand credits therefore costicch a little e 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.970
 now to finish the video then you are 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.670
 seeing the account of the pros and gods 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.190
 against my final vote for this one 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.540
 paper I still remember the suggest 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.269
 with another in the comments below 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.860
 player to say review for the 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.540
 next video is that both a player and 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.239
 expensive so i can find the player 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.800
 cheap if the video is liked put 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:01.010
 I like writing to my channel e 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.010
