00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
always goes in before the tomato because

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.449 
always goes in before the tomato because
I<00:02:48.220> want<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.430> cook<00:02:49.030> my<00:02:49.209> alcohol<00:02:49.720> off<00:02:49.930> basically

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
but I always move the skillet away from

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.069 
but I always move the skillet away from
the<00:02:53.709> flame<00:02:53.950> because<00:02:54.609> the<00:02:54.730> ouzo<00:02:55.090> can<00:02:55.689> light<00:02:55.900> up

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
the flame because the ouzo can light up

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:02.220 
the flame because the ouzo can light up
