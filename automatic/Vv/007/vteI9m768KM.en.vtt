00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.979 
cast in Shira is a little weaker in my
view<00:03:22.400> than<00:03:22.579> in<00:03:22.670> he-man<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.329> I<00:03:23.630> think<00:03:23.870> it's

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
view than in he-man and I think it's

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.110 
view than in he-man and I think it's
mostly<00:03:24.440> because<00:03:24.650> Shira<00:03:25.370> is<00:03:25.640> so<00:03:25.940> utterly

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
mostly because Shira is so utterly

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.150 
mostly because Shira is so utterly

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.270 
the entire horde and it's just one

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.330 
the entire horde and it's just one
general<00:05:02.840> within<00:05:03.080> the<00:05:03.380> army<00:05:03.830> which<00:05:04.160> is
