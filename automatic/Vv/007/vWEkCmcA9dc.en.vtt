00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.549
 May together here is christian again 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.440
 from appdata 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.929
 and I have the first smart watch here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.150
 from home asus lie in front of me or 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.730
 here somewhere on a frame in front of me 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.290
 angefixt and yes what should I say that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.149
 is the asus sandwich that is the first 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.070
 smart watch runs we can see too 

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:27.630
 with android would be that is the google 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.520
 Operating system for mobile applications 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.559
 for advertising and accordingly 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.600
 also the updates of google on time 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.950
 this clock will decide very shortly on the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.660
 unfortunately we do not have technical data 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.420
 so much information about the clock 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.579
 we have 512 MB of RAM 4 here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.850
 gigabytes of internal memory as well 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 another know and we have 16 3 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.699
 inch large display with a resolution 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.379
 of 320 x 320 pixels for a smart watch 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.660
 display absolutely sufficient or up 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.309
 At eye level with Samsung Life 's 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.629
 display is also on amoled basis 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.249
 Made that means we have here 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.449
 really great colors 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.519
 black level and also the brightness 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.140
 should be relatively good at this clock 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:06.390
 as you can see here is on this 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 watch a leather bracelet attached to it 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.409
 Also called in a standard version 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.979
 of 22 mm the leather bracelet I can 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.479
 switch 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.979
 that means I can all the others 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.450
 the bracelets i have with my optician and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.390
 I can get watch business here 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.310
 Attach this smart watch to the battery 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 a capacity of 369 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.530
 milli-hour is a bit below 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 the cbot or the samsung life and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.560
 Accordingly , only in 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.390
 quotes battery terms of 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.100
 one to one and a half days possible 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.960
 The watch has a weight of 570 grams 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.270
 and you notice it too it is a something 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.620
 heavier higher than samsung or lg 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.229
 that means we have a lot here 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.750
 high quality materials and when in the 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.550
 lateral construction looks then one becomes 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.990
 find that these are made up of three parts 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.280
 namely, consists of the bottom 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.350
 actually, then we have such a draw 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.300
 between belly of something reset 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.790
 is and of course the upper one 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.840
 side so the display at the exact 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.700
 you will also see 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.229
 that the display is slightly bent that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.420
 is also called to the edge easily drugs is so 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.979
 that the inputs are really good 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.869
 Otherwise, the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.570
 At the moment there is still one running 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.399
 demo on this clock level has very very 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.750
 many watch faces and also customizable 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.640
 watch base that means you can do that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.080
 look the clock on the display 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 I really try to change the whole thing 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.220
 now is the language input resp 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.630
 the theme has been activated and now 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.940
 it will take a moment before that 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.800
 back is world races is their 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.540
 can the look change the clock 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.980
 if I press it long one should 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.080
 You can do that here in this demo 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.790
 does not work but the function 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.530
 here as with these other watches too 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.300
 namely on android the base that is 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.970
 I can use various applications or 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.660
 get notifications like here 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.650
 to emphasize and accordingly 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.120
 otherwise I can do that 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.480
 Holiday does not have to do that too 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.250
 that of the tchibo or beer and leifken 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 that was actually it 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.120
 samsung still or respectively 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.430
 this is one of them 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.569
 reaction manager is available that is 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.519
 the clock can be your well-being 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.290
 measure and feel like the whole 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.999
 I should be able to work that unfortunately 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.889
 did not say it was always in the bottom 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:05.060
 range somehow typed on it like that 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.829
 then I can finally work 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.079
 not tell you what a 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.400
 first impression of the asus zenbook on the 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.739
 First look really makes a lot 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.790
 nice and good and high quality 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.829
 processed impression 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.659
 I definitely like it for 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.650
 199 euros now already the next 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.510
 weeks appear 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.590
 that was it with the short overview many 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.590
 Thanks for seeing it's good
