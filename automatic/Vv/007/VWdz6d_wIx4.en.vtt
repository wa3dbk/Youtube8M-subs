just the best second part if i'm using
an<00:01:05.780> ACO<00:01:06.680> which<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.430> very<00:01:07.910> good<00:01:07.970> because<00:01:08.180> it's

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
an ACO which is very good because it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.680 
an ACO which is very good because it's
got<00:01:08.570> very<00:01:08.810> low<00:01:09.530> recoil<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.760> kick<00:01:11.030> i<00:01:11.270> will

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
got very low recoil and kick i will

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.150 
got very low recoil and kick i will
probably<00:01:12.020> go<00:01:12.110> hard<00:01:12.410> line<00:01:12.650> because<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
probably go hard line because the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.650 
probably go hard line because the
chances<00:01:13.340> are<00:01:13.700> i'm<00:01:13.910> not<00:01:14.090> going<00:01:14.240> to<00:01:14.270> be<00:01:14.450> sitting

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
the head down to the chest with stopping

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.500 
the head down to the chest with stopping
power<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.230> without<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.790> is<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.090> one-shot

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
power and without it it is a one-shot

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.960 
power and without it it is a one-shot
kill<00:01:48.050> to<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.350> head<00:01:48.560> I<00:01:48.590> believe<00:01:49.070> I'm<00:01:49.400> not<00:01:49.730> too

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
kill to the head I believe I'm not too

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.780 
kill to the head I believe I'm not too
sure<00:01:50.480> now<00:01:50.750> I<00:01:50.780> believe<00:01:51.170> that's<00:01:51.320> what<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.710> is

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
sure now I believe that's what it is

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.700 
sure now I believe that's what it is
it's<00:01:52.790> a<00:01:52.880> semi-automatic<00:01:53.570> with<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:53.900> larger<00:01:54.440> clip

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
it's a semi-automatic with a larger clip

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.010 
it's a semi-automatic with a larger clip
and<00:01:55.040> swats<00:01:55.610> weapons<00:01:55.970> pretty<00:01:56.330> quickly<00:01:56.570> it's

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and swats weapons pretty quickly it's

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.080 
and swats weapons pretty quickly it's
probably<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:58.010> better<00:01:58.190> choice<00:01:58.490> to<00:01:58.700> go<00:01:58.880> with

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
probably the better choice to go with

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.600 
probably the better choice to go with
over<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.920> wa2000<00:02:00.920> but<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.280> does<00:02:01.460> require

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
over the wa2000 but it does require

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.220 
over the wa2000 but it does require
stopping<00:02:02.210> power<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.900> want<00:02:03.050> to<00:02:03.140> be

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
stopping power if you want to be

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.530 
stopping power if you want to be
effective<00:02:03.710> with<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.010> I'll<00:02:05.000> probably<00:02:05.270> go<00:02:05.480> with

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
effective with it I'll probably go with

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.420 
effective with it I'll probably go with
FMJ<00:02:05.930> because<00:02:06.409> I<00:02:06.440> feel<00:02:06.890> every<00:02:07.310> other

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
FMJ because I feel every other

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.710 
FMJ because I feel every other
attachment<00:02:08.030> isn't<00:02:08.360> really

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
attachment isn't really

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.120 
attachment isn't really
sorry<00:02:09.050> I<00:02:09.170> might<00:02:09.350> switch<00:02:09.590> it<00:02:09.740> up<00:02:09.830> with<00:02:10.070> the

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
sorry I might switch it up with the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.490 
sorry I might switch it up with the

really<00:02:12.710> going<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.980> be<00:02:13.130> needed<00:02:13.550> since<00:02:13.730> you've

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
really going to be needed since you've

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.030 
really going to be needed since you've
got<00:02:14.030> temple<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:14.630> in<00:02:14.810> each<00:02:14.960> magazine<00:02:15.350> and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.650 

don't<00:02:19.040> really<00:02:19.250> see<00:02:19.460> any<00:02:19.790> other<00:02:20.000> attachment

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
don't really see any other attachment

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.320 
don't really see any other attachment
that's<00:02:20.840> really<00:02:21.650> that<00:02:21.830> much<00:02:22.040> better<00:02:22.310> I<00:02:22.700> mean<00:02:23.180> I

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
that's really that much better I mean I

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.850 
that's really that much better I mean I
like<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.660> way<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.960> gun<00:02:24.140> is<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.590> I<00:02:24.650> might<00:02:24.770> as

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
like the way the gun is so I might as

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.850 
like the way the gun is so I might as
well<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.160> put<00:02:25.310> FMJ<00:02:25.820> on<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:26.320> the<00:02:27.320> second<00:02:27.740> one

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
well just put FMJ on it the second one

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.130 
well just put FMJ on it the second one
is<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.220> hidden<00:02:28.760> gun<00:02:28.790> i<00:02:29.480> like<00:02:29.660> to<00:02:29.810> call<00:02:29.960> it<00:02:30.020> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
is a hidden gun i like to call it the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.280 
is a hidden gun i like to call it the
m14<00:02:30.890> because<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.610> m14<00:02:32.210> is<00:02:32.450> pretty<00:02:32.780> much<00:02:33.020> just

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
m14 because the m14 is pretty much just

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.240 
m14 because the m14 is pretty much just
an<00:02:33.530> assault<00:02:33.950> rifle<00:02:34.040> variation<00:02:35.030> of<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.360> end<00:02:35.570> 21

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
an assault rifle variation of the end 21

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.530 
an assault rifle variation of the end 21
that's<00:02:37.250> why<00:02:37.430> I<00:02:37.460> nickname<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.180> class<00:02:38.390> because

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
that's why I nickname this class because

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.480 
that's why I nickname this class because
it's<00:02:38.750> basically<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.200> then<00:02:39.590> 14<00:02:40.040> can<00:02:40.340> run

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
it's basically just then 14 can run

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.910 
it's basically just then 14 can run
around<00:02:40.760> shooting<00:02:40.880> people<00:02:41.240> from<00:02:42.110> close<00:02:42.410> ranges

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
around shooting people from close ranges

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.580 
around shooting people from close ranges
and<00:02:43.160> long<00:02:43.400> ranges<00:02:43.880> so<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.660> very<00:02:44.780> good<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.350> I

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
and long ranges so it's very good so I

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.490 
and long ranges so it's very good so I
would<00:02:45.770> suggest<00:02:45.950> that<00:02:46.220> one<00:02:46.490> and<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.500> silencer

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
would suggest that one and the silencer

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.260 
would suggest that one and the silencer
scavenger<00:02:49.130> approach<00:02:49.459> is<00:02:49.700> good<00:02:49.910> for<00:02:50.120> long

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
scavenger approach is good for long

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.020 
scavenger approach is good for long
distances<00:02:50.920> if<00:02:51.920> you<00:02:52.070> put<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.430> silencer<00:02:52.850> on<00:02:52.880> it

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
distances if you put the silencer on it

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.760 
distances if you put the silencer on it
means<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.690> now<00:02:53.750> have<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.260> go<00:02:54.560> for<00:02:54.740> the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
means you can now have to go for the

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.320 
means you can now have to go for the
two-shot<00:02:55.220> kill<00:02:55.430> from<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.760> body<00:02:55.970> or<00:02:56.300> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
two-shot kill from the body or the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.870 
two-shot kill from the body or the
one-shot<00:02:56.810> kill<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.260> head<00:02:57.730> that's<00:02:58.730> all

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
one-shot kill to the head that's all

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.490 
one-shot kill to the head that's all
I've<00:02:59.000> got<00:02:59.030> really<00:02:59.450> for<00:02:59.630> those<00:02:59.750> sniper<00:03:00.140> rifles

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
I've got really for those sniper rifles

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.620 
I've got really for those sniper rifles
there<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.820> thing<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.090> need<00:03:02.390> to<00:03:02.480> realize

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
there the thing you need to realize

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.199 
there the thing you need to realize
about<00:03:02.810> those<00:03:03.170> sniper<00:03:03.440> offices<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.130> little<00:03:05.120> bit

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
about those sniper offices a little bit

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.720 
about those sniper offices a little bit
more<00:03:05.420> tricky<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.930> get<00:03:06.050> a<00:03:06.110> one-shot<00:03:06.620> kill<00:03:06.950> but

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
more tricky to get a one-shot kill but

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.150 
more tricky to get a one-shot kill but
it's<00:03:07.910> pretty<00:03:08.570> easy<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.990> get<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.320> standing<00:03:09.830> kill

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
it's pretty easy to get a standing kill

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.890 
it's pretty easy to get a standing kill
if<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.520> found<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.940> pattern<00:03:11.330> on<00:03:11.600> one

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
if you just found the pattern on one

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.380 
if you just found the pattern on one
person<00:03:12.350> so<00:03:12.620> that's<00:03:13.310> all<00:03:13.459> I've<00:03:13.610> got<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:13.910> those

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
person so that's all I've got for those

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.199 
person so that's all I've got for those
guns<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.230> will<00:03:15.739> see<00:03:15.950> you<00:03:15.980> for<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.400> riot<00:03:17.120> shield

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
guns I will see you for the riot shield

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.140 
guns I will see you for the riot shield
peace<00:03:17.870> out
