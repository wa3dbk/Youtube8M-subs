those colors and then create a second
test<00:01:36.509> chart<00:01:36.750> which<00:01:36.960> you'll<00:01:37.110> print<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
test chart which you'll print out this

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
test chart which you'll print out this
test<00:01:38.520> chart<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.030> based<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.200> readings<00:01:40.500> that

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
test chart is based on the readings that

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.499 
test chart is based on the readings that
you<00:01:40.680> got<00:01:40.890> from<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.100> first<00:01:41.310> test<00:01:41.520> chart<00:01:41.850> really

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you got from the first test chart really

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.920 
you got from the first test chart really
helps<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> figure<00:01:43.229> out<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> nuanced<00:01:43.740> colors

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
helps to figure out the nuanced colors

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.149 
helps to figure out the nuanced colors
once<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.320> measured<00:01:46.530> those<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
once you have measured those it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.520 
once you have measured those it
calculates<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.939> unique<00:01:48.329> profile<00:01:48.840> specifically

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
calculates a unique profile specifically

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.069 
calculates a unique profile specifically
for<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:49.829> printer<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:51.689> really<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.020> very

colors here I can get detail on each one

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.270 
colors here I can get detail on each one
of<00:03:08.980> them<00:03:09.420> it<00:03:10.420> gives<00:03:10.690> me<00:03:10.870> my<00:03:11.019> LAV<00:03:11.500> values<00:03:11.890> my

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
of them it gives me my LAV values my

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.720 
of them it gives me my LAV values my
srgb<00:03:12.940> values<00:03:13.299> for<00:03:13.510> each<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.400> snap

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
srgb values for each and I can snap

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.080 
srgb values for each and I can snap
right<00:03:16.120> to<00:03:16.540> any<00:03:17.080> of<00:03:17.650> these<00:03:18.040> libraries<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.940> can

right to any of these libraries I can

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.020 
right to any of these libraries I can
snap<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:19.959> Pantone<00:03:20.650> color<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.370> can<00:03:21.430> snap<00:03:21.880> it

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
snap it to a Pantone color I can snap it

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.630 
snap it to a Pantone color I can snap it
to<00:03:22.150> different<00:03:22.480> printing<00:03:22.720> situations<00:03:23.410> and<00:03:24.310> so

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
to different printing situations and so

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.570 
to different printing situations and so
I<00:03:24.700> can<00:03:24.940> see<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.239> hey<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.980> closest<00:03:27.340> match<00:03:27.549> to

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
I can see that hey the closest match to

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.920 
I can see that hey the closest match to
this<00:03:27.940> blue<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.299> I've<00:03:28.420> measured<00:03:28.570> on<00:03:28.840> my

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
this blue that I've measured on my

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.009 
this blue that I've measured on my
calendar<00:03:29.350> is<00:03:29.920> Pantone<00:03:30.670> 88<00:03:31.120> -<00:03:31.360> 3<00:03:31.750> -<00:03:31.959> 2<00:03:32.019> C<00:03:33.600> so<00:03:34.600> that

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
calendar is Pantone 88 - 3 - 2 C so that

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.520 
calendar is Pantone 88 - 3 - 2 C so that
is<00:03:35.650> a<00:03:35.709> really<00:03:36.370> nice<00:03:36.549> way<00:03:36.850> of<00:03:37.120> capturing<00:03:37.959> colors

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
is a really nice way of capturing colors

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.830 
is a really nice way of capturing colors
from<00:03:39.310> whatever<00:03:39.790> inspires<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.660> don't

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
from whatever inspires you you don't

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.590 
from whatever inspires you you don't
have<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.170> hold<00:03:41.769> your<00:03:42.040> ear<00:03:42.370> hook<00:03:43.120> up<00:03:43.299> to<00:03:43.480> it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
have to hold your ear hook up to it

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.120 
have to hold your ear hook up to it
anymore<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.200> don't<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.440> to<00:03:44.530> guess<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.980> can

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
anymore you don't have to guess you can

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.890 
anymore you don't have to guess you can
actually<00:03:45.280> just<00:03:45.610> zap<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.329> right<00:03:46.480> off<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> color

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
actually just zap it right off the color

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440 
actually just zap it right off the color
bring<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.260> right<00:03:47.440> into<00:03:47.620> your<00:03:47.769> computer<00:03:48.450> there

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
bring it right into your computer there

are other ways of building palettes you
can<00:03:52.120> also<00:03:52.920> import<00:03:53.920> images<00:03:54.340> say<00:03:54.610> a<00:03:54.640> client

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
can also import images say a client

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.430 
can also import images say a client
gives<00:03:55.360> you<00:03:55.540> an<00:03:55.690> image<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.079> they'd<00:03:56.230> like<00:03:56.380> to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
gives you an image that they'd like to

in<00:03:57.620> their<00:03:58.250> design<00:03:58.640> well<00:03:59.120> you<00:03:59.270> can<00:03:59.420> bring<00:03:59.600> that

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
in their design well you can bring that

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.930 
in their design well you can bring that
image<00:03:59.900> right<00:04:00.530> into<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.250> color<00:04:01.430> monkey<00:04:01.670> design

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.540 
image right into the color monkey design
program<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:02.690> it<00:04:03.590> will<00:04:03.710> automatically<00:04:04.310> pull

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
program and it will automatically pull

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.270 
program and it will automatically pull
the<00:04:05.030> 12<00:04:05.360> most<00:04:05.780> dominant<00:04:06.230> colors<00:04:06.620> out<00:04:06.860> of<00:04:06.920> there

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280

that you're looking for really isn't in

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.190 
that you're looking for really isn't in
there<00:04:12.110> as<00:04:12.410> you<00:04:13.400> can<00:04:13.630> double<00:04:14.630> click<00:04:14.660> on<00:04:14.990> it<00:04:15.140> and

say I want this color exactly right here

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.900 
say I want this color exactly right here
and<00:04:17.600> then<00:04:18.290> it<00:04:18.650> brings<00:04:18.860> it<00:04:19.010> up<00:04:19.130> for<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.730> can

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
and then it brings it up for you you can

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.340 
and then it brings it up for you you can
see<00:04:20.120> exactly<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:21.260> values<00:04:21.860> for<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:23.320> so<00:04:24.320> you

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
see exactly the values for that so you

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.200 
see exactly the values for that so you
can<00:04:24.680> bring<00:04:24.860> all<00:04:25.070> these<00:04:25.190> colors<00:04:25.580> into<00:04:26.180> your

old color libraries whether it be the

old color libraries whether it be the
Pantone<00:04:40.100> libraries<00:04:40.580> we<00:04:41.330> have<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.600> new

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
Pantone libraries we have the new

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.190 
Pantone libraries we have the new
Pantone<00:04:42.170> go<00:04:42.820> system<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:43.940> there<00:04:44.090> we<00:04:44.780> also<00:04:44.930> have

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
Pantone go system in there we also have

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.800 
Pantone go system in there we also have
the<00:04:45.850> Pantone<00:04:46.850> matching<00:04:47.030> system<00:04:47.180> libraries

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
the Pantone matching system libraries

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.440 
the Pantone matching system libraries
and<00:04:48.020> everyone<00:04:48.320> has<00:04:48.910> been<00:04:49.910> using<00:04:50.090> for<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.420> long

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450

bit and pull out this kind of purplish
blue<00:05:00.890> they<00:05:01.130> call<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:01.520> it's<00:05:01.760> Pantone<00:05:02.180> 82<00:05:02.690> -<00:05:02.870> 2<00:05:03.140> -

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
blue they call it it's Pantone 82 - 2 -

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.360 
blue they call it it's Pantone 82 - 2 -

and then voila we have a palette right
here<00:05:33.700> what<00:05:34.700> it's<00:05:34.820> doing<00:05:35.120> is<00:05:35.270> it's<00:05:35.480> showing<00:05:35.840> you

here what it's doing is it's showing you

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.290 
here what it's doing is it's showing you

the color that you've either measured or

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:42.100 
the color that you've either measured or
imported<00:05:38.750> and<00:05:39.400> comparing<00:05:40.400> it<00:05:40.520> to<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:41.300> Pantone

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
imported and comparing it to the Pantone

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.080 
imported and comparing it to the Pantone
we<00:05:42.290> I've<00:05:42.530> selected<00:05:42.710> the<00:05:43.100> Pantone<00:05:43.520> go<00:05:43.700> system

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
we I've selected the Pantone go system

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.150 
we I've selected the Pantone go system
so<00:05:44.630> it's<00:05:44.840> comparing<00:05:45.410> it<00:05:45.530> it'll<00:05:45.860> show<00:05:46.010> you<00:05:46.100> a

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
so it's comparing it it'll show you a

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.600 
so it's comparing it it'll show you a
slight<00:05:46.460> variation<00:05:46.820> that<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.750> closest<00:05:48.169> color

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
slight variation that the closest color

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.040 
slight variation that the closest color
and<00:05:49.610> then<00:05:49.850> what<00:05:50.000> I<00:05:50.030> can<00:05:50.240> do<00:05:50.360> once<00:05:50.600> I<00:05:50.720> have<00:05:50.900> this
