00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.780
 ransoming shop the deficit replace 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.390
 hope by an engine I you what is it 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.590
 after a little consciousness of fact there is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.170
 two three days that was up to that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.970
 negative does that what we do with the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.520
 word egypt the first measure i have michao 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.439
 level we have this opus agitators done 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.380
 the suspension towers so that his

 chloe girl does not settle here and there 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.720
 add up all that we have two six engines

 drive wheels with the double of plain 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.680
 the double exit but the double of 3 and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.659
 of doga x 220 on the disorder 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.970
 of installation yeah sure it's for sure 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.070
 that they were alas and alain poet 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.540
 souchon maintained their advance at an axle 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.060
 rigid went with suspensions 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.310
 independent

 [Music] 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.990
 had quoted drum the service offered 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.030
 a record at 20 before there was a super 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.189
 illu two suspects had invented gaga 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 gaga to always find room 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.450
 for all this and we must all short 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.250
 coordination that is what is 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.689
 important is the shifter for them 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.209
 encrypt and other aspirants together 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.810
 for the pedal the clutch to disengage

 the country of the eu as problem 400 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.220
 injured the biggest challenge the biggest 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.770
 size mismatch you know what 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.810
 the two challenges we had is that he 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.220
 have to keep them 2 bat of origin then 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.690
 it was necessary to allow a trap this shock 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 so that it looks the most free 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.850

 from April to get some air underneath 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.320
 on one side by all we can 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.270
 madness radiators doctor it a lot of 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.100
 women who put this so that some 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.600
 have constant temperature 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.030
 four buildings builds a car 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.610
 like that this success the goal is not 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.560
 to have something to have the nose 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.120
 off plus my money a point of view 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 reliability all this is something 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.840
 of something unique she as well 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.310
 balanced iti managed a no-fault in 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.820
 his engine at the front and almost had no 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.640
 cutting 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.070
 there she is here did not make the weight 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.560
 well balanced lotto the double the cost of 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.600
 all wheel drive lsd forward 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.000
 last actus starts with a small 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 machine for an echo it's not 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.480
 so much need we expose ourselves with a 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.540
 pinch that 500 fourth world drive et al 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.140
 hadari silvio 25 years ago a tragedy 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.850
 pop it takes a simple tool and guard 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.500
