most accurate means is and accept that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.240 
most accurate means is and accept that
they<00:01:54.390> will<00:01:54.540> need<00:01:54.689> some<00:01:54.960> reading<00:01:55.259> glasses<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they will need some reading glasses and
