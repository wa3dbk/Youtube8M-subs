00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.110 
simply lift out a little bit release of
course<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:04.920> last<00:02:05.130> one<00:02:05.280> wants<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.640> be<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:05.850> little

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
course the last one wants to be a little

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.360 
course the last one wants to be a little
difficult

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.789 

there<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:12.989> essentially<00:02:13.500> what<00:02:13.530> it's

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
there and this is essentially what it's

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.319 
there and this is essentially what it's
going<00:02:14.189> to<00:02:14.250> look<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.609> when<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.879> pull<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.239> out

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
going to look like when you pull it out

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.449 
going to look like when you pull it out
Center<00:02:16.170> is<00:02:16.260> missing<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.890> nothing<00:02:17.250> more<00:02:17.400> than

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
Center is missing it's nothing more than

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.910 
Center is missing it's nothing more than
just<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.989> four-legged<00:02:18.989> little<00:02:19.260> piece<00:02:19.739> of

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
just a four-legged little piece of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.979 
just a four-legged little piece of
plastic<00:02:20.010> pin<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.969> that's<00:02:21.510> all<00:02:21.659> that<00:02:21.810> holds

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
plastic pin and that's all that holds

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.089 
plastic pin and that's all that holds
them<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.200> place<00:02:23.569> now<00:02:24.569> all<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.989> have<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.530> three

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
them in place now all you have is three

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.210 
them in place now all you have is three
spring<00:02:26.430> clips<00:02:26.700> on<00:02:26.939> the<00:02:27.569> backside<00:02:28.079> that<00:02:28.590> hold

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
spring clips on the backside that hold

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860 
spring clips on the backside that hold
this<00:02:29.370> inflation<00:02:29.909> you<00:02:29.970> can<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.299> it's<00:02:30.480> already

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
this inflation you can see it's already

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.599 
this inflation you can see it's already
loose<00:02:31.140> even<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.920> plastic<00:02:32.370> rivets<00:02:32.519> out

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
loose even with the plastic rivets out

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:40.610 
loose even with the plastic rivets out
again<00:02:36.109> get<00:02:37.109> up<00:02:37.230> underneath<00:02:39.319> this<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
again get up underneath this is the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.000 
again get up underneath this is the
beauty<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.010> having<00:02:41.099> plastic<00:02:41.700> tools<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.480> that

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
beauty of having plastic tools is that

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.420 
beauty of having plastic tools is that
any<00:02:44.010> damage<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.349> you'll<00:02:46.349> hear<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.799> release

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
any damage and you'll hear it release

00:02:47.430 --> 00:03:05.290 
any damage and you'll hear it release
from<00:02:47.669> the<00:02:47.760> spring<00:02:48.030> clip

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.870 

they're<00:03:06.300> essentially<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.810> aur<00:03:07.490> ok<00:03:08.490> so<00:03:08.550> now<00:03:08.820> we

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
they're essentially the aur ok so now we

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.160 
they're essentially the aur ok so now we
have<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.210> new<00:03:09.330> piece<00:03:09.510> of<00:03:09.540> trim<00:03:09.870> that<00:03:09.900> we're

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
have the new piece of trim that we're

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.200 
have the new piece of trim that we're
going<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.380> install<00:03:10.710> on<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.100> vehicle<00:03:11.520> before

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
going to install on the vehicle before

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.360 
going to install on the vehicle before
we<00:03:12.540> do<00:03:12.720> that<00:03:12.750> you're<00:03:13.620> going<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.830> remove<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
we do that you're going to remove the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.190 
we do that you're going to remove the
three<00:03:14.640> snap<00:03:14.910> clips<00:03:15.270> that<00:03:15.480> are<00:03:15.540> mounted<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.020> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
three snap clips that are mounted on the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.230 
three snap clips that are mounted on the
a<00:03:16.230> pill<00:03:16.620> or<00:03:16.650> underneath<00:03:17.190> we<00:03:17.760> don't<00:03:17.970> longer

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
a pill or underneath we don't longer

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.530 
a pill or underneath we don't longer
need<00:03:18.420> these<00:03:18.660> as<00:03:19.530> you'll<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.640> get<00:03:20.820> three

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
need these as you'll see you get three

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.360 
need these as you'll see you get three
new<00:03:21.690> ones<00:03:21.900> on<00:03:22.200> these<00:03:22.530> trim<00:03:22.800> panels<00:03:23.220> and

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
new ones on these trim panels and

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.220 
new ones on these trim panels and
essentially<00:03:24.270> how<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.600> works<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.080> when

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
essentially how this works is when

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.200 
essentially how this works is when
you're<00:03:25.350> going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.530> reinstall<00:03:26.100> this<00:03:26.370> you're

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
you're going to reinstall this you're

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.600 
you're going to reinstall this you're
going<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.420> take<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.870> backside<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:29.070> this<00:03:29.220> trim

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
going to take the backside of this trim

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.300 
going to take the backside of this trim
piece<00:03:29.820> and<00:03:30.380> insert<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.650> back<00:03:31.860> of<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.070> panel

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
piece and insert the back of the panel

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.010 
piece and insert the back of the panel

and these rounded tabs on the clips I'm
going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.260> reach<00:03:37.440> over<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.830> top<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.100> this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
going to reach over the top of this

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.600 
going to reach over the top of this
raised<00:03:39.420> area<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:40.200> snap<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.800> place<00:03:40.830> it's

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
raised area and snap in place it's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.030 
raised area and snap in place it's
pretty<00:03:41.850> much<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.060> one-shot<00:03:42.630> deal<00:03:42.680> so<00:03:43.680> we'll

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
pretty much a one-shot deal so we'll

and<00:03:56.690> line<00:03:57.690> up<00:03:57.930> the<00:03:58.080> holes<00:03:58.290> for<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.250> pushpins

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
and line up the holes for the pushpins

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.449 
and line up the holes for the pushpins
and<00:04:02.760> then<00:04:03.030> you're<00:04:03.180> going<00:04:03.330> to<00:04:03.450> push<00:04:04.220> forward<00:04:05.220> on

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
and then you're going to push forward on
