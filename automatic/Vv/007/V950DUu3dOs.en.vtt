switch you can just kind of drill it and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.600 
switch you can just kind of drill it and
isolate<00:03:08.350> it<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.300> instead<00:03:10.300> of<00:03:10.360> doing<00:03:11.700> this<00:03:14.610> you

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
isolate it so instead of doing this you

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.670 
isolate it so instead of doing this you
can<00:03:15.730> just<00:03:15.820> isolate<00:03:15.970> each<00:03:16.420> part<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.470> can

can just isolate each part you can

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.490 
can just isolate each part you can
support<00:03:18.250> yourself<00:03:18.489> with<00:03:18.760> both<00:03:18.970> your<00:03:19.090> arms

switch your feet and then lean forward

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.729 
switch your feet and then lean forward
and<00:03:26.500> just<00:03:27.010> get<00:03:27.190> used<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.459> switching<00:03:28.470> side<00:03:29.470> side

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
and just get used to switching side side

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.000 
and just get used to switching side side
with<00:03:30.010> your<00:03:30.130> arms<00:03:31.170> so<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.290> opposite<00:03:32.620> hand<00:03:32.860> is

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
with your arms so the opposite hand is

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.240 
with your arms so the opposite hand is
up<00:03:33.040> from<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.970> arm<00:03:34.090> that<00:03:34.209> supporting<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.980> then

up from the arm that supporting and then

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.030 
up from the arm that supporting and then
you<00:03:37.150> pump<00:03:37.300> together<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:39.810> this<00:03:40.810> legs<00:03:41.110> out<00:03:41.410> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
you pump together so this legs out the

step all we do after that switch is

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.410 
step all we do after that switch is
again<00:03:54.700> pull<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:55.660> leg<00:03:55.930> out<00:03:56.740> in<00:03:57.160> make<00:03:58.060> that<00:03:58.270> your

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
too smooth when you're first learning is

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.199 
too smooth when you're first learning is
isolate<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.470> slap<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:18.070> steps<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.940> slower

isolate the slap the steps the slower
you<00:04:19.330> do<00:04:19.570> it<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.870> faster<00:04:20.170> you're<00:04:20.290> going<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
you do it the faster you're going to

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.160 
you do it the faster you're going to
learn<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.739> and<00:04:21.510> pretty<00:04:22.510> quick<00:04:22.720> to<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:22.930> doing<00:04:23.110> at

to be nice and tight you want to hit the
same<00:04:29.710> angles<00:04:30.070> every<00:04:30.280> time<00:04:30.460> so<00:04:31.240> when<00:04:31.420> you're

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
same angles every time so when you're

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.570 
same angles every time so when you're
turning<00:04:31.930> at<00:04:32.050> 180<00:04:32.680> degrees<00:04:32.770> you<00:04:33.220> could<00:04:33.340> pick<00:04:33.430> an

turning at 180 degrees you could pick an

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.970 
turning at 180 degrees you could pick an

object or a point try to line up and hit
that<00:04:36.100> same<00:04:36.340> point<00:04:36.520> every<00:04:36.910> single<00:04:37.180> time<00:04:37.360> and

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
that same point every single time and

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.500 
that same point every single time and
another<00:04:39.550> thing<00:04:39.670> if<00:04:40.000> you're<00:04:40.240> first<00:04:40.420> learning

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
another thing if you're first learning

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.020 
another thing if you're first learning
this<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:41.680> can<00:04:41.830> try<00:04:42.010> it<00:04:42.070> on<00:04:42.220> linoleum<00:04:42.490> or<00:04:42.820> and

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
this you can try it on linoleum or and

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.030 
this you can try it on linoleum or and
socks<00:04:43.270> it'll<00:04:44.110> make<00:04:44.140> a<00:04:44.350> little<00:04:44.530> bit<00:04:44.620> easier<00:04:44.920> to

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
socks it'll make a little bit easier to

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.310 
socks it'll make a little bit easier to
slide<00:04:45.280> your<00:04:45.490> feet<00:04:45.640> through<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:46.210> take<00:04:47.050> some<00:04:47.260> of

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
slide your feet through and take some of

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.200 
slide your feet through and take some of
the<00:04:47.380> friction<00:04:47.680> off<00:04:47.800> so<00:04:48.580> let's<00:04:48.730> give<00:04:48.850> it<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:49.000> try

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
the friction off so let's give it a try

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.940 
the friction off so let's give it a try
half<00:04:49.630> speed<00:04:49.840> then<00:04:50.350> we'll<00:04:50.470> do<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.650> full<00:04:50.830> speed

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
half speed then we'll do it full speed

00:04:50.950 --> 00:05:00.530 
half speed then we'll do it full speed
to<00:04:51.190> the<00:04:51.280> music<00:04:52.560> so<00:04:53.560> we'll<00:04:53.680> go<00:04:54.540> one<00:04:56.520> two<00:04:58.440> three

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
to the music so we'll go one two three

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:28.470 
to the music so we'll go one two three
four<00:05:02.730> 1234<00:05:12.600> 1234<00:05:20.850> 1234<00:05:26.640> that<00:05:27.640> felt<00:05:27.880> good<00:05:28.030> let's

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
four 1234 1234 1234 that felt good let's

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.630 
four 1234 1234 1234 that felt good let's
try<00:05:28.600> it<00:05:28.660> full<00:05:28.810> speed<00:05:28.990> a<00:05:29.410> little<00:05:30.130> bit<00:05:30.250> more<00:05:30.460> time

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
try it full speed a little bit more time

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.460 
try it full speed a little bit more time
run<00:05:30.880> through<00:05:31.060> lesson<00:05:31.360> again<00:05:31.480> when<00:05:32.260> you<00:05:32.350> feel

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
run through lesson again when you feel

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.380 
run through lesson again when you feel
like<00:05:32.560> you're<00:05:32.740> ready<00:05:32.890> we'll<00:05:33.640> go<00:05:33.760> full<00:05:33.970> speed<00:05:34.120> to

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:34.390 
like you're ready we'll go full speed to

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.330 
like you're ready we'll go full speed to
