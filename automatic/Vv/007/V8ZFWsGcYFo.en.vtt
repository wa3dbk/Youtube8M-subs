00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
exact and this set was considerably

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.859 
exact and this set was considerably
delayed<00:00:16.049> after<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.090> base<00:00:18.090> actually<00:00:18.660> after

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
delayed after the base actually after

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.810 
delayed after the base actually after
the<00:00:18.920> fossil-based<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.220> too<00:00:20.430> came<00:00:20.699> in

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the fossil-based that too came in

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.939 
the fossil-based that too came in
between<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.170> about<00:00:22.410> six<00:00:22.769> months

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
between but it was about six months

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.970 
between but it was about six months
between<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:24.390> fossil<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.350> team<00:00:25.619> rocket

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
between the fossil and team rocket

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.920 
between the fossil and team rocket
releases<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.789> reason<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.119> was<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.570> because

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
releases the reason that was is because

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.960 
releases the reason that was is because
this<00:00:28.710> set<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.490> set<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.820> have<00:00:29.939> a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
this set was the first set to have a

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.240 
this set was the first set to have a
secret<00:00:30.420> rare<00:00:30.630> card<00:00:30.990> which<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.590> basically<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
secret rare card which is basically a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
card that has a number higher than the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.020 
card that has a number higher than the
amount<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> cards<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> set<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.430> dark

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
amount of cards in the set and dark

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.869 
amount of cards in the set and dark
raichu<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:36.870> card<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:38.219> cards

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
raichu is that card and that cards

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.660 
raichu is that card and that cards
number<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.210> 83<00:00:39.840> out<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.079> 82<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.950> there's<00:00:41.129> 83

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
number is 83 out of 82 so there's 83

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
number is 83 out of 82 so there's 83
total<00:00:42.059> cards<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> set<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.379> look

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
total cards in the set but if you look

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.220 
total cards in the set but if you look
down<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.820> only<00:00:44.910> show<00:00:45.210> 82<00:00:45.750> cards<00:00:46.110> in

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
down here it will only show 82 cards in

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
down here it will only show 82 cards in
the<00:00:46.289> set<00:00:46.469> because<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.950> right<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the set because that right you is a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.660 
the set because that right you is a
secret<00:00:47.940> rare<00:00:48.210> card<00:00:48.739> the<00:00:49.739> symbol<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.489> team

rocket is this are like this as you can

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.720 
rocket is this are like this as you can
see<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> holographic<00:00:56.010> pattern<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.640> same

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
see the holographic pattern is the same

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.979 
see the holographic pattern is the same
as<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:58.100> set<00:00:59.100> i<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.399> got<00:00:59.550> done<00:00:59.579> reviewing<00:00:59.989> the

probably<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> better<00:01:25.680> type<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.220> later<00:01:26.759> on<00:01:26.970> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
probably a better type and later on the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.969 
probably a better type and later on the
neo<00:01:27.330> sets<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.869> introduced<00:01:28.259> light<00:01:28.680> type
