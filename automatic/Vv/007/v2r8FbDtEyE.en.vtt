00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.750 

all<00:00:06.790> right<00:00:07.000> I<00:00:07.149> wanted<00:00:07.509> to<00:00:07.600> demonstrate<00:00:07.779> how<00:00:08.349> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
all right I wanted to demonstrate how to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.359 
all right I wanted to demonstrate how to
deal<00:00:09.760> with<00:00:09.820> the<00:00:10.090> smaller<00:00:10.990> faster<00:00:11.650> mech<00:00:12.099> when

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:12.369 
deal with the smaller faster mech when

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.850 
deal with the smaller faster mech when
you<00:00:12.549> are<00:00:12.730> a<00:00:12.760> larger<00:00:13.269> slower<00:00:13.570> mech

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
you are a larger slower mech

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.859 
you are a larger slower mech
in<00:00:16.279> game<00:00:16.699> when<00:00:16.880> you're<00:00:17.029> expecting<00:00:17.210> someone

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869 
in game when you're expecting someone

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.220 
in game when you're expecting someone
you<00:00:18.080> always<00:00:18.260> see<00:00:18.650> them<00:00:18.800> just<00:00:19.900> full<00:00:20.900> speed

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
you always see them just full speed

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.170 
you always see them just full speed
straight<00:00:21.740> on<00:00:21.890> trying<00:00:22.400> to<00:00:22.580> shoot<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:22.970> lighter

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
straight on trying to shoot the lighter

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.630 
straight on trying to shoot the lighter
Mac<00:00:23.420> as<00:00:23.599> it<00:00:23.779> passes<00:00:23.990> in<00:00:24.289> front<00:00:24.320> of<00:00:24.590> them<00:00:24.680> you

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
Mac as it passes in front of them you

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.550 
Mac as it passes in front of them you
know<00:00:25.730> or<00:00:25.910> trying<00:00:26.210> to<00:00:26.270> turn<00:00:26.480> into<00:00:26.810> them<00:00:26.990> as<00:00:27.289> they

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
know or trying to turn into them as they

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.380 
know or trying to turn into them as they
go<00:00:27.710> by<00:00:27.919> and<00:00:28.250> it's<00:00:28.400> just<00:00:28.550> not<00:00:28.730> the<00:00:28.880> way<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.029> do<00:00:29.240> it

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
go by and it's just not the way to do it

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.290 
go by and it's just not the way to do it
and<00:00:30.130> I'll<00:00:31.130> show<00:00:31.310> you<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:34.000> larger<00:00:35.000> circle<00:00:35.239> in

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
and I'll show you the larger circle in

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.180 
and I'll show you the larger circle in
the<00:00:35.360> middle<00:00:35.390> is<00:00:35.660> the<00:00:35.690> larger<00:00:36.140> mech<00:00:36.320> and<00:00:36.500> the

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the middle is the larger mech and the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.400 
the middle is the larger mech and the
smaller<00:00:37.730> circle<00:00:38.090> orbiting<00:00:38.420> is<00:00:38.600> the<00:00:39.140> smaller

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
smaller circle orbiting is the smaller

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.540 
smaller circle orbiting is the smaller
mech<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:40.570> right<00:00:41.570> now<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:42.190> larger<00:00:43.190> mech<00:00:43.340> would

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
mech and right now the larger mech would

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.580 
mech and right now the larger mech would
be<00:00:43.700> stationary<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.780> smaller<00:00:45.170> mech<00:00:45.440> can

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
be stationary so the smaller mech can

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.650 
be stationary so the smaller mech can
just<00:00:45.770> circle<00:00:46.100> it<00:00:46.160> at<00:00:46.340> an<00:00:46.579> even<00:00:46.910> pace<00:00:47.120> all<00:00:47.600> the

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
just circle it at an even pace all the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.170 
just circle it at an even pace all the
way<00:00:47.780> around<00:00:48.280> but<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.400> soon<00:00:49.610> as<00:00:49.700> you<00:00:49.880> start

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
way around but as soon as you start

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.140 
way around but as soon as you start
moving<00:00:50.650> that<00:00:51.650> circle<00:00:52.100> changes<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.880> the<00:00:52.970> path

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
moving that circle changes in the path

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.960 
moving that circle changes in the path
of<00:00:53.329> the<00:00:53.390> smaller<00:00:53.720> make<00:00:53.930> changes<00:00:54.670> so<00:00:55.670> let's<00:00:55.820> say

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
of the smaller make changes so let's say

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.110 
of the smaller make changes so let's say
that<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.360> left<00:00:57.079> side<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.290> the<00:00:57.410> screen<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
that the left side of the screen is the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.180 
that the left side of the screen is the
direction<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.020> larger<00:01:00.470> mech<00:01:00.620> will<00:01:00.739> be<00:01:00.860> moving

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
direction the larger mech will be moving

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.149 
direction the larger mech will be moving
forward<00:01:02.350> we'll<00:01:03.350> see<00:01:03.500> what<00:01:03.620> happens<00:01:03.710> when<00:01:04.009> it

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
forward we'll see what happens when it

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.410 
forward we'll see what happens when it
starts<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.460> move<00:01:04.579> forward<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.149> start<00:01:08.390> to

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
starts to move forward and you start to

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.420 
starts to move forward and you start to
see<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:10.570> smaller<00:01:11.570> mex<00:01:11.930> path<00:01:12.920> changes

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
see that the smaller mex path changes

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.230 
see that the smaller mex path changes
and<00:01:14.290> then<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:15.439> time<00:01:16.009> that<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.549> smaller<00:01:16.969> mech

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
and then the time that the smaller mech

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.649 
and then the time that the smaller mech
is<00:01:17.390> in<00:01:17.540> front<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.970> shorter<00:01:19.970> than<00:01:20.180> it<00:01:20.510> is

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
is in front of you is shorter than it is

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.899 
is in front of you is shorter than it is
when<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.290> behind<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.370> it<00:01:22.460> gets<00:01:22.549> to<00:01:22.700> shoot

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
when it's behind you so it gets to shoot

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.260 
when it's behind you so it gets to shoot
you<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:23.240> back<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.810> lot<00:01:24.229> more<00:01:25.060> without<00:01:26.060> you

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
you in the back a lot more without you

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.330 
you in the back a lot more without you
being<00:01:26.450> able<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.810> do<00:01:26.930> anything<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.590> it<00:01:28.159> also

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
being able to do anything and it also

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.940 
being able to do anything and it also
gets<00:01:28.580> a<00:01:28.670> chance<00:01:28.909> to<00:01:29.210> just<00:01:29.479> basically<00:01:30.020> stop<00:01:30.590> and

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
gets a chance to just basically stop and

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.130 
gets a chance to just basically stop and
keep<00:01:31.729> shooting<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.450> in<00:01:32.479> the<00:01:32.659> back<00:01:32.780> until<00:01:32.960> you

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
keep shooting you in the back until you

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.320 
keep shooting you in the back until you
decide<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:33.500> want<00:01:33.650> to<00:01:33.710> turn<00:01:33.830> around<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.210> you

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
decide you want to turn around and you

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.810 
decide you want to turn around and you
don't<00:01:35.720> want<00:01:35.840> to<00:01:35.930> do<00:01:36.049> that<00:01:36.369> you<00:01:37.369> want<00:01:37.490> to<00:01:37.610> try<00:01:37.760> to

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
don't want to do that you want to try to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.120 
don't want to do that you want to try to
keep<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.119> mech<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:38.510> front<00:01:38.840> of<00:01:38.930> you<00:01:39.080> as<00:01:39.260> much<00:01:39.979> as

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
keep the mech in front of you as much as

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.880 
keep the mech in front of you as much as
you<00:01:40.220> can<00:01:40.720> so<00:01:41.720> let's<00:01:41.930> switch<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.710> direction

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
you can so let's switch the direction

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.840 
you can so let's switch the direction
and<00:01:43.369> say<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.860> right<00:01:45.860> side<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.460> your

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and say that the right side is your

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.330 
and say that the right side is your
facing<00:01:47.270> direction<00:01:47.510> for<00:01:47.810> forward<00:01:48.260> but<00:01:49.070> we<00:01:49.159> want

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
facing direction for forward but we want

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.980 
facing direction for forward but we want
to<00:01:49.430> start<00:01:49.580> moving<00:01:49.729> backward<00:01:50.479> want<00:01:50.689> to<00:01:50.750> put<00:01:50.900> it

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
to start moving backward want to put it

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.800 
to start moving backward want to put it
in<00:01:51.080> full<00:01:51.320> reverse<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:53.060> able<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.420> twist<00:01:53.659> the

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
in full reverse and be able to twist the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.980 
in full reverse and be able to twist the
torso<00:01:53.990> from<00:01:54.320> left<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.710> right<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> we're<00:01:56.900> going

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
torso from left to right so we're going

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.530 
torso from left to right so we're going
to<00:01:57.080> throw<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.320> in<00:01:57.380> reverse<00:01:57.409> and<00:01:57.860> now<00:01:58.540> you'll

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
to throw it in reverse and now you'll

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.370 
to throw it in reverse and now you'll
see<00:01:59.689> that<00:01:59.810> the<00:02:01.390> smaller<00:02:02.390> mech<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.780> in<00:02:02.960> front<00:02:03.259> of

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
see that the smaller mech is in front of

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.710 
see that the smaller mech is in front of
you<00:02:03.530> more<00:02:03.710> because<00:02:04.360> when<00:02:05.360> you're<00:02:05.509> going

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
you more because when you're going

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.120 
you more because when you're going
backward<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.229> he's<00:02:06.380> going<00:02:06.530> forward<00:02:06.950> at<00:02:07.040> this

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
backward and he's going forward at this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.880 
backward and he's going forward at this
point<00:02:07.430> right<00:02:07.549> here<00:02:08.500> you're<00:02:09.500> putting<00:02:09.679> more

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
point right here you're putting more

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.509 
point right here you're putting more
distance<00:02:10.310> between<00:02:10.369> you<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.939> him<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.400> you

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
distance between you and him so then you

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.050 
distance between you and him so then you
can<00:02:13.849> start<00:02:14.180> looking<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:15.379> your<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.769> and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
can start looking to your right and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.220 
can start looking to your right and
shooting<00:02:17.060> them<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.299> following<00:02:17.840> him<00:02:17.959> all<00:02:18.079> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
way around to your left this whole area

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.100 
way around to your left this whole area
here<00:02:21.849> then<00:02:22.849> he's<00:02:23.000> only<00:02:23.150> behind<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.050> a

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
here then he's only behind you for a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.130 
here then he's only behind you for a
short<00:02:24.440> time<00:02:25.569> that's<00:02:26.569> way<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.750> put<00:02:27.020> more

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
short time that's way you put more

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.170 
short time that's way you put more
damage<00:02:27.500> on<00:02:27.680> them<00:02:27.800> he's<00:02:28.340> putting<00:02:28.670> less<00:02:28.849> damage

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
damage on them he's putting less damage

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.590 
damage on them he's putting less damage
on<00:02:29.300> you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
on you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.780 
on you
at<00:02:30.050> least<00:02:30.200> in<00:02:30.350> the<00:02:30.440> back<00:02:30.620> where<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:31.700> don't

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
at least in the back where you don't

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.940 
at least in the back where you don't
have<00:02:32.000> as<00:02:32.120> much<00:02:32.240> armor<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.380> you're

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
have as much armor and you're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.700 
have as much armor and you're
effectively<00:02:34.370> dita<00:02:35.080> defending<00:02:36.080> yourself<00:02:36.440> and

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
effectively dita defending yourself and

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.700 
effectively dita defending yourself and
making<00:02:36.980> him<00:02:37.190> go<00:02:37.250> it's<00:02:37.550> not<00:02:37.700> worth<00:02:38.500> me<00:02:39.500> taking

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
making him go it's not worth me taking

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.130 
making him go it's not worth me taking
all<00:02:39.950> his<00:02:40.040> damage<00:02:40.430> to<00:02:40.640> shoot<00:02:40.820> him<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:41.990> he's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
all his damage to shoot him so he's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.370 
all his damage to shoot him so he's
going<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.320> run<00:02:42.440> off<00:02:42.500> or<00:02:42.920> he's<00:02:43.160> going<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.310> die

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
going to run off or he's going to die

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.780 
going to run off or he's going to die
that's<00:02:45.380> basically<00:02:45.590> how<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.190> deal<00:02:46.580> with

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
that's basically how you deal with

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.820 
that's basically how you deal with
smaller<00:02:47.210> max<00:02:47.710> reverse<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:50.450> not<00:02:50.800> turn<00:02:51.800> your

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
smaller max reverse do not turn your

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.550 
smaller max reverse do not turn your
legs<00:02:52.250> just<00:02:52.580> use<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> torso<00:02:53.450> when<00:02:54.080> he<00:02:54.260> goes<00:02:54.410> out

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
legs just use a torso when he goes out

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.630 
legs just use a torso when he goes out
of<00:02:54.740> range<00:02:54.980> behind<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.450> wait<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:57.640> swing

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
of range behind you you wait you swing

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.770 
of range behind you you wait you swing
all<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.880> way<00:02:58.970> over<00:02:59.300> to<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.420> opposite

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
all the way over to the opposite

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.360 
all the way over to the opposite
direction<00:02:59.900> wait<00:03:00.770> for<00:03:00.950> him<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.070> come<00:03:01.220> back

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
direction wait for him to come back

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.190 
direction wait for him to come back
around<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.830> right<00:03:04.010> now<00:03:04.040> he's<00:03:04.910> going<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.150> go<00:03:05.300> to

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
around so right now he's going to go to

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.890 
around so right now he's going to go to
the<00:03:06.260> top<00:03:07.010> side<00:03:07.280> here<00:03:07.490> out<00:03:07.670> of<00:03:07.730> view<00:03:08.240> come<00:03:08.720> back

little hard to have someone help you do

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.830 
little hard to have someone help you do
this<00:03:40.100> while<00:03:40.400> there's<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.760> match<00:03:40.940> going<00:03:41.210> on<00:03:41.480> and

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
this while there's a match going on and

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.810 
this while there's a match going on and
you<00:03:42.680> know<00:03:42.830> people<00:03:43.310> are<00:03:43.370> shooting<00:03:43.520> at<00:03:43.760> each

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
you know people are shooting at each

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.560 
you know people are shooting at each
other<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.950> I'm<00:03:46.070> in<00:03:46.190> the<00:03:46.250> testing<00:03:46.640> ground<00:03:46.880> and

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
other so I'm in the testing ground and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.730 
other so I'm in the testing ground and
obviously<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:48.020> guy's<00:03:48.260> not<00:03:48.440> going<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.650> go

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
obviously this guy's not going to go

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:50.500 
obviously this guy's not going to go
anywhere<00:03:48.950> so<00:03:49.880> I'm<00:03:49.940> gonna<00:03:50.030> be<00:03:50.150> doing<00:03:50.240> us<00:03:50.390> a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
anywhere so I'm gonna be doing us a

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.500 
anywhere so I'm gonna be doing us a
little<00:03:50.810> slower<00:03:51.740> speed<00:03:52.130> then<00:03:52.430> I<00:03:52.790> would

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
little slower speed then I would

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.420 
little slower speed then I would
normally<00:03:53.630> do<00:03:53.990> it<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.150> match<00:03:56.300> but<00:03:57.340> when<00:03:58.340> he

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
normally do it in a match but when he

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.910 
normally do it in a match but when he
stopped<00:03:58.760> like<00:03:59.000> this<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.330> can<00:03:59.480> just<00:03:59.740> move<00:04:00.740> around

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
stopped like this I can just move around

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.580 
stopped like this I can just move around
them<00:04:01.160> at<00:04:01.280> any<00:04:01.520> range<00:04:01.820> i<00:04:02.030> want<00:04:02.270> and<00:04:02.540> keep<00:04:03.380> that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
them at any range i want and keep that

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.320 
them at any range i want and keep that
orbit<00:04:04.010> in<00:04:04.190> that<00:04:04.970> range

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.400 

and<00:04:07.720> then<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.640> could<00:04:09.640> just<00:04:10.020> flat-out<00:04:11.020> stop

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
and then I could just flat-out stop

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.320 
and then I could just flat-out stop
behind<00:04:11.650> him<00:04:11.860> that<00:04:12.430> he<00:04:12.580> can't<00:04:12.880> really<00:04:13.090> do

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
behind him that he can't really do

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.080 
behind him that he can't really do
anything<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.350> can<00:04:14.530> maneuver<00:04:15.430> myself<00:04:15.580> every

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
anything and I can maneuver myself every

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.350 
anything and I can maneuver myself every
time<00:04:16.120> he<00:04:16.510> turns<00:04:17.700> forward<00:04:18.700> or<00:04:18.850> backward<00:04:19.239> and

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:19.360 
time he turns forward or backward and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.170 
time he turns forward or backward and
stay<00:04:19.810> behind<00:04:19.959> him<00:04:23.400> so<00:04:24.400> if<00:04:24.550> he<00:04:24.730> was<00:04:24.850> moving

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
stay behind him so if he was moving

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
stay behind him so if he was moving
forward<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.320> I<00:04:26.680> was<00:04:26.830> orbiting<00:04:27.160> him<00:04:28.200> what's

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
forward and I was orbiting him what's

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.500 
forward and I was orbiting him what's
gonna<00:04:29.350> happen<00:04:29.830> is<00:04:29.980> when<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:30.730> come<00:04:30.940> across<00:04:31.090> him

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
gonna happen is when I come across him

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.420 
gonna happen is when I come across him
like<00:04:31.660> this<00:04:31.930> he's<00:04:32.170> moving<00:04:32.530> away<00:04:32.680> from<00:04:32.920> me<00:04:33.160> now

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
like this he's moving away from me now

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.100 
like this he's moving away from me now
and<00:04:33.670> I'm<00:04:34.030> moving<00:04:34.300> away<00:04:34.390> from<00:04:34.540> him<00:04:34.810> at<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:34.990> same

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
and I'm moving away from him at the same

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.490 
and I'm moving away from him at the same
time<00:04:35.350> so<00:04:35.560> now<00:04:35.680> i<00:04:35.710> can<00:04:35.890> just<00:04:36.220> slow<00:04:37.120> down<00:04:37.410> come<00:04:38.410> up

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
time so now i can just slow down come up

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.600 
time so now i can just slow down come up
with<00:04:38.650> side<00:04:38.800> him<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:39.070> start<00:04:39.250> shooting<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.520> the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
with side him and start shooting in the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.920 
with side him and start shooting in the
back<00:04:39.760> while<00:04:39.910> he's<00:04:40.120> still<00:04:40.300> moving<00:04:40.480> away<00:04:40.780> from

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
back while he's still moving away from

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.540 
back while he's still moving away from
me<00:04:41.850> but<00:04:42.850> fuse<00:04:43.090> moving<00:04:43.420> backwards<00:04:44.310> when<00:04:45.310> I<00:04:45.370> was

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
me but fuse moving backwards when I was

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.390 
me but fuse moving backwards when I was
going<00:04:45.850> forward<00:04:46.330> like<00:04:46.660> this<00:04:46.690> now<00:04:47.050> he's<00:04:47.920> pulling

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
going forward like this now he's pulling

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.100 
going forward like this now he's pulling
ground<00:04:48.640> on<00:04:48.820> me<00:04:48.970> and<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.150> gotta<00:04:49.330> turn<00:04:49.570> in<00:04:49.840> and

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
ground on me and I gotta turn in and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.350 
ground on me and I gotta turn in and
he's<00:04:50.620> just<00:04:50.740> shooting<00:04:51.070> me<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:51.370> whole<00:04:51.550> time<00:04:51.700> so

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 
he's just shooting me the whole time so

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.280 
he's just shooting me the whole time so
I'm<00:04:52.390> just<00:04:52.510> getting<00:04:52.690> shot<00:04:52.930> at<00:04:53.080> now<00:04:53.230> the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
I'm just getting shot at now the

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.010 
I'm just getting shot at now the
distances<00:04:53.980> and<00:04:54.460> he's<00:04:54.700> at<00:04:55.270> this<00:04:55.540> point<00:04:55.810> one

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
distances and he's at this point one

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.320 
distances and he's at this point one
we're<00:04:56.230> going<00:04:57.160> the<00:04:57.250> same<00:04:57.460> direction<00:04:57.490> I'm<00:04:58.090> not

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
we're going the same direction I'm not

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.840 
we're going the same direction I'm not
going<00:04:58.540> as<00:04:58.690> fast<00:04:59.160> I'm<00:05:00.160> not<00:05:00.370> pulling<00:05:00.550> as<00:05:00.730> much

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
going as fast I'm not pulling as much

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.910 
going as fast I'm not pulling as much
distance<00:05:01.090> as<00:05:01.390> I<00:05:01.540> could<00:05:01.810> if<00:05:02.050> he<00:05:02.620> was<00:05:02.710> going

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
distance as I could if he was going

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.150 
distance as I could if he was going
forward<00:05:04.200> so<00:05:05.200> now<00:05:05.290> i<00:05:05.320> have<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.710> i<00:05:05.740> only<00:05:06.010> have<00:05:06.130> a

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
forward so now i have to i only have a

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.860 
forward so now i have to i only have a
shorter<00:05:06.610> time<00:05:06.760> behind<00:05:06.940> him<00:05:07.300> instead<00:05:07.600> of<00:05:07.660> that

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
shorter time behind him instead of that

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.990 
shorter time behind him instead of that
big<00:05:08.140> long<00:05:08.500> loop<00:05:08.950> like<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:09.730> would<00:05:09.820> get<00:05:10.060> now<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.940> if

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
big long loop like I would get now so if

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000 
big long loop like I would get now so if
he's<00:05:13.150> moving<00:05:13.510> backward<00:05:13.930> my<00:05:14.230> loop<00:05:14.440> behind<00:05:14.620> him

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
he's moving backward my loop behind him

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.210 
he's moving backward my loop behind him
would<00:05:15.400> be<00:05:15.430> smaller<00:05:15.850> and<00:05:16.410> my<00:05:17.410> loop<00:05:17.620> in<00:05:17.800> front<00:05:18.130> of

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
would be smaller and my loop in front of

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.450 
would be smaller and my loop in front of
him<00:05:18.310> would<00:05:18.820> be<00:05:18.850> a<00:05:19.000> lot<00:05:19.270> bigger
