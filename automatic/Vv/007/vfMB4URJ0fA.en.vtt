 canon 71 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.450
 the two kilos 3 it's really not 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.459
 heavy it's really not heavy at all 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.069
 it's nice as everything is great 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.870
 it's a nice rifle a nice rifle but 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.040
 we are we are bluffed by the weight and that 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.350
 is that art is blown away by the place 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.760
 and it's certainly the lightest 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.100
 which currently exists 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.950

 it takes 1380 euros 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.239
 okay in that version because 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:36.690
 that there is also an injector is 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.690
 as well 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.540
 what else to say so we have a lock of 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.040
 browning type so it does not move it is 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.269
 very very very strong even if you want 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.769

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.330
 okay problem so we'll shoot 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.180

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.400
 after x years there was a catch 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.040
 of play we can readjust 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.730
 but in fact for adjustments to 28 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.299
 already must already be pretty good 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.209

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.950
 good we will take ten cartridges then we will 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.840
 shoot a plateau so these are 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.329
