that stone edge now remember

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.810 
that stone edge now remember
stone<00:02:25.780> edge<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.290> rather<00:02:26.860> inaccurate<00:02:27.340> by

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
stone edge is rather inaccurate by

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.540 
stone edge is rather inaccurate by
nature<00:02:28.410> but<00:02:29.410> it's<00:02:29.590> very<00:02:29.770> strong<00:02:30.220> and<00:02:30.430> has<00:02:30.520> a

high<00:02:30.820> critical<00:02:31.300> hit<00:02:31.510> rate<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.340> a

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
high critical hit rate so it is a

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.430 
high critical hit rate so it is a
gambler

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440
