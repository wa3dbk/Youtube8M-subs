00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
adapter does it actually allows you to

use<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.829> pin<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.370> every<00:00:38.640> Nikon

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
use this a little pin that every Nikon

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.940 
use this a little pin that every Nikon
lens<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.360> had<00:00:39.540> built<00:00:39.809> into<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.469> override

lens has had built into it to override
the<00:00:41.250> aperture<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.510> I'm<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.170> try<00:00:43.320> answer<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
couple of questions you should have

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
couple of questions you should have
about<00:00:45.000> these<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.620> yeah<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.920> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
about these because yeah it's the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.639 
about these because yeah it's the
cheaper<00:00:48.270> alternative<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.200> seems<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
cheaper alternative this seems to be

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.160 
cheaper alternative this seems to be
another<00:00:49.829> case<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.100> where<00:00:50.399> China<00:00:50.789> comes<00:00:51.210> finds

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
another case of where China comes finds

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.689 
another case of where China comes finds
a<00:00:52.230> good<00:00:52.379> product<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.070> makes<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.489> for<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
a good product and makes it for a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
a good product and makes it for a
fraction<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> cost<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:55.110> us<00:00:55.289> you

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
fraction of the cost and have us you

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.580 
fraction of the cost and have us you
know<00:00:55.920> praising<00:00:56.760> them<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.170> them<00:00:58.170> just

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
know praising them for them just

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.590 
know praising them for them just
destroying<00:00:59.039> our<00:00:59.219> economy<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.820> don't<00:01:00.000> know<00:01:00.059> but

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
destroying our economy I don't know but

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
destroying our economy I don't know but
uh<00:01:00.629> why<00:01:01.530> spy<00:01:01.859> fraction<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.550> me<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:02.940> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
uh why spy fraction I do me in a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870 
uh why spy fraction I do me in a
fraction<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.470> popular<00:01:04.979> types<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
fraction the more popular types like the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.149 
fraction the more popular types like the
Nova<00:01:06.240> flex<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> believe<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> one<00:01:07.260> more<00:01:07.439> known

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
Nova flex I believe is one more known

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.550 
Nova flex I believe is one more known
ones<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> couple<00:01:09.420> hundred<00:01:09.479> dollars<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
ones is a couple hundred dollars this

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.510 
ones is a couple hundred dollars this
one<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.890> here<00:01:11.900> seventeen<00:01:12.900> dollars<00:01:13.560> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
one right here seventeen dollars so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
one right here seventeen dollars so
quirks<00:01:15.090> aside<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.780> really<00:01:16.259> really<00:01:16.500> hard<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
quirks aside it's really really hard to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
quirks aside it's really really hard to
beat<00:01:17.070> now<00:01:17.640> number<00:01:18.270> one<00:01:18.299> question<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
beat now number one question is is it

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.039 
beat now number one question is is it
built<00:01:19.439> well<00:01:19.650> well<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.280> all<00:01:20.580> metal<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.509> seems

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
built well well it's all metal so seems

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.109 
built well well it's all metal so seems
to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.320> yes<00:01:22.650> there<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.580> couple<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:23.820> moving

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
to be yes there are a couple of moving

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.510 
to be yes there are a couple of moving
parts<00:01:24.390> obviously<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.830> one<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.130> I've<00:01:26.220> had<00:01:26.400> an

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
parts obviously the one that I've had an

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
parts obviously the one that I've had an
issue<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> thus<00:01:27.119> far<00:01:27.150> is<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.049> little<00:01:28.290> pin

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
issue with it thus far is the little pin

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.710 
issue with it thus far is the little pin
that<00:01:28.920> releases<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> pin<00:01:29.909> or<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> lever<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that releases the pin or the lever that

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.990 
that releases the pin or the lever that
releases<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.170> pin<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:32.220> unlock<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
releases the pin to unlock it from the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.200 
releases the pin to unlock it from the
camera<00:01:33.360> body<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:34.229> it's<00:01:34.770> not<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.340> big<00:01:35.369> deal<00:01:35.880> I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
camera body now it's not a big deal I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.030 
camera body now it's not a big deal I
just<00:01:36.420> know<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.810> know<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.320> have<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.829> make<00:01:38.009> sure

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
just know I know I have to make sure

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.160 
just know I know I have to make sure
that<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.520> never<00:01:38.700> loose<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.960> way

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
that it's never loose but it has a way

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
that it's never loose but it has a way
of<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.530> telling<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.009> loose

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
of kind of telling you it's loose

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679 
of kind of telling you it's loose
because<00:01:41.880> if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> use<00:01:42.329> it

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
because if you use it

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.030 
because if you use it
the<00:01:42.840> little<00:01:43.049> leaver<00:01:43.200> gets<00:01:43.380> stuck<00:01:43.680> under<00:01:43.950> the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the little leaver gets stuck under the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.069 
the little leaver gets stuck under the
little<00:01:44.159> lip<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.729> got<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.909> pop<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.240> out<00:01:45.360> so

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
little lip and you got to pop it out so

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.630 
little lip and you got to pop it out so
I<00:01:46.470> don't<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:47.159> that'll<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.520> issue

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
I don't think that'll be an issue

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.429 
I don't think that'll be an issue
because<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.840> always<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> off<00:01:49.320> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
because you can always get it off the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.230 
because you can always get it off the
camera<00:01:49.860> no<00:01:50.310> problem<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.850> that's<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
camera no problem because that's the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
camera no problem because that's the
cameras<00:01:51.570> mechanism<00:01:52.110> but<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.680> get<00:01:52.770> off<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> lens

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
cameras mechanism but to get off a lens

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.710 
cameras mechanism but to get off a lens
you<00:01:53.520> might<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.880> I'll<00:01:54.000> let<00:01:54.180> pins<00:01:54.390> all<00:01:54.509> stuck

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
you might see I'll let pins all stuck

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.959 
you might see I'll let pins all stuck
there<00:01:54.869> okay<00:01:55.049> pop<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.680> done<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.790> I'll<00:01:56.850> just

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
there okay pop it up done so I'll just

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.399 
there okay pop it up done so I'll just
demonstrate<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> how<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:58.020> goes<00:01:58.200> on

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
to line up goes onto the camera nice and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660 
to line up goes onto the camera nice and
smooth<00:02:18.959> but<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.200> nearly<00:02:19.560> as<00:02:19.709> snug<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.459> not

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
smooth but not nearly as snug it's not

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.750 
smooth but not nearly as snug it's not
loose<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> is<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.720> snug<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.550> little

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
loose but it is not snug but the little

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.340 
loose but it is not snug but the little
test<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:24.090> have<00:02:24.300> is<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> just<00:02:24.720> pressed<00:02:25.110> down

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
test I have is that I just pressed down

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.080 
test I have is that I just pressed down
the<00:02:25.380> lens<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.830> little<00:02:25.860> bit<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> does<00:02:26.819> come

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
the lens a little bit and it does come

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.820 
the lens a little bit and it does come
away<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.600> body<00:02:27.780> tiny<00:02:28.410> it's<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> little

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
away from the body tiny it's a little

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
away from the body tiny it's a little
bit<00:02:29.010> but<00:02:29.610> I'm<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.820> concerned<00:02:30.090> about<00:02:30.270> that

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
bit but I'm not concerned about that

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.030 
bit but I'm not concerned about that
because<00:02:30.690> I'm<00:02:30.959> never<00:02:31.080> pressing<00:02:31.620> down<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.950> my

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
because I'm never pressing down on my

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.530 
because I'm never pressing down on my
lens<00:02:32.190> while<00:02:32.400> I'm<00:02:32.490> shooting<00:02:32.670> you<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
lens while I'm shooting you can see I

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.840 
lens while I'm shooting you can see I
don't<00:02:34.050> see<00:02:34.350> this<00:02:34.709> thing<00:02:34.860> coming<00:02:35.160> off<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.520> seems

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
don't see this thing coming off it seems

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.600 
don't see this thing coming off it seems
pretty<00:02:36.270> much<00:02:36.420> solid<00:02:37.140> it's<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> tiny<00:02:38.100> tiny<00:02:38.250> bit

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
pretty much solid it's a tiny tiny bit

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.250 
pretty much solid it's a tiny tiny bit
of<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:38.700> play<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.180> don't<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.870> messing

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
of a play I don't see that messing

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.470 
of a play I don't see that messing
anything<00:02:40.350> up<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.489> I'm<00:02:41.730> confident<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.270> it

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
anything up so I'm confident that it

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.449 
anything up so I'm confident that it
will<00:02:42.660> not<00:02:42.989> have<00:02:43.350> any<00:02:43.380> of<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.650> lenses<00:02:43.980> fall<00:02:44.250> and

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
will not have any of my lenses fall and

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.890 
will not have any of my lenses fall and
I'm<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.640> going<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.820> go<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.060> put<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> 70<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.690> 200

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
I'm not going to go and put a 70 to 200

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440 
I'm not going to go and put a 70 to 200
to<00:02:46.260> 8<00:02:46.380> on<00:02:46.530> here<00:02:46.800> without<00:02:47.220> lens<00:02:47.850> support<00:02:48.300> that

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
to 8 on here without lens support that

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.960 
to 8 on here without lens support that
would<00:02:48.570> just<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.840> silly<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.410> any<00:02:49.650> adapter<00:02:50.190> so

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
would just be silly for any adapter so

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.350 
would just be silly for any adapter so
it<00:02:51.570> does<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:52.050> now<00:02:52.410> how<00:02:52.739> smooth<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
it does that now how smooth is the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.080 
it does that now how smooth is the
aperture<00:02:54.750> control<00:02:55.260> well<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.760> smooth

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
aperture control well really smooth

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870 
aperture control well really smooth
actually<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:58.320> actually<00:02:58.590> really<00:02:59.130> loose<00:02:59.459> when

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
actually it's actually really loose when

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.100 
actually it's actually really loose when
you<00:02:59.910> don't<00:03:00.269> have<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.540> attached<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.810> anything

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
you don't have it attached to anything

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.110 
you don't have it attached to anything
but<00:03:01.350> once<00:03:01.560> you<00:03:01.680> attach<00:03:01.950> it<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> lens<00:03:02.610> it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
but once you attach it to the lens it

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.150 
but once you attach it to the lens it
seems<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.600> tighten<00:03:03.959> up<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:04.709> got<00:03:04.800> a<00:03:04.830> very

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
seems to tighten up it's got a very

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.720 
seems to tighten up it's got a very
tight<00:03:05.700> very<00:03:06.170> smooth<00:03:07.170> feel<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.920> does<00:03:08.580> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
tight very smooth feel to it does it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.759 
tight very smooth feel to it does it
hold<00:03:08.970> its<00:03:09.180> positioning<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.989> does<00:03:10.380> seem<00:03:10.680> to

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
hold its positioning it does seem to

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.360 
hold its positioning it does seem to
hold<00:03:10.920> its<00:03:11.070> positioning<00:03:11.580> just<00:03:11.790> fine<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:13.680> it

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
hold its positioning just fine so it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.220 
hold its positioning just fine so it
does<00:03:14.610> seem<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.880> do<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.030> work<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:15.570> does<00:03:15.959> seem

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
does seem to do the work it does seem

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.380 
does seem to do the work it does seem
reasonably<00:03:16.739> well<00:03:16.950> made<00:03:17.190> one<00:03:18.060> little<00:03:18.299> extra

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
reasonably well made one little extra

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.509 
reasonably well made one little extra
cork<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.959> how<00:03:19.110> you<00:03:19.200> get<00:03:19.350> these<00:03:19.440> things<00:03:19.650> off<00:03:19.980> you

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
cork is how you get these things off you

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.130 
cork is how you get these things off you
got<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.670> press<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.150> little<00:03:21.299> lever<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.870> then

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
got to press that little lever and then

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.390 
got to press that little lever and then
I've<00:03:22.530> managed<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.829> figure<00:03:23.010> out<00:03:23.130> how<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.250> do

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
I've managed to figure out how to do

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.620 
I've managed to figure out how to do
with<00:03:23.519> one<00:03:23.700> hand<00:03:23.730> first<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.299> thought<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.510> need

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
with one hand first I thought you need

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.509 
with one hand first I thought you need
three<00:03:24.870> but<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.470> got<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.829> take<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.130> finger

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
three but you got to take one finger

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.130 
three but you got to take one finger
press<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.880> down<00:03:27.120> another<00:03:27.510> hand<00:03:27.750> holds<00:03:27.989> that

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
press it down another hand holds that

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.930 
press it down another hand holds that
and<00:03:28.380> then<00:03:28.980> just<00:03:29.750> wrench<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.930> off<00:03:31.049> so<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.280> can<00:03:32.820> do

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
and then just wrench it off so I can do

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.340 
and then just wrench it off so I can do
it<00:03:33.030> pretty<00:03:33.120> quickly<00:03:33.420> now<00:03:33.540> but<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.019> first<00:03:34.170> time

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
it pretty quickly now but the first time

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.170 
it pretty quickly now but the first time
you<00:03:34.470> do<00:03:34.620> it<00:03:34.650> it's<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.160> little<00:03:35.430> weird<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:36.000> it

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
you do it it's a little weird but it

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.690 
you do it it's a little weird but it
will<00:03:36.390> come<00:03:36.720> off<00:03:36.930> another<00:03:37.860> user<00:03:38.130> didn't<00:03:38.610> know

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
will come off another user didn't know

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.520 
will come off another user didn't know
that<00:03:39.060> his<00:03:39.390> came<00:03:39.630> with<00:03:39.750> a<00:03:39.780> whole<00:03:40.170> bunch<00:03:40.440> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
that his came with a whole bunch of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.259 
that his came with a whole bunch of
grease<00:03:40.769> on<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.640> notice<00:03:41.970> there's<00:03:42.239> a

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
grease on it I do notice there's a

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.970 
grease on it I do notice there's a
little<00:03:42.390> bit<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.660> grease<00:03:42.870> inside<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.380> moving

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
little bit of grease inside the moving

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.030 
little bit of grease inside the moving
metal<00:03:44.220> parts<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.670> keep<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.940> fluid<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:46.350> mine

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
metal parts to keep it fluid but mine

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.680 
metal parts to keep it fluid but mine
seems<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.670> perfect<00:03:48.000> amount<00:03:48.090> don't

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
seems to have the perfect amount don't

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.690 
seems to have the perfect amount don't
see<00:03:48.840> any<00:03:49.049> excess<00:03:49.650> anywhere<00:03:50.160> it's<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.400> getting

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
see any excess anywhere it's not getting

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.460 
see any excess anywhere it's not getting
anywhere<00:03:51.000> near<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> lens<00:03:51.450> elements<00:03:51.930> so<00:03:52.110> I'm

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
anywhere near the lens elements so I'm

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.370 
anywhere near the lens elements so I'm
fine<00:03:52.860> with<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:54.750> one<00:03:54.959> other<00:03:55.140> little

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
fine with that and the one other little

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.990 
fine with that and the one other little
interesting<00:03:56.070> thing<00:03:56.250> about<00:03:56.280> using<00:03:56.850> one<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
interesting thing about using one of

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.729 
interesting thing about using one of
these<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.660> while<00:03:58.290> you<00:03:58.709> don't

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
these is that while you don't

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.009 
these is that while you don't
necessarily<00:03:59.010> need<00:03:59.640> them<00:03:59.910> for<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.209> old<00:04:00.360> AI<00:04:00.630> or

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
necessarily need them for the old AI or

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.370 
necessarily need them for the old AI or
AIS<00:04:01.470> or<00:04:01.769> not<00:04:02.280> AI<00:04:02.489> lenses<00:04:03.060> it<00:04:03.810> does<00:04:04.079> something

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
AIS or not AI lenses it does something

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.680 
AIS or not AI lenses it does something
to<00:04:04.560> them<00:04:04.860> that<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.880> wouldn't<00:04:06.209> have<00:04:06.480> had

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
to them that you wouldn't have had

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.680 
to them that you wouldn't have had
before<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.320> I'm<00:04:08.190> not<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.430> fan<00:04:08.670> of<00:04:08.700> Irish<00:04:09.209> ramps

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
before and I'm not a fan of Irish ramps

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.750 
before and I'm not a fan of Irish ramps
while<00:04:10.109> shooting<00:04:10.380> but<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.160> can<00:04:11.280> outdo<00:04:11.609> them

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
while shooting but you can outdo them

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.330 
while shooting but you can outdo them
with<00:04:11.880> these<00:04:12.000> like<00:04:12.329> you<00:04:12.420> can<00:04:12.630> with<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:13.140> other

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
with these like you can with the other

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.039 
with these like you can with the other
autofocus<00:04:14.340> lenses<00:04:14.670> because<00:04:14.910> using<00:04:15.900> this

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
autofocus lenses because using this

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.990 
autofocus lenses because using this
overrides<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.010> clicking<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.640> don't<00:04:17.669> need

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
overrides the clicking you don't need

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.400 
overrides the clicking you don't need
the<00:04:18.120> clicks<00:04:18.359> anymore<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.870> open<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.229> all<00:04:19.320> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
the clicks anymore you open it all the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.890 
the clicks anymore you open it all the
way<00:04:19.500> up<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.799> this<00:04:20.400> now<00:04:20.580> takes<00:04:20.910> over<00:04:21.570> or

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
way up and this now takes over or

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.120 
way up and this now takes over or

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.620 
actually I forget it you open all
anything<00:04:23.310> close<00:04:23.729> all<00:04:23.880> way<00:04:23.970> down

No there we go wait no you open it all
the<00:04:27.660> way<00:04:27.810> up<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.110> now<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.530> thing<00:04:28.590> works<00:04:28.980> yep

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
the way up and now this thing works yep

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.690 
the way up and now this thing works yep
wait<00:04:30.570> no<00:04:30.900> hmm<00:04:31.590> no<00:04:31.890> that's<00:04:31.920> not<00:04:32.310> how<00:04:32.400> it<00:04:32.520> works

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
wait no hmm no that's not how it works

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.330 
wait no hmm no that's not how it works
yeah<00:04:33.570> that's<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.200> set<00:04:34.440> it<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.590> f-22<00:04:35.190> at

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
yeah that's it you set it to f-22 at

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.380 
yeah that's it you set it to f-22 at
least<00:04:35.490> on<00:04:35.610> this<00:04:35.730> particular<00:04:36.120> lens<00:04:36.240> but<00:04:36.330> I

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
least on this particular lens but I

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.840 
least on this particular lens but I
think<00:04:36.570> 22<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.440> magic<00:04:38.130> lock<00:04:38.310> up<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.610> number

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
think 22 is the magic lock up the number

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.210 
think 22 is the magic lock up the number
so<00:04:39.180> you<00:04:39.630> get<00:04:39.810> the<00:04:39.900> nice<00:04:40.020> smooth<00:04:40.410> adjustments

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
so you get the nice smooth adjustments

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.410 
so you get the nice smooth adjustments
with<00:04:41.340> these<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.790> this<00:04:41.940> adapter<00:04:42.390> will

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
with these so this adapter will

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.690 
with these so this adapter will
literally<00:04:42.930> work<00:04:43.200> with<00:04:43.440> I<00:04:43.530> believe<00:04:43.770> any<00:04:44.010> nikon

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
literally work with I believe any nikon

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.990 
literally work with I believe any nikon
lens<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.420> put<00:04:45.930> it<00:04:46.020> onto<00:04:46.140> any<00:04:46.950> Canon<00:04:47.370> EF<00:04:47.670> body

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
lens and put it onto any Canon EF body

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.290 
lens and put it onto any Canon EF body
so<00:04:48.720> it's<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.170> nifty<00:04:49.380> little<00:04:49.530> thing<00:04:49.970> this<00:04:50.970> is<00:04:51.180> so

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
so it's a nifty little thing this is so

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.360 
so it's a nifty little thing this is so
inexpensive<00:04:51.510> you<00:04:52.020> can<00:04:52.050> basically<00:04:52.350> have<00:04:52.590> you

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
inexpensive you can basically have you

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.580 
inexpensive you can basically have you
know<00:04:53.460> buy<00:04:53.700> each<00:04:53.940> one<00:04:54.270> for<00:04:54.540> each<00:04:54.720> lens<00:04:55.110> and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
know buy each one for each lens and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.560 
know buy each one for each lens and
basically<00:04:56.310> just<00:04:56.520> consider<00:04:56.850> that<00:04:56.910> lens<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.450> be

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
basically just consider that lens to be

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.420 
basically just consider that lens to be
a<00:04:57.600> canon<00:04:57.930> lens<00:04:58.080> from<00:04:58.230> now<00:04:58.410> on<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.980> you<00:04:59.340> don't

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
a canon lens from now on and you don't

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.800 
a canon lens from now on and you don't
have<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.670> worry<00:04:59.880> about<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.330> little<00:05:00.660> lever

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
have to worry about this little lever

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:02.750 
have to worry about this little lever
part<00:05:01.200> because<00:05:01.710> that's<00:05:02.040> only<00:05:02.310> if<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.580> gotta

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
part because that's only if you gotta

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.610 
part because that's only if you gotta
take<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.060> adapter<00:05:03.570> off<00:05:03.840> from<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.050> lens<00:05:04.260> so

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
take the adapter off from the lens so

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.210 
take the adapter off from the lens so
it's<00:05:05.490> now<00:05:05.730> just<00:05:06.150> a<00:05:06.330> regular<00:05:06.690> old<00:05:06.980> canon<00:05:07.980> lens

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
it's now just a regular old canon lens

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.370 
it's now just a regular old canon lens
that<00:05:08.460> does<00:05:08.670> canon<00:05:09.450> lens<00:05:09.690> kind<00:05:10.080> of<00:05:10.170> things

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
that does canon lens kind of things

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.580 
that does canon lens kind of things
except<00:05:10.920> for<00:05:11.010> autofocus<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.840> that's<00:05:13.260> a<00:05:13.380> little

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
except for autofocus so that's a little

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.800 
except for autofocus so that's a little
