00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.210 

so<00:00:00.299> recently<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.840> installed<00:00:01.350> a<00:00:01.469> generator<00:00:01.979> and

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so recently I installed a generator and

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.190 
so recently I installed a generator and
I<00:00:02.310> went<00:00:02.550> into<00:00:02.700> this<00:00:02.939> really<00:00:03.300> not<00:00:03.510> knowing<00:00:03.959> what

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
I went into this really not knowing what

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.680 
I went into this really not knowing what
I<00:00:04.230> was<00:00:04.470> doing<00:00:04.890> or<00:00:05.069> what<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.250> would<00:00:05.460> need<00:00:05.759> so

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
I was doing or what I would need so

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.570 
I was doing or what I would need so
after<00:00:07.109> doing<00:00:07.350> some<00:00:07.500> research<00:00:07.680> and<00:00:08.099> talking<00:00:08.340> to

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
after doing some research and talking to

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.940 
after doing some research and talking to
an<00:00:08.700> electrician<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:09.570> determined<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.620> proper

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
an electrician I determined the proper

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.669 
an electrician I determined the proper
way<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.130> do<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.519> and<00:00:11.700> I<00:00:12.660> managed<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.650> that

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
way to do it and I managed to do that

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.460 
way to do it and I managed to do that
successfully<00:00:14.120> so<00:00:15.120> I'll<00:00:15.540> just<00:00:16.049> tell<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.350> what

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
successfully so I'll just tell you what

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.650 
successfully so I'll just tell you what
you<00:00:16.590> need<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.100> then<00:00:17.580> how<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> hook<00:00:18.000> things<00:00:18.180> up

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you need and then how to hook things up

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.790 
you need and then how to hook things up
so<00:00:19.050> one<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.289> things<00:00:19.439> you're<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
so one of the things you're going to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.130 
so one of the things you're going to
need<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.699> generator<00:00:21.330> panel<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:21.930> very

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
need is a generator panel it's very

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.730 
need is a generator panel it's very
similar<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.650> your<00:00:22.890> typical<00:00:24.529> circuit<00:00:25.529> breaker

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
similar to your typical circuit breaker

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
similar to your typical circuit breaker
panel<00:00:26.000> except<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.119> has<00:00:28.310> two<00:00:29.310> breakers

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
panel except this has two breakers

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
panel except this has two breakers
side-by-side<00:00:30.420> with<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.560> little<00:00:31.830> toggle

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
side-by-side with this little toggle

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.420 
side-by-side with this little toggle
mechanism<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.540> only<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.380> can<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.860> at<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
mechanism so only one can be on at a

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360 
mechanism so only one can be on at a
time<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.420> house<00:00:36.719> power<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:38.219> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
time this is the house power and this is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.850 
time this is the house power and this is
the<00:00:38.520> generator<00:00:39.000> power<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.989> if<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> flip<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.620> up

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
the generator power so if I flip that up

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.549 
the generator power so if I flip that up
this<00:00:41.579> would<00:00:41.820> automatically<00:00:42.329> hinge<00:00:42.719> knock

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
this would automatically hinge knock

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.400 
this would automatically hinge knock
this<00:00:43.800> one<00:00:43.980> off<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.760> one<00:00:44.969> comes<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.450> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this one off as this one comes on so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.549 
this one off as this one comes on so
that's<00:00:46.649> quite<00:00:46.890> useful<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:48.480> prevent<00:00:48.899> any<00:00:49.260> kind

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that's quite useful to prevent any kind

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.760 
that's quite useful to prevent any kind
of<00:00:50.629> voltage<00:00:51.629> feedback<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.500> primary

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
of voltage feedback to your primary

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.990 
of voltage feedback to your primary
circuits<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.530> concept<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
circuits so that's the concept of the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.979 
circuits so that's the concept of the
generator<00:00:57.600> panel<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.600> then<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> will<00:01:00.840> need

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
generator panel and then you will need

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.030 
generator panel and then you will need
to<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:02.629> circuit<00:01:03.629> breakers<00:01:04.049> for<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
to get some circuit breakers for the

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.399 
to get some circuit breakers for the
circuits<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.610> want<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.330> during<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
circuits that you want to use during the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
circuits that you want to use during the
power<00:01:07.560> outage<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.400> one's<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.700> water<00:01:08.939> pump

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
power outage so this one's a water pump

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.530 
power outage so this one's a water pump
this<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> Internet<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.390> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
this one is for the Internet this one is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.840 
this one is for the Internet this one is
for<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> fridge<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.350> was<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> freezer<00:01:14.070> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
for a fridge this was for a freezer and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.370 
for a fridge this was for a freezer and
this<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:15.930> some<00:01:16.140> additional

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this one is just for some additional

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.700 
this one is just for some additional
lighting<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.750> won't<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:19.049> completely<00:01:19.500> dark

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
lighting so it won't be completely dark

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.240 
lighting so it won't be completely dark
when<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.040> power's<00:01:20.400> out<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.890> while<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.040> here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
when the power's out and while I'm here

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.070 
when the power's out and while I'm here
I'm<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.490> well<00:01:23.700> show<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> some<00:01:24.509> other<00:01:24.780> things

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
I'm is well show you some other things

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:31.730 
I'm is well show you some other things
you'll<00:01:25.259> need<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.670> cable<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:30.409> 8<00:01:31.409> gauge

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you'll need this cable is a 8 gauge

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.910 
you'll need this cable is a 8 gauge
cable<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:33.780> comes<00:01:33.990> over<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.899 

connects<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.670> 60<00:01:39.390> amp<00:01:39.630> breaker

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.679 

so<00:01:43.450> it's<00:01:43.630> two-phase<00:01:44.909> or<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:48.009> has<00:01:48.310> 240<00:01:49.299> volts<00:01:49.570> so

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
so it's two-phase or it has 240 volts so

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.529 
so it's two-phase or it has 240 volts so
this<00:01:49.810> is<00:01:50.460> 120<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> black<00:01:51.970> is<00:01:52.180> 120<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:54.539> also

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
this is 120 in the black is 120 and also

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.469 
this is 120 in the black is 120 and also
on<00:01:55.780> that<00:01:56.530> cable<00:01:57.039> is<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.780> ground<00:01:59.200> and<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:01.090> neutral

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
on that cable is a ground and a neutral

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.830 
on that cable is a ground and a neutral
so<00:02:01.990> those<00:02:02.140> go<00:02:02.319> up<00:02:02.470> here<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:02.970> attach<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.329> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
so those go up here and attach to the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.809 
so those go up here and attach to the
ground<00:02:05.200> bar<00:02:07.679> and<00:02:08.679> another<00:02:09.160> cable<00:02:09.429> that<00:02:09.700> you're

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
ground bar and another cable that you're

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.070 
ground bar and another cable that you're
going<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.179> need<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:10.509> one<00:02:10.690> doesn't<00:02:10.840> need<00:02:10.989> to

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
going to need this one doesn't need to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.790 
going to need this one doesn't need to
be<00:02:11.170> quite<00:02:11.410> as<00:02:11.590> thick<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.130> your<00:02:13.030> generator<00:02:13.480> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
be quite as thick if your generator is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.509 
be quite as thick if your generator is
say<00:02:14.800> 30<00:02:15.160> amps<00:02:15.900> maximum<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:18.040> 10

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
say 30 amps maximum so this is a 10

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.320 
say 30 amps maximum so this is a 10
gauge<00:02:18.760> cable<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.390> has<00:02:20.640> three<00:02:21.640> conductors<00:02:22.150> with

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
gauge cable it has three conductors with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.229 
gauge cable it has three conductors with
a<00:02:22.360> ground<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.920> I'll<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.459> open<00:02:24.640> this<00:02:24.880> up<00:02:24.940> so

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
a ground and I'll just open this up so

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.720 
a ground and I'll just open this up so
you<00:02:25.330> can<00:02:25.480> see<00:02:25.660> what<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> mean

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.229 

so<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:32.319> where<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:33.370> mains<00:02:33.640> come<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.060> so

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
so this is where the mains come in so

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.569 
so this is where the mains come in so
your<00:02:34.390> typical<00:02:34.540> house<00:02:34.900> power<00:02:35.230> so<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.370> goes

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
your typical house power so that goes

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.870 
your typical house power so that goes
here<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.269> 60<00:02:37.780> amp<00:02:37.930> breaker<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.430> red<00:02:39.670> and

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
here to the 60 amp breaker the red and

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.520 
here to the 60 amp breaker the red and
the<00:02:39.940> black<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.630> then<00:02:40.720> the<00:02:40.840> neutral<00:02:40.989> comes<00:02:41.349> up

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
the black and then the neutral comes up

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.130 
the black and then the neutral comes up
here<00:02:41.819> just<00:02:42.819> the<00:02:42.940> neutral<00:02:43.299> bar<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.780> then<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
here just the neutral bar and then the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.930 
here just the neutral bar and then the
ground<00:02:44.319> comes<00:02:44.650> up<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.069> attaches<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:45.700> ground

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
ground comes up and attaches the ground

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.780 
ground comes up and attaches the ground
bar<00:02:47.100> and<00:02:48.690> here<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.170> generator<00:02:50.709> power<00:02:51.010> so

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
bar and here is the generator power so

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.670 
bar and here is the generator power so
here<00:02:52.150> we<00:02:52.269> are<00:02:52.299> with<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.780> red<00:02:52.959> and<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.500> black

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
here we are with the red and the black

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.380 
here we are with the red and the black
which<00:02:54.010> come<00:02:54.220> from<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.430> orange<00:02:54.850> cable<00:02:55.180> here

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
which come from the orange cable here

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.090 
which come from the orange cable here
and<00:02:56.160> then<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.280> white<00:02:58.109> goes<00:02:59.109> to<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.620> neutral

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
and then the white goes to the neutral

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
and then the white goes to the neutral
bar<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:01.090> ground<00:03:01.329> goes<00:03:01.750> to<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.989> ground

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
bar and the ground goes to the ground

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.879 
bar and the ground goes to the ground
bar<00:03:03.030> alright<00:03:04.030> and<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.930> circuits<00:03:05.380> you<00:03:05.680> see

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
bar alright and the circuits you see

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.420 
bar alright and the circuits you see
here<00:03:06.190> so<00:03:06.639> the<00:03:07.000> water<00:03:07.299> pump<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.709> internet

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
here so the water pump the internet

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.729 
here so the water pump the internet
freezer<00:03:09.760> fridge<00:03:10.209> all<00:03:10.480> that<00:03:10.630> stuff<00:03:10.900> they<00:03:11.680> were

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
freezer fridge all that stuff they were

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.300 
freezer fridge all that stuff they were
originally<00:03:13.290> attached<00:03:14.290> over<00:03:14.709> here<00:03:15.069> to<00:03:15.220> where

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
originally attached over here to where

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.000 
originally attached over here to where
these<00:03:15.489> white<00:03:15.700> things<00:03:15.730> are<00:03:16.560> that<00:03:17.560> was<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.889> so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
these white things are that was just so

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.680 
these white things are that was just so
I<00:03:18.040> knew<00:03:18.370> which<00:03:18.549> ones<00:03:18.790> to<00:03:18.940> pull<00:03:19.180> when<00:03:19.389> all<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
I knew which ones to pull when all the

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.020 
I knew which ones to pull when all the
power<00:03:19.900> was<00:03:20.139> out<00:03:20.260> so<00:03:21.130> before<00:03:21.489> removing<00:03:21.940> these

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
power was out so before removing these

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.629 
power was out so before removing these
circuits<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.600> would<00:03:22.720> recommend<00:03:23.440> pulling<00:03:23.950> this

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
circuits I would recommend pulling this

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.840 
circuits I would recommend pulling this
down<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.359> turn<00:03:25.540> off<00:03:25.690> all<00:03:25.930> house<00:03:26.139> power<00:03:26.609> so<00:03:27.609> it's

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
down to turn off all house power so it's

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.120 
down to turn off all house power so it's
safer<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.540> remove<00:03:29.049> wires<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.680> everything

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
safer to remove wires and everything

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.390 
safer to remove wires and everything
alright<00:03:31.120> so<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:32.109> being<00:03:32.260> said<00:03:32.319> I<00:03:32.530> had<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:33.040> pull

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
alright so that being said I had to pull

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.229 
alright so that being said I had to pull
the<00:03:34.389> hot<00:03:34.720> and<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:36.100> neutral<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.880> ground

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
the hot and the neutral and the ground

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.339 
the hot and the neutral and the ground
and<00:03:37.600> then<00:03:38.530> pull<00:03:38.769> the<00:03:38.889> wire<00:03:39.389> out<00:03:40.389> of<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.810> top<00:03:41.139> of

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
and then pull the wire out of the top of

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:42.210 
and then pull the wire out of the top of
this

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
this

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.630 
this
run<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:43.120> over<00:03:43.300> through<00:03:43.750> here<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.560> then<00:03:45.460> bring

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
run it over through here and then bring

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.610 
run it over through here and then bring
them<00:03:45.820> down<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.450> still<00:03:46.900> need<00:03:47.080> to<00:03:47.140> nail<00:03:47.290> these<00:03:47.470> in

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
them down I still need to nail these in

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.720 
them down I still need to nail these in
place<00:03:48.090> but<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.390> brought<00:03:49.720> them<00:03:49.870> down<00:03:50.730> connected

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
place but I brought them down connected

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.730 
place but I brought them down connected
them<00:03:51.880> in<00:03:51.970> here<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.390> hot<00:03:52.800> neutral<00:03:53.800> and<00:03:54.010> ground

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
them in here so hot neutral and ground

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.500 
them in here so hot neutral and ground
all<00:03:56.740> right<00:03:56.830> hopefully<00:03:57.190> that<00:03:57.520> all<00:03:57.850> made<00:03:58.180> sense

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
all right hopefully that all made sense

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.750 
all right hopefully that all made sense
it's<00:03:58.990> a<00:03:59.050> little<00:03:59.290> complicated<00:03:59.860> so<00:04:01.980> any<00:04:02.980> surface

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
it's a little complicated so any surface

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.240 
it's a little complicated so any surface
you<00:04:03.790> want<00:04:04.230> during<00:04:05.230> the<00:04:05.440> power<00:04:05.590> outage<00:04:05.770> you'll

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
you want during the power outage you'll

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.820 
you want during the power outage you'll
have<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.550> disconnect<00:04:07.060> here<00:04:07.480> run<00:04:08.470> them<00:04:08.620> over

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
have to disconnect here run them over

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.550 
have to disconnect here run them over
bring<00:04:09.820> them<00:04:09.970> down<00:04:10.210> and<00:04:10.540> set<00:04:11.260> up<00:04:11.350> your<00:04:11.530> own

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
bring them down and set up your own

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.400 
bring them down and set up your own
circuits<00:04:12.520> so<00:04:13.270> typically<00:04:13.750> they'll<00:04:13.930> be<00:04:14.050> running

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
circuits so typically they'll be running

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.830 
circuits so typically they'll be running
off<00:04:14.620> of<00:04:14.650> your<00:04:15.130> house<00:04:15.280> power<00:04:15.610> so<00:04:15.940> that's<00:04:16.060> the

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
off of your house power so that's the

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.860 
off of your house power so that's the
first<00:04:17.110> circuit<00:04:17.830> breaker<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.340> then<00:04:19.180> here<00:04:19.750> this

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
first circuit breaker and then here this

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.050 
first circuit breaker and then here this
is<00:04:19.930> your<00:04:20.200> generator<00:04:20.590> circuit<00:04:21.100> breaker<00:04:21.340> so<00:04:21.820> if

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
is your generator circuit breaker so if

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.510 
is your generator circuit breaker so if
the<00:04:22.600> power<00:04:22.810> goes<00:04:23.080> out<00:04:23.290> you<00:04:23.950> can<00:04:24.130> turn<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.490> your

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
the power goes out you can turn on your

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.100 
the power goes out you can turn on your
generator<00:04:25.150> and<00:04:26.070> use<00:04:27.070> those<00:04:27.430> circuits<00:04:28.050> now<00:04:29.050> I'm

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
generator and use those circuits now I'm

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.970 
generator and use those circuits now I'm
going<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.320> show<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.470> some<00:04:29.620> other<00:04:29.740> things

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
going to show you some other things

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.330 
going to show you some other things
you're<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.280> need<00:04:31.710> so<00:04:32.710> of<00:04:32.890> course<00:04:33.070> you're

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
you're going to need so of course you're

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.450 
you're going to need so of course you're
going<00:04:33.550> to<00:04:33.640> need<00:04:33.790> a<00:04:33.820> generator<00:04:34.450> this<00:04:34.930> one<00:04:35.170> is

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
going to need a generator this one is

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.630 
going to need a generator this one is
6,000<00:04:36.460> watts<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:37.650> from<00:04:38.650> that<00:04:38.770> generator<00:04:39.250> if

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640

twenty one is for neutral and one as
we're<00:04:51.160> ground<00:04:51.690> so<00:04:52.890> you'll<00:04:53.890> need<00:04:54.040> to<00:04:54.160> purchase

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
we're ground so you'll need to purchase

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.380 
we're ground so you'll need to purchase
one<00:04:54.790> of<00:04:54.910> these<00:04:55.060> cables<00:04:55.620> and<00:04:56.620> that<00:04:57.610> may<00:04:57.820> depend

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
one of these cables and that may depend

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.230 
one of these cables and that may depend
upon<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.320> generator<00:04:59.710> you<00:04:59.800> purchase<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:00.730> I'll

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
upon the generator you purchase so I'll

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.450 
upon the generator you purchase so I'll
put<00:05:01.450> a<00:05:01.480> link<00:05:01.780> in<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.200> description<00:05:02.740> below<00:05:02.890> for

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
put a link in the description below for

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.510 
put a link in the description below for
this<00:05:03.610> cable<00:05:03.910> but<00:05:04.840> I'm<00:05:05.770> not<00:05:06.100> going<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.340> say<00:05:06.490> a

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
this cable but I'm not going to say a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.740 
this cable but I'm not going to say a
hundred<00:05:06.820> percent<00:05:06.940> this<00:05:07.270> is<00:05:07.419> what<00:05:07.600> you're

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
hundred percent this is what you're

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.030 
hundred percent this is what you're
going<00:05:07.870> to<00:05:07.960> need<00:05:08.230> in<00:05:08.500> case<00:05:08.710> you<00:05:08.890> get<00:05:08.980> a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
going to need in case you get a

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.700 
going to need in case you get a
different<00:05:09.400> kind<00:05:09.430> of<00:05:09.669> generator<00:05:10.210> alright<00:05:11.020> so

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
different kind of generator alright so

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.560 
different kind of generator alright so
you<00:05:11.800> the<00:05:12.130> generator<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.730> course<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.360> then<00:05:13.540> a

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
you the generator of course and then a

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.270 
you the generator of course and then a
cable<00:05:14.050> and<00:05:14.290> then<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:15.100> run<00:05:15.280> this<00:05:15.400> cable<00:05:17.280> over

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
cable and then you run this cable over

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.700 
cable and then you run this cable over
to<00:05:18.610> here<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.120> you'll<00:05:19.900> need<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.110> purchase<00:05:20.320> one

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
to here and you'll need to purchase one

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.790 
to here and you'll need to purchase one
of<00:05:20.830> these<00:05:20.950> guys<00:05:21.300> which<00:05:22.300> just<00:05:23.110> attaches<00:05:23.590> to<00:05:23.680> the

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
of these guys which just attaches to the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.960 
of these guys which just attaches to the
outside<00:05:24.130> of<00:05:24.160> your<00:05:24.370> house

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
outside of your house

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.050 
outside of your house
and<00:05:26.630> that<00:05:27.560> connects<00:05:28.010> to<00:05:28.220> the<00:05:28.310> orange<00:05:28.670> cable<00:05:28.880> I

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
and that connects to the orange cable I

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.240 
and that connects to the orange cable I
showed<00:05:29.240> you<00:05:29.360> on<00:05:29.480> the<00:05:29.570> inside<00:05:29.900> of<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:30.170> house<00:05:30.350> so

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
showed you on the inside of the house so

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.530 
showed you on the inside of the house so
that<00:05:31.400> runs<00:05:31.610> through<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.000> wall<00:05:32.180> so<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.450> have

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
that runs through the wall so you have

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.910 
that runs through the wall so you have
to<00:05:32.660> drill<00:05:32.870> a<00:05:32.900> hole<00:05:32.990> through<00:05:33.470> your<00:05:33.710> wall

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
to drill a hole through your wall

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.850 
to drill a hole through your wall
probably<00:05:34.850> cinderblock<00:05:35.810> or<00:05:36.110> cement<00:05:36.470> something

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
probably cinderblock or cement something

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.440 
probably cinderblock or cement something
like<00:05:37.040> that<00:05:37.250> so<00:05:37.790> you<00:05:37.880> have<00:05:37.970> to<00:05:38.090> drill<00:05:38.270> through

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
like that so you have to drill through

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.650 
like that so you have to drill through
that<00:05:38.480> and<00:05:39.430> bring<00:05:40.430> your<00:05:40.520> cable<00:05:40.850> in<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.060> top<00:05:41.300> or

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
that and bring your cable in the top or

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.390 
that and bring your cable in the top or
the<00:05:41.900> bottom<00:05:42.050> here<00:05:42.530> or<00:05:42.770> you<00:05:42.920> could<00:05:43.070> run<00:05:43.190> it<00:05:43.310> in

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
the bottom here or you could run it in

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.150 
the bottom here or you could run it in
the<00:05:43.460> side<00:05:43.700> there's<00:05:44.630> holes<00:05:44.930> for<00:05:45.200> either<00:05:45.800> side

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
the side there's holes for either side

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.840 
the side there's holes for either side
there<00:05:46.430> if<00:05:46.670> you<00:05:47.300> need<00:05:47.480> it<00:05:47.660> and<00:05:48.520> that's<00:05:49.520> how<00:05:49.790> you

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
there if you need it and that's how you

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.340 
there if you need it and that's how you
would<00:05:50.060> attach<00:05:51.490> your<00:05:52.490> generator<00:05:53.300> to<00:05:54.200> that

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
would attach your generator to that

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:56.740 
would attach your generator to that
orange<00:05:54.590> cable<00:05:54.800> there's<00:05:55.160> some<00:05:56.120> screw<00:05:56.390> amounts

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
orange cable there's some screw amounts

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.480 
orange cable there's some screw amounts
in<00:05:56.840> there<00:05:57.020> for<00:05:57.290> you<00:05:57.350> to<00:05:57.470> attach<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:58.160> orange

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
in there for you to attach the orange

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:03.130 
in there for you to attach the orange
cable<00:05:58.850> to<00:05:59.480> the<00:05:59.630> four<00:05:59.810> positions<00:06:00.290> there<00:06:02.140> and

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
cable to the four positions there and

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.000 
cable to the four positions there and
I'll<00:06:03.380> just<00:06:03.530> pull<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:04.520> guy<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:06.590> you<00:06:06.680> can<00:06:06.830> see

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
I'll just pull this guy so you can see

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.980 
I'll just pull this guy so you can see
what<00:06:07.160> it<00:06:07.250> looks<00:06:07.430> like<00:06:09.040> so<00:06:10.040> there<00:06:10.220> are<00:06:10.310> four

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
what it looks like so there are four

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.020 
what it looks like so there are four
connectors<00:06:11.990> here<00:06:13.960> which<00:06:14.960> connect<00:06:15.880> to<00:06:16.880> these

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
connectors here which connect to these

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.320 
connectors here which connect to these
guys<00:06:17.330> so<00:06:17.690> I<00:06:17.720> believe<00:06:18.080> this<00:06:18.200> is<00:06:18.350> the<00:06:18.440> ground<00:06:19.330> one

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330 
guys so I believe this is the ground one

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.330 
guys so I believe this is the ground one
of<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:20.600> hots<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:21.230> other<00:06:21.440> hot<00:06:21.770> and<00:06:22.100> then<00:06:22.250> the

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340 
of the hots the other hot and then the

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.740 
of the hots the other hot and then the
neutral<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.850> believe<00:06:23.090> is<00:06:23.240> how<00:06:23.360> this<00:06:23.540> hole

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
neutral I believe is how this hole

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.740 
neutral I believe is how this hole
configured<00:06:24.350> there<00:06:24.590> so<00:06:25.550> that<00:06:26.000> is<00:06:26.270> how<00:06:26.600> it<00:06:26.750> works

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
configured there so that is how it works

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.900 
configured there so that is how it works
and<00:06:29.750> I<00:06:30.590> think<00:06:30.740> I<00:06:30.800> covered<00:06:31.040> everything<00:06:31.340> and

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
and I think I covered everything and

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.610 
and I think I covered everything and
I'll<00:06:32.060> put<00:06:32.240> links<00:06:32.450> for<00:06:32.780> all<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:32.960> stuff<00:06:33.320> that<00:06:33.350> I

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:33.620 
I'll put links for all the stuff that I

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.760 
I'll put links for all the stuff that I
used<00:06:33.980> in<00:06:34.370> the<00:06:34.940> description<00:06:34.970> below
