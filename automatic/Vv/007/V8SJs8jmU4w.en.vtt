there's<00:00:38.820> only<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.120> catch<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
there's only one catch this is the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.170 
there's only one catch this is the
standard<00:00:40.620> galactic<00:00:40.770> alphabet<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.790> you

standard galactic alphabet and you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
standard galactic alphabet and you
probably<00:00:42.390> can't<00:00:42.719> read<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.530> even<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
probably can't read it and even if you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.069 
probably can't read it and even if you
could<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.670> just<00:00:45.030> translates<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> bunch

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
could it's just translates into a bunch

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.930 
could it's just translates into a bunch
of<00:00:46.200> random<00:00:46.950> words<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.520> strung<00:00:47.760> together

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
of random words that are strung together

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.910 
of random words that are strung together
and<00:00:48.510> there's<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.020> bunch<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> jokes<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.739> there

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920
