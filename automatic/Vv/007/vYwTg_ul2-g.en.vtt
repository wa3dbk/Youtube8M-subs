in math I know that four times 14 is 56

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.120 
in math I know that four times 14 is 56
that's<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.590> this<00:02:19.650> is<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.890> fourth

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that's right and this is the fourth

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.320 
that's right and this is the fourth
stone<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:21.870> thrown<00:02:22.730> for<00:02:23.730> distance<00:02:24.150> as

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
stone this is thrown for distance as

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.090 
stone this is thrown for distance as
well<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:24.660> height<00:02:24.960> now<00:02:25.590> if<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:25.770> were<00:02:25.890> throwing

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
well as height now if we were throwing

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.700 
well as height now if we were throwing
for<00:02:26.400> distance<00:02:26.820> we<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.720> preliminary<00:02:27.990> warm<00:02:28.560> up

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
for distance we do a preliminary warm up

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.010 
for distance we do a preliminary warm up
here<00:02:28.950> catch<00:02:29.730> our<00:02:30.000> feet<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.450> we'd<00:02:30.630> go<00:02:30.660> through

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
here catch our feet and we'd go through

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.720 
here catch our feet and we'd go through
two<00:02:31.200> modified<00:02:31.770> spins<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.400> would<00:02:32.520> look<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.700> lot

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
two modified spins that would look a lot

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.120 
two modified spins that would look a lot
like<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.180> discus<00:02:33.740> anytime<00:02:34.740> a<00:02:34.770> weight<00:02:35.010> is

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
like the discus anytime a weight is

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
like the discus anytime a weight is
thrown<00:02:35.370> for<00:02:35.610> distance<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.180> called<00:02:36.420> a<00:02:36.510> weight

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
thrown for distance it's called a weight

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.560 
thrown for distance it's called a weight
throw<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:38.070> also<00:02:38.370> thrown<00:02:38.820> for<00:02:39.090> height<00:02:39.300> and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
throw it's also thrown for height and

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.770 
throw it's also thrown for height and
that's<00:02:40.020> called<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.380> weight<00:02:40.560> toss<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.780> we'd

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
that's called a weight toss and we'd

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.660 
that's called a weight toss and we'd
warm<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.470> couple<00:02:43.860> swings<00:02:44.100> again<00:02:44.490> between

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
warm up with couple swings again between

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.850 
warm up with couple swings again between
the<00:02:44.970> legs<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:46.050> we<00:02:46.170> throw<00:02:46.350> this<00:02:46.560> as<00:02:46.709> high

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the legs and then we throw this as high

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.070 
the legs and then we throw this as high
as<00:02:46.920> we<00:02:47.160> could<00:02:47.370> over<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.730> bar<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.300> looks<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.959> lot

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
as we could over a bar that looks a lot

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840 
as we could over a bar that looks a lot
like<00:02:49.230> a<00:02:49.290> cross<00:02:49.620> bar<00:02:49.950> for<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.250> pole<00:02:50.459> vault<00:02:50.490> or

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
like a cross bar for the pole vault or

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.790 
like a cross bar for the pole vault or
high<00:02:51.000> jump<00:02:53.270> after<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.750> stone<00:02:54.990> putt<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.530> then

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
high jump after the stone putt and then

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.250 
high jump after the stone putt and then
the<00:02:55.980> 56<00:02:56.520> pound<00:02:56.790> weight<00:02:57.060> we'd<00:02:57.330> go<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.750> 28

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
the 56 pound weight we'd go to a 28

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.449 
the 56 pound weight we'd go to a 28
pound<00:02:58.500> weight<00:03:00.709> which<00:03:01.709> again<00:03:01.980> you<00:03:02.220> math

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
pound weight which again you math

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.280 
pound weight which again you math
whizzes<00:03:02.760> wouldn't<00:03:03.480> it<00:03:03.570> recognized<00:03:04.020> as<00:03:04.260> the

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
whizzes wouldn't it recognized as the

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.590 
whizzes wouldn't it recognized as the
two<00:03:04.620> stone<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.580> again<00:03:06.240> it's<00:03:06.390> thrown

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
two stone and again it's thrown

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.920 
two stone and again it's thrown
basically<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> same<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.890> four<00:03:08.100> stone

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
basically the same as the four stone

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.350 
basically the same as the four stone

they're<00:05:54.180> disappointed<00:05:54.690> when<00:05:54.990> they<00:05:55.020> don't<00:05:55.230> see

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
they're disappointed when they don't see

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.360 
they're disappointed when they don't see
that<00:05:55.710> but<00:05:56.700> this<00:05:56.820> is<00:05:56.940> actually<00:05:57.330> the<00:05:57.450> sheaf<00:05:57.690> toss

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
that but this is actually the sheaf toss

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.850 
that but this is actually the sheaf toss
this<00:05:59.370> is<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.640> 16<00:06:00.330> pound<00:06:00.720> sack<00:06:01.200> of<00:06:01.410> hay<00:06:01.620> and

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
this is a 16 pound sack of hay and

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.550 
this is a 16 pound sack of hay and
you'll<00:06:02.850> take<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.120> couple<00:06:03.419> preliminary<00:06:04.169> swings

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
you'll take a couple preliminary swings

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.400 
you'll take a couple preliminary swings
here<00:06:05.010> and<00:06:05.160> again<00:06:05.940> throw<00:06:06.330> it<00:06:06.450> up<00:06:06.570> over<00:06:07.110> a<00:06:07.140> bar

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
here and again throw it up over a bar

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.560 
here and again throw it up over a bar
for<00:06:07.650> height<00:06:07.890> just<00:06:08.669> like<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.030> pole-vaulter

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
for height just like the pole-vaulter

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.600 
for height just like the pole-vaulter
high<00:06:09.720> jump<00:06:10.020> only<00:06:10.320> much<00:06:10.500> higher<00:06:10.530> and<00:06:11.040> this

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
high jump only much higher and this

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.690 
high jump only much higher and this
involves<00:06:11.850> a<00:06:12.090> pitchfork<00:06:12.980> an<00:06:13.980> interesting<00:06:14.550> note

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.700 
involves a pitchfork an interesting note

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.659 
involves a pitchfork an interesting note
about<00:06:14.730> the<00:06:15.030> sheaf<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.919> was<00:06:16.919> in<00:06:17.070> Scotland<00:06:17.490> last

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
about the sheaf I was in Scotland last

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.520 
about the sheaf I was in Scotland last
summer<00:06:17.910> and<00:06:18.210> competed<00:06:18.630> in<00:06:18.750> eight<00:06:18.870> games<00:06:19.110> I<00:06:19.410> was

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
summer and competed in eight games I was

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.350 
summer and competed in eight games I was
there<00:06:19.680> two<00:06:19.860> years<00:06:19.890> before<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.760> never<00:06:21.000> saw<00:06:21.300> the

there two years before and never saw the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.080 
there two years before and never saw the
sheaf<00:06:21.660> competed<00:06:22.230> in<00:06:22.470> Scotland<00:06:23.040> one<00:06:23.910> of<00:06:24.030> the

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
sheaf competed in Scotland one of the

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.750 
sheaf competed in Scotland one of the
first<00:06:24.360> Americans<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:25.020> go<00:06:25.200> to<00:06:25.260> Scotland

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
first Americans to go to Scotland

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.890 
first Americans to go to Scotland
happened<00:06:26.760> to<00:06:26.820> go<00:06:26.940> to<00:06:27.000> one<00:06:27.210> of<00:06:27.270> the<00:06:27.419> games<00:06:27.450> where

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
happened to go to one of the games where

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.540 
happened to go to one of the games where
the<00:06:27.990> sheaf<00:06:28.200> was<00:06:28.410> competed<00:06:28.919> and<00:06:29.070> thought<00:06:29.370> that

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
the sheaf was competed and thought that

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.800 
the sheaf was competed and thought that
they<00:06:29.610> would<00:06:29.790> bring<00:06:29.970> that<00:06:30.120> event<00:06:30.390> back<00:06:30.510> to<00:06:30.720> the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
they would bring that event back to the

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.870 
they would bring that event back to the
States<00:06:31.080> now<00:06:31.980> it's<00:06:32.190> one<00:06:32.340> of<00:06:32.400> the<00:06:32.490> most<00:06:32.550> popular

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 
States now it's one of the most popular

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.420 
States now it's one of the most popular
events<00:06:33.450> here<00:06:33.810> but<00:06:34.500> you<00:06:34.650> hardly<00:06:34.830> ever<00:06:35.010> see<00:06:35.190> it

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
events here but you hardly ever see it

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.060 
events here but you hardly ever see it
in<00:06:35.550> Scotland<00:06:36.000> I<00:06:36.289> don't<00:06:37.289> like<00:06:37.440> the<00:06:37.620> sheaf<00:06:37.830> toss

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
in Scotland I don't like the sheaf toss

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.040 
in Scotland I don't like the sheaf toss
but<00:06:38.789> that's<00:06:38.940> that's<00:06:39.240> probably<00:06:39.600> a<00:06:39.690> topic<00:06:40.020> for

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
but that's that's probably a topic for

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.590 
but that's that's probably a topic for
another<00:06:40.200> show

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
another show

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.450 
another show
we<00:06:42.600> would<00:06:42.780> finally<00:06:43.169> wind<00:06:43.380> up<00:06:43.590> with<00:06:43.800> the<00:06:43.919> 56

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
we would finally wind up with the 56

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:45.740 
we would finally wind up with the 56
pound<00:06:44.669> weight<00:06:44.820> for<00:06:45.000> height<00:06:45.150> which<00:06:45.600> we

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
pound weight for height which we

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.150 
pound weight for height which we
demonstrated<00:06:46.289> we<00:06:46.440> got<00:06:46.590> a<00:06:46.620> little<00:06:46.800> bit<00:06:47.009> out<00:06:47.130> of

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 
demonstrated we got a little bit out of

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.189 
demonstrated we got a little bit out of
order<00:06:47.400> but<00:06:48.180> those<00:06:48.419> are<00:06:48.630> basically<00:06:49.110> the

order but those are basically the
