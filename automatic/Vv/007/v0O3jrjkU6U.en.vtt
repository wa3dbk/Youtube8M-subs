00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.759
 my now nasty channel for live 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.759
 communicating 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:25.590
 today there will be two concerts like you at all 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.540
 they will carry them like a marathon 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.020
 itâ€™s usual to rest more 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.510
 business 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.420
 a marathon such we need four 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.850
 concert day so 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:38.130
 nothing so unusual on this probably 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 unusual for some there as spectators 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.100
 for me it is familiar but actually 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.640
 evening concert he will be great night 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.280
 concert 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.610
 he will be much smaller dad dad 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.740
 except therefore 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.740
 in this plan will be just 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.580
 whether my listeners are music lovers 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.740
 hope that when thousands come out 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.079
 new tracks such as she try 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.119
 Of course, of course there was a project 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.399
 solaris is my third site project 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.200
 besides you duck it for yes about their solaris 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:29.289
 first of all sharpened just for the songs 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.299
 format it is some kind of poems to the music and 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.899
 not even the elements monologues dive in greater 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.909
 degrees 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.979
 I want to try to do something new 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.569
 try to experiment try 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.069
 look for yourself in something else 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.740
 how well it turns out not 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:44.730
 it turns out another question but this one 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.710
 constant search it when paint leads 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.710
 by some other perfect result 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.340
 we have already formed in Russia two 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.409
 biggest label as far as i know im 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.360
 what kind of relationship are enemies partners 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.890
 competitors actually 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.050
 neutral attitude towards each other nobody 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.970
 each other spokes in the wheel is not inserted in the 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.970
 us a little different audience and 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.710
 but 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.670
 june 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.670
 if there is 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.420
 and cultures tattooed blood like 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.610
 the continuation of my hand started not clogged 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.620
 not forgotten i need to actually upgrade 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.180
 because well, and already a lot of time 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.879
 she is already a little faded but 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.530
 what about the appointment that has invested 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.599
 she still present not appeared 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.209
 new cultures which tattoos which 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.550
 can also be part of the poem space 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.410
 that's probably space so close but closed 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.510
 clouds in general here is like a left hand 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.489
 fully abdullah on the subject of space 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:05.040
 and I'm a big fan 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:07.500
 on the shoulder came here she bambolbi 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.269
 right hand and I do not know everything will probably 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.269
 brighter side of me 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:21.710
 you have more than 20 concerts a month and when 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.590
 you do not have time to create this much 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.710
 time that inspires you to create 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.900
 it turns out very little time till night 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.330
 it remains me just for the sake of it 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.770
 January is not going to rest 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.510
 how many probably do in our 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.490
 country this New Year holidays so 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.590
 Then I will meet the new year and immediately after 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.830
 yourself at the studio because january is this 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.360
 such a kind of intermediate result 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:47.210
 when i can post everything completely 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.850
 devote to creativity after graduation 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.410
 album companion slightly revised its 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.220
 relation to the release of material 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.320
 Therefore, such a direct massed as 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.480
 release as an album now I do 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.820
 I will not be going to produce everywhere on 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.030
 syndrome because here's an album released 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:08.530
 now the generation has changed and now everything 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.530
 require daily new music 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.810
 plain biome light instructs 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.260
 I did not think that except 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.790
 such musical tours can still 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.250
 conduct these business trainings and 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.440
 master once again you will not come with a business 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.780
 tour so high place i'm with a big 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.390
 pleasure because but experience is already in 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.660
 This is an experience already planned in Moscow 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:41.450
 went to university by university department 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:44.450
 workshops we recently had you from 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.430
 Krasnodar them Rostov actually I 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:50.090
 told you based on some 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:51.950
 your moments and life as you can 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.800
 move or what to do 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.890
 but in principle, I only invite 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.260
 if there is not a large audience and 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.260
 people who want me to listen to anyone 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.790
 go home house 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.610
 not 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.479
 you were a bricklayer for a long time playing but 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.789
 me what a mason can not move away from 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:31.729
 wants to participate in this sphere everywhere 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.429
 work everywhere and turns on their humor 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:37.099
 program say you became a rapper where yuma 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:39.830
 stayed behind or you Sabaeva for you 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.569
 are using but I'm still in the muse of music 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.379
 it 's still not humor for me 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.269
 some kind of music i try more more 

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:50.989
 perhaps lyric to be first 

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:51.909
 turn but elbows seems to me this is humor 

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:54.459
 where 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.899
 what is the maximum humor for a tourist 

00:05:54.459 --> 00:06:00.469
 elbows and that is so straight steep 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:02.589
 good humor for dance floors for wide 

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:02.589
 audience 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.539
 and above can not be solved in the end 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:20.729
 a row that men from mars pig girls in 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:24.360
 This video is one hundred percent, but we have 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:28.829
 absolutely different logic of men of course 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:31.739
 from Mars, of course, cats and cats 

00:06:28.829 --> 00:06:34.759
 smarta and man with mars so therefore 

00:06:31.739 --> 00:06:34.759
 we are alike 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:52.740
 hi there, one black star inc here 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.740
 and you watch my tevii be online 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.759
 official page will not surprise online 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.759
 gave . kind of slash motive
