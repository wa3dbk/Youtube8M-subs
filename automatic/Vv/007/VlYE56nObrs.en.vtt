00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
is to shampoo and condition with our

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.470 
is to shampoo and condition with our
kpop<00:01:36.010> we<00:01:36.130> constructed<00:01:36.640> because<00:01:36.730> she<00:01:37.330> does

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
kpop we constructed because she does

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.630 
kpop we constructed because she does
have<00:01:37.600> some<00:01:37.660> high<00:01:38.080> lifter<00:01:38.530> color<00:01:38.830> on<00:01:39.010> air<00:01:39.160> so

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
have some high lifter color on air so

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.040 
have some high lifter color on air so
you<00:01:39.730> still<00:01:39.910> want<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.060> to<00:01:40.120> look<00:01:40.330> healthy<00:01:40.840> but

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
you still want it to look healthy but

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.140 
you still want it to look healthy but
undone<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.980> I<00:01:42.190> think<00:01:42.370> that's<00:01:42.490> a<00:01:42.580> real<00:01:42.730> balance

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
undone and I think that's a real balance

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.060 
undone and I think that's a real balance
but<00:01:43.810> if<00:01:43.900> we<00:01:43.990> turned<00:01:44.230> to<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:44.350> side<00:01:44.620> what<00:01:44.830> I<00:01:44.860> did

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
but if we turned to the side what I did

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.710 
but if we turned to the side what I did
