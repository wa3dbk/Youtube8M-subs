00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360 
can even go diagonally so if I step on
both<00:00:39.480> sets<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.840> pressure<00:00:40.020> plates<00:00:40.320> at<00:00:40.469> once<00:00:40.649> you

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
both sets of pressure plates at once you

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.400 
both sets of pressure plates at once you
can<00:00:41.489> see<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:42.000> villager<00:00:42.360> guy<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:42.960> sorry<00:00:43.230> the

Golem claw moves diagonally let's go

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
Golem claw moves diagonally let's go
this<00:00:46.110> way<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.629> did<00:00:48.629> we<00:00:48.690> get<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.190> yeah<00:00:50.190> he's

this way and did we get it yeah he's
moving<00:00:50.520> diagonally<00:00:50.870> so<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.430> really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
moving diagonally so so it's really

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.150 
moving diagonally so so it's really
pretty<00:00:53.820> flexible<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:55.680> then<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.890> button

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
pretty flexible and and then the button

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
pretty flexible and and then the button
of<00:00:56.460> course<00:00:56.750> dips<00:00:57.750> down<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.020> tries<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> pick

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

all<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.210> redstone<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.350> everything

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
all the redstone here this is everything

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.160 
all the redstone here this is everything
that<00:01:46.799> runs<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.159> game<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.930> too

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that runs the game it's really not too

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
that runs the game it's really not too
complicated<00:01:49.619> well<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.610> least<00:01:50.700> there's<00:01:50.939> not<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
complicated well at least there's not a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.830 
complicated well at least there's not a
lot<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.240> red<00:01:51.360> stones<00:01:51.619> red<00:01:52.619> stones<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.970> uh<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.659> is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
lot of red stones red stones it uh it is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.969 
lot of red stones red stones it uh it is
a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:55.020> bit<00:01:55.170> complicated<00:01:55.380> how<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.770> works

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
a little bit complicated how it works

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
a little bit complicated how it works
but<00:01:56.250> I'll<00:01:56.399> try<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.670> explain<00:01:57.110> we've<00:01:58.110> got<00:01:58.259> here

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
but I'll try and explain we've got here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
but I'll try and explain we've got here
is<00:01:59.060> actually<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> stack<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> villagers<00:02:00.990> well

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
is actually a stack of villagers well

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.600 
is actually a stack of villagers well
you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.770> some<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> villagers<00:02:02.399> here

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
you can see some of the villagers here

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.630 
you can see some of the villagers here
and<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.790> even<00:02:02.969> Peaks<00:02:03.180> above<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.570> top<00:02:04.640> beneath

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and it even Peaks above the top beneath

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340 
and it even Peaks above the top beneath
iron<00:02:06.030> golem<00:02:06.420> there's<00:02:06.600> more<00:02:06.869> villagers

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
iron golem there's more villagers

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.839 
iron golem there's more villagers
they're<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.710> invisible<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.550> can't<00:02:08.729> see

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
they're just invisible so you can't see

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.609 
they're just invisible so you can't see
them<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> they're<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.569> involve<00:02:09.899> ulnar<00:02:10.410> 'el

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
them and they're all involve ulnar 'el

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
them and they're all involve ulnar 'el
and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.720 
and
so<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.110> that's<00:02:13.290> how<00:02:13.530> that's<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> that's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so that that's how that's the that's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.369 
so that that's how that's the that's
what<00:02:14.879> it's<00:02:15.000> made<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.450> how<00:02:16.019> does<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.230> work

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
what it's made of how does it work

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.740 
what it's made of how does it work
though<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:16.920> let's<00:02:17.250> see<00:02:17.480> these<00:02:18.480> pressure

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
though so let's see these pressure

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.420 
though so let's see these pressure
plates<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> stand<00:02:19.590> on<00:02:19.769> say<00:02:20.159> these

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
plates when I stand on say these

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.520 
plates when I stand on say these
pressure<00:02:20.730> plates<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:21.599> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> turn<00:02:22.080> on<00:02:22.290> a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
pressure plates it's going to turn on a

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
pressure plates it's going to turn on a
comparator<00:02:23.040> clock<00:02:23.250> over<00:02:23.489> here<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.879> what<00:02:24.180> we

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
comparator clock over here and what we

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.119 
comparator clock over here and what we
can<00:02:24.510> actually<00:02:24.540> see<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.920> see<00:02:26.040> the

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:26.129 
can actually see that you can see the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.250 
can actually see that you can see the
comparator<00:02:26.489> clock<00:02:26.670> goes<00:02:27.030> pulses<00:02:27.629> rapidly<00:02:28.080> and

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
comparator clock goes pulses rapidly and

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.860 
comparator clock goes pulses rapidly and
it<00:02:28.379> tries<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.590> push<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.450> thing<00:02:30.599> off<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
it tries to push the the thing off to

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.600 
it tries to push the the thing off to
the<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.110> similarly<00:02:31.680> over<00:02:31.769> here<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
the right similarly over here we have a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.630 
the right similarly over here we have a
comparator<00:02:33.330> clock<00:02:33.540> pushes<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.560> stack<00:02:35.280> off<00:02:35.489> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
comparator clock pushes the stack off to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
comparator clock pushes the stack off to
the<00:02:35.730> left<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.810> does<00:02:36.989> that<00:02:37.230> by<00:02:37.440> using<00:02:37.709> a

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
the left and it does that by using a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.699 
the left and it does that by using a
teleport<00:02:38.730> command<00:02:39.090> with<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.420> new<00:02:39.660> @e<00:02:40.170> selector

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
teleport command with a new @e selector

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.649 
teleport command with a new @e selector
so<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.340> going<00:02:41.909> to<00:02:41.970> go<00:02:42.060> over<00:02:42.239> exactly<00:02:42.510> what

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659 
so I'm not going to go over exactly what

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:44.660 
so I'm not going to go over exactly what
this<00:02:42.780> does<00:02:42.930> but<00:02:43.170> basically<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:44.129> one<00:02:44.370> tries

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
this does but basically this one tries

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.449 
this does but basically this one tries
to<00:02:44.910> move<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.829> villager<00:02:46.829> stack<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.340> the

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
to move the villager stack in the

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.819 
to move the villager stack in the
negative<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.750> X<00:02:48.900> Direction<00:02:49.349> negative

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
negative in the X Direction negative

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.990 
negative in the X Direction negative
point<00:02:50.310> 2<00:02:50.519> and<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:52.500> got<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:52.980> other<00:02:53.250> stuff<00:02:53.819> in

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
point 2 and it's got some other stuff in

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.610 
point 2 and it's got some other stuff in
here<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.480> basically<00:02:54.599> makes<00:02:55.049> sure<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.440> can't

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
here that basically makes sure it can't

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.099 
here that basically makes sure it can't
go<00:02:55.739> past<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.160> left<00:02:56.340> edge<00:02:56.579> of<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.879> of<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.870> box

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
go past the left edge of the of the box

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.280 
go past the left edge of the of the box
and<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:59.400> that's<00:02:59.609> that's<00:02:59.849> how<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.290> stays

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
and so that's that's how it stays

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.860 
and so that's that's how it stays
inbounds<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:02.220> will<00:03:03.000> not<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:03.690> will<00:03:03.810> not

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
inbounds and will not it will not

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.990 
inbounds and will not it will not
accidentally<00:03:04.440> escape<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.069> box<00:03:05.280> because

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
accidentally escape the box because

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.400 
accidentally escape the box because
there's<00:03:06.180> restrictions<00:03:06.420> on<00:03:06.870> how<00:03:07.019> far<00:03:07.260> out<00:03:07.379> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
there's restrictions on how far out I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.210 
there's restrictions on how far out I
can<00:03:07.620> go<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.959> that's<00:03:10.140> that's<00:03:10.349> how<00:03:10.560> all<00:03:10.590> four<00:03:11.190> of

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
can go so that's that's how all four of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.830 
can go so that's that's how all four of
the<00:03:11.430> directions<00:03:11.819> work<00:03:12.030> it's<00:03:12.239> actually<00:03:12.750> very

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
the directions work it's actually very

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
the directions work it's actually very
simple<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.069> then<00:03:14.700> back<00:03:15.690> here<00:03:16.079> we've<00:03:16.290> got<00:03:16.500> this

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
simple and then back here we've got this

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.979 
simple and then back here we've got this
thing<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.880> deletes<00:03:18.150> everything<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.750> thing

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
thing just deletes everything this thing

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.629 
thing just deletes everything this thing
recreates<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.680> stack<00:03:19.919> of<00:03:20.099> villagers<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
recreates the stack of villagers and

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.610 
recreates the stack of villagers and
iron<00:03:21.000> golems<00:03:21.389> especially<00:03:22.049> just<00:03:22.139> a<00:03:22.260> very<00:03:22.410> long

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
iron golems especially just a very long

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.180 
iron golems especially just a very long
command<00:03:23.010> with<00:03:23.160> a<00:03:23.190> bunch<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.489> stacks<00:03:23.730> and<00:03:25.190> yeah

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
command with a bunch of stacks and yeah

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.830 
command with a bunch of stacks and yeah
there's<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.639> lot<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:26.910> stuff<00:03:27.120> in<00:03:27.359> here<00:03:27.389> but

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
there's a lot of stuff in here but

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.150 
there's a lot of stuff in here but
anyway<00:03:28.319> I'm<00:03:28.440> not<00:03:28.470> going<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.769> go<00:03:28.889> over<00:03:28.919> that

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
anyway I'm not going to go over that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.430 
anyway I'm not going to go over that
either<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:30.000> course<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:30.989> can<00:03:31.109> download<00:03:31.230> the

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
either of course you can download the

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.110 
either of course you can download the
map<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.769> explore<00:03:32.370> exactly<00:03:32.579> what's<00:03:32.880> going<00:03:33.030> on

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
map and explore exactly what's going on

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.930 
map and explore exactly what's going on
here<00:03:33.359> this<00:03:33.900> thing<00:03:34.200> basically<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:35.519> what

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
here this thing basically is what

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.280 
here this thing basically is what
happens<00:03:36.209> when<00:03:36.299> you<00:03:36.389> push<00:03:36.599> the<00:03:36.750> button<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.169> it

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
happens when you push the button so it

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.740 
happens when you push the button so it
we're<00:03:37.440> using<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.859> redstone<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.609> very<00:03:39.180> fast<00:03:39.450> clock

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
we're using a redstone a very fast clock

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.470 
we're using a redstone a very fast clock
here<00:03:40.019> it<00:03:40.109> uses<00:03:40.230> a<00:03:40.349> redstone<00:03:40.650> block<00:03:41.010> and<00:03:41.250> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
here it uses a redstone block and a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.000 
here it uses a redstone block and a
setblock<00:03:42.480> command<00:03:42.540> with<00:03:43.019> destroy<00:03:43.349> anyway<00:03:43.950> so

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
setblock command with destroy anyway so

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.500 
setblock command with destroy anyway so
it's<00:03:44.310> just<00:03:44.459> checking<00:03:44.760> for<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.090> stone<00:03:45.419> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
it's just checking for the stone the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.210 
it's just checking for the stone the
button<00:03:45.720> being<00:03:45.840> pushed<00:03:46.049> so<00:03:46.769> when<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:46.919> push<00:03:47.069> the

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
button being pushed so when you push the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.559 
button being pushed so when you push the
button<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.579> not<00:03:47.760> actually<00:03:48.090> triggering<00:03:48.389> any

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
button it's not actually triggering any

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.729 
button it's not actually triggering any
redstone<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.079> can<00:03:49.200> see<00:03:49.319> this<00:03:49.410> is<00:03:49.560> just

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
redstone you can see this is just

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.559 
redstone you can see this is just
floating<00:03:50.010> over<00:03:50.099> there<00:03:50.250> it's<00:03:50.790> just<00:03:51.060> it's<00:03:51.359> just

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
floating over there it's just it's just

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.020 
floating over there it's just it's just
triggering<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:51.959> test<00:03:52.919> for<00:03:53.190> block<00:03:53.459> commands

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
triggering that test for block commands

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.619 
triggering that test for block commands
and<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.470> does<00:03:55.470> some<00:03:55.709> stuff<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.250> so<00:03:57.030> what<00:03:57.540> it

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
and that does some stuff and so what it

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.319 
and that does some stuff and so what it
does<00:03:57.660> over<00:03:58.349> here<00:03:58.379> we<00:03:59.129> can<00:03:59.250> see<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.790> it<00:04:00.090> moves

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
does over here we can see is it moves

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.720 
does over here we can see is it moves
the<00:04:00.510> villager<00:04:00.930> stack<00:04:01.260> downward<00:04:01.859> by<00:04:02.069> in<00:04:02.430> the

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
the villager stack downward by in the

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.759 
the villager stack downward by in the
y-direction<00:04:02.879> which<00:04:03.389> is<00:04:03.569> up<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:04.680> down

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
y-direction which is up and down

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.129 
y-direction which is up and down
downwards<00:04:05.519> by<00:04:05.669> one<00:04:05.940> moves<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.690> downwards<00:04:07.019> by

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
downwards by one moves it downwards by

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.439 
downwards by one moves it downwards by
one<00:04:07.410> same<00:04:07.859> thing<00:04:07.889> again<00:04:08.400> same<00:04:09.000> thing<00:04:09.180> again

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
one same thing again same thing again

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.720 
one same thing again same thing again
and<00:04:09.510> then<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:09.870> moves<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.290> back<00:04:10.440> up<00:04:10.650> four<00:04:11.549> times

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
and then it moves it back up four times

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.559 
and then it moves it back up four times
one<00:04:12.510> each<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.049> so<00:04:13.919> when<00:04:14.549> we<00:04:14.669> saw<00:04:14.879> the<00:04:14.940> villager

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
one each and so when we saw the villager

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.360 
one each and so when we saw the villager
stack<00:04:15.780> extended<00:04:16.229> above<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.650> top<00:04:16.859> of<00:04:16.889> this

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
stack extended above the top of this

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.039 
stack extended above the top of this
thing<00:04:17.639> that's<00:04:18.150> actually<00:04:18.479> important<00:04:18.870> so<00:04:18.959> that

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
thing that's actually important so that

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.390 
thing that's actually important so that
when<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.199> press<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.560> button<00:04:19.590> there's

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
when you press the button there's

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.270 
when you press the button there's
there's<00:04:21.239> something<00:04:21.620> above<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.800> things<00:04:23.010> that

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
there's something above the things that

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.800 
there's something above the things that
it<00:04:23.550> has<00:04:23.789> room<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.479> extend<00:04:25.020> downwards

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
it has room to extend downwards

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.480 
it has room to extend downwards
and<00:04:25.900> so<00:04:26.290> you<00:04:26.380> start<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.650> see<00:04:26.860> those<00:04:27.070> villagers

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
and so you start to see those villagers

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.550 
and so you start to see those villagers
come<00:04:27.850> in<00:04:28.060> when<00:04:28.750> when<00:04:29.139> that<00:04:29.260> extends<00:04:29.620> downwards

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
come in when when that extends downwards

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.650 
come in when when that extends downwards
so<00:04:32.560> that's<00:04:32.740> how<00:04:32.889> the<00:04:32.950> clod<00:04:33.250> dips<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.910> then<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
so that's how the clod dips and then the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.570 
so that's how the clod dips and then the
way<00:04:34.750> it<00:04:34.780> actually<00:04:35.080> grabs<00:04:35.470> a<00:04:35.800> mob<00:04:36.010> you<00:04:36.280> probably

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
way it actually grabs a mob you probably

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.150 
way it actually grabs a mob you probably
saw<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> minecart<00:04:38.139> so<00:04:38.740> we<00:04:38.830> some<00:04:39.040> in<00:04:39.130> a

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
saw the minecart so we some in a

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.220 
saw the minecart so we some in a
minecart<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.700> we<00:04:39.820> teleport<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.419> the<00:04:40.840> golem

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
minecart and we teleport it to the golem

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:47.100 
minecart and we teleport it to the golem
and<00:04:42.419> and<00:04:43.419> then<00:04:44.200> we<00:04:44.970> basically<00:04:45.970> after<00:04:46.330> about

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:47.110 
and and then we basically after about

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.230 
and and then we basically after about
what's<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.130> like<00:04:48.400> little<00:04:48.730> over<00:04:48.970> half<00:04:49.150> a

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
what's this like little over half a

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.480 
what's this like little over half a
second<00:04:49.600> we<00:04:50.110> teleport<00:04:50.560> that<00:04:50.710> minecart<00:04:51.250> into

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
second we teleport that minecart into

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.790 
second we teleport that minecart into
the<00:04:51.580> tray<00:04:51.850> then<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:52.720> kill<00:04:52.930> the<00:04:53.050> minecart<00:04:53.530> and

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
the tray then we kill the minecart and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.909 
the tray then we kill the minecart and
clear<00:04:54.130> out<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:55.360> item<00:04:55.690> that<00:04:55.990> spawned<00:04:56.740> when

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
clear out the the item that spawned when

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.320 
clear out the the item that spawned when
the<00:04:57.040> when<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.460> minecart<00:04:57.820> was<00:04:57.910> killed<00:04:58.090> so

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
the when the minecart was killed so

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.620 
the when the minecart was killed so
basically<00:04:58.930> teleport<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.620> minecart<00:05:00.030> at<00:05:01.030> okay<00:05:01.600> so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
basically teleport a minecart at okay so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:03.510 
basically teleport a minecart at okay so
this<00:05:01.900> thing<00:05:02.110> the<00:05:02.410> stack<00:05:02.680> dips<00:05:03.010> down<00:05:03.190> and<00:05:03.250> the

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
this thing the stack dips down and the

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.670 
this thing the stack dips down and the
iron<00:05:03.669> golems<00:05:04.000> near<00:05:04.240> the<00:05:04.360> ground<00:05:04.540> then<00:05:05.200> we<00:05:05.320> then

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
iron golems near the ground then we then

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.290 
iron golems near the ground then we then
we<00:05:05.740> teleport<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.340> minecart<00:05:06.760> in<00:05:06.880> right<00:05:07.120> where

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
we teleport the minecart in right where

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.580 
we teleport the minecart in right where
it<00:05:07.390> is<00:05:07.510> you<00:05:07.690> can<00:05:07.750> see<00:05:07.930> there's<00:05:08.110> rails<00:05:08.290> on<00:05:08.500> the

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
it is you can see there's rails on the

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.720 
it is you can see there's rails on the
ground<00:05:08.770> those<00:05:08.919> are<00:05:09.010> actually<00:05:09.220> important<00:05:09.610> and

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
ground those are actually important and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.730 
ground those are actually important and
then<00:05:10.419> so<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.750> minecarts<00:05:11.200> there<00:05:11.440> with<00:05:11.620> the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
then so the minecarts there with the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.300 
then so the minecarts there with the
rails<00:05:11.950> and<00:05:12.390> a<00:05:13.390> mob<00:05:13.900> that's<00:05:14.410> near<00:05:14.710> a<00:05:14.770> minecart

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
rails and a mob that's near a minecart

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.370 
rails and a mob that's near a minecart
on<00:05:15.400> Rails<00:05:15.640> will<00:05:15.970> try<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.240> get<00:05:16.330> in<00:05:16.450> it<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:16.780> so

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
on Rails will try and get in it and so

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.469 
on Rails will try and get in it and so
if<00:05:17.650> anyone<00:05:17.950> does<00:05:18.190> get<00:05:18.430> in<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:18.669> when<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.090> when

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 
if anyone does get in it when the when

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:21.810 
if anyone does get in it when the when
the<00:05:19.510> minecart<00:05:19.870> is<00:05:19.930> teleported<00:05:20.350> over<00:05:20.530> here<00:05:20.830> the

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
the minecart is teleported over here the

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.390 
the minecart is teleported over here the
mob<00:05:22.000> will<00:05:22.180> teleport<00:05:22.450> with<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.340> it'll<00:05:24.340> be

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
mob will teleport with it and it'll be

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.440 
mob will teleport with it and it'll be
in<00:05:24.550> the<00:05:24.610> tray<00:05:24.790> and<00:05:24.940> then<00:05:25.030> when<00:05:25.120> we<00:05:25.180> kill<00:05:25.330> the

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
in the tray and then when we kill the

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.150 
in the tray and then when we kill the
minecart<00:05:25.840> the<00:05:26.050> mob<00:05:26.200> stays<00:05:26.470> there<00:05:26.710> so<00:05:27.040> that's

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
minecart the mob stays there so that's

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.190 
minecart the mob stays there so that's
how<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.370> all<00:05:27.460> works<00:05:27.669> like<00:05:28.630> I<00:05:28.750> said<00:05:28.900> is<00:05:29.020> a<00:05:29.050> little

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
how it all works like I said is a little

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.520 
how it all works like I said is a little
bit<00:05:29.290> complicated<00:05:29.530> but<00:05:30.120> but<00:05:31.120> it<00:05:31.210> it's<00:05:32.200> not<00:05:32.320> too

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
bit complicated but but it it's not too

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.990 
bit complicated but but it it's not too
much<00:05:32.680> in<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:32.979> way<00:05:33.310> of<00:05:33.340> redstone<00:05:33.640> behind<00:05:33.910> it

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
much in the way of redstone behind it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.670 
much in the way of redstone behind it
which<00:05:34.090> is<00:05:34.210> really<00:05:34.330> cool<00:05:34.450> this<00:05:34.780> is<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.500> type

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
which is really cool this is this type

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.370 
which is really cool this is this type
of<00:05:35.710> thing<00:05:35.890> was<00:05:36.040> not<00:05:36.340> at<00:05:37.030> all<00:05:37.300> possible<00:05:37.840> let's

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
of thing was not at all possible let's

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.900 
of thing was not at all possible let's
try<00:05:38.530> and<00:05:38.620> get<00:05:38.680> that<00:05:38.800> slime<00:05:39.070> not<00:05:39.700> at<00:05:39.820> all

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
try and get that slime not at all

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.510 
try and get that slime not at all
possible<00:05:40.360> before<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.979> @e<00:05:41.979> selector<00:05:42.400> which

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
possible before the @e selector which

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.090 
possible before the @e selector which
allows<00:05:42.700> you<00:05:42.789> to<00:05:42.880> teleport<00:05:43.270> around<00:05:43.650> mobs<00:05:44.650> and

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:45.100
