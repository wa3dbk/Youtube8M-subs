00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
pretty much done by having a fake decoy

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.289 
pretty much done by having a fake decoy
chester<00:00:14.340> room<00:00:14.490> right<00:00:14.670> here<00:00:14.700> as<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.120> can<00:00:15.150> see

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
chester room right here as you can see

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.910 
chester room right here as you can see
so<00:00:15.750> pretty<00:00:16.020> much<00:00:16.139> first<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.560> all<00:00:16.680> what<00:00:16.830> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so pretty much first of all what you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
so pretty much first of all what you
need<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.310> is<00:00:17.520> make<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.029> chest<00:00:18.420> room<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.930> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
need to do is make a chest room that is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.779 
need to do is make a chest room that is
fake<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.590> basically<00:00:20.130> going<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.400> be<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.609> room

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
fake it's basically going to be the room

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.490 
fake it's basically going to be the room
that<00:00:20.970> doesn't<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.480> any<00:00:21.660> loot<00:00:21.840> in<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.080> chests

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.000 
it's going to be the fake chest room
that<00:00:24.510> people<00:00:24.930> will<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.109> we'll<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:25.769> loot

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010

that people will think we'll have loot
in<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> but<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> actually<00:00:26.609> want<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.359> then

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
in it but it actually want and then

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.599 
in it but it actually want and then
behind<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.529> fake<00:00:28.769> chest<00:00:29.070> room<00:00:29.310> you're<00:00:29.490> going

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
behind the fake chest room you're going

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.580 
behind the fake chest room you're going
to<00:00:29.699> have<00:00:29.789> your<00:00:30.029> real<00:00:30.300> chess<00:00:30.660> room<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.410> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to have your real chess room with the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.470 
to have your real chess room with the
loop<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.070> you<00:00:32.160> want<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.489> hide<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
loop that you want to hide so this is

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.180 
loop that you want to hide so this is
all<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.840> Diamonds<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.530> I've<00:00:34.620> got<00:00:34.860> stored

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
and nobody hopefully we'll be able to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.750 
and nobody hopefully we'll be able to
find<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.829> diamonds<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:38.489> i'm<00:00:38.550> going<00:00:38.670> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
show you guys how this trick works so

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.930 
show you guys how this trick works so
pretty<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.559> what<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.829> need<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.040> do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.399> go

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
pretty much what you need to do is go

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.750 
pretty much what you need to do is go
into<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.629> fake<00:00:43.079> decoy<00:00:43.620> chest<00:00:43.980> room<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
into the fake decoy chest room and you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.880 
into the fake decoy chest room and you
need<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.120> shift<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.899> against<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.559> chest

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
need to shift up against this chest

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.010 
need to shift up against this chest
right<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.550> then<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.360> stare<00:00:48.780> at

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
right here and then you need to stare at

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.810 
right here and then you need to stare at
the<00:00:49.230> chests<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.430> basically

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the chests right here and you basically

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
the chests right here and you basically
just<00:00:51.149> need<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.570> hold<00:00:52.020> shift<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> walk

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
just need to hold shift and walk

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.160 
just need to hold shift and walk
backwards<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:54.180> should<00:00:54.449> go<00:00:54.660> inside<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
backwards and you should go inside of

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
backwards and you should go inside of
the<00:00:55.440> chest<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.890> should<00:00:56.100> take<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.550> through

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the chest that should take you through

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.400 
the chest that should take you through
the<00:00:57.000> walls<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.660> need<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.899> keep<00:00:58.050> doing

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the walls so you just need to keep doing

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
the walls so you just need to keep doing
this<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.829> sometimes<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> could<00:00:59.910> be<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.059> little

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
this and sometimes it could be a little

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
this and sometimes it could be a little
bit<00:01:00.420> tricky<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.750> do<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.590> basically<00:01:01.949> just

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
bit tricky to do but you basically just

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.820 
bit tricky to do but you basically just
need<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.579> shift<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.780> walk<00:01:04.049> backwards<00:01:04.379> up

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
need to shift and walk backwards up

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.340 
need to shift and walk backwards up
against<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.430> up<00:01:06.299> against<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> chest<00:01:07.170> right

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
against this up against this chest right

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
against this up against this chest right
here<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.799> should<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> wall

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
here and you should go through the wall

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.560 
here and you should go through the wall
inside<00:01:10.110> into<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.070> real<00:01:11.820> chess<00:01:12.150> room<00:01:12.390> right

be<00:01:27.509> honest<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.829> just

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
be honest because you know you can just

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.399 
be honest because you know you can just
shift<00:01:29.220> up<00:01:29.430> against<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.990> walk

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
shift up against here and then just walk

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.499 
shift up against here and then just walk
backwards<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> no<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.670> will<00:01:32.880> think<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.329> do

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
backwards and no one will think to do

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
backwards and no one will think to do
this<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.710> great<00:01:34.950> way<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.159> hiding<00:01:35.520> your

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
this so it's a great way of hiding your

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.719 
this so it's a great way of hiding your
chests<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.740> just<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:37.920> through<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> chest

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
chests and just going through the chest

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.600 
chests and just going through the chest
you<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.360> real<00:01:39.600> loot<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.610> yeah

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you get to your real loot and yeah

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.700 
you get to your real loot and yeah
that's<00:01:41.790> basically<00:01:41.939> how<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:43.110> trick<00:01:43.439> works

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
that's basically how this trick works

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
that's basically how this trick works
and<00:01:44.130> sometimes<00:01:44.369> it<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.299> little<00:01:45.479> while

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
and sometimes it can take a little while

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.469 
and sometimes it can take a little while
to<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> speed<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> process

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to do and a way to speed up the process

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.539 
to do and a way to speed up the process
is<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> just<00:01:49.259> break<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.770> chest<00:01:50.040> in<00:01:50.189> front<00:01:50.220> of

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
is to just break the chest in front of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
is to just break the chest in front of
you<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.540> through<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you and it will take you through the

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
you and it will take you through the
wall<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:52.740> sometimes<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> doesn't<00:01:53.970> let<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
wall so sometimes if it doesn't let you

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.120 
wall so sometimes if it doesn't let you
go<00:01:54.270> through<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> chest<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.590> break<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
go through the chest just break the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.590

chest<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.700> front<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.390> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
chest that's in front of you and it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.899 
chest that's in front of you and it
should<00:01:57.869> work<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.770> yeah<00:01:59.250> that's<00:01:59.460> basically<00:01:59.640> how

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
should work so yeah that's basically how

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.399 
should work so yeah that's basically how
this<00:02:00.090> trick<00:02:00.299> works<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.780> thanks<00:02:01.049> for<00:02:01.140> watching
