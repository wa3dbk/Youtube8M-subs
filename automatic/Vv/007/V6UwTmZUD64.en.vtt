you see there it's actually connected to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.080 
you see there it's actually connected to
you<00:04:13.770> place<00:04:14.070> so<00:04:15.860> it's<00:04:16.860> not<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.310> network<00:04:17.790> itself

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
you place so it's not the network itself

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.030 
you place so it's not the network itself
it's<00:04:18.239> not<00:04:18.390> my<00:04:18.600> part<00:04:19.110> of<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> network<00:04:19.769> it's

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:27.620 
it's not my part of the network it's
it's<00:04:20.900> definitely<00:04:21.900> you<00:04:22.350> be<00:04:22.380> some<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:26.630> sadly

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
on it right now probably because it's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.720 
on it right now probably because it's
the<00:04:34.050> weekends<00:04:34.590> or<00:04:34.710> something<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:35.190> don't<00:04:35.610> know
