Orange<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:43.200> first<00:00:43.620> clip<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.100> with<00:00:45.079> this<00:00:46.079> base

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
Orange the first clip is with this base

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.440 
Orange the first clip is with this base
restrictor<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.610> that's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.969> really

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
restrictor in it and that's a really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
restrictor in it and that's a really
tiny<00:00:48.660> restrictor<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.739> tails<00:00:50.190> pretty

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
tiny restrictor and it tails pretty

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.630 
tiny restrictor and it tails pretty
badly<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> now<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.649> base<00:00:53.010> restrictor<00:00:53.489> has

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
badly and now the base restrictor has

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.750 
badly and now the base restrictor has
been<00:00:53.789> pulled<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.100> so<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.309> second<00:00:56.610> clip

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
been pulled out and so the second clip

00:00:56.760 --> 00:02:00.850 
been pulled out and so the second clip
is<00:00:56.940> without<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> base<00:00:57.719> restrictor

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.890
