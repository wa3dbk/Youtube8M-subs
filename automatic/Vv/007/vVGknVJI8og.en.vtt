00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:08.310
 Today I am going to tell you a little anecdote 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.580
 it turns out that once I had a subscriber 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:14.280
 who told me hey romanorum I can catch 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.859
 and I can take the cages for nissan and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 fourth because my father will not let me 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:23.190
 have it extra and I love myself for me 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.880
 fourth and I told him do not take the 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.880
 Cage to your room because it's bad 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:36.650
 I said Romans in the cage my heart my 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.700
 father does not let me have a system and I 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:44.629
 I said no you do not want your cage 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.660
 love or your room and suddenly one day 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.129
 The good guy told me to light up if I can not 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.379
 take me the fear cage because my 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.800
 fourth could you please tell me the 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 Causes 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.809
 and I told him if I'm going to say but 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.660
 after saying a video from here to a time 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.239
 when you take out and today that video is here 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.800
 people that it turns out that as I have 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.479
 counted previously, before 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.570
 subscriber had the problem that his 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.470
 dad and his mom did not want him to have the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.060
 love neither in 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.080
 in the room because he said he used a lot 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:23.250
 water that fell something that you knew the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:27.850
 stick that came out mixture that smelled like 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.350
 sits down and that the bird if he wanted that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.960
 put it in his room 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.370
 so then I when that boy 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.990
 they said to pay attention to me that I do not know 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.720
 put in his room that not that not 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.580
 not that there were negative causes to 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.040
 he finally tells him by the comment of 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.229
 the negative things I was going to that was and 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.619
 so then one of the causes between 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.810
 many that there is but the most important 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.090
 ok and I hope you listen to everything and 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.830
 all all in all that you have already 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.350
 japan and nymph budgie in you 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 rooms listen to this that loses order 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.150
 you know why because possibly 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.240
 Roman West 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.310
 saving civilian life as listening 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.310
 and how to listen and Romans no longer 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.660
 save lives of animals but Roman a 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.790
 lifeguards already of people 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.380
 and about all the people that you see me 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.510
 subscribers and hopefully those 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.490
 subscribing thoughts go to your 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.280
 friend her friend her cousins â€‹â€‹and more 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.990
 imbeciles tell you mobile to look at the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 event a video steals what it says this is 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.800
 true so you know by what in 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.600
 practice because I'm saving you the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.840
 lifetime 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.790
 it turns out that the steam or federico is 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:42.370
 groom and pluck a lot in your pen 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.530
 as you see when a job is not with 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.380
 their normal feathers and currents because no 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.290
 nothing happens but when you see them 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.410
 realizes fixed tells me what is said and is 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.820
 do so and be radicalized and made 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:59.800
 five legs and they are done that way because it happens 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.010
 because they release a few hairs loose a 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.220
 pen release a micro micro 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.180
 micro particles from feathers 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.530
 powder dead skin 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.319
 of microbes release a series of Peru 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:19.739
 follow a fluff so girl so 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:23.879
 girl so small that we do not 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.859
 we see but we breathe them then 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.689
 what happens when we have 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.780
 nothing by nor nor forum or parakeet in 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:33.659
 our room one day another day one night 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.269
 one week one month one year two years five 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.670
 years that happens because we are always 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.639
 at night breathing to go 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:45.090
 inhaling those little fluff 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:48.290
 small particles where as you can 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:53.269
 know and how can you see and how can you 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.269
 notice then they go to the lungs 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.540
 it was a dopamine when you when 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.340
 tennis when you are when you absorb 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.590
 when you suck when you move 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:08.590
 16 kilos of speed after so much 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.470
 years that fuzz remained lungs 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.900
 and it causes many respiratory problems 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.720
 they produce many problems at the time of 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.419
 talks about then of running and produces 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.000
 illness and things that really 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.880
 you have to keep it in mind then what 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.460
 it happens is never convenient nor 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.950
 recommended for health or nothing 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.450
 What do you have your pets for? 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.930
 nymph budgie 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.030
 or another type of bird in your room in 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.410
 four fourth I mean the fourth where 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:45.790
 sleep because when I slept 2007 6 8 10 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.669
 12 now 14 now 18 now 24 hours at 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.180
 day and when you're sleeping 24 a day 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.280
 during the 365 days of the year in that 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.540
 room then the fluff that now 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.330
 same I am here talking to the 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.430
 video and as a pen that is being given 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.580
 I see writing some fluff 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:06.840
 girls were already controlled and when 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.840
 the old people 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.100
 and then I try not to breathe but 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.770
 that you know that she knew that in essence 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.480
 in our body and our system if 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.940
 they are in small quantity they are not bad 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.250
 but if it's one night after night after 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.710
 night after night after night after night and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.420
 breathing that fuzz as is logical to 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:30.370
 the doctor and I say that I am a 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.410
 feather mattress inside 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.090
 so you know, but that's not it 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.190
 advice that you know many lives out there 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.230
 voucher of friends and friend and of anger 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.730
 posts even from enemies some like 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.530
 the casualties of something happens weird by the 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:44.320
 Positive and admirable takes care of you for this 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.690
 that you are and never have the Japanese and 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.700
 parakeets in our rooms without 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:50.800
 have it in our room you can have it 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.660
 in our kitchen or without having it in 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.570
 our living room you can have it 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.250
 even in some study areas that 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.730
 you pass a shore to shore a day 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.860
 it's just ok but never put it in 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:04.570
 the rooms are worth when they were 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.640
 cuddled are sleeping and they 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.010
 they are in their quiet cage at night is 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.210
 the more you scratch the more effective the more you 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.919
 move and more and more 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.050
 they have chills and also tonces 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.449
 when least advisable is to have 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.460
 our classrooms in our room a 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.650
 cordial greeting of roman the moon and the 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.240
 luck but still active not luck but 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.410
 in chairs that sometimes I see yellow or 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.470
 whatever god 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:29.419

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.729
 life but you have to understand that there 

00:06:29.419 --> 00:06:33.970
 that also look with health worth chau 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:33.970
 bye
