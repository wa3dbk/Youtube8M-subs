so<00:00:08.170> I<00:00:08.200> have<00:00:08.440> a<00:00:08.680> microwave<00:00:09.400> with<00:00:09.880> an<00:00:10.200> f3<00:00:11.200> I

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
so I have a microwave with an f3 I

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.650 
so I have a microwave with an f3 I
believe<00:00:13.059> it<00:00:13.420> is<00:00:13.660> a<00:00:13.690> control<00:00:14.469> panel<00:00:15.129> that<00:00:15.660> is

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
believe it is a control panel that is

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.540 
believe it is a control panel that is
not<00:00:17.170> working<00:00:17.650> properly<00:00:18.660> anymore<00:00:19.660> so<00:00:20.590> I<00:00:21.100> looked

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
not working properly anymore so I looked

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.120 
not working properly anymore so I looked
it<00:00:21.699> up<00:00:21.820> on<00:00:22.000> the<00:00:22.090> internet<00:00:22.420> and<00:00:22.750> it<00:00:23.080> needs<00:00:23.980> to<00:00:24.070> be

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
it up on the internet and it needs to be

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.410 
it up on the internet and it needs to be
replaced<00:00:24.690> so<00:00:25.690> I'm<00:00:25.780> going<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.020> replace<00:00:26.350> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.310 
replaced so I'm going to replace the
control<00:00:28.420> panel<00:00:29.170> on<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.740> GE<00:00:30.070> microwave<00:00:31.320> first

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
control panel on this GE microwave first

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.729 
control panel on this GE microwave first
thing<00:00:32.619> to<00:00:32.770> do<00:00:32.949> is<00:00:33.309> to<00:00:34.149> remove<00:00:34.480> these<00:00:34.809> two

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
up and out go into the control panel

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.540 
up and out go into the control panel
here<00:01:46.890> that's<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.220> ground<00:01:48.490> wire<00:01:48.940> you'll<00:01:49.780> have<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
here that's a ground wire you'll have to

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.970 
here that's a ground wire you'll have to
remove<00:01:51.550> that<00:01:51.849> here

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:06.220 

I<00:02:01.810> don't<00:02:02.810> know<00:02:02.930> if<00:02:03.050> you<00:02:03.200> can<00:02:03.500> see<00:02:03.740> but<00:02:04.930> on<00:02:05.930> this

control panel
so<00:02:16.240> this<00:02:17.240> cable<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:19.450> it<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:22.160> for<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> control

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
so this cable here it is for the control

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.600 
so this cable here it is for the control
panel<00:02:23.780> so<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.050> want<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.530> remove<00:02:24.860> that<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.690> pop

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.980 
panel so you want to remove that you pop
this<00:02:28.610> connection<00:02:29.830> you'll<00:02:30.830> pull<00:02:31.220> it<00:02:31.250> up<00:02:32.090> before

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
this connection you'll pull it up before

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.190 
this connection you'll pull it up before
you<00:02:33.020> can<00:02:33.290> remove<00:02:33.500> this<00:02:35.260> so<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:37.370> there's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
you can remove this so and then there's

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.020 
you can remove this so and then there's
like<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.380> said<00:02:39.680> there's<00:02:39.950> four<00:02:40.160> screws<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:40.940> I'll

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
like I said there's four screws so I'll

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:52.210 
like I said there's four screws so I'll
remove<00:02:41.360> those<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.080> once<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.650> get<00:02:51.980> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
remove those and then once you get the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.130 
remove those and then once you get the
new<00:02:52.430> control<00:02:53.030> panel<00:02:53.300> you'll<00:02:54.880> put<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.210> board

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
new control panel you'll put this board

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.210 
new control panel you'll put this board
back<00:02:57.710> on<00:03:00.430> it's<00:03:01.430> always<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:01.700> good<00:03:01.940> idea<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:03.220> to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
back on it's always a good idea to to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.030 
back on it's always a good idea to to
ground<00:03:04.959> yourself<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:07.070> remove<00:03:07.720> static<00:03:09.040> just

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
ground yourself to remove static just

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.010 
ground yourself to remove static just
touch<00:03:10.400> something<00:03:10.790> metal<00:03:11.090> and<00:03:11.300> I'll<00:03:11.450> relieve

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
touch something metal and I'll relieve

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.920 
touch something metal and I'll relieve
some<00:03:12.380> static<00:03:13.030> before<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.120> put<00:03:14.330> the<00:03:14.480> new<00:03:14.510> board

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
some static before you put the new board

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.320 
some static before you put the new board
on<00:03:16.060> then<00:03:17.060> you<00:03:17.180> want<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.480> put<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:19.000> ground<00:03:20.000> wire

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
on then you want to put the ground wire

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:28.600 
on then you want to put the ground wire
back<00:03:20.750> in<00:03:21.110> here<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:22.780> cinch<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.870> up<00:03:24.350> first<00:03:27.610> and

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
back in here and cinch that up first and

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.520 
back in here and cinch that up first and
don't<00:03:28.850> forget<00:03:29.239> to<00:03:29.480> reconnect<00:03:30.170> your<00:03:32.530> ribbon

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
cable in here you want to make sure that

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.090 
cable in here you want to make sure that
this<00:03:38.030> connectors<00:03:38.870> all<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.260> way<00:03:39.350> up<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.800> then

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
this connectors all the way up and then

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.060 
this connectors all the way up and then
push<00:03:40.430> that<00:03:40.670> in<00:03:43.660> seats<00:03:44.660> all<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.080> way<00:03:45.200> down<00:03:45.530> and
