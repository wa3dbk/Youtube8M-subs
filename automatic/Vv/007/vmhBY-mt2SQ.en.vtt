00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 they are all boys here and yellow and they are 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.279
 returned with you today with a new video 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.560
 different from the usual this one is a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.570
 unboxing of the game capture hd delegate 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
 that since it was sent practically 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.900
 I am required to do this unboxing and ne 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 you have seen in billions in packages why 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.470
 I will try to do mine is my style 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.119
 trying to make a decent boxing 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 since my first and only one I think 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.270
 last you will have me on this channel 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.350
 because I play with I don't do unboxing 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.760
 end point 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.350
 we leave immediately I was no longer in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.689
 I opened the skin when it arrived 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.769
 discarded, I was delighted and screamed though 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.779
 I can assure you that all that 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.189
 was in the box I put it back 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.719
 exactly how it was when i was 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.010
 arrived we leave immediately for how it is 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.780
 open this box opens in a manner 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.300
 really cool is really spectacular that is 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 well cared for everything is shaped 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.649
 see there is the little hole and shaped 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.379
 very very nice box defined a lot 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.870
 finished it opens like this 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.760
 very cool on this side we have the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
 instruction booklet that we see if 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.480
 I can take without destroying 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.969
 everything ok here it is written 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.920
 practically both in English and in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.219
 French in both English and French 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.129
 how to connect both ps3 and 360 to yours 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.840
 product and on TV and then we have precisely 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 in the fact that in jail hd that guys are 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.490
 really tiny I show you the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.490
 difference with a putt of 360 which is stuff 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 hallucinating is this business noè è è 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.640
 very small this is really beautiful 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.200
 it is a gem above all counting that 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
 he's used to seeing that one 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.009
 pvr booth on the desk 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 let's say this is really really well 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 let's put it aside then what 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.400
 we have this part here it always opens 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.290
 in a very very cool way and from this one 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.990
 part what we have hdmi cable that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.090
 strangely they put it on and I live in many 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 vr which marks to buy all the cable a 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.790
 v for those who should connect it to ps3 cable 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 usb to connect to the computer and finally 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.479
 the component cable and therefore there is 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.130
 practically everything guys we pass i 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.259
 links per hour as we have seen 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.530
 me indeed as we see here it is written 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.970
 hdmi or ad in these things are guys 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.909
 input sockets that must be 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.180
 connected from here to ps3 or water la 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.369
 360 via precisely optical cable or like 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.909
 I said first HDMI cable because all the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.819
 60 while on the reverse we have on the back 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.890
 as I speak from this part here hdmi out 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.460
 that is the door 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 hdmi that will go to the TV and the door 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.970
 usb that will need to connect water to 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.530
 computer to record with col 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.790
 your little program from what I have 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.800
 read that they are free programs 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.510
 downloadable from the delegated site for those who 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.250
 buy and for those who already have a 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.750
 program like TV will be fine by 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.520
 what I understood because I will try to 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.530
 record some like that but I too with 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.030
 she tv then recapping over to 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.370
 have instruction booklet like 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.720
 precisely said el gato that encapsulates hd 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.700
 that goes well they are essential 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:43.170
 we have the component cable in the package 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.080
 the hdmi and av cable for ps3 is finally 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.239
 the usb cable to connect to the computer 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.610
 I leave you some text now a clip 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.590
 with registered with denied encapsulating 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.739
 hd right the day I owed it 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.080
 if you seem to mount the tv to the xbox e 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.060
 so no guys can tell you mine 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.890
 impressions because inter people like me 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.280
 that makes youtube that for a while ago 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.720
 youtube 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.730
 maybe a year maybe there are also those 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.890
 will do more to play with the cable 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.959
 component then play in 720 a little 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 grainy yes I don't say it's difficult 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.160
 however we say that the experience in 1080 e 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.680
 much much better especially happy 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.110
 that I can play in 1080 at 1080p and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.489
 you will choose to record 1080 in 720 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.620
 so let's say I have the same polita o 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.670
 superior seeing that much better 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.989
 that's on the screen so I'm a lot 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.579
 very happy because above all 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.530
 Delegated but sent for free 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.209
 so I didn't even have to pay for it 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.060
 having this little gem now must 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.370
 decide what to do with the pvr if selling it 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.590
 give it some friend see what to do o 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.959
 if you keep it on my shelf like 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.269
 heirloom from i the buyers i like there 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.160
 better to remember and see what to do with it 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.090
 however to the boys that deceive to have 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.799
 seen the video 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.150
