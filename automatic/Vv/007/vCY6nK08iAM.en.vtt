00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.470 

so<00:00:04.710> this<00:00:04.859> is<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.100> giant<00:00:05.430> sandbox<00:00:05.879> that<00:00:06.359> were

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
so this is a giant sandbox that were

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.820 
so this is a giant sandbox that were
making<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:07.140> universe<00:00:08.010> size<00:00:08.280> sandbox<00:00:09.650> it's<00:00:10.650> full

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
making a universe size sandbox it's full

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.200 
making a universe size sandbox it's full
of<00:00:10.950> choices<00:00:13.490> like<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.790> we're<00:00:15.000> at<00:00:15.089> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
of choices like here we're at the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.790 
of choices like here we're at the
boundary<00:00:15.630> between<00:00:15.719> two<00:00:16.410> warring<00:00:16.680> factions<00:00:17.430> I

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
boundary between two warring factions I

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.450 
boundary between two warring factions I
could<00:00:19.800> join<00:00:20.010> in

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
could join in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:41.650 
could join in
I<00:00:20.490> could<00:00:20.910> take<00:00:21.090> sides

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.610 

so<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> tiny<00:00:43.260> glimpse<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.890> space<00:00:44.220> combat

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.810 
so that's a tiny glimpse of space combat
but<00:00:46.620> I've<00:00:46.710> only<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:47.100> three<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
but I've only got three but it's of

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.299 
but I've only got three but it's of
those<00:00:47.970> loads<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.450> want<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.690> show<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.309> like

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
those loads that I want to show you like

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.420 
those loads that I want to show you like
this<00:00:51.050> so<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.559> solar<00:00:52.830> system<00:00:53.309> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this so this is the solar system that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.189 
this so this is the solar system that
we're<00:00:53.580> currently<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.970> that's<00:00:54.330> where<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
we're currently at that's where that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.259 
we're currently at that's where that
battle<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.680> taking<00:00:55.890> place<00:00:56.309> but<00:00:56.580> battles<00:00:57.059> like

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
battle is taking place but battles like

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.390 
battle is taking place but battles like
that<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:58.080> taking<00:00:58.590> place<00:00:58.800> across<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
that are taking place across the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.499 
that are taking place across the
universe<00:01:01.699> if<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.790> pull<00:01:03.000> back<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.390> bit<00:01:05.509> you

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:06.509 
universe if I pull back a little bit you

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.200 
universe if I pull back a little bit you
could<00:01:06.690> see<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.740> stars<00:01:08.160> nearby<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:09.150> I

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
could see the other stars nearby that I

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.080 
could see the other stars nearby that I
can<00:01:09.420> reach<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.840> my<00:01:09.990> current<00:01:10.200> hyperdrive<00:01:11.090> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
can reach with my current hyperdrive and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.940 
can reach with my current hyperdrive and
I'm<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.660> to<00:01:12.720> pull<00:01:12.899> back<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> little<00:01:13.320> bit<00:01:13.590> more

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
I'm going to pull back a little bit more

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.060 
I'm going to pull back a little bit more
to<00:01:14.220> give<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> send<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.149> size<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.660> the<00:01:15.750> game

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
to give you send to the size of the game

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.700 
to give you send to the size of the game
when<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.399> really<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.530> keep<00:01:19.530> in

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
when I do I really need you to keep in

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.920 
when I do I really need you to keep in
mind<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.190> understand<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.030> every<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.810> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
mind to understand that every one of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.310 
mind to understand that every one of
these<00:01:22.050> points<00:01:22.289> of<00:01:22.530> light<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.360> Sun<00:01:24.360> never<00:01:25.229> be

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
these points of light is a Sun never be

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.770 
these points of light is a Sun never be
one<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.470> those<00:01:25.649> Suns<00:01:26.039> has<00:01:26.940> its<00:01:27.149> own<00:01:27.330> solar

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
one of those Suns has its own solar

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.380 
one of those Suns has its own solar
system<00:01:27.950> with<00:01:28.950> planet<00:01:29.670> sized<00:01:29.880> planets

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
system with planet sized planets

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.430 
system with planet sized planets
orbiting<00:01:30.840> around<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.399> those<00:01:32.399> have<00:01:32.610> life

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
orbiting around it those have life

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.300 
orbiting around it those have life
ecology

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:48.499 

and<00:01:40.310> I<00:01:40.430> can<00:01:40.580> even<00:01:40.670> go<00:01:40.790> a<00:01:40.910> little<00:01:41.090> faster

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.560 

now<00:01:49.079> most<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.469> these<00:01:49.619> places<00:01:50.180> I've<00:01:51.180> never<00:01:51.270> been

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
now most of these places I've never been

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:00.529 
now most of these places I've never been
visited<00:01:52.340> many<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.670> never<00:01:53.789> will<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:59.539> over

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
visited many of them never will be over

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:03.319 
visited many of them never will be over
there<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.619> distance<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.909> center<00:02:03.270> of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
there in the distance is the center of

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.809 
there in the distance is the center of
the<00:02:03.450> galaxy<00:02:04.159> that's<00:02:05.159> where<00:02:05.369> we're<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.610> trying

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
the galaxy that's where we're all trying

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.520 
the galaxy that's where we're all trying
to<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:09.630> I'm<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> do<00:02:10.259> something

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
to get to and I'm going to do something

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.490 
to get to and I'm going to do something
really<00:02:10.769> stupid

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
really stupid

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.720 
really stupid
I've<00:02:13.500> just<00:02:13.739> got<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:13.920> pick<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.430> these<00:02:14.549> at

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
I've just got to pick one of these at

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.839 
I've just got to pick one of these at
random<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.390> can<00:02:18.540> go<00:02:18.690> there<00:02:18.930> now<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:20.670> was

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
random and we can go there now this was

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.729 
random and we can go there now this was
okay<00:02:21.330> in<00:02:21.480> rehearsal<00:02:22.019> otherwise<00:02:22.410> it<00:02:22.560> would<00:02:22.709> be

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
okay in rehearsal otherwise it would be

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.479 
okay in rehearsal otherwise it would be
here<00:02:23.099> but<00:02:24.140> if<00:02:25.140> anything<00:02:25.590> horrible<00:02:25.799> goes<00:02:26.220> wrong

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
here but if anything horrible goes wrong

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.699 
here but if anything horrible goes wrong
just<00:02:26.519> keep<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.060> mind<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.540> I've<00:02:28.319> not<00:02:28.530> been

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
just keep in mind that I've not been

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:36.390 
just keep in mind that I've not been
here<00:02:28.860> before

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.390 

cool<00:02:40.810> so<00:02:41.810> here<00:02:41.990> we<00:02:42.110> are<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.470> an<00:02:42.620> undiscovered

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640 
cool so here we are in an undiscovered
solar<00:02:43.760> system<00:02:44.300> probably<00:02:44.990> no<00:02:45.140> one's<00:02:45.290> ever<00:02:45.440> been

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
solar system probably no one's ever been

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.330 
solar system probably no one's ever been
here<00:02:45.800> before

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
here before

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.990 
here before
I<00:02:46.370> could<00:02:46.910> do<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> scan<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:52.280> when<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.550> do<00:02:52.670> you'll

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
I could do a scan and when I do you'll

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.449 
I could do a scan and when I do you'll
see<00:02:53.090> some<00:02:53.390> points<00:02:53.660> of<00:02:53.750> interest<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.980> red<00:02:55.250> one

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
see some points of interest that red one

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:01.660 
see some points of interest that red one
down<00:02:55.670> there<00:02:56.000> is<00:02:56.209> a<00:02:56.660> beacon<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:01.280> I've<00:03:01.370> made<00:03:01.610> it

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
down there is a beacon and I've made it

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.340 
down there is a beacon and I've made it
so<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.030> there's<00:03:02.360> always<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.690> beacon<00:03:03.110> near

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
so that there's always a beacon near

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:18.199 
so that there's always a beacon near
where<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.709> warp<00:03:03.980> in<00:03:04.190> just<00:03:04.459> for<00:03:04.610> this

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.290 

so<00:03:19.209> beacons<00:03:19.810> are<00:03:19.989> where<00:03:20.170> you

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
and and this is the planet that we've

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.870 
and and this is the planet that we've
just<00:03:34.450> found<00:03:34.800> just<00:03:35.800> an<00:03:35.950> alien<00:03:36.340> world<00:03:36.520> that<00:03:36.790> we

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
just found just an alien world that we

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.840 
just found just an alien world that we
found<00:03:37.090> together<00:03:37.450> this<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:37.840> Planet<00:03:38.560> III<00:03:41.850> and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
found together this is Planet III and

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.880 
found together this is Planet III and
it's<00:03:43.090> not<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.720> prettiest<00:03:44.350> planet<00:03:44.739> I've

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
it's not like the prettiest planet I've

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.510 
it's not like the prettiest planet I've
seen<00:03:45.130> better<00:03:45.280> but<00:03:46.770> I've<00:03:47.770> also<00:03:48.010> seen<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.430> lot

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
seen better but I've also seen a lot

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:56.490 
seen better but I've also seen a lot
worse<00:03:49.590> so<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.620> could<00:03:50.860> do<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.069> scan<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:55.320> as<00:03:56.320> luck

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
worse so I could do a scan and as luck

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.350 
worse so I could do a scan and as luck
would<00:03:56.530> have<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.800> there's<00:03:57.040> no<00:03:57.160> alien<00:03:57.519> life<00:03:57.700> but

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
would have it there's no alien life but

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.380 
would have it there's no alien life but
I<00:03:58.390> could<00:03:58.540> show<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.720> this<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.950> every<00:04:00.850> planet<00:04:01.269> in
