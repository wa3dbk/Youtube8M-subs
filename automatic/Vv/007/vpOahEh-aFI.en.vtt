III<00:01:15.460> rook<00:01:16.000> g1<00:01:18.240> yeah<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.450> looks<00:01:19.660> like<00:01:19.870> proper

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
III rook g1 yeah this looks like proper

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.200 
III rook g1 yeah this looks like proper
nonsense

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.940 

you<00:01:27.210> can<00:01:27.330> also<00:01:27.480> just<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:28.110> him<00:01:30.830> after<00:01:31.830> which

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
you can also just take him after which

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
you can also just take him after which
she<00:01:31.980> may<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.370> has<00:01:32.610> queen<00:01:32.940> age<00:01:33.090> five<00:01:34.550> okay<00:01:35.550> let's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
she may be has queen age five okay let's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:46.010 
she may be has queen age five okay let's
just<00:01:36.330> take<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:38.570> continue<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.900> develop

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.870 

this<00:01:47.020> position<00:01:47.259> is<00:01:47.590> is<00:01:48.070> awful<00:01:48.549> for<00:01:48.700> white

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
this position is is awful for white

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.410 
this position is is awful for white
anyway<00:01:49.329> I<00:01:50.250> mean<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.399> structure<00:01:51.909> is<00:01:52.030> just<00:01:52.270> the

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
anyway I mean the structure is just the

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:14.440 
anyway I mean the structure is just the
catastrophe

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.809 

yeah<00:02:15.050> I'm<00:02:15.470> not<00:02:15.709> quite<00:02:15.950> sure<00:02:15.980> how<00:02:16.160> he<00:02:16.370> defends

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
yeah I'm not quite sure how he defends

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.410 
yeah I'm not quite sure how he defends
e6<00:02:17.709> cannot<00:02:18.709> really<00:02:18.950> believe<00:02:19.129> that<00:02:19.370> f5<00:02:20.030> is<00:02:20.269> a

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
e6 cannot really believe that f5 is a

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:28.000 
e6 cannot really believe that f5 is a
booth<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.760> we'll<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.480> six<00:02:26.780> let's<00:02:27.680> let

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
booth so we'll just do six let's let

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.930 
booth so we'll just do six let's let
slow<00:02:28.250> deaths<00:02:28.580> Castle<00:02:28.849> here<00:02:30.250> must<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.459> must<00:02:31.819> be

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
capture first why not it's got no way to

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:55.210 
capture first why not it's got no way to
defend<00:03:37.260> it<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.680> anyway

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
would be made I didn't calculate but

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.280 
would be made I didn't calculate but
when<00:04:41.110> I<00:04:41.140> come<00:04:41.380> on<00:04:41.500> this<00:04:41.710> planet<00:04:42.990> cannot<00:04:43.990> change

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
when I come on this planet cannot change

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.760 
when I come on this planet cannot change
otherwise<00:04:44.910> check<00:04:48.420> so<00:04:49.420> how<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.750> meet<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.470> snow

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
otherwise check so how to meet the snow

00:04:50.770 --> 00:05:02.220 
otherwise check so how to meet the snow
a<00:04:52.890> five<00:04:55.230> yeah<00:04:56.230> a<00:04:56.260> five<00:04:59.880> yeah<00:05:01.230> threatened

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
a five yeah a five yeah threatened

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.600 
a five yeah a five yeah threatened
screen<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.830> to<00:05:02.890> mate<00:05:03.340> and<00:05:03.580> could<00:05:03.910> be<00:05:04.090> four<00:05:04.330> made

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
screen a to mate and could be four made

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.420 
screen a to mate and could be four made
so<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.940> don't<00:05:07.300> think<00:05:07.630> his<00:05:07.930> is<00:05:08.620> able<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.160> defend

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
so I don't think his is able to defend

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:16.680 
so I don't think his is able to defend
that<00:05:14.250> so<00:05:15.250> rook<00:05:15.520> be<00:05:15.730> one<00:05:15.970> that<00:05:16.180> screen<00:05:16.510> a<00:05:16.630> to

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
that so rook be one that screen a to

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.820 
that so rook be one that screen a to
mate<00:05:17.520> check<00:05:18.520> this<00:05:18.700> isn't<00:05:19.090> made<00:05:19.240> us<00:05:19.420> wrong

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
mate check this isn't made us wrong

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.200 
mate check this isn't made us wrong

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
check checkmate don't see that too often
