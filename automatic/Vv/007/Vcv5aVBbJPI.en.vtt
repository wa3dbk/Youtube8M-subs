00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 f3 manufactory company of shame in 1952 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.230
 year began producing 60 cubic 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.240
 motorcycle engine and 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.340
 established itself as a manufacturer 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 Engines are mostly small tooth stroke 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 engines 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.760
 here they also supplied the engine from 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.369
 other motorcycle manufacturers such 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.609
 like miata zebra yamaguchi 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.189
 hikari and varnishes were soon decided 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.219
 let out to taste and 1 which could 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.010
 protect the driver from the weather 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.730
 speech then I was tasked to develop 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.840
 cars he was responsible for the design of the body on 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.989
 nissan motor 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.450
 about before the war and after that he was 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.770
 responsible for car design for 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:55.739
 Simon manufactory 150 cars which 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:58.739
 were built between 1954 and 1955 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 his work was highly respected and he was 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.100
 known as leonardo da vinci in japan 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.510
 right there the cabin was introduced 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.330
 Tokyo Motor Show in 1955 it was 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.000
 beautiful streamlined double compartment on 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.270
 three wheels and he was driven 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.420
 two-stroke engine 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.700
 the engine had only one cylinder 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.650
 engine power was five and a half 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.350
 horsepower and it all allowed 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.829
 accelerate cab pooja to forty five 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.869
 kilometers per hour the construction was 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:38.040
 monocoque she had one hundred and fifteen 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:40.040
 50 centimeters wide and weighed 50 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.619
 points of the temple strengthened 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.590
 cooling pipes through which 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.470
 cool air from outside yielded 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.119
 engine and cooled it 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.030
 the trunk where the engine was also located 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.340
 was the original design consisted of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.330
 two covers that resembled wings 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.730
 Zhukov 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 covers were also developed that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.040
 allowed out hot air 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.720
 I wonder what serial car had 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.660
 just one thing but the auto version on 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.720
 Tokyo exhibition had two doors 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.730
 fastest 2 door was removed for 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.260
 order to make it as cheap as possible 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.360
 the design of the car is small but 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.790
 well designed gretel had 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.270
 reverse gear on the car 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.390
 there was one cyclop on yavara decorating 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.910
 slender nose car role was so 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.680
 let's sort it out in a cramped salon 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.650
 it got even closer 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.410
 until you were inside the car 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.540
 then looking at it from the side was created 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.310
 impression that the car is pretty 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.820
 solider also 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.220
 the interior was covered with thick material 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.560
 isolation of course isolation was only on 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.760
 dashboard and on the sides of everything 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.920
 the rest was bare painted metal 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.640
 front wheels were independent friend 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.040
 from each other and have rubber buffers 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.560
 the rear wheel was mounted on 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.260
 swivel bracket on to the carcass rack 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.680
 all this provided a comfortable ride 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.620
 the car was sold at a different price 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.310
 car cost depended on volume 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.380
 engine and from the trim that's 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.880
 for example avto engineed 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.450
 twenty two dice guys with 60 cost 450 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.360
 dollars car already stocked 250 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.590
 honda cubic motorcycle engine 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.600
 cost 490 dollars buying a car at a price 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:48.330
 for 650 dollars you get completely 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.730
 sheathed interior material for full 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.360
 weather protection 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:57.750
 whether it is hot or cold planned 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:01.500
 release from 400 to 500 units a month but 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.350
 only 85 units were manufactured 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.080
 but this was due to the fact that the plants did not 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.780
 able to work with fiberglass 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.810
 and also because of bad marketing 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.500
 companies at the moment right there cab 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.700
 very rare cars they have only 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.710
 a couple of pieces February 16, 2013 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:29.150
 This car model was sold for 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.150
 126 thousand 500 dollars
