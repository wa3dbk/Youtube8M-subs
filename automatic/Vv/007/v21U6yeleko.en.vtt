00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:01.870
 America because I love the phrase to him 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.699
 he likes it because he likes it and he does it 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.710
 it seems that he looks like he likes 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.410

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.560

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.840

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.159
 the channels when a room figure 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:07.500

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:24.650

 improves the relationship a little and just 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.060
 had to do with all this to see 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.120
 when I want to show this I do not want 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.489
 to show 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.870
 nothing the hocus-pocus from which it was taken 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:36.690
 the theme in the American Chinese program 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.129
 that also warmed me up before 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.170
 can take as a subject that happens 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:43.360
 90% of women when they separate 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.220
 with the food quota with the fight the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.319
 tugging of parents with children with 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.250
 yachts being able to talk about that 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.230
 it was what we want to get 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 they grabbed good too that you can 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.840
 wait for marengo thinking about that
