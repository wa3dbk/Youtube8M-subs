00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 pico is there to for example 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.119

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.119

 now just a variant but it 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.250
 There are really innumerable of them, that is me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.269
 start with a tight stitch and 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:54.320
 two daily air make every day 

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:54.320
 firm stitch through the first fragrance mark 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.879
 and the next solid mesh I do 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.579
 him the next but probably 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.540
 skip this and hunter comes one 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.770
 firm mass then follow again two air 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.070
 then wash a tight stitch again 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 skip through the first air mass 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 we'll go back and so on 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.150

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.150
