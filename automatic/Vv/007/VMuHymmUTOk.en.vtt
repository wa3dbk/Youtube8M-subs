 the classic apple alarm and you have 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.520
 eager to change this is an excellent 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.780

 right we have the active alarm what 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.470
 bad is that it has in the form of purchase 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.180
 integrated something as important as it is 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.950
 put automatic alarms for certain 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.350

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.700
 format not see anymore it's basically a network 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.470
 social where we can see drawings that

 with tools like pencil brush bottle 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.979
 of paint among others the good thing about 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.210
 photoshop sketch with respect to the 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.799
 competition is that it is totally 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.470

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.069
 I become my first choice at the time 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.200
 of calculating things has three points 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.400
 The first one is free and 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.659
 excellent quality 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.310
 It was paid for several years but 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.730
 finally we can get them from the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.860
 app store 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.689
 without paying a penny the second point 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.879
 visually it is impeccable and we can 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.500
 customize the background last not 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.209
 we have to be the same but the same 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.069
 application and performing the operations 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.019
 without us having to give the ok a 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.939
