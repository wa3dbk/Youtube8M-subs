00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
I'm pissed anyway this is obviously on a

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.090 
I'm pissed anyway this is obviously on a
modded<00:00:34.260> map<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.620> there's<00:00:34.829> about<00:00:35.040> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
modded map because there's about a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.889 
modded map because there's about a
billion<00:00:35.430> rocks<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.090> about<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> billion<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
billion rocks and about a billion of

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.130 
billion rocks and about a billion of
those<00:00:37.050> golf<00:00:37.680> tins<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.870> apparently<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
those golf tins and apparently this is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.810 
those golf tins and apparently this is
the<00:00:40.260> first<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:40.890> been<00:00:41.550> made<00:00:41.790> on

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the first one that's been made on

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.049 
the first one that's been made on
completely<00:00:42.480> grass<00:00:42.950> or<00:00:43.950> tins<00:00:44.399> whatever<00:00:44.820> and

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
completely grass or tins whatever and

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
completely grass or tins whatever and
it's<00:00:45.780> actually<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.200> fast-paced<00:00:46.559> it's

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
it's actually really fast-paced it's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.770 
it's actually really fast-paced it's
really<00:00:47.010> fun<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.789> rocks<00:00:47.969> are<00:00:48.090> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> edge<00:00:48.450> I

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
really fun the rocks are on the edge I

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
really fun the rocks are on the edge I
guess<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:52.020> certain<00:00:52.289> spots<00:00:52.590> you

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
guess you know it's certain spots you

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
guess you know it's certain spots you
kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.309> hit<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.550> edge<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.180> slows<00:00:54.420> you

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
kind of hit the edge and it slows you

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of hit the edge and it slows you
down<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:54.750> flips<00:00:55.140> you<00:00:55.260> around<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.370> are

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
down or flips you around but what are

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.979 
down or flips you around but what are
you<00:00:56.520> gonna<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.120> still<00:00:57.420> looks<00:00:57.660> cool<00:00:57.870> and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you gonna do it still looks cool and

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.349 
you gonna do it still looks cool and
it's<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.530> not<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.770> bad<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> drive<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
it's really not that bad to drive on I

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.290 
it's really not that bad to drive on I
got<00:01:00.570> this<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.379> think<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.370> second<00:01:02.789> take<00:01:03.030> and

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
driving on a millipede i guess because

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.500 
driving on a millipede i guess because

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.830 
it's got about a billion legs that's how

he's or what he said at least and the

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.030 
he's or what he said at least and the
only<00:03:10.959> other<00:03:11.109> thing<00:03:11.260> i<00:03:11.470> don't<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.709> about<00:03:11.799> this

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
only other thing i don't like about this

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.849 
only other thing i don't like about this
is<00:03:12.099> that<00:03:12.459> weird<00:03:12.940> ending<00:03:13.329> spot<00:03:13.599> but<00:03:13.900> oh<00:03:14.140> well<00:03:14.560> he

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
is that weird ending spot but oh well he

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.140 
is that weird ending spot but oh well he
got<00:03:15.010> back<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.340> beginning<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.790> map<00:03:15.910> and

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
got back to the beginning of the map and

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.839 
got back to the beginning of the map and
i<00:03:16.299> guess<00:03:16.629> that's<00:03:16.810> all<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.019> really<00:03:17.049> matters

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
i guess that's all that really matters

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.729 
i guess that's all that really matters

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
hills through the middle of it this map

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:24.780 
hills through the middle of it this map
is<00:03:22.989> called<00:03:23.319> a<00:03:23.470> bit<00:03:23.769> screwy<00:03:24.250> and<00:03:24.549> you've

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
is called a bit screwy and you've

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.789 
is called a bit screwy and you've
probably<00:03:24.940> seen<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.329> before<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.169> on<00:03:26.380> i

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
probably seen it before it was on i

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.920 
probably seen it before it was on i
think<00:03:27.459> at<00:03:27.700> least<00:03:27.970> one<00:03:28.180> other<00:03:28.329> channel<00:03:28.750> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
think at least one other channel and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.370 
think at least one other channel and
this<00:03:29.410> starting<00:03:29.769> part<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.569> just<00:03:31.569> awesome<00:03:32.260> i

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
this starting part is just awesome i

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.050 
this starting part is just awesome i
told<00:03:32.620> him<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.859> was<00:03:32.950> majestic<00:03:33.160> he<00:03:33.639> got<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:33.849> kick

out of that so yeah that starting
corkscrew<00:03:36.160> thing<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.459> majestic<00:03:38.010> again<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.310> a

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
corkscrew thing is majestic again on a

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.409 
corkscrew thing is majestic again on a
modded<00:03:39.910> map<00:03:40.090> sorry<00:03:40.569> if<00:03:40.720> you<00:03:40.840> hate<00:03:41.319> it<00:03:41.500> i<00:03:42.419> don't

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
modded map sorry if you hate it i don't

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.030 
modded map sorry if you hate it i don't
know<00:03:43.510> what<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.870> about<00:03:43.989> it<00:03:44.139> but<00:03:44.260> he<00:03:44.799> kind<00:03:45.010> of

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
know what to do about it but he kind of

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.409 
know what to do about it but he kind of
like<00:03:45.250> some<00:03:45.459> men<00:03:45.609> i<00:03:45.760> don't<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.239> have

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
like some men i don't really have

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.339 
like some men i don't really have
anything<00:03:46.630> against<00:03:47.019> him<00:03:47.079> i<00:03:47.200> guess<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:49.349> here

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
anything against him i guess and here

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.650 
anything against him i guess and here
the<00:03:50.500> little<00:03:50.620> trap<00:03:50.950> with<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.340> fusion<00:03:52.150> coils<00:03:52.569> in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
the little trap with the fusion coils in

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.199 
the little trap with the fusion coils in
the<00:03:52.750> mind<00:03:52.989> i<00:03:53.609> slowed<00:03:54.609> down<00:03:54.760> just<00:03:54.819> because<00:03:55.090> i

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
the mind i slowed down just because i

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.520 
the mind i slowed down just because i
didn't<00:03:55.389> want<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.599> have<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.720> try<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.290> do<00:03:56.410> this

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
didn't want to have to try to do this

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.589 
didn't want to have to try to do this
one<00:03:56.709> again<00:03:56.849> this<00:03:57.849> one<00:03:58.000> again<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.359> comes<00:03:58.480> down

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
one again this one again it comes down

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.180 
one again this one again it comes down
to<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> whole<00:03:59.049> modded<00:03:59.560> map<00:03:59.709> thing<00:03:59.950> it<00:04:00.069> just

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
to the whole modded map thing it just

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.920 
to the whole modded map thing it just
kind<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.459> goes<00:04:00.669> and<00:04:01.000> goes<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.180> goes<00:04:01.389> but<00:04:01.780> this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
kind of goes and goes and goes but this

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.360 
kind of goes and goes and goes but this
one's<00:04:02.109> at<00:04:02.260> least<00:04:02.440> more<00:04:02.739> interesting<00:04:03.099> than<00:04:03.220> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
one's at least more interesting than the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.550 
one's at least more interesting than the
last<00:04:03.519> one<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.819> think<00:04:04.139> these<00:04:05.139> rolling<00:04:05.470> hills

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
last one I think these rolling hills

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.830 
last one I think these rolling hills
they<00:04:05.919> dip<00:04:06.340> under<00:04:06.760> water<00:04:07.239> every<00:04:07.540> once<00:04:07.690> in<00:04:07.810> a

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
they dip under water every once in a

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.270 
they dip under water every once in a
while<00:04:07.989> and<00:04:08.260> they<00:04:08.379> go<00:04:08.530> around<00:04:08.650> it<00:04:08.980> uses

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
while and they go around it uses

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.539 
while and they go around it uses
different<00:04:09.459> types<00:04:10.269> of<00:04:10.389> objects<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.340> a<00:04:12.340> little

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
different types of objects and a little

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.740 
different types of objects and a little
bit<00:04:12.669> later<00:04:12.940> we'll<00:04:13.209> get<00:04:13.329> to<00:04:13.480> where<00:04:13.599> there's

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
bit later we'll get to where there's

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.420 
bit later we'll get to where there's
some<00:04:13.870> jumps<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.440> jumps<00:04:14.709> all<00:04:14.829> they<00:04:15.280> work

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
some jumps and the jumps all they work

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.830 
some jumps and the jumps all they work
totally<00:04:15.669> fine

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.210 

this<00:04:19.840> map<00:04:20.020> though<00:04:20.230> definitely<00:04:20.500> really<00:04:20.980> fun<00:04:21.130> to

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
this map though definitely really fun to

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.920 
this map though definitely really fun to
drive<00:04:21.370> on<00:04:21.580> I<00:04:21.820> only<00:04:22.030> did<00:04:22.210> it<00:04:22.270> with<00:04:22.420> three<00:04:22.630> people

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
drive on I only did it with three people

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.270 
drive on I only did it with three people
I<00:04:22.990> didn't<00:04:23.170> want<00:04:23.290> to<00:04:23.320> have<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.470> worry<00:04:23.560> about<00:04:23.830> any

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
I didn't want to have to worry about any

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.600 
I didn't want to have to worry about any
kind<00:04:24.760> of<00:04:24.880> lag<00:04:25.210> or<00:04:26.040> whatever<00:04:27.040> because<00:04:27.190> like<00:04:27.490> I

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
kind of lag or whatever because like I

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.070 
kind of lag or whatever because like I
said<00:04:27.670> pretty<00:04:28.570> long<00:04:28.810> lap<00:04:29.050> time<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:30.150> I<00:04:31.150> don't

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
said pretty long lap time and I don't

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.510 
said pretty long lap time and I don't
know<00:04:32.170> I<00:04:32.350> guess<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.650> didn't<00:04:32.890> have<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.100> patience

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
know I guess I didn't have the patience

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.600 
know I guess I didn't have the patience
to<00:04:33.990> want<00:04:34.990> to<00:04:35.080> take<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.500> million<00:04:36.040> takes<00:04:36.340> on<00:04:36.490> this

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
to want to take a million takes on this

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.070 
to want to take a million takes on this
I<00:04:36.730> think<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:36.970> tried<00:04:37.570> twice<00:04:37.870> or<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.150> this<00:04:40.150> here<00:04:41.050> is

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
I think I tried twice or so this here is

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.250 
I think I tried twice or so this here is
out<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.620> brace<00:04:41.860> larges<00:04:42.400> and<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:43.660> don't<00:04:44.200> know

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
out of the brace larges and I don't know

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.480 
out of the brace larges and I don't know
if<00:04:44.320> he's<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:44.530> first<00:04:44.710> person<00:04:44.860> to<00:04:45.040> do<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.220> but<00:04:45.430> I

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
if he's the first person to do it but I

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.630 
if he's the first person to do it but I
think<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.760> looks<00:04:45.790> really<00:04:46.030> cool<00:04:46.240> oh<00:04:46.420> my<00:04:46.540> gosh<00:04:47.640> I

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
think it looks really cool oh my gosh I

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.280 
think it looks really cool oh my gosh I
don't<00:04:49.270> know<00:04:49.390> driving<00:04:49.720> around<00:04:49.930> it's<00:04:50.170> just

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
don't know driving around it's just

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.230 
don't know driving around it's just
really<00:04:50.410> fun<00:04:50.650> you<00:04:50.800> can't<00:04:51.010> even<00:04:51.070> tell<00:04:51.940> which<00:04:52.090> way

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
really fun you can't even tell which way

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.520 
really fun you can't even tell which way
