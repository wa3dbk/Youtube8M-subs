but<00:02:14.730> I've<00:02:14.880> got<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.150> say<00:02:15.270> guys<00:02:15.480> he<00:02:15.660> feels<00:02:15.870> faster

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
maybe because he's short and he's maybe

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
maybe because he's short and he's maybe
more<00:02:23.100> agile<00:02:23.550> that<00:02:24.000> makes<00:02:24.240> him<00:02:24.390> feel<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.570> little

shooting<00:03:35.610> in<00:03:35.820> general<00:03:36.450> with<00:03:36.600> him<00:03:36.720> was

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
shooting in general with him was

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.170 
shooting in general with him was
terrible<00:03:37.380> but<00:03:37.590> shooting<00:03:38.010> isn't<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:39.030> know<00:03:39.150> a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
terrible but shooting isn't you know a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.600 
terrible but shooting isn't you know a
must<00:03:39.480> for<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.720> centre-back<00:03:40.170> so<00:03:40.350> even<00:03:40.740> though<00:03:40.890> it

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
must for a centre-back so even though it

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.390 
must for a centre-back so even though it
is<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:42.060> weakness<00:03:42.570> I'm<00:03:42.810> not<00:03:43.110> gonna<00:03:43.350> count<00:03:43.500> it<00:03:43.740> as

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
is a weakness I'm not gonna count it as

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.670 
is a weakness I'm not gonna count it as
a<00:03:44.460> weakness<00:03:44.700> towards<00:03:45.450> his<00:03:45.690> final<00:03:46.230> rating

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
a weakness towards his final rating

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.320 
a weakness towards his final rating
because<00:03:47.070> like<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.310> said<00:03:47.370> shooting<00:03:47.940> it<00:03:48.060> really

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
because like I said shooting it really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.480 
because like I said shooting it really
isn't<00:03:48.510> important<00:03:49.230> for<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.440> centre-back<00:03:49.950> but

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
isn't important for a centre-back but

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.430 
isn't important for a centre-back but
