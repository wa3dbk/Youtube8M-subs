00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and I learned about it that well the way

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.670 
and I learned about it that well the way
you<00:01:49.520> play<00:01:50.030> with<00:01:50.330> it<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:50.900> way<00:01:51.110> it<00:01:51.260> turns<00:01:51.470> out

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
you play with it is the way it turns out

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.590 
you play with it is the way it turns out
so<00:01:51.860> if<00:01:51.980> you<00:01:52.100> be<00:01:52.220> evil<00:01:52.700> to<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:53.060> it'll<00:01:53.330> turn<00:01:53.450> out

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
so if you be evil to it it'll turn out

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.870 
so if you be evil to it it'll turn out
you<00:01:53.720> if<00:01:54.320> you<00:01:54.470> treat<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.740> nice<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.730> would<00:01:55.850> be

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
you if you treat it nice it would be

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.800
