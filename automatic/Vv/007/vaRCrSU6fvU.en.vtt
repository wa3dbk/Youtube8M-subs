think is a bit too dark so i think i'd

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.730 
think is a bit too dark so i think i'd
have<00:03:44.320> to<00:03:44.380> mix<00:03:44.820> two<00:03:45.820> shades<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.540> get<00:03:46.720> my<00:03:47.110> shade<00:03:47.470> I

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740
