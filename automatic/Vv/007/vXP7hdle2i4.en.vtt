00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.370
 we do not imagine all that must 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.030
 to undergo a product to be on sale at 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 Brico Depot 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.880
 today I'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.380
 bathroom furniture we all got 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 one day leaning on the door of his 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.190
 building to rise an act in 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 seemingly harmless appearance that may turn out 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.550
 dangerous if not tested well 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.710
 do you think this gesture has a lot 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.539
 others are reproduced and tested in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.539
 a laboratory is security 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.920
 shampoo bottles cream perfumes 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 deodorant our bathroom furniture 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.210
 is full of objects to simulate this 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:43.440
 presence of fish placed in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.149
 every piece of furniture test first test 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.920
 the sudden opening of a drawer 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 it happens that a drawer too strongly 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.690
 solicited get off a flip-flop of 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
 more than 5 kg simulates an opening 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.460
 brutal in order to test the resistance of 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.510
 backstage and this test is carried out ten 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.190
 time 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.050
 by dint of dropping products on 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.479
 a shelf these brackets can let go 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.060
 here the technician is going to drop ten 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.130
 times a plate of a kilo 7 on 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.520
 each package to evaluate their 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520
 resistance 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.960
 to illustrate the weight of a person 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 who use them as support for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.650
 raise the hinges of the doors are 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.900
 faced with nose load tests 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.790
 it's not less than 30 kg that are 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.190
 hanging on the door by actuating it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.470
 many times we test the resistance of 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.899
 eighth in extreme conditions 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.520
 if you want to climb on the basin of 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.970
 his furniture for example to change a 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.830
 bulb 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.039
 we must be sure that this one is going 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.509
 resist 4 jaws of 25 kg are deposited 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.020
 10 x 10 seconds to test the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.310
 resistance that its layer 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.289
 question how long does a piece of furniture 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 bathroom can he resist reason 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.950
 of 5 daily openings in order to 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.750
 test the durability of the hinges and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.660
 slides of the robots reproduce 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.200
 30000 cycle is the equivalent of 20 years 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.200
 of use 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.960
 the use of these robots for 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.510
 perform endurance tests allows 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.500
 to increase the accuracy of the results 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.500
 but also the performance 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.120
 try scratching disassemble brico-deposit 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.590
 also attaches great importance to 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.860
 finishing of his furniture is important 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.480
 finishing by dragging out 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.440
 objects on the surface of our furniture on 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.299
 leave traces 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.700
 we submit a sample to scratches 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:45.819
 of different intensities the result 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.829
 determines the tolerance threshold is for 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.709
 simulate the regular maintenance of a piece of furniture 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.180
 abrasive paper is used 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:57.239
 the sample is deteriorating which allows 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.239
 to measure the wear rate of the coating 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.620
 a furnished daily subject to 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.870
 attacks of surrounding products the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:13.090
 empowered task test measures impact 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:15.430
 tasks on the coating resistance 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 longevity safety room furniture 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.060
 have had to suffer to be here 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.040
 because one thing is sure we do not compromise 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.040
 not with the quality at brico deposit
