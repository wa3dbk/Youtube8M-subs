00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.300
 hello today graved will tell 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.000
 you about the board game Pharaoh code 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.050
 This game will offer you to compete in 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.200
 mathematics in ancient Egyptian scenery 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.779
 box 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.700
 greets us with Egyptian images 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.550
 tombs and inside it is decorated 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.840
 accordingly all components of the game 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 quite strict 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.720
 but very stylish playing field 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.620
 placed in the center of the table all the tiles 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.359
 treasures are divided into 4 groups by color 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.870
 shuffled separately and put into 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:44.739
 pile up all relevant 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.449
 divisions on the field immediately filled 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.960
 one of the players is selected first 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.570
 lead and the game begins lead 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 rolls at the same time three different dice and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.059
 all players try using values 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.910
 on two or three of them and the simplest 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.600
 arithmetic operations get any 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.720
 number 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.190
 specified in the pyramid of pharaoh 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:11.150
 you can use addition subtraction 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.220
 multiplying and dividing the value of each 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.760
 dice in equality can be used 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:20.870
 only once for example 7th 5 plus 1 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.330
 equal to 36 as just one of the players 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.970
 came up with a suitable equality he 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.220
 calls the final number takes 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.700
 matching tile and flips 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.770
 hourglass while time is flowing all 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.050
 the other players are trying to come up 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.560
 other options that would allow 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:42.410
 get another number from the pyramid player 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.950
 also voiced the number itself and takes 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.960
 his tile itself however by default every 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.020
 a player cannot get more than one 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.410
 tylo round as soon as the sand in the clock 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.260
 the end is over and the round is all 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.260
 players who collect tiles voice their 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.130
 equality if she is correct that group 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.790
 puts tail 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.770
 at home if he got the bodies wrong 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.649
 flips face down and 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.769
 means the number of penalty points 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.740
 now the field is updated with new tiles 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:17.690
 and a new round begins and ends 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.360
 game as soon as at least in one of 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.730
 heaps will not give 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.180
 Exactly tiles to fill empty 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.520
 places on the field at this moment every player 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.070
 flips his victory tiles 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.130
 and counts the number of scarabs at 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.240
 them and then subtracts from this number 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.800
 penalty points Pharaoh's code is excellent 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.080
 board game for those who love 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.570
 count in mind and a great incentive 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.480
 learning for those who are not very fond of and 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.150
 for complication, you can remove the restriction 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.060
 on 1 ton l per round and turn this game into 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.060
 the real competition of minds
