degrees<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:48.030> partly<00:02:48.510> cloudy<00:02:48.690> so<00:02:49.230> we'll

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
degrees and partly cloudy so we'll

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.640 
degrees and partly cloudy so we'll
probably<00:02:49.590> go<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:49.950> 14<00:02:50.940> balls<00:02:51.379> if<00:02:52.379> it's
