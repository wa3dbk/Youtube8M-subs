I'm trying to use and i just realized i

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.370 
I'm trying to use and i just realized i
was<00:00:09.269> not<00:00:09.420> taping<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.870> whole<00:00:09.900> time<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.230> just

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
was not taping the whole time I just

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.870 
was not taping the whole time I just
tried<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> make<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.099> second<00:00:11.460> video<00:00:13.639> as<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> can

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.790 
tried to make my second video as you can
see<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:16.560> sitting<00:00:16.920> in<00:00:17.039> my<00:00:17.220> shirt<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.800> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
see it's sitting in my shirt so the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560 
see it's sitting in my shirt so the
stuff<00:00:19.980> around<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.340> neck<00:00:20.520> twice<00:00:20.760> but<00:00:21.180> sitting

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
stuff around my neck twice but sitting

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.060 
stuff around my neck twice but sitting
in<00:00:21.660> my<00:00:21.750> shirt<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.880> I<00:00:24.830> can't<00:00:25.830> believe<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.039> just

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
in my shirt so I can't believe I just

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.920 
in my shirt so I can't believe I just
wasted<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.550> whole<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:26.730> actually<00:00:26.910> took<00:00:27.180> some

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
wasted a whole I actually took some

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.990 
wasted a whole I actually took some
corners<00:00:28.260> very<00:00:28.439> nicely<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.189> better<00:00:29.670> than<00:00:29.880> I'd

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
corners very nicely and better than I'd

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.939 
corners very nicely and better than I'd
ever<00:00:30.029> before<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.570> guess<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.230> camera<00:00:31.529> inspires

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
ever before I guess the camera inspires

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.590 
ever before I guess the camera inspires
but<00:00:32.930> I've<00:00:33.930> got<00:00:34.170> very<00:00:34.590> limited<00:00:35.520> memory<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.390> this

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
but I've got very limited memory on this

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.760 
but I've got very limited memory on this
camera<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.110> just<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.440> take<00:00:37.590> pictures

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

here<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:44.460> should<00:00:45.090> be<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.420> slower<00:00:45.539> than

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
here I should be going a lot slower than

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.360 
here I should be going a lot slower than
