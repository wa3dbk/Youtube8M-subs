 unique French agriculture a world-wide experience on 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.589
 the man the animal he is mature 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:13.570
 soybeans or corn and cotton or genetically 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.570
 changed the considerable implications 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.109
 the agrochemical multinational Monsanto owns 90% of these plants 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.029
 single transgenic lost by the bayern and others challenge the rest 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.239
 genetically manipulated plants can have consequences 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.780
 uncontrollable because our knowledge of the operation of cheonan was 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.970
 incomplete 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.100
 despite these risks 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.770
 young foreigners are inserted into plants they are then 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.770
 used on a large scale with the room 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.870
 at present 90% of these crops are located on the American continent 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.530
 it is in the usa in argentina brazil called calm to restraint 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.880
 but the researchers seem to have forgotten that once in the wild 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.440
 transgenic plants are not under control as it could be 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.000
 in laboratory 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.290
 where it proliferates contaminated objects the genetic heritage of others 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.460
 plants and ends up in the fields of neighboring farmers those who 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.970
 would like to avoid them 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.710
 not 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.340
 agri-foodstuffs while GMOs do not allow farmers 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.460
 improve their performance 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.790
 this argument does not hold water 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.930
 the yields of these crops are not higher than those of the crops 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 more traditional farmers must buy back each year from 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.020
 expensive patented ogm seeds making them totally dependent on 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.030
 multinational seed companies 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.520
 Moreover, multinationals seeking to impose GMO 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.880
 also markets herbicides or insecticides 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.880
 transgenic plants are primarily titers 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.930
 on the boards are tolerant to herbicides and companies have talent 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.280
 also the corresponding index 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.049
 these are the plants themselves produce an insecticide continuously 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.659
 in one case as in the other the process but the mines not only 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.250
 the brain the parasites but also living organisms needed to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.549
 future 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.999
 and as nature adapts pests and weeds more 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:04.999
 not resistant to pesticides 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.390
 consequence the ever more massive use of pesticides ever more 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:11.229
 toxic 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:14.499
 particularly serious repercussions are observable when 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.099
 monoculture 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.079
 in south america for example 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.239
 the rainforest and natural landscapes are destroyed the day after 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.989
 day in favor of the development of monocultures of GM and pasture for 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.989
 cattle breeding 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.460
 adjusted parallel 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.150
 the balances and the water table his handsome too polluted between the pro lobbies 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
 Ogm continues to repeat that GMOs to solve the problem of hunger 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.639
 in the world 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.909
 GMOs are not the solution to the problem 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.959
 we produce enough food but its equitable distribution 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:52.230
 the truth is that ogm cultures are mostly used to feed the 

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:53.459
 livestock 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.800
 and they end up in our supermarkets in the form of beef or 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.799
 dairy products 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.150
 to the list of all its harmful effects on the environment is added a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.139
 tricky question what are the effects of genetically modified organisms 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.549
 on a dwarf and animal health the answer of eads 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.299
 nobody knows anything 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.779
 that's why it's important to educate yourself about the products that 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.779
 you buy 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:32.759
 before 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:36.169
 transforming ways that go well in other words in a laboratory
