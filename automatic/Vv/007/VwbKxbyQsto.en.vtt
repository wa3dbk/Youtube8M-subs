00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the one on the galaxy s4 a bit more

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.260 
the one on the galaxy s4 a bit more
because<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.680> has<00:01:19.710> higher<00:01:20.159> contrast<00:01:20.729> more

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
because it has higher contrast more

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.120 
because it has higher contrast more
vibrant<00:01:21.840> colors<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.979> better<00:01:23.580> viewing<00:01:24.090> angles
