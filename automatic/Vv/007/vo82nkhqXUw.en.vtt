 field distance still is leading the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.330
 platoon there is morandi to the agreement and 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.330
 heap that has the advantage clearly ahead 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.979
 morandi who is leading the pack at 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.080
 the outside avanade gold is third

 while vancouver and is in fourth 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.400
 position the superflex twist is with so 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.020
 you are still trout in the back 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.700

 the plain monceau what better but the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.580
 platoon that is getting closer now under 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.360
 the impulse of morandi with gold avanade 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.700
 outside 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.530
 accompanied by vancouver it and our roles 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.640
 says now has been shifted from the back of 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.990
 plain mound and who now is 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.310
 launched by christophe soumillon but 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.690
 had the rating coming as vancouver 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.520
 was now only old to his 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.350
 turn by stone charles boudot death or 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.610
 living cost-truth for the victory to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.200
 also bonal gold who are trying to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.519
 react and if the room dating back more and 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.880
 more or more completely outside 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:13.710
 other truths 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.600
 it ends well accompanied later 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.040
 pilot sometimes truth that sinks 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.690
 second place maybe for drivers to 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.110
 see with 6 and if he reaches the classes 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.850
 thank you stéphane 2 7 and 3 is the arrival 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.120
 provisional of this price guillaume d'ornano 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.460
 with the success of a great foal 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.780
 vocal talents truth the number 2 which 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.850
 wins fourth consecutive victory 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.530
 for this horse he is ahead of the number seven 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.090
 drivers who wears very well and who 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.890
 allows andré fabre to make a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.860
 paired in this race 3rd place for 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.690
 number 3 6 who is no longer unbeaten 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.740
 but still short 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.450
 remarkably at group level ii and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.470
 fourth place farther for the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.790
 number 9 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.900
 if the only one who made a very beautiful 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.740
 mid-line effort with his 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.570
 thought for a moment that she had 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.740
 seen come worrying a lot truth but 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.020
 he stayed a little bit there anyway 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.670
 what shape what form for andré 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.870
 fabre what form also stéphane for 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.010
 stone charles boudot come ten just 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.360
 before the race he made a shot of 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.960
 yesterday he made a shot of the day before yesterday at 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.680
 vichy it's a jockey who really 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.850
 spent a plateau this year month 78 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.050
 victories this year it's beautiful 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.490
 it's remarkable and then there are 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.320
 important races we talked about taza 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.330
 day tippl also follows who won at 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.800
 gayclic here with vancouver and he climbed 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.810
 worse 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.000
 accelerated perfectible and will prevail 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.830
 remember that the winner was curate 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.910
 with brit account stables of 4 euros 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.780
 fifty pilots could well 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.820
 other people they had a rating 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.110
 high zee was undefeated on the other hand me 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.610
 makes who writes as if to win 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.650
 vincent that interests you the ap 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.610
 but I think you think I 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.350
 think my computer did not have the right 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 place in fact a the fact that there is a 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.220
 horse had to give names that made a 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.350
 great advance a little obliged morandi to 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.970
 bring back the pack is she not the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.500
 better role for him anyway he 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.630
 will have to buy it back right now 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.280
 went to collect the impressions of 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:48.620
 stone charles boudot that must be 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.680

 bucking very good right once we have 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.810

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.600
 feelings outside between them before 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.100
