 Mikhail Isakovsky will tell us about a very 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.189
 curious driven by our football

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.130
 sector rates buy tickets in 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.920

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.539
 not at all 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.549
 probably there is if someone announcements 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.320

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:05.009

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.060
 Luzhniki find your sector is always very 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.470

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.880
 arena but in my opinion what we are looking for 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.079

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:42.860
