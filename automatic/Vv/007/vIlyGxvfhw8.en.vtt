00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello friends, how are you? 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.330
 we believe that we know our 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.360
 neighbor planet Mars there are things that still 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 they escape us and well this video is about 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.390
 those things so do not miss the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.500
 five mysteries of Mars that still follow 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500
 unresolved 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.570
 is one of the questions that still 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.839
 they are unresolved they have in fact been 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.550
 discovered meteorites in Antarctica 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.769
 from Mars with structures 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 that remind us of the microbes of our 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.860
 home but there is still no agreement in the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.180
 scientific community about whether 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 structures are organic or inorganic 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.700
 remember that Mars had an atmosphere 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.430
 before the earth during 1500 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.009
 millions of years which means that the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.909
 life could be developed there even 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.909
 evolve 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.630
 methane is a gas that on earth is 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.510
 produces as a result of life the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 European Space Agency ESA found 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.960
 methane in the atmosphere of Mars and not 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.690
 just that but also seems recent 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.369
 science is still debated if it is 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.420
 coming from volcanic activity 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 I can see there but I still do not know 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.780
 knows 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.790
 until now no water has been found 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.250
 liquid on Mars but it is suspected that 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.670
 there had to be since there are deltas 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.099
 mineral valleys and of course what 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.180
 they seem to be oceans that need 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.209
 water for your training 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.329
 many experts suggest that Mars was 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.670
 once warm however these models 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:27.030
 climate conflicts with 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.090
 the idea that then the sun was much 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.689
 weaker a new hypothesis rises 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.330
 Posing that perhaps the place was more 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:38.830
 very cold and humid 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.310
 remember that I have found myself in 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.130
 some mars images of google art what 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.190
 that looks like a waterfall of water 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.200
 I put in an annotation so that the 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.030
 you can see 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.540
 does this mean that we are 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.390
 hiding the presence of water on Mars 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.810
 and if so, even when you think of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.810
 do what 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.560
 because the northern hemisphere of Mars is 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.290
 so different from the southern hemisphere the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.989
 Northern Hemisphere is a little rugged and 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:22.400
 flat while the southern hemisphere is 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.200
 steep and crowded full of craters a 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.260
 recent hypothesis raises what makes 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.660
 thousands of years something hit against the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.420
 southern hemisphere making you have that 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 orography but it is still an enigma and 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.910
 the hypotheses raised lack of 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.910
 veracity 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.410
 logically it is the Martian mystery that 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.240
 we are most anxious to solve but until the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.730
 date is not resolved 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.610
 we know there are microorganisms called 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.160
 extremophiles that can withstand 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.760
 harsh conditions of Mars and perhaps 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.340
 are in the Martian subsoil but until 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.610
 now it seems that it has not been found 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.970
 nothing 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.190
 if on Mars there were ever oceans is 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.760
 There may have been living organisms 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.470
 and that they survive despite everything 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.180
 but nothing has been found in 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.000
 this sense 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.000
 and well these are the five children over 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 Mars that remain unresolved I hope that 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.430
 you liked it and thank you very much for watching 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.580
 another video of the most paranormal up 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.580
 then
