Nubble<00:02:20.150> crisp<00:02:20.360> on<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.570> side<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.900> doesn't<00:02:21.080> turn

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
Nubble crisp on the side it doesn't turn

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.910 
Nubble crisp on the side it doesn't turn
the<00:02:21.680> when<00:02:22.070> you<00:02:22.220> turn<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.520> drill<00:02:22.820> like<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.480> one

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the when you turn to drill like this one

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.430 
the when you turn to drill like this one
I'm<00:02:24.920> just<00:02:25.130> kind<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:26.530> so<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:28.120> I'm<00:02:29.120> on

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
I'm just kind of there so then I'm on

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.470 
I'm just kind of there so then I'm on
changing<00:02:30.440> this<00:02:30.530> to<00:02:30.590> vertical<00:02:31.040> position<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.700> lab

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
changing this to vertical position a lab

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.790 
changing this to vertical position a lab
is<00:02:32.720> revealed<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:34.390> there's<00:02:35.390> actually<00:02:36.020> ten

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
is revealed and there's actually ten

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.900 
is revealed and there's actually ten
wheels<00:02:38.739> notice<00:02:39.739> there's<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.160> little<00:02:40.400> thing

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
wheels notice there's this little thing

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.830 
wheels notice there's this little thing
right<00:02:41.180> here<00:02:41.980> what<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.640> these<00:02:44.540> two

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
right here what that is is these two

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.100 
right here what that is is these two
little<00:02:45.050> wheels<00:02:45.380> turn<00:02:46.269> one<00:02:47.269> with<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> vehicle

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
little wheels turn one with the vehicle

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.440 
little wheels turn one with the vehicle
so<00:02:48.739> in<00:02:48.890> these<00:02:49.070> little<00:02:49.370> wheels<00:02:49.519> turn<00:02:49.910> this

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
so in these little wheels turn this

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.750 
so in these little wheels turn this
turns<00:02:50.810> which<00:02:51.620> is<00:02:51.830> connected<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:54.760> limit

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
turns which is connected to this limit

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.930 
turns which is connected to this limit
end<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.209> run<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.510> composition<00:02:57.230> see<00:02:58.130> it

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
end of the run of composition see it

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.990 
end of the run of composition see it
will<00:02:59.090> connect<00:02:59.420> with<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.519> because<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.820> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
will connect with that because it to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.339 
will connect with that because it to
spend<00:03:02.540> the<00:03:02.660> other<00:03:02.780> direction

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.770 

and<00:03:07.349> in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> lab<00:03:07.740> though<00:03:08.030> there<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.450> little
