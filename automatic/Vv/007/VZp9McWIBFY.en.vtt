I've been like what are you guys using

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.850 
I've been like what are you guys using
for<00:00:33.100> run<00:00:33.309> real<00:00:33.610> combo<00:00:34.059> so<00:00:34.809> I<00:00:35.079> never<00:00:35.739> thought

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
for run real combo so I never thought

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.560 
for run real combo so I never thought
that<00:00:36.100> was<00:00:36.220> really<00:00:36.399> important<00:00:36.850> but<00:00:37.149> I<00:00:37.210> guess

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
that was really important but I guess

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.110 
that was really important but I guess
some<00:00:38.110> guys<00:00:38.290> didn't<00:00:38.559> want<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.739> know<00:00:38.800> so<00:00:39.579> stay

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
picked it up and plus smooth I haven't

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.850 
picked it up and plus smooth I haven't
even<00:01:19.270> wild<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.780> since<00:01:20.020> I<00:01:20.290> bought<00:01:20.440> it<00:01:20.500> anything

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
even wild it since I bought it anything

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.580 
even wild it since I bought it anything
it's<00:01:21.070> still<00:01:21.310> smooth<00:01:21.580> so<00:01:21.960> big<00:01:22.960> plus<00:01:23.230> on<00:01:23.410> that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
it's still smooth so big plus on that

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.650 
it's still smooth so big plus on that
and<00:01:23.830> I<00:01:23.950> kind<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.280> knew<00:01:24.490> Shimano<00:01:24.970> quality<00:01:25.480> was

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
and I kind of knew Shimano quality was

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.690 
and I kind of knew Shimano quality was
not<00:01:26.470> gonna<00:01:26.680> disappoint<00:01:27.040> when<00:01:27.250> I<00:01:27.280> bought<00:01:27.460> it<00:01:27.580> so

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
not gonna disappoint when I bought it so

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.040 
not gonna disappoint when I bought it so
that's<00:01:27.850> why<00:01:27.940> I<00:01:27.970> spend<00:01:28.240> extra<00:01:28.420> money<00:01:28.510> for<00:01:28.900> it

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
that's why I spend extra money for it

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's why I spend extra money for it
and<00:01:29.530> it's<00:01:29.950> light<00:01:30.220> but<00:01:30.610> it's<00:01:30.730> not<00:01:30.820> super<00:01:31.030> light

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
and it's light but it's not super light

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.780 
and it's light but it's not super light
but<00:01:31.330> it's<00:01:31.720> just<00:01:31.990> light<00:01:32.560> enough<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:33.100> the<00:01:33.610> point

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
but it's just light enough to the point

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.550 
but it's just light enough to the point
where<00:01:33.970> I<00:01:34.000> would<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.600> don't<00:01:34.660> mind<00:01:34.960> carrying<00:01:35.200> this

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
that's the that's the setup to go

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.289 
that's the that's the setup to go
right<00:04:15.840> there<00:04:16.190> okay<00:04:17.190> but<00:04:17.789> it<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.000> fairly

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
right there okay but it is fairly

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.860 
right there okay but it is fairly
expensive<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.900> real<00:04:19.109> was<00:04:19.970> $240<00:04:20.970> and<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
expensive the real was $240 and so I

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.020 
expensive the real was $240 and so I
said<00:04:22.049> the<00:04:22.109> rival<00:04:22.470> 70<00:04:22.830> bucks<00:04:23.009> so<00:04:23.340> all<00:04:23.880> together
