00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
the front here we have down the middle I

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
the front here we have down the middle I
have<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> bunch<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.660> platforms<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.559> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have a bunch of platforms which is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
have a bunch of platforms which is
because<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.280> doesn't<00:00:47.550> exactly<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.969> much

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
because it doesn't exactly have much

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.549 
because it doesn't exactly have much
running<00:00:48.390> around<00:00:48.539> room<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> bottom

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
running around room because the bottom

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.110 
running around room because the bottom
that<00:00:49.739> tanks<00:00:50.010> really<00:00:50.219> small<00:00:50.520> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.760> kinda<00:00:51.030> do

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
that tanks really small so I kinda do

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.450 
that tanks really small so I kinda do
these<00:00:51.239> platforms<00:00:51.620> so<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> branches<00:00:53.160> wouldn't

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
these platforms so the branches wouldn't

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.340 
these platforms so the branches wouldn't
hurt<00:00:53.610> him<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.059> then<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> can<00:00:55.050> see<00:00:55.199> they're

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
hurt him and then you can see they're

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.779 
hurt him and then you can see they're
attached<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:56.219> attached<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.670> some

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
attached actually attached with some

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
attached actually attached with some
really<00:00:57.000> strong<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.480> fishing<00:00:57.930> line<00:00:58.079> type

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really strong like fishing line type

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.139 
really strong like fishing line type
stuff<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> covered<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.820> straying

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
stuff but I covered it with straying

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.029 
stuff but I covered it with straying
first<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.539> all<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.780> he<00:01:00.899> wouldn't<00:01:01.170> run<00:01:01.410> run<00:01:01.800> into

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
first of all so he wouldn't run run into

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
first of all so he wouldn't run run into
it<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.219> hurt<00:01:02.430> himself<00:01:02.550> second<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:03.359> cuz<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it and hurt himself second of all cuz it

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.990 
it and hurt himself second of all cuz it
looks<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.049> lot<00:01:04.140> more<00:01:04.199> natural<00:01:04.739> anyway<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.909> then

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
looks a lot more natural anyway and then

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.060 
looks a lot more natural anyway and then
down<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> bottom<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.439> that's<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.830> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
down here to the bottom is that's just a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.710 
down here to the bottom is that's just a
fluorescent<00:01:08.640> light<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> bottom<00:01:09.570> part

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
fluorescent light to get the bottom part

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.810 
fluorescent light to get the bottom part
of<00:01:09.840> it<00:01:09.960> lighten<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.439> gets<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:10.860> heat<00:01:11.159> then

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
of it lighten it gets a little heat then

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.310 
of it lighten it gets a little heat then
down<00:01:12.060> here<00:01:12.090> let<00:01:12.479> me<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.720> these<00:01:12.900> off<00:01:12.960> these

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
down here let me take these off these

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.899 
down here let me take these off these
are<00:01:13.350> so<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.650> doesn't<00:01:13.799> run<00:01:14.070> into<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> glass<00:01:14.580> as

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
are so he doesn't run into the glass as

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.469 
are so he doesn't run into the glass as
he<00:01:15.060> swims<00:01:15.450> they're<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.470> cover<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> any

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
he swims they're just cover so that any

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.100 
he swims they're just cover so that any
waiting<00:01:18.689> down<00:01:18.810> here<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.110> bottom<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:20.030> have

90<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.030> stand<00:04:01.269> levels<00:04:01.569> about<00:04:01.690> 95

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
90 this so the stand levels about 95

90 this so the stand levels about 95
that<00:04:02.829> he<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.340> same<00:04:03.579> level<00:04:04.139> sand<00:04:05.139> temperature

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
that he the same level sand temperature

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.610 
that he the same level sand temperature
on<00:04:05.799> this<00:04:05.980> sides<00:04:06.280> about<00:04:06.730> 80<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.959> he<00:04:08.200> seems<00:04:08.410> to<00:04:08.560> be
