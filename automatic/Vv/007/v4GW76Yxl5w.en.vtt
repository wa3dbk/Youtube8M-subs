00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 root a samsung galaxy s 4 with the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.480
 version of android 4.3 or with the version 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.090
 of android 4.2.2 that have active knox 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.860
 very important I make this video since 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 some time ago I made one of how to surround it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.230
 with the ceo autoroute and with the odin but 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.630
 if you try to surround the phone with this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.029
 procedure and having active knox to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.210
 the time to test if you have the root os 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.160
 will say that you do not have that permission 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.330
 available that knox has blocked it like this 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.099
 that we have to use this 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.590
 procedure we will see that 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.630
 we need to have to make this 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.879
 simple process first thing we have to 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 have the android version 4.3 is very 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.200
 important we can check it here in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.950
 Android version and I repeat 4.3 or 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.739
 4.2.2 that is after August 2013 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.899
 and that they have active knox you also have 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.420
 have the developer options 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.940
 enabled that is activated by pressing seven 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.309
 times in the active compilation number 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.289
 is this this option that is around here and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.850
 let's connect the phone to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.009
 computer and let's go to the computer 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.650
 well once here on the computer what 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.869
 we will have to do is the following below in 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.909
 the description will leave you a couple of 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.610
 files among which you will find 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.670
 this folder that is a zip the folder is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.619
 v-rod flame if the decompress 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.810
 this file will appear that is a file 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.670
 and installable executable installs it jce and 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.800
 I created this program you see by 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.320
 here what we are going to do is open it 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.000
 and as you can see , this screen appears 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.890
 that will be installed and it will appear 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.480
 a bar that is filling and such 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.070
 you just allow it and once it 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.340
 has filled the bar we jump from this 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.250
 I announce this little panel by the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.530
 phone we give you to accept and as you see 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.050
 is doing an operation in the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.150
 computer has not been detected that we have 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.150
 the galaxy s 4 phone 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.690
 if everything goes well in a couple of seconds it 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.030
 We enable this poster you see by 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.310
 here in green that says root simply 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 we press it and as you see it starts to 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.780
 surround the phone the program is in 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.550
 Chinese really I do not understand the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.530
 options that come but simply 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
 you have to wait until the 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.450
 bar the first time you install it 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.190
 to detect the phone by pressing 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.380
 simply to accept once we 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.540
 what detects us as you have seen 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.120
 right now and we will have to wait for 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.520
 the small screen to the icon 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.770
 put in green the one that says root and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.580
 we hope as you are seeing 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.580
 rotate the phone 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.960
 well once the 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.630
 process as you see the phone is 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.340
 reboot is completely normal if you see 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.710
 that the phone is not reset and that 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.930
 ends the process as now it will happen in 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.520
 the computer simply re-initials 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:59.600
 you can manually pass both 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.600
 here you see is restarting 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.730
 well once rebooted as you have 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.810
 seen we appeared from that little screen 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.599
 we accept 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.060
 and ready as you see by the computer and 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.470
 this screen appears with a tick 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.020
 means that he has surrounded 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.870
 correctly and now we can close 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.849
 the program and let's focus on the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.060
 phone well then we can already 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.890
 disconnect the cable from the computer and what 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.290
 what we should do is the following one 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.640
 Once we have downloaded the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.730
 files that I will leave you below in the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.280
 description that is a folder a zip what 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.130
 you should unzip and move to the root 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.590
 of the very important internal memory of 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.940
 your phone once decompressed 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.769
 the file you will find the 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.560
 next folder that is called m 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.900
 rw is very important is I repeat again 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.540
 that is at the root of memory 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.280
 internal phone well once 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.650
 having this folder that you are 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.900
 seeing in the root of internal memory 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.910
 I repeat for the third time we shall 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.160
 download the terminal application 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.080
 emulator this application will download 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.500
 free google play and again you 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.000
 I will leave 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.269
 to download it below in the description 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.269
 once executed what we must 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.860
 enter are the following commands 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.050
 yes and we press intro 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.389
 As you can see, this screen jumps 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.460
 we accept and we have already given 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.409
 superuser permissions and now we should 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:36.220
 enter the following command that h 

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:39.070
 space 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.370
 bar 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.200
 s kart this command will let down 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:47.610
 in the description so you can see it more 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.610
 clear bar 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.110
 m r w 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.110

 roth point sh the one you are looking at 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.269
 here 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.780
 first we give the south command we press 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:08.150
 enter 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.860
 and we put the following command that you 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.590
 I'll repeat again I'll leave it below in 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:18.120
 the description and now we give to enter 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.310
 as you see executes the command are performed 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.730
 a pair of force closures is totally 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.170
 normal 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.700
 do not worry the phone restarts 

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:30.060
 is what must happen that is 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.370
 produce a pair of forced closures not 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.170
 absolutely nothing happens we wait for 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.170
 the phone restarted 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.340
 and ready once it has been restarted what 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.460
 What we have to do is go to our 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.090
 application drawer 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:52.050
 and we should have this application that 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:54.120

 We have our Samsung Galaxy S 4 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.470
 surrounded so we must do 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.539
 we go over menu or settings here in the 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.669
 third tab and we should continue 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:05.610
 the following configurations below 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:08.150
