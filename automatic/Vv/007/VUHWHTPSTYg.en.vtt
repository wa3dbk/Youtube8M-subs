00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 grenoble wants to prove that he has the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.190
 shoulders to qualify corrected the 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.810
 week spent in bordeaux les isérois 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.490
 receive the leader Clermont and 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.380
 account redeem especially before 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.740
 of entry he pushes the jaunards to the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.240
 fault 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.389
 Julian Caminati passes two penalties 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.520
 against one to morgan parra 6 3 for the 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 fcg but the asn puts the pressure on 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.900
 grenoble and will find the flaw on this 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.939
 balloon recovered in a ruck 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 it's going to be expensive who transmits to score 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.660
 clearly dominated thinks to start 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.940
 shelter on this stanley breakthrough after 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.800
 video arbitration the test is denied for 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 an obstruction of fritz fold 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.790
 the third center line excluded ten 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.989
 minutes for this gesture the asm bros falls 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 then in the discipline 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.940
 and after two failures caminati brings back 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 grenoble to a point back from the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 locker rooms and at 15 against 15 clermont 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.170
 go back to the attacked 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.789
 thiery the big rear furniture at the tables 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.840
 voluntarily in the ball is excluded 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.280
 in turn 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.230
 James Brock takes advantage and passes the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 penalty 9 13 for Auvergne 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.309
 the jaunards when then in the camp 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 Grenoble but does not concretize the fcg 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.019
 it will feed on mistakes 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.019
 Clermontoises 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.010
 it's obviously hard he said 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.080
 it's expensive 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.850
 of marriage 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.680
 clermont is then led by three points 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 the Auvergnats are rushing to the assault for 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.310
 snatch the victory and at the end of a 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.140
 endless fritz action that spends the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 line in goal but the test is denied to 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.100
 the video i jenbacher is sacrificing himself 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.650
 prevents them from flattening grenoble is needed 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.030
 of a breath 16 13 Isérois now 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.730
 fourth of a championship always 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.630
 led by the asn 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.310
 it was good because they are sent 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630
 like dogs it has 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.550
 closed defense was going beautiful corner 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 it shows a bit of value because this 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.360
 discount team we are just fine we 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.710
 is just happy to share with her 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.590
 public it's a cubic whore of 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.390
 sick and alençon this guy is awesome 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.860
 we are going to age in a match just as 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 that captain you see a reaction 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.740
 serious spread in action where it's going 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.270
 be rethought and and that's when we 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.950
 think we're in the nails and then 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 we are waiting for him 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.810
 it's pretty all it's just fabulous 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.869
 did a little trick in garnet carry 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.959
 single women never 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.160
 usually a toy is not won so 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.180
 to use sabah frau wood but 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.620
 I think we lack a bit of realism 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.700
 and pragmatism we see it on the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.110
 last action when we start playing 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.790
 and accelerated consumer we manage to hold 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.140
 the ball over several play times to 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.690
 put the defense in bad 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.040
 well here I take very little 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.090
 concentration time is needed and we take the 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.090
 sargos all completely that
