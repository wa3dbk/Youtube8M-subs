getting them back into the community the
course<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> good<00:00:35.370> balance<00:00:35.550> of

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
course here is a good balance of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.799 
course here is a good balance of
background<00:00:37.350> knowledge<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:38.280> well<00:00:38.489> as<00:00:38.809> nursing

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
background knowledge as well as nursing

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.600 
background knowledge as well as nursing
skills<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:40.379> in<00:00:40.649> first<00:00:41.070> year<00:00:41.190> we<00:00:41.309> learn<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> lot

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
skills so in first year we learn a lot

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.060 
skills so in first year we learn a lot
of<00:00:41.850> anatomy<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> physiology<00:00:42.739> which<00:00:43.739> forms<00:00:44.010> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of anatomy and physiology which forms a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.610 
of anatomy and physiology which forms a
good<00:00:44.190> fundamental<00:00:44.789> basis<00:00:45.149> for<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:46.260> comes<00:00:46.469> in

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
good fundamental basis for what comes in

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
good fundamental basis for what comes in
second<00:00:46.860> year<00:00:46.920> which<00:00:47.100> is<00:00:47.219> mostly<00:00:47.489> patient

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
second year which is mostly patient

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.209 
second year which is mostly patient
assessments<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.070> look<00:00:50.070> after

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
assessments so it's how to look after

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.639 
assessments so it's how to look after
patients<00:00:50.520> who<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.059> ill<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.899> find<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.590> really

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
patients who are ill I find it really

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.430 
patients who are ill I find it really
interesting<00:00:52.879> doing<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> practicals<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.899> the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
interesting doing the practicals in the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.770 
interesting doing the practicals in the
clinical<00:00:55.920> labs<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.660> one

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
clinical labs like here and that was one

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
clinical labs like here and that was one
of<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> main<00:00:58.109> reasons<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.859> came<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.520> this

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
of the main reasons I came to this

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.729 
of the main reasons I came to this
university<00:00:59.760> as<00:01:00.480> well<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:01.079> was<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.379> they

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
university as well it was because they

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.870 
university as well it was because they
have<00:01:01.920> wars<00:01:02.520> that<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.120> work<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:04.400> it's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.610> an

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
have wars that you can work on it's a an

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.840 
have wars that you can work on it's a an
emergency<00:01:06.619> critical<00:01:07.619> situation<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
emergency critical situation and you

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
emergency critical situation and you
have<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> simulate<00:01:09.720> everything<00:01:10.710> from

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
have to simulate everything from

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.590 
have to simulate everything from
assessing<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> patient<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.240> cooling<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
assessing the patient to cooling the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.249 
assessing the patient to cooling the
doctor<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.939> really<00:01:15.479> intense<00:01:16.049> it

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
doctor and it's it's really intense it

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.890 
doctor and it's it's really intense it
kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.950> over<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.490> in<00:01:17.820> sort<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.570> five

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
kind of it's over in in sort of five

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.280 
kind of it's over in in sort of five
minutes<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.070> think<00:01:21.320> let<00:01:22.320> me<00:01:22.380> go<00:01:22.530> again<00:01:22.650> I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
minutes and you think let me go again I

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.600 
minutes and you think let me go again I
think<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.560> there'll<00:01:25.860> always<00:01:25.979> be<00:01:26.100> things

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
think that there'll always be things

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.670 
think that there'll always be things
that<00:01:26.790> kind<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.360> you're<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.810> confident<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
that kind of you're not confident in so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.950 
that kind of you're not confident in so

got to see some really interesting

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.539 
got to see some really interesting
procedures<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:46.770> majority<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.189> teachers

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
procedures the majority of teachers

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.340 
procedures the majority of teachers
practice<00:01:47.909> still<00:01:48.149> so<00:01:48.689> everything's<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
practice still so everything's up to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
practice still so everything's up to
date<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.890> still<00:01:50.159> know<00:01:50.310> all<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> kind<00:01:50.820> of

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
first-year and learning it for has been

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.220 
first-year and learning it for has been
very<00:02:20.470> hard<00:02:20.770> but<00:02:21.460> incredibly<00:02:22.210> rewarding<00:02:22.630> and

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
very hard but incredibly rewarding and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.950 
very hard but incredibly rewarding and
I've<00:02:24.160> loved<00:02:24.610> every<00:02:24.880> minute<00:02:25.180> of<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.750> haven't

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.630 
I've loved every minute of it I haven't
had<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> day<00:02:26.350> when<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> thought<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.490> I'm

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
had a day when I thought but I'm

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.820 
had a day when I thought but I'm
definitely<00:02:27.820> in<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.120> wrong<00:02:28.240> profession

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
definitely in the wrong profession

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.870 
definitely in the wrong profession
so<00:02:29.830> if<00:02:29.950> someone<00:02:30.220> said<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.400> me<00:02:30.550> they<00:02:30.790> were

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
so if someone said to me they were

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.010 
so if someone said to me they were
thinking<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.270> studying<00:02:31.540> nursing<00:02:31.720> at

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370

them<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.260> my<00:02:35.260> experience<00:02:35.650> here<00:02:35.830> has<00:02:35.860> been

in<00:02:36.790> terms<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.620> location<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.670> learning

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
in terms of the location the learning

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.550 
in terms of the location the learning
but<00:02:40.450> also<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.780> placements<00:02:41.290> have<00:02:41.440> been

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
