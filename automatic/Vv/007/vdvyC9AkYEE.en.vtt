00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.450
 very good that such I am k but 399 and here 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.640
 We are in a video tutorial of 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.580
 minecraft to install the mode 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:14.599
 electric age for versions 1.7 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.790
 point 2 and 1 point 7.10 good in the link 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.519
 in the description I will leave the link 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.680
 for this minecraft form page in the 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:26.160
 who will find 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.560
 some information regarding the mod 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.230
 It's in English but hey 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.800
 for the download they go here to down load 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:40.230
 and you will see that there are different versions 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.230
 we will click on the 1.7 points 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.750
 in case you do not know it logically 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.540
 will need the fork with the 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.970
 corresponding version of minecraft 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:56.510
 to be able to operate this mod 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:59.640
 anyway I made a video of how 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.480
 how to install it so I'll leave you a 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.680
 link for if they have any problem 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.840
 good on this page of git hub 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.720
 are the different versions that are 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.780
 have published for 1.7 point 2 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.780
 the same file as the mod 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.390
 it serves them both for the 1.7 points 2 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.270
 as for the 1,110 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.840
 they go here and here they have different 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.210
 old versions but this would be the 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.510
 most recent give it here and they would start 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.220
 download directly here below me 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.229
 I give him to refuse because I already have it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.229
 here good once they have 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.740
 downloaded we can go through the 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740
 installation 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 is this file will copy it will go to the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 minecraft point folder in update 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.550
 roaming and will go to the mod file if you do not 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.990
 they have 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.079
 they create it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.000
 and they copy it in here once 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:05.210
 have done this because we are going to the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.189
 profile version in the profile 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 we put the version of the force in which 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.110
 I think we want to put if they have gone down 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.860
 the 1.7 point days then they have to put 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.860
 with this version 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.750
 start the game and we will see that everything 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.620
 has come out correctly and that there is no 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.269
 no problem 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.269
 we wait here to load 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.719
 OK, perfect 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.440
 we create a world 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:50.000
 good anything any doubt that 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.990
 they have extreme and recently climbs them 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.990
 the tutorial 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.599
 and I think that in the tutorial it is understood 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.840
 in most things it's pretty 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.819
 good and good this is we all see each other very 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.079
