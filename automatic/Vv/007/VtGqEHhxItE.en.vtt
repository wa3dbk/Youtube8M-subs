 being the only thing I have to say thank you 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.960
 I already started 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.380
 I think if it was not everyone's current 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.280
 of Brazilians and all the fans 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.330
 together with me and I think 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.610
 I do not know what would have happened. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.240
 but thanks to god Felipe were also of the year this is what matters more than 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.480
 all 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.839
 and what matters is that people 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.499
 still intense 

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:15.669
 However this twist in this chain that Brazil is doing I know that goes 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.569
 increase much more 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.049
 p soon it goes 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.139
 will leave here from the village isabel 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.629
 ef 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.429
 No lieutenant to repeat in faith 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.559
 what 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:29.700
 shortly 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.700
 the winner and again the red yellow helmet stand 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:34.249
 it goes away 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.539
 very good 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.250
 is to have the race because if you make the decision 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.349
 d 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.989
 send this message to Brazil what I think the worst thing in the world and 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.250
 people do not have news and I think all the affection everything that arrives for us 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:54.090
 by letter by message for everything they say my family tells the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.409
 people who enter Brazil with such 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.319
 I think the least we can do to thank all this 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.480
 energy all this offer from that moment when everyone became more worried 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:09.549
 It's the least we can do is thank 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:14.969
 and as the same dudu spoke first of all thank you that he left this click here 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:18.549
 team he will recover we also received mainly 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.380
 mainly because above all else 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.179
 is he took Philip out of a situation that 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:27.169
 could have been fatal 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.239
 and I think inside it tito of the fatality of what happened 

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:32.999
 on the escape the robbers 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:36.519
 luck inside that he was very lucky because he is
