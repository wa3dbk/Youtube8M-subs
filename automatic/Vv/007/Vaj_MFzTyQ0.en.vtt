this<00:02:33.590> lid<00:02:33.890> and<00:02:34.130> now<00:02:34.849> put<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.209> flame<00:02:35.480> on<00:02:35.720> high

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
this lid and now put the flame on high

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.940 
this lid and now put the flame on high
and<00:02:37.150> give<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.269> two<00:02:38.660> whistles<00:02:39.080> on<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.769> high

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
and give it two whistles on this high

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.680 
and give it two whistles on this high
flame<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.340> then<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:40.819> turn<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.120> off

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.210 

the<00:02:47.690> steam<00:02:47.990> has<00:02:48.290> escaped<00:02:48.740> this<00:02:48.950> pressure

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
the steam has escaped this pressure

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.050 
the steam has escaped this pressure
cooker<00:02:49.430> completely<00:02:50.380> cooled<00:02:51.380> down

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.090 

and<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.780> can<00:02:54.990> see<00:02:55.200> how<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.440> carrots<00:02:55.920> have

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and you can see how the carrots have

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.150 
and you can see how the carrots have
cooked<00:02:56.340> down<00:02:56.640> they've<00:02:57.270> become<00:02:57.420> softer<00:02:58.160> see

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
cooked down they've become softer see

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
cooked down they've become softer see
I'll<00:02:59.490> just<00:02:59.760> pass<00:03:00.510> it<00:03:00.750> through<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.290> can<00:03:01.530> see

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.400 

so<00:03:07.180> now<00:03:07.330> this<00:03:07.569> has<00:03:07.780> cooled<00:03:08.020> down<00:03:08.140> completely

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
so now this has cooled down completely

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.240 
so now this has cooled down completely
and<00:03:09.250> I'm<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.120> blend<00:03:10.989> it<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.800> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
and I'm just going to blend it and you

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.500 
and I'm just going to blend it and you
shouldn't<00:03:12.520> be<00:03:12.580> blending<00:03:13.060> things<00:03:13.239> when

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
shouldn't be blending things when

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
shouldn't be blending things when
they're<00:03:13.690> hot<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.110> know<00:03:14.230> never<00:03:14.530> do<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.830> the

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
they're hot you know never do that the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.770 
they're hot you know never do that the
liquids<00:03:15.400> just<00:03:15.819> wait<00:03:16.000> for<00:03:16.180> them<00:03:16.300> to<00:03:16.390> cool<00:03:16.540> down

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
liquids just wait for them to cool down

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:26.340 
liquids just wait for them to cool down
little<00:03:17.410> bit<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.650> patience

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.100 

so<00:03:27.350> this<00:03:27.560> is<00:03:27.740> all<00:03:27.950> blended<00:03:28.520> together<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:29.720> what

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
so this is all blended together and what

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.020 
so this is all blended together and what
I'm<00:03:30.200> going<00:03:30.380> to<00:03:30.440> do<00:03:30.680> now<00:03:30.920> is<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.370> add<00:03:31.580> a<00:03:31.820> little

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
I'm going to do now is to add a little

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.790 
I'm going to do now is to add a little
bit<00:03:32.150> more<00:03:32.450> flavor<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.020> if<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.350> look<00:03:33.530> at<00:03:33.710> it

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
bit more flavor to it if you look at it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.280 
bit more flavor to it if you look at it
right<00:03:34.010> now<00:03:34.070> it's<00:03:34.670> still<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> bit<00:03:35.210> pulpy<00:03:35.750> so<00:03:36.200> I'm

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
right now it's still a bit pulpy so I'm

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.620

gonna<00:03:36.470> add<00:03:36.650> some<00:03:36.680> more<00:03:36.980> coconut<00:03:37.460> milk<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.480> give
