00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
700 watts and that's funny maybe 80

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.979 
700 watts and that's funny maybe 80
percent<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.340> time<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.940> will<00:00:33.120> only

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
percent of the time and this will only

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
percent of the time and this will only
work<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> backup<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.579> that's<00:00:35.850> why<00:00:36.059> it<00:00:36.120> says

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
work as a backup so that's why it says

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.750 
work as a backup so that's why it says

out of the bag Kukui room one to two
degrees<00:01:02.489> goes<00:01:03.390> through<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> filter<00:01:03.949> the

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
degrees goes through a filter the

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.710 
degrees goes through a filter the
pressure<00:01:05.189> used<00:01:05.430> in<00:01:05.549> refrigerator<00:01:06.090> pushes<00:01:06.600> it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pressure used in refrigerator pushes it

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
pressure used in refrigerator pushes it
down<00:01:06.750> through<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.110> coil<00:01:07.409> system<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
down through a coil system that's on the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.940 
down through a coil system that's on the
outside<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.570> tank<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.590> see<00:01:10.710> by<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
outside of the tank you can see by the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.609 
outside of the tank you can see by the
diagram<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.030> there's<00:01:12.780> no<00:01:12.840> calcium<00:01:13.409> build

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
diagram here so there's no calcium build

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.740 
diagram here so there's no calcium build
up<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.220> tanks<00:01:14.880> made<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.180> fiberglass

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
up because that tanks made of fiberglass

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.270 
up because that tanks made of fiberglass
which<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.049> great<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.500> could<00:01:16.770> add<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> few<00:01:16.979> more

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
which is great to could add a few more

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.999 
which is great to could add a few more
years<00:01:17.430> on<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.439> this<00:01:19.439> thing<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> wonderful

years on to it this thing is wonderful
it's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.509> changed<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> modes<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.100> here

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
it's a it changed the modes in here

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
it's a it changed the modes in here
making<00:01:23.850> more<00:01:23.970> energy-efficient<00:01:24.630> depending

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
making more energy-efficient depending
