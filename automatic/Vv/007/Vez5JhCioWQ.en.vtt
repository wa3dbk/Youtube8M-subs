the graphics they're still bad the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.389 
the graphics they're still bad the
characters<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> way<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.100> walk

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
characters look at the way the walk

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:43.190 
characters look at the way the walk
people<00:01:36.360> do<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.539> walk<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:42.960> what's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
worse is the movement of the characters

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.029 
worse is the movement of the characters
