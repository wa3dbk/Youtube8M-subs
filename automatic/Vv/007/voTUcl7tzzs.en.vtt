00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
named Barrett and so what I've done

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.650 
named Barrett and so what I've done
already<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:14.219> have<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.540> supplement<00:00:15.540> my

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
already is I've I have a supplement my

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480 
already is I've I have a supplement my
health<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:16.080> some<00:00:16.199> painkillers<00:00:16.830> and<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:17.220> cyber

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
health with some painkillers and a cyber

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.150 
health with some painkillers and a cyber
Bruce<00:00:17.730> bone<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.900> got<00:00:19.050> nipped<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> 125<00:00:19.890> you

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
Bruce bone and I got nipped to 125 you

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
Bruce bone and I got nipped to 125 you
get<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.550> shot<00:00:21.000> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> way<00:00:21.300> running<00:00:21.570> over<00:00:21.689> here

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
get a shot on the way running over here

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.380 
get a shot on the way running over here
but<00:00:22.560> my<00:00:22.710> strategy<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:23.550> using<00:00:24.150> these

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
but my strategy is basically using these

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
but my strategy is basically using these
barrels<00:00:24.900> scatter<00:00:25.619> around<00:00:25.740> them<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> your

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
barrels scatter around them to your

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.269 
barrels scatter around them to your
advantage<00:00:26.720> because<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.019> do<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.619> have<00:00:28.800> any<00:00:28.980> guns

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
advantage because I do not have any guns

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.240 
advantage because I do not have any guns
for<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.730> level<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:31.230> was<00:00:31.710> completely<00:00:32.070> out<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
for this level I was completely out of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.090 
for this level I was completely out of
my<00:00:32.759> time<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> reach<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.570> boss<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.410> had<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
my time I reach this boss so I had to

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
my time I reach this boss so I had to
rely<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.670> revolver<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.480> these<00:00:36.660> barrels

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
rely on this revolver and these barrels

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.160 
rely on this revolver and these barrels
so<00:00:37.950> as<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.879> what<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.149> did<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
so as you see what I did is that you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.470 
so as you see what I did is that you
have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.379> go<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.040> run<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.090> barrels

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
have to go over and run to the barrels

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.990 
have to go over and run to the barrels
the<00:00:42.960> first<00:00:43.530> barrel<00:00:43.800> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> left<00:00:44.190> pick<00:00:44.789> up<00:00:44.910> as

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the first barrel on the left pick up as

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
the first barrel on the left pick up as
much<00:00:45.210> crap<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.110> around<00:00:46.289> that<00:00:46.710> box<00:00:46.980> on

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
much crap as you can around that box on

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
much crap as you can around that box on
the<00:00:47.370> top<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.289> wait<00:00:49.289> for<00:00:49.500> him<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> come<00:00:49.800> over

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the top and wait for him to come over

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.490 
the top and wait for him to come over
and<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.219> can<00:00:50.340> throw<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> barrel<00:00:50.820> at<00:00:50.910> him

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
and you can throw the barrel at him

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.350 
and you can throw the barrel at him
next<00:00:52.500> after<00:00:52.770> he's<00:00:53.460> stunned<00:00:53.820> from<00:00:54.030> getting<00:00:54.270> hit

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
next after he's stunned from getting hit

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090 
next after he's stunned from getting hit
by<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> barrel<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:54.960> run<00:00:55.260> over<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> pick

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
by the barrel you can run over and pick

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.380 
by the barrel you can run over and pick
up<00:00:56.219> another<00:00:56.489> barrel<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.910> throw<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.270> him

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
up another barrel and throw it at him

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.049 
up another barrel and throw it at him
now<00:00:58.170> we're<00:00:58.710> back<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.309> real<00:00:59.489> time<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.879> went

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
now we're back into real time we went

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.880 
now we're back into real time we went
over<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.690> here's<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.109> more<00:01:01.289> health

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
over here you here's and more health

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.280 
over here you here's and more health
supplements<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:02.730> box<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:04.080> pick<00:01:04.199> up

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
supplements at that box you can pick up

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.520 
supplements at that box you can pick up
the<00:01:04.409> third<00:01:04.650> barrel<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.420> throw<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> at<00:01:06.630> him<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the third barrel and throw it at him the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
the third barrel and throw it at him the
key<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:08.040> strategy<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.420> rush

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
key to this strategy is to not to rush

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.700 
key to this strategy is to not to rush
if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.520> rush<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:12.630> he's<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.320> shoot<00:01:13.530> the

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
if you rush then he's going to shoot the

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
if you rush then he's going to shoot the
barrel<00:01:14.010> if<00:01:14.159> he<00:01:14.580> shoots<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.030> barrel<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.900> you

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
barrel if he shoots the barrel then you

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160 
barrel if he shoots the barrel then you
get<00:01:16.259> hit<00:01:16.530> by<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.130> big<00:01:17.580> explosion<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.900> why<00:01:19.110> don't

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
get hit by a big explosion now why don't

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.749 
get hit by a big explosion now why don't
you<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> be<00:01:19.740> hit<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:19.920> every<00:01:20.220> disclosure

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you want to be hit by every disclosure

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.260 
you want to be hit by every disclosure
well<00:01:21.650> first<00:01:22.650> off<00:01:22.890> that's<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.729> generally<00:01:24.119> not

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
well first off that's just generally not

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.100 
well first off that's just generally not
a<00:01:24.330> good<00:01:24.450> idea

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
a good idea

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.580 
a good idea
second<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.280> die<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.630> guess<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> Tison

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
second you die and I guess the Tison

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.280 
second you die and I guess the Tison
with<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.009> generally<00:01:29.340> knocking<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> idea<00:01:30.299> so

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
with it generally knocking the idea so

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.929 
with it generally knocking the idea so
right<00:01:31.680> about<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.159> got<00:01:32.430> into<00:01:32.610> some<00:01:32.759> trouble

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
right about here I got into some trouble

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.080 
right about here I got into some trouble
because<00:01:33.770> I<00:01:34.770> thought<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.430> might<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.790> able<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
because I thought I might be able to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.640 
because I thought I might be able to
finish<00:01:36.270> off<00:01:36.509> with<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.780> revolver<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.409> just

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
finish off with the revolver but I just

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
finish off with the revolver but I just
wasn't<00:01:37.950> able<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.509> panicked<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.020> tried

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
wasn't able to and I panicked and tried

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.179 
wasn't able to and I panicked and tried
to<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.560> at<00:01:40.740> what<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:40.950> left<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:43.350> looked
