flash<00:03:48.390> this<00:03:48.630> rom<00:03:57.170> performance<00:04:02.120> so<00:04:03.120> sir<00:04:03.300> here

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
flash this rom performance so sir here

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.410 
flash this rom performance so sir here
so<00:04:04.680> my<00:04:04.800> maximum<00:04:05.310> cpu<00:04:05.850> speed<00:04:06.030> is<00:04:06.420> 15<00:04:06.810> 16<00:04:07.230> here

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
so my maximum cpu speed is 15 16 here

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.810 
so my maximum cpu speed is 15 16 here
I'd<00:04:09.420> actually<00:04:09.810> have<00:04:10.020> to<00:04:10.260> be<00:04:10.350> running<00:04:10.740> or<00:04:11.580> here

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
I'd actually have to be running or here

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.290 
I'd actually have to be running or here
actually<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.270> here<00:04:12.540> here<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.020> I'll<00:04:13.110> do<00:04:13.320> is

actually in here here what I'll do is

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.120 
actually in here here what I'll do is
switch<00:04:15.300> over<00:04:15.630> to<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.960> developer<00:04:16.560> options<00:04:17.040> and

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
switch over to the developer options and

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.650 
switch over to the developer options and
there<00:04:20.130> are<00:04:20.250> some<00:04:20.430> really<00:04:20.820> really<00:04:21.120> cool<00:04:21.420> stuff

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
there are some really really cool stuff

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.000 
there are some really really cool stuff
in<00:04:21.870> here<00:04:21.930> like<00:04:22.410> show<00:04:22.950> cpu<00:04:23.460> usage<00:04:23.670> and<00:04:24.570> now<00:04:25.010> get

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
in here like show cpu usage and now get

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.820 
in here like show cpu usage and now get
this<00:04:26.160> little<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.880> slower<00:04:27.690> cpu<00:04:27.930> your<00:04:28.350> such<00:04:28.530> thing

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
this little a slower cpu your such thing

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.230 
this little a slower cpu your such thing
there<00:04:28.980> oh<00:04:29.160> wait<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.610> doesn't<00:04:29.700> show<00:04:30.030> me<00:04:30.150> the

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
there oh wait that doesn't show me the

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.400 
there oh wait that doesn't show me the
clock<00:04:30.480> speed<00:04:32.990> well<00:04:33.990> still<00:04:34.880> let's<00:04:36.110> try<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.260> with

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
clock speed well still let's try it with

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.940 
clock speed well still let's try it with
that<00:04:37.940> and<00:04:38.940> let's<00:04:38.970> see<00:04:39.510> now<00:04:39.720> if<00:04:39.870> i<00:04:40.020> tap<00:04:40.650> that<00:04:42.950> ok

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
that and let's see now if i tap that ok

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.540 
that and let's see now if i tap that ok
hey<00:04:45.740> wasn't

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.830 

okay<00:04:52.550> that<00:04:53.120> looks<00:04:53.150> like<00:04:53.450> I<00:04:53.540> didn't<00:04:53.720> have

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
okay that looks like I didn't have

00:04:53.840 --> 00:05:21.070 
okay that looks like I didn't have
enough<00:04:54.020> memory<00:04:54.260> to<00:04:54.380> keep<00:04:54.590> it<00:04:54.710> running

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.840 

so<00:05:22.080> this<00:05:22.260> may<00:05:22.440> take<00:05:22.680> a<00:05:22.740> moment<00:05:23.010> and<00:05:23.370> you'll<00:05:23.760> be

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
so this may take a moment and you'll be

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.340 
so this may take a moment and you'll be
able<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.090> see<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.330> startup<00:05:24.690> performance<00:05:25.200> of

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
able to see the startup performance of

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.660 
able to see the startup performance of
that<00:05:25.500> oh<00:05:25.680> is<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.220> loading<00:05:26.760> me<00:05:26.910> already<00:05:28.040> okay<00:05:29.040> so

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:29.670 
that oh is it loading me already okay so
