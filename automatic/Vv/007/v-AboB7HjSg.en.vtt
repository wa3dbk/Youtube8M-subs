00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
all right let's take a look at this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.310 
all right let's take a look at this
street<00:00:07.589> joke<00:00:07.919> again<00:00:08.250> sometimes<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.660> need<00:00:10.260> to

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
street joke again sometimes you need to

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.560 
street joke again sometimes you need to
be<00:00:10.710> more<00:00:10.980> worried<00:00:11.340> about<00:00:11.400> being<00:00:11.849> fast<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
be more worried about being fast and

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.660 
be more worried about being fast and
effective<00:00:13.110> than<00:00:13.259> being<00:00:13.440> technical<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.219> by

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
effective than being technical and by

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.279 
effective than being technical and by
technical<00:00:15.150> I<00:00:15.269> mean<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> way<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.049> fight

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
technical I mean the way that we fight

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.650 
technical I mean the way that we fight
other<00:00:16.529> train<00:00:16.890> guys<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.460> the<00:00:17.580> Academy

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
other train guys in the Academy

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.980 
other train guys in the Academy
a<00:00:18.690> lot<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.100> fast<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.210> stronger

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a lot of the the fast and and stronger

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
a lot of the the fast and and stronger
self-defense<00:00:22.529> techniques<00:00:22.949> are<00:00:23.070> being<00:00:23.250> lost

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
self-defense techniques are being lost

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
self-defense techniques are being lost
because<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.029> emphasis<00:00:24.480> on<00:00:24.630> sport<00:00:24.960> fighting<00:00:25.320> a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
because the emphasis on sport fighting a

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.099 
because the emphasis on sport fighting a
lot<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.099> these<00:00:26.189> techniques<00:00:26.609> won't<00:00:27.269> work<00:00:27.930> in

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
lot of these techniques won't work in

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
lot of these techniques won't work in
the<00:00:28.230> academy<00:00:28.710> against<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.070> Ranger<00:00:29.429> Jitsu

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the academy against that Ranger Jitsu

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.490 
the academy against that Ranger Jitsu
guy<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.359> he<00:00:30.510> knows<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> defenses

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
guy because he knows all the defenses

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.200 
guy because he knows all the defenses
and<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.710> know<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.099> holes<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:33.090> at<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and you know the holes are but at the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.360 
and you know the holes are but at the
same<00:00:33.450> time<00:00:33.750> they<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.140> be<00:00:34.380> faster<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.130> more

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
same time they can be faster and more

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
same time they can be faster and more
direct<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.630> believe<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:37.050> making

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
direct so I really believe in making

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.170 
direct so I really believe in making
sure<00:00:37.350> people<00:00:37.829> learn<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.250> material<00:00:38.460> before

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
sure people learn this material before

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.990 
sure people learn this material before
they<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:39.870> into<00:00:40.469> more<00:00:41.309> technical<00:00:41.520> choke

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
they go into into more technical choke

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.130 
they go into into more technical choke
so<00:00:42.120> we'll<00:00:42.239> look<00:00:42.360> at<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.809> difference

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
so we'll look at some of the difference

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.180 
so we'll look at some of the difference
here<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> main<00:00:44.010> idea<00:00:44.040> here<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.789> I'm<00:00:44.940> if<00:00:45.780> I

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
here but the main idea here is I'm if I

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
here but the main idea here is I'm if I
face<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> guy<00:00:47.489> who's<00:00:47.760> bigger<00:00:48.059> stronger<00:00:48.480> more

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
face a guy who's bigger stronger more

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.869 
face a guy who's bigger stronger more
aggressive<00:00:49.379> but<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.680> trained<00:00:50.399> that's<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
aggressive but not trained that's the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
aggressive but not trained that's the
beginning<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.329> self-defense<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> use

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
beginning of self-defense and I can use

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.619 
beginning of self-defense and I can use
these<00:00:52.949> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> moves<00:00:53.460> as<00:00:53.640> he<00:00:53.760> pushes<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.239> me<00:00:54.420> I

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
these kind of moves as he pushes on me I

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.920 
these kind of moves as he pushes on me I
want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> get<00:00:55.289> behind<00:00:55.739> him<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.579> pop<00:00:57.210> his<00:00:57.449> hips<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
want to get behind him I pop his hips to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.240 
want to get behind him I pop his hips to
get<00:00:58.079> his<00:00:58.170> hips<00:00:58.350> four<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.710> pull<00:00:58.949> his<00:00:59.070> head

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
get his hips four and I pull his head

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.580 
get his hips four and I pull his head
back<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.670> want<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.090> be<00:01:00.210> careful<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.379> more

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
back I want to be careful but the more

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.560 
back I want to be careful but the more
his<00:01:01.710> head<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.039> going<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.359> better

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
his head is going like this the better

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
his head is going like this the better
it's<00:01:03.719> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.899> be<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.439> when<00:01:04.710> he's<00:01:04.830> no<00:01:05.339> matter

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's going to be now when he's no matter

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's going to be now when he's no matter
how<00:01:05.729> heavy<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.299> once<00:01:06.689> his<00:01:06.960> his<00:01:07.350> balance<00:01:08.010> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
how heavy is once his his balance is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
how heavy is once his his balance is
broken<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.000> particularly<00:01:09.299> his

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
broken like this and particularly his

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.870 
broken like this and particularly his
posture<00:01:09.990> it's<00:01:10.260> easy<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.770> sit<00:01:11.040> him<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> his<00:01:11.610> butt

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
posture it's easy to sit him on his butt

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.000 
posture it's easy to sit him on his butt
again<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.960> want<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> sit<00:01:13.380> him<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.560> his<00:01:13.710> butt<00:01:13.950> so

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
again you want to sit him on his butt so

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.649 
again you want to sit him on his butt so
that<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.400> harder<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> move<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.540> want

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that it's harder in the move don't want

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:16.999 
that it's harder in the move don't want
to<00:01:15.720> be<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> his<00:01:16.020> knees<00:01:16.049> or<00:01:16.380> anything<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.799> it's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to be on his knees or anything and it's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.800 
to be on his knees or anything and it's
certainly<00:01:17.310> possible<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.090> choke<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> guy<00:01:18.600> down

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
certainly possible to choke a guy down

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.840 
certainly possible to choke a guy down
here<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.680> not<00:01:19.860> considered<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.280> technical

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
here this is not considered a technical

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539 
here this is not considered a technical
choke<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.210> takes<00:01:21.390> more<00:01:21.540> force<00:01:22.100> it<00:01:23.100> may<00:01:23.310> take<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
choke it takes more force it may take a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.800 
choke it takes more force it may take a
little<00:01:23.670> longer<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.180> actually<00:01:24.299> make<00:01:24.600> him<00:01:24.689> go

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
little longer to actually make him go

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.870 
little longer to actually make him go
unconscious<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.740> faster<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.250> slap<00:01:26.580> on

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
unconscious but it's faster to slap on

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.609 
unconscious but it's faster to slap on
and<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.630> stay<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> standing<00:01:28.590> position

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and I can stay in the standing position

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
and I can stay in the standing position
so<00:01:29.460> let's<00:01:29.520> take<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> look<00:01:30.030> at<00:01:30.180> all<00:01:30.450> I'm<00:01:30.600> doing<00:01:30.900> is

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so let's take a look at all I'm doing is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.859 
so let's take a look at all I'm doing is
making<00:01:31.200> sure<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.799> my<00:01:32.310> thumb<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.150> under<00:01:33.720> his

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
making sure that my thumb is under his

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.630 
making sure that my thumb is under his
chin<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.530> mean<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.920> obvious<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
chin I mean this is obvious but in the

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
have to make a transition to ground work

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.360 
have to make a transition to ground work
and<00:02:12.090> that's<00:02:12.570> gonna<00:02:12.750> be<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.990> topic<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.620> a

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
and that's gonna be the topic of a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.890 
and that's gonna be the topic of a
different<00:02:14.640> series<00:02:14.940> because<00:02:15.120> groundwork<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
different series because groundwork is a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
different series because groundwork is a
it's<00:02:16.590> a<00:02:16.680> complicated<00:02:17.250> thing<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:17.970> basically

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it's a complicated thing but basically

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.170 
it's a complicated thing but basically
from<00:02:18.780> here<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.650> see<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:20.160> you<00:02:20.490> know<00:02:20.910> in

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
from here you can see and you know in

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.320 
from here you can see and you know in
judo<00:02:22.140> old<00:02:22.410> style<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:23.220> would<00:02:23.610> practice<00:02:23.820> at<00:02:24.240> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
judo old style we would practice at the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.490 
judo old style we would practice at the
position<00:02:24.780> from<00:02:25.020> here

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
position from here

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.530 
position from here
you<00:02:26.070> know<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.280> see<00:02:26.550> it's<00:02:26.700> pretty<00:02:26.880> easy<00:02:27.000> to

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
you know you see it's pretty easy to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.560 
you know you see it's pretty easy to
make<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:28.550> transition<00:02:29.550> into<00:02:29.970> grow<00:02:30.150> and<00:02:30.330> work<00:02:30.420> I

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
make a transition into grow and work I

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.840 
make a transition into grow and work I
put<00:02:30.750> one<00:02:30.990> hook<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.740> would<00:02:32.160> fall<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.610> side

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
put one hook in I would fall to the side

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.610 
put one hook in I would fall to the side
and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.570> I<00:02:33.660> would<00:02:33.780> put<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.020> other<00:02:34.140> hook<00:02:34.410> it

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
and then I would put the other hook it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.620 
and then I would put the other hook it
in<00:02:34.680> okay<00:02:34.980> that's<00:02:35.550> how<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.850> can<00:02:36.060> better

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
in okay that's how you can better

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.870 
in okay that's how you can better
control<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> guy<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.130> want<00:02:38.400> even<00:02:38.670> start

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
control the guy if you want even start

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.040 
control the guy if you want even start
from<00:02:39.030> here<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.420> usually<00:02:39.750> how<00:02:39.870> these

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
from here this is usually how these

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.560 
from here this is usually how these
shows<00:02:40.380> are<00:02:40.590> talking<00:02:41.040> now<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.000> difference<00:02:42.420> is

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
shows are talking now the difference is

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.540 
shows are talking now the difference is
between<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.110> technical<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.310> street

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
between the technical and the street

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.630 
between the technical and the street
show<00:02:44.790> is<00:02:45.300> if<00:02:45.540> I<00:02:45.660> want<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.680> use<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> figure<00:02:47.250> four

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
show is if I want to use a figure four

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.240 
show is if I want to use a figure four
usually<00:02:48.060> called<00:02:48.240> a<00:02:48.330> lie<00:02:48.480> until<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.620> in

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
usually called a lie until in in

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.800 
usually called a lie until in in
Brazilian<00:02:50.640> jiu-jitsu<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.030> need<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.510> down

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
Brazilian jiu-jitsu I need to get down

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.949 
Brazilian jiu-jitsu I need to get down
farther<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.730> reduces<00:02:54.239> a<00:02:54.510> little<00:02:54.750> bit<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
farther so this reduces a little bit of

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.949 
farther so this reduces a little bit of
my<00:02:55.110> mobility<00:02:55.880> from<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.239> looser<00:02:57.690> wider

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
my mobility from this looser wider

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.410 
my mobility from this looser wider
children<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.590> can<00:02:59.010> stay<00:02:59.340> up<00:02:59.489> more<00:02:59.730> upright<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
children I can stay up more upright and

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.410 
children I can stay up more upright and
I<00:03:00.480> still<00:03:00.660> get<00:03:00.780> a<00:03:00.870> power
