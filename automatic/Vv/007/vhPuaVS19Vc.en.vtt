on<00:00:03.510> I'm<00:00:03.899> pulled<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.319> rest<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.589> these<00:00:04.710> coils

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
on I'm pulled the rest of these coils

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.220 
on I'm pulled the rest of these coils
off<00:00:05.279> we're<00:00:05.549> gonna<00:00:05.640> get<00:00:05.790> this<00:00:05.940> ls1<00:00:06.569> firing<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
off we're gonna get this ls1 firing the

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.589 
off we're gonna get this ls1 firing the
way<00:00:07.379> it<00:00:07.529> did<00:00:07.770> right<00:00:08.189> from<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> factory<00:00:08.820> we<00:00:09.450> got

said what I was doing so I found these

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.569 
said what I was doing so I found these
factory<00:00:51.899> wires<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.039> inducted<00:00:53.460> let

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
factory wires and this is inducted let

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
factory wires and this is inducted let
me<00:00:53.670> show<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.879> why<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.449> wires<00:00:54.600> will<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
me show you why a lot of wires will just

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.660 
me show you why a lot of wires will just
be<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.590> piece<00:00:55.770> right<00:00:56.039> yeah<00:00:56.399> well

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
be one little piece right yeah well

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.189 
be one little piece right yeah well
these<00:00:56.789> things<00:00:57.000> are<00:00:57.180> custom<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.629> insulation

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
these things are custom the insulation

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.290 
these things are custom the insulation
on<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> original<00:00:59.520> insulation

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
on this is the original insulation

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.150 
on this is the original insulation
inside<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.530> more<00:01:01.710> insulation

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
inside that was some more insulation

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
inside that was some more insulation
yeah<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.030> but<00:01:03.059> check<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> right

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
yeah all right but check out this right

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.200 
yeah all right but check out this right
so<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.530> sitting<00:01:04.769> here<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.070> wire<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.939> see

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so you sitting here on this wire you see

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.060 
so you sitting here on this wire you see
this<00:01:06.360> inductive<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:06.900> just<00:01:07.049> rode<00:01:07.320> wire<00:01:08.210> yeah

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
this inductive it's just rode wire yeah

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
this inductive it's just rode wire yeah
it's<00:01:11.070> like<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.189> cartoon<00:01:11.700> no<00:01:11.939> sweater<00:01:12.390> what

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it's like a cartoon no sweater what

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:20.270 
it's like a cartoon no sweater what
should<00:01:13.049> disappear<00:01:14.900> cool<00:01:18.619> that<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> little

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
should disappear cool that was a little

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.480 
should disappear cool that was a little
spark<00:01:20.549> plug<00:01:20.790> wire<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.840> long<00:01:22.490> blow

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
spark plug wire was a really long blow

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
spark plug wire was a really long blow
right<00:01:24.240> cool<00:01:24.869> we<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.140> spark<00:01:25.470> plugs<00:01:25.710> too<00:01:25.979> now

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
right cool we got spark plugs too now

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.569 
right cool we got spark plugs too now
these<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:26.909> AC<00:01:27.150> Delco<00:01:27.659> same<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.500> holy<00:01:28.979> SPECT

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
these are AC Delco same thing holy SPECT

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.060 
these are AC Delco same thing holy SPECT
out<00:01:29.759> plug<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.630> got<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> copper<00:01:31.140> core<00:01:31.470> we're

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
out plug it's got a copper core we're

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
out plug it's got a copper core we're
making<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> lot<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> performance<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.810> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
making a lot of performance a lot of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.300 
making a lot of performance a lot of
heat<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.380> copper<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.799> gonna<00:01:34.950> wick<00:01:35.159> the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
heat so that copper is gonna wick the

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.800 
heat so that copper is gonna wick the
heat<00:01:35.520> out<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.820> play<00:01:36.000> it's<00:01:36.509> got<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
heat out of the play it's got the

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.539
