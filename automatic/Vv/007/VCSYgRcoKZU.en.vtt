00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.469
 we arrived at number five and 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.650
 I had already announced this time 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:14.320
 it goes with the plum around the corner and 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.240
 Although the Ford Fiesta St already had 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.380
 mentions her ford fiesta st has im 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.150
 last year everything went flat 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.320
 made what was there and you see 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.090
 from the outside actually not at all 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.880
 he has a small counterfeit here 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:29.019
 third counter behind small diffuser 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:34.690
 and the five spoke rims in the design 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.830
 the it and lee were all is 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.129
 but of course under the hood 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.129
 hidden 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.960
 you see a slightly different picture 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.989
 Actually, I'm sitting on this side 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.350
 but in fiesta this is me happy 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.850
 have become totally why why a bit 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.559
 I also have to deal with the car 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.600
 me personally all the time 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.220
 I'm glad I'm something 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.850
 I have to say that biased 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.289
 I am the last driver but that has 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 also his good reason for this 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:17.580
 Dare makes a lot of fun 182 hp 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:20.850
 from 1.6 liters displacement with the proven 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.229
 eco boost turbocharger means one hand 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.729
 we have a lot of power though 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.229
 on the other hand, we have in the ordinary 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.560
 operation also relatively few consumers 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.500
 they are on average if it is 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.170
 not to overdo me just 6.3 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.479
 liter 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.740
 and even if we then this 182 ps 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.850
 Extend time we are in the area of 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.209
 7 7 semiconductors and there is nothing to do 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.360
 say another in the test clearly 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:56.700
 to see more often so the comparison fiesta 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 normal and fiesta ste you want then 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.360
 Of course, seeing a big one is great 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 difference between that is very clear 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.599
 it is obvious 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.819
 Alone, somehow next to that 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.759
 Driving alone because the engine noise 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.709
 what you have me personally a lot 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.200
 made fun he growls really nice 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.580
 deep down 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.220
 with normal flags and clear one wants 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.220
 Gas then gets louder and still 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.110
 more fun you have to say as a 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.569
 bit helped so this 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.940
 usual readjusting about the 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.379
 Air vents from the interior we have so 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.640
 a bit the same problem as well 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.410
 at the corsa it's a bit 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.960
 needs work 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.590
 But we do not want any further words 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:41.560
 lose it because the drive clicks 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.840
 drive in the foreground to my 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.690
 view that I have a very good one 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.210
 crisp circuit otherwise he pulls 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.550
 quite well and has just 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:55.210
 this in my eyes very large 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.100
 positive point that he simply measured 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.200
 power consumed very little besides the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.330
 practical aspects as well as the 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.390
 spacious in the trunk we have 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:08.910
 also sportive aspects like ordinary 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.370
 seats of recaro the now assigned 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.110
 corsa not only on hard as racetracks 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.360
 but also for the 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.730
 long oblique but we have very good 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.600
 controls the cheeks and also 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.940
 shoulder up 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.580
 still a bit strong pad 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.650
 I find very well solved that is a 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.550
 nice football between comfort and 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.540
 Sports 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:34.690
 I feel that he is with me 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.130
 on the street feels completely different 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 somehow than the others you could 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.740
 Now my first much harder 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.959
 the street but that is not that 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.910
 correct word 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.890
 he is softer than the opel corsa too 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.590
 but you still feel each one 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.160
 ground shaft much more intense and takes 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.260
 every little rub was much more 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.030
 jump more about the ground waves than 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.380
 that you just notice the corsa okay 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.990
 that a bottoming does theirs 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.450
 hurts back then really jumps 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.620
 partly then over it naturally takes 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.690
 also a bit in speed out 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.230
 partly the difficult questions to 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.730
 final fifth episode 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:12.640
 actually, we also thought last 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.780
 belong with the window on it wants 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.170
 not quite the case we have 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.880
 on 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:22.919
 a jogger quasi an additional participant 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.180
 ie where would we put the 4star in 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.180
 where do I want him others or how 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:42.719
 so i would tell you about fabia and 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:45.740
 ibiza is simply a lot more agile 

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:50.460
 clearly sportive much more direct 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:53.729
 suddenly it just can not be that way 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.960
 he is not far back and then have 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:05:00.090
 we of course the range at 200 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.659
 ps is there is the question he can there 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.099
 really easy to keep up 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.349
 a typical one in any case 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.020
 I think the opel corsa are jokes 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:12.090
 difficult browser to do yes 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.189
 because he does not make it easy 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:18.419
 actually would have to say must Opel 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:21.060
 corsa before it remains but I think of 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:26.969
 I feel like the fiesta after 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.490
 front actually has basically no 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:31.580
 fitness for everyday use is race tracks 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.789
 tool fiesta is still has 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:40.740
 fitness for everyday use and also because he is so 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:42.539
 maybe a bit warmer throughout 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.259
 in the price performance 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.770
 fitness for everyday use and that is yes 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:52.840
 really the 1 we just put it 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.990
 times on the 1 but race track comes 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.910
 so far not to the big pc actually 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:00.610
 not so i think you could be like you 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.190
 say that with this in everyday life 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.930
 Have fun and sometimes if you can 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.970
 Occasionally would like to race 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.979
 but if they go daily to the 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.970
 go yourself and with what you can then 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:14.310
 has more fun then the opc front 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.050
 you just need a double garage 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.669
 exactly 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:20.110
 I had already announced fiesta 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.659
 will not be the last one we have 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.970
 another french france 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.699
 has already worked quite well 

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.930
 with the peugeot look is one 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.930
 other Frenchman wants to do so
