00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:04.390
 for those who start from looking towards these landslides here and today the 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.410
 little tica squad purpose of kung fu panda 2 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.400
 I would say that there is not much to say about this quota for everyone, not because 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.520
 I liked it because the simple truth I enjoyed it very well entertained me 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.740
 percent fortunately is cortita does not pass the love and a half 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.519
 percent and bridges is I think that 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.829
 a successor pool but you have to remember that neither the first part 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.300
 old thing 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.399
 n even other context data a little bit more this second part is a 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 impeccably made movie 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 it is well written has 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.190
 has some of those counted has some good morning 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.789
 Personally, I thank the protagonist that the opponents in 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:47.980
 Beijing is 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.089
 per cent the voice already provides it 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.040
 percent is not the same league character in the first part as well as 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.480
 the 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.200
 as happened in what happened yesterday part of those who decided to repeat as is 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.400
 the first film in kung fu panda 2 are not repeating p the first 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.510
 movie as is 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.710
 I insist that there is an evolution of the character is no longer jealous stupid no 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.370
 Is jealous 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.860
 for those in the first part but yes 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.899
 he learned things 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.239
 this bear po among his most evolved characters not only how much 

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:23.820
 they are physically skilled because I believe that the kun fu 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760
 yes no this one because it's 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.690
 a bear that without losing in this circus his essential qualities of the character what 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.410
 amazing a little smarter a little less fruit and I or paralysis and 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.640
 this the personal thing to me did not seem 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.720
 particularly funny the movie 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.200
 the apple team I insist the movie is more of the same 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.299
 but it's from a store history that works well enough effective 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 the characters are still very attractive the first level animation 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.890
 you'll also have to say that I think it's one of the movies visually 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.049
 most disadvantaged the accompaniment to them because if you have to criticize these 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.149
 gentlemen since then 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.039
 that will not only be done in Quito for the easy route 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.679
 of the fast schools of what has been that has worked very well 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:18.320
 box office in fact either for equality share 3 4 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.520
 i 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.850
 his ex although they said that it was already finished with the fourth movie now well the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.830
 duck summoned i madagascar another movie in order there would not be that 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.700
 criticize them 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.310
 the difference of pixar or other companies have gone by for the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.909
 patella lartigue hamas demanded to be 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.920
 overexploit its great successes 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.050
 but good in this case at least I think it is a sequel that is saved 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.050
 many senses i insist on this question of what 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.939
 visually that is a movie that has many jokes that 3d is very 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.209
 well designed go see please 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:52.949
 the living room 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.039
 of 3d 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.059
 yes yes with a ceiling the requirements of the arts in 3d is not 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.609
 because I want to keep on potentiating the 3d rooms of cinépolis we have already 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.889
 said many times are better than those of cemex 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.660
 p this way on May 3 also álvarez sports 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.420
 and I recommend it is a good option for the weekend 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.419
 I will surely have pianos 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.430
 five minutes later they must have seen it they will be forgotten
