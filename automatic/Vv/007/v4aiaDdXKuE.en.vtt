 ok, guys welcome to this new one 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.110
 tutorial after my long absence 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.199
 because of the exams I come back with a new one 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.370
 tutorial today we will learn how to make 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:51.460
 in five minutes 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:55.629
 a glass effect broken then first 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.540
 what we choose the image on which 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.729
 applying the effect I chose this 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.500
 water you see on the screen right away 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:05.800
 then we have to enter ours 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:09.009
 image of the glass broken then me 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.539
 you can very well look for them on the internet 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:17.440
 images or information 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:22.890
 of the video you can download some examples 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.890
 which I will insert then we go on insert 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.380
 we add a broken glass 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 ok option and as a casting method 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.870
 let's make a mask 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.430
 of cut therefore we click here 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.090
 select the wand tool 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.340
 magic 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 then select the level then the 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 broken glass 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.650
 select the part of the glass 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.110
 now shattered and then re-selected 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.110
 level mask and press football 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.060
 we deselect everything now we must 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:06.770
 give a more realistic effect then 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:10.880
 we will have to add another image that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:15.200
 as always you will find in the link with a 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.970
 link on video file information e 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.600
 inserts aluminum steel la 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.600
 risistemiamo 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.069
 affection we press ok and immediately afterwards how 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.069
 fusion method let's multiply 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:43.370
 and we put it in the lowest level ok it is 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.099
 dead put the texture and we have to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.549
 copy the same clipping mask 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.470
 in aluminum and aluminum aluminum level 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.230
 we hold down the keyboard key 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:58.970
 on holding down the mask is the 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:05.030
 we bring it under and here it is done on 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:08.870
 fusion options we do right click 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.030
 here we do among level squeezes 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.799
 first if we click we can 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.220
 edit 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:25.159
 we activate puff and relief effect is 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.760
 we put it with relief effect is like 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.080
 technique 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.230
 then I went should stay 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:38.330
 let's modify the depth let's put one 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:42.790
 dimensions 5 and two nations 5 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:46.190
 then we put an outline where 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.700
 by clicking here we have to 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.680
 select double double ring 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.040
 we are gay and we also select one 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.040
 textures 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:00.540
 in this case this now 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.060
 this is a hundred scale this is fine 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.440
 what remains for us to do is to 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:24.210
 increase the saturation a little 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.990
 brightness then click here and 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.990
 let's make 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.449
 hue and saturation also e 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:36.949
 we click on hue and saturation 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:41.930
 let's put saturation at 22 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.930
 and this we put it at 3 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.430
 and we bring it as a first level 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:53.270
 now to finish we disable a moment 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:58.070
 all levels and let 's take the launch 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.370
 magnetic and select the part of the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.370
 arm 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:08.450
 we try to make a great selection myself 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.310
 I try to do it as quickly as possible 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.310
 so don't expect it 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:24.120
 that I succeed immediately at the first blow but it is 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:26.370
 also to understand us ok we make a copy is the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.700
 we paste in a new level there 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.820
 let's start at the last level if 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:37.820
 we reactivate all the glasses and we have so 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:40.820
 an effect is realized in 5 minutes 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.820
 glass 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:50.670
 oh well with this video I greet you and there 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.670
 see you at the next tutorial
