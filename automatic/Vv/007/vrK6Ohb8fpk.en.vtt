00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.250
 1 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.540
 so hello so I'm going to you 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.010
 present today so the art of 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.230
 train I would say a holiday table 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.120
 so first thing of course to take 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.740
 in account it's gilles so is the place 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.619
 where you will receive your 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.869
 guests then here we at bristol us 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.220
 have a french created environment i 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.699
 would say with on a lot of 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.760
 lore 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.670
 so here I presented a table that 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.140
 is of course in line with the 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.199
 middle in which gÃ©monies we have 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.879
 so decided to use here plates 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.920
 so I have a presentation what you 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.129
 can also do at home with 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 thursday this decoration 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.640
 based on the gold color of course with a 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.229
 very beautiful silverware 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.510
 the same for the staff we touched 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:49.280
 may be porcelain or a 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.850
 Dishwasher others perhaps for 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.470
 great opportunities 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.879
 do not hesitate it's gilles sallafranque 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.239
 it's an opportunity to transfer to put it 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.220
 before the decoration I would say we can 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.720
 try to stay on two to three tones 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.909
 colors and if we decided to 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:08.870
 work so the side off of course the 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.360
 money side the money that goes of course 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.170
 marry very well with silverware side 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.330
 so to prove to you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.440
 and then of course the red side the side 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.630
 red that always makes you think a little 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.860
 little why not to Santa Claus 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.990
 it's unreal it's very beautiful colors 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.030
 additional costs find who attracted 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.540
 is also in the streets of Paris or 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.180
 anyway 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.710
 a fairly simple layout I would say 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.700
 in a first glance the goal is 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.230
 to have a decoration that satie who 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.320
 catches the eye but he does not see no 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.300
 over loaded we used 2 the 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.740
 Corsican woods it reminds us a little 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.119
 the warm side of the 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.640
 the ine the side a little bit but on 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.329
 end-of-year holidays the side raised on 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.600
 Christmas ball 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.250
 and then the side candlesticks the side I will go 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.659
 who will bring warmth to the table 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.909
 with lille but a little bit 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.500
 sifted to bring even more of the 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.750
 magic at this party we have elements 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.369
 which are very simple to disposition as 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.070
 we offer nature where our part and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.080
 that of the bark of wood a branch of 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.520
 fir tree maybe it is also 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.080
 a decoration on the fruit on the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.490
 vegetables a nice red apple maybe 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.170
 a little chandeliers and we'll have on 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.750
 the table with maybe an artichoke 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.610
 with a clementine a mandarin orange 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.920
 citrus sides that is still very 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 friendly so I'll go so 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.560
 dishes properly speaking so the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.370
 plates 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.290
 me what I always recommend 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.120
 it is to have maybe in a first 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.769
 time a white plate head 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.480
 white will always showcase the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.670
 preparation that you put in hours 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.110
 and hours manage after running 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.370
 in your kitchen when of course you 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.900
 know very well that he did not leave 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.209
 your guests wait without a small 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.769
 cup of champagne do not hesitate so to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.150
 go out if it's very nice cut you 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.660
 so have the cuts earlier is based 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.790
 is flat 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 so you have like here flutes 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.359
 so for me the champagne flute 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.739
 it's really the essential element of 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:50.239
 end of business year celebrations may 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.160
 already the white wine glass to start 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:53.810
 and then you add the wine glass 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.579
 red just after everyone knows 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.859
 already at home so that the fork and 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.480
 soon left the knife right a 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.540
 plate not if you want it 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.850
 can of course be arranged a chore of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.819
 full middle so I laugh at 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.319
 table since have maybe a little 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.060
 when this one pepper mignonnette have 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.049
 maybe pepper of your choice then 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.319
 if the leaf or not but maybe to 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.019
 avoid at the level of training of the 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.129
 table is managed as I explained it 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.889
 just now is not to load 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.879
 very low decor inventory hole 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.500
 listen I think with all these 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:25.299
 advice i'm sure you 're going 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.980
 able to get there and that your evening 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.489
 will be memorable so I wish a 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.489
 excellent time
