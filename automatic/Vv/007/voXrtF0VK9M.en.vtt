two modes on this transmitter the modes

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.699 
two modes on this transmitter the modes
means<00:02:42.519> mode<00:02:42.879> one<00:02:43.120> standard<00:02:44.019> flight<00:02:44.319> very

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
means mode one standard flight very

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.309

you're<00:02:47.769> going<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.010> be<00:02:48.160> in<00:02:48.459> what<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.060> called

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
you're going to be in what they called

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.210 
you're going to be in what they called
extreme<00:02:49.690> mode<00:02:49.900> which<00:02:50.140> means<00:02:50.319> all<00:02:50.950> your

extreme mode which means all your

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.699 
extreme mode which means all your
motions<00:02:51.730> are<00:02:51.970> going<00:02:52.480> to<00:02:52.540> be<00:02:52.690> real<00:02:53.140> drastic

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
motions are going to be real drastic

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.559 
motions are going to be real drastic
it's<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.459> be<00:02:54.549> real<00:02:54.730> sensitive<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.390> that

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
it's going to be real sensitive and that

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.390 
it's going to be real sensitive and that

doing<00:03:04.569> flips<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:04.959> roll<00:03:05.170> now<00:03:05.739> let's<00:03:05.860> talk

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
doing flips and roll now let's talk

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.470 
doing flips and roll now let's talk
about<00:03:05.980> flight<00:03:06.340> characteristics<00:03:06.760> flight

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
about flight characteristics flight

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.119 
about flight characteristics flight
characteristics<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:08.379> really<00:03:08.680> liked<00:03:08.860> how<00:03:09.010> it

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
characteristics we really liked how it

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.539 
characteristics we really liked how it
flew<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.720> flies<00:03:10.900> real<00:03:11.140> good<00:03:11.410> with<00:03:11.769> a<00:03:11.799> 2.4<00:03:12.400> gig

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549
